Easy to assemble. Works as advertised. Installed two units under the eaves of our south facing balcony. On the hottest days it has cooled by about 10 degrees. When we build a pergola later in the year we will move it to the edge of the deck where I'm sure it will be even more beneficial during the hottest times of the day. The plants on the deck really appreciate the mister too. Great kit for the money.  A note on assembly. Make sure to really push the tubing in as deep as possible to the brass fittings. Our first try we had leaks at every joining, but that was because my female hands weren't as strong as my husbands. He had more success at a tight seal. We also purchased the filter.	1
definately cools u down	1
i have bought dozens of this products, last one i got got all sort of missing pieces.(was supposed to be new) sometimes it misses something small so i never reported, last time was just too much to let it go away. sadly returning this items is hard as i consolidate this in the border (texas) and move it from there to my current location. just make sure you check your items before doing anything.  4 brass coupling were missing and all the misting heads were also missing,  got a very expensive set of hoses.	-1
UPDATED: 8/2015  The biggest problem with this mist system is that the tubes break very often. I have a 20' long line installed and, every year at least 3 tube break near the metal nozzles. And, to make it worse, removing the snipped tube remaining from the nozzle metal and restoring a new tube is extremely hard. The fact that it is installed at a high elevation (mine is at 10-12' from ground) makes it even worse.  After struggling for 5 years after initial installation, I gave up and am going to scrap the installed line. I will try installing a PVC version instead next year.  ==INITIAL REVIEW== I installed a 30-ft misting system with a booster pump on our backyard patio arbor. It worked perfectly.  But after 3 years since the installation, 2 tubes broke and 3 nozzles out of 15 stopped working for clogging. I had more or less anticipated these so that I was not surprised. I bought this kit for parts replacement (more economical than buying individual parts one by one).  The tube breakage was unrepairable (I tried hot glue and taping but it very soon broke again). So, I simply replaced the tubes.  As to the clogged nozzles, I tried soaking them in kitchen vinegar for one hour until the rusted brass turned copper-red. Voila! They restored the original performance!  I was using a calcium filter and residual water drainage, but clogging does occur. Try this simple restoration.  Hint: I would recommend cleaning all nozzles at once. If you do only clogged ones, you'll find another after reinstalling the cleaned ones. This "scheduled maintenance" approach will eventually save your time. Don't forget to clean and flush the nozzles with fresh water after removing from vinegar.	-1
Following printed instructions to call Orbit if the any of the pieces were missing from the parts bag, I explained to the customer service dude that I lacked the brass coupling that attaches the feed line to the misting line. He informed me that it wasn't there because I didn't  need it. After going back and forth with him a few times ("why is it on the parts list if I don't need it?" etc), I realized I was getting nowhere with this jacknut, and hung up. True, I didn't need that brass coupling as long as I was content to sacrifice 2 feet of mist line and 1 out of the 5 mist nozzles as a workaround.  I should have sent it back right then and there, but I needed a mister to alleviate the suffering of a sick horse, so I went ahead and installed what remained of the kit in her shed. After messing with it for an hour, the result was that the end plug and 2 of the nozzles leaked like mad, while the remaining two nozzles merely spurted large, unpleasant droplets. Again following instructions for leakage troubleshooting, I attempted to remove the tubing from the brass nozzles to check the o rings. Sadly, no instructions for tubing removal were supplied, and I was unable to figure out how to accomplish the task without damaging the nozzle fittings. Eventually the end plug -- ill-fitting from the git-go -- blew off the line when I turned up the hose in an attempt to get a finer mist. I never found that dadgum plug. A total waste of time and money, and I'm back to hand-misting my poor horse until a professional installer gets here with actual functioning equipment.	-1
Very happy with this shovel.  Keep in mind that it does not have edges, so it doesn't work the best for powdery snow.  For that heavy wet stuff, though, this is the shovel I use.  Durable and makes the job quick and easy.  It's been put to the test a lot this winter!  I'm only 5 1/2" tall & find this to be easy to use - not awkward, like some I've tried.  Pricey, but metal vs. plastic usually is - hopefully it will last long enough to pay for itself :-)	1
Only used it once this year, which is typical in the Carolinas, but I am happy with the quality - the weight of the metal, sturdiness of both the handle and the blade, the shoveling edge is reinforced, and although not painted or coated, I sprayed it with a vegetable oil and had no sticking problems.  For $20, I felt this was a deal as many of the plastic, wimpy shovels in the various big box stores are this price and more.	1
I got this and put it together per the instructions, I'm a pretty handy guy so I thought it would work well. WRONG, it leaks like a sieve from every joint. I had to take the whole thing down; I had put it up because I'm a trusting person and silly enough to believe that a new product right out of the box should work. I took it all down but that was easy because the low number of chintzy clips they send aren't very long. I have put Gorilla Glue on all of the joints because that's a product that I can rely on. That should hold but it's too bad that an expensive item like this with about five bucks worth of parts that they sell for $33 should work. One of the small screw-in misters was missing so I sent them an email, that was never anwered. I guess I'll plug that hole with more Gorilla Glue. Caveat Emptor	-1
I purchased this shovel based on blade size and handle length.  It has seen us through several snow falls now and I recommend this shovel to anyone who has a long driveway to clear.  My husband is a foot taller than me and we both USS with ease.  It certainly meets all the claims the company makes about the product.	1
very heavy duty!	1
received as advertised very satisfied	1
Hard to find part. Very reasonable.	1
Nice but the design takes a little getting use to moving snow with it.	1
works well	1
Not worth the . Breakable easy	-1
Great product at a great price. Very happy customer!!	1
great	1
Looks nice and sturdy. Wish I had this when the big snow storm hit this year!	1
To be fair, I have pretty hard water.  But this thing has gone bad only 5 months after installing it.  It went in fine, seemed to work great... until it didn't.  Thinking a seal has failed, as it shoots a constant stream of water (not the typical 'whoosh' of a PVB valve).  I had a metal PVB, but the thing never would hold a solid connection to the PVC pipe (metal to plastic, after all).  But at least the whole valve didn't blow out.  Avoid this valve, it's junk.	-1
One snow storm so far this year, thankfully! Shovel worked very well on 8 to 12 inches of fairly wet and heavy snow. Handle is configured so I could push snow on my concrete drive into a nice pile then shift hands and shovel it away. Scoop is quite large so wet snow can make the shovel heavy- be wise. Nice edge, got right down to base of snow and scraped concrete clean with little effort. Maybe it won't snow here again until next year, I expect shovel will work just a s well then.	1
Nice snow shovel, it works well, but I don't know how it will hold up, hence the 4 stars.	1
Didn't buy on Amazon but it is the same Manufacture and product number I bought elsewhere locally. It should NOT be called a shovel what-so-ever. After about 2 hrs of use in light/medium weight snow, the plastic cracked where the handle is inserted into shovel. Had to finish the job taking less than full scoops and plastic continued to crack (hey what can you do, must finish the job right?). It's now completely useless to pick up any snow, even light powder.	-1
I have not had a chance to use it yet, therefore its ability to keep the driveway clear of snow is working perfectly	1
Product as advertised and swift delivery. Would recommend to anyone and do business again.	1
As advertised	1
These type shovels are hard to find in our area, so it's good to have a source.  I have the aluminum version of this shovel but the metal wear strip separates  and comes off.  I'll see if the one piece steel will be better, although it is heavier.	1
this is not a shovel but a snow pusher.  I have used mine several times now in Salt Lake City, it is just another tool I use to remove snow.  It works well and glad I got it.	1
Seems sturdy enough to help you dig your car out in an emerency (that's what I got it for).  Stows well since it folds small.	1
I hope it never snows so much that I have to use the SnoBoss, but if it does, my husband will love me for getting this!	1
huge good construction lets see how long it lasts	1
If you have to use a snow shovel, this is the one to get.	1
Its simply too big (in this case, that is not a good thing). It just about broke my back to pick snow up in it. When I bought this, I thought I would never have to lift it. I though it would be easy to just push it and tilt up to dump the snow, but the biggest problem there is that if you are shoveling snow off your sidewalks - then odds are you live in a climate that causes your driveway and sidewalks to heave and crack, therefore it is impossible to just push and dump. Much easier to just go with a smaller shovel and if you are looking for something easier than that then the only logical choice is a snow blower. This is a very durable, well made product for what its worth though.	-1
I absolutely love this shovel. I use it for leaves and garden waste. It does not snow here in Florida but if I does, I am ready!	1
Great product!	1
This Shovel is the best I seen out there lately.  I like metal snow shovels and most DIY stores only carry plastic versions. True snow might stick on this one but with a little spray and 15min in the colder air before using and all should be okay.	1
This baby works great.	1
This is too heavy to handle.  I am an average woman and It is too cumbersome.  Even if I got it under the ice so that I could jar it away from the pavement it is still too heavy to push that and the ice.  I would NEVER try to lift snow and the shovel!  Well made product but virtually useless to me.	-1
Good shovel for the price. Handel wobbels where it meets the shovel. Redesign  it, or send a free sample of gorilla glue with each order. I fixed mine that way.	1
This thing is awesome! i move a ton of snow at one time.	1
Great	1
Seems well made - I have not used it much but will update next year when I have more experience.	1
I looked everywhere for a watering wand that had a turning lever to operate on and off.  Not only that, it was made of brass, which lasts many more seasons.  I have arthritis in my hands and I cannot turn plastic screws, etc.  This ones works wonderful and is easy on the hands.	1
Very sturdy good quality.  I did have to drill a hole in the wood handle to screw the blade on.  The one wood screw is provided with the shovel.	1
good old steel shovel is way better that a plastic one with a riveted metal strip.	1
My snow was gone by the time these arrived (poor planning on my part!), but these seem quite solid and should be great for next winter!	1
This shovel was my answer to clearing snow this winter. Pushing it along and then shoving the snow off to the side is much better than trying to pick up big heavy snow shovelfuls, that most women can't do easily. It's easy on the back and actually fun to use.	1
My last shovel cracked and I bought this as a replacement. We haven't had any snow since it arrived but it's well made and was recommended by TheSweetHome. Note that I bought this and the Backsaver Grip https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000DEN57S/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_7	1
Very cheaply made. Don't waste your money.	-1
I bought this some time ago, but didn't use it right away.  I probably got a month of use out of it last summer, then stored it inside in a tub on top of hoses over winter.  I used it once this year and it was fine, by the second use it sheered apart where the handle attaches to the brass part.  It appears the metal just sheered off from the water pressure and is paper thin there, even tho it is metal.  Overall, maybe got 2 months of use from it.  I liked the thing when it worked, but very disappointed at how fast it broke under very little exposure/stress.	-1
Very nice sprayer.	1
I have had one of these for years and loved it. As with others, it eventually broke at the base of the handle.  Easy fix: don't hold it by the handle.. hold it by the hose. The aluminum pipe is not very thick so if you start dragging around 25 feet of full hose, it is bound to break.  I love all the settings and the gasket at the spray head was just barely starting to leak after 3-4 years (and it had a bad habit of being left in the mud).	1
Wroking real good.	1
Well I laughed when I had to buy a snow shovel off the internet. So we get 8" of snow and I get a chance to use this very ergonomic shovel. This made snow shovelling so much easier, it is solid, and well built.  I highly recommend it !	1
Winter is coming full-force in Upstate NY and I was happy to find such a great, sturdy and ergonomic shovel on Amazon.  This shovel is strong and easy to use.  The handle is wide enough to accommodate a thick ragg wool glove with ease.  The wear strip is a nice extra when shoveling ice and hitting blacktop or concrete.  I have a much cheaper shovel and don't trust it half as much as this one.  The ergo design does help your back when lifting and pushing.  If you need a shovel and are thinking about it, buy this one -- it's great for fluffy and slushy snow.  The capacity is pretty large -- so be mindful of your back.	1
works so great.  dial for different sprays works easily.  no leakage.  easy to handle and use.	1
This is a very heavy built snow shovel. The handle is ergonomically built to save the back and the handle has enough room to wear a thick glove and still be able to use it. High quality product.	1
Good quality snow shovel at a decent price. I am happy with this purchase.	1
Although using this mostly for my plants - the versatility is great for a small yard/patio.  It is easy for my hands to hold - a real plus for me.	1
Exactly what I wanted.	1
Excellent quality and value.  I don't need to worry about this one breaking.  The mist setting really is a very fine mist.  This spray wand is replacing a plastic one that broke from being dropped on the deck too many times.  It is just the right size.  I appreciate the fact that a good quality ball valve is included.	1
Just what we were looking for	1
Cleans the right down to the walk and driveway. Light to use.	1
I like all the settings. Good item for the price.	1
This is the best sprayer I have ever had.  Then I dropped it in the lake.  Now I am buying another!	1
Works great. The amusing thing is that it has a brass valve that costs more by itself than this whole thing did.	1
This and the unit does not work. i got one summer out of the mosquito vac. Very expensive disappointment.	-1
I bought this by accident, intending to buy a True Temper shovel with a metal wear edge.  The nylon wear edge has a curve to it, which does not allow it to lay flat on the sidewalk or driveway.  This limits the usability of this shovel, since the handle design is intended to enhance the ability to use said shovel laying flat on the surface to be cleaned.  Give this shovel a big skip, and get a shovel with a metal wear edge. (I did so, and that shovel gets a very different review.)	-1
Needed a snow shovel and decided on this one after reading reviews of this and others.  However, it seldom snows here, so I have not used it yet, but it appears well enough made.  I have tried to figure out the logic behind the grip that they seem to be so proud of, but I can't see any benefit over a regular straight grip, as this one ends up in the same location for gripping anyway after going through a couple of, in my opinion, unnecessary bends before getting there.	1
MUST HAVE for your car--suv--porch! You can sit there and look stupid or you can break out this folding sturdy heavy duty shovel and get yourself free!	1
I really like the way the Suncast handle is bent.  Maybe its just me, but it fits my 5' 11" size well.  shovel is the right size. I use this as much for moving wood chips as for snow.  better than a pitch fork.	1
Broke apart at the valve. Cheap cast parts, plastic, etc.	-1
really like it	1
Nice for watering in the garden since it can pump out lotsa water for big tubs and not mess up the surfaces of bonsai trees when you dial down the water flow.  Nice wand & cheap price.	1
This spray wand works very well on all settings. It also comes with a shutoff valve attached so that it can replace whatever nozzle you are using now. The extra length wand also makes it easier to water hanging plants.	1
I could not wait to get a decent shovel that would not break my back. The first time I used it, I knew I made a good purchase. It worked great and didn't give me back pains, I am just so happy to have a decent shovel that is not 40 plus years old and worn out. When I used it some of the snow had begun to melt but it required very little effort to utilize. The shovel is well made and should last me a very long time.	1
This snow shovel is amazing.  It did a fantastic job with 3 feet of snow.  It is very strong and sturdy, and it seems like it will last for many years to come.	1
Skeeter Vac works with killing mosquitos	1
IT LURES BUGS..... BUT IS PRICEY!!!!	1
For an inexpensive nozzle, I initially was pleased. It seemed like a solid 4* product. The things that recommended it was a large array of sprinkling patterns and the longer slightly curved wand that was really practical when watering hanging baskets. Oh, I also liked the on/off switch. After two months I am not so much in 'like'. The spray adjustment isn't working right and the on/off switch broke within the first month. Sorry to say that I can't recommend this and because I did not save the sales receipt I can't return it.	-1
We have had the yellow/black version of this shovel for over 10 years and LOVE IT.  This is a beast of a shovel, the shovel is deep and very sturdy, never have had it bend, crack or anything.  Very easy to use as a pusher, the only issue is that it can pick up a lot and can be heavy. I would recommend this to anyone, we just bought another one, not from amazon and hoping to get at least another 10 years out of the second one.	1
Surprisingly arrived fully assembled, Looks well made, but won't be able to evaluate it's quality until it snows  which could be any second now!	1
Good quality, comfortable, light, and good price.	1
Worth the price. The shovel has not cracked or chipped so far. Indeed made from quality material. Looking forward to use this shovel in many more winter seasons. The curved handle makes it easy on your back when you have a heavy load to throw. The grip is nice too.	1
Its a shovel, happy enough lightweight but sturdy and like the metal edge.	1
If you use any type of a mosquito eliminator, these work great to get most of the insects.	1
nice product and price	1
awesome wand. Its well built and sturdy. it does not leak anywhere and ive kept it in the sun most days. If it ever fails i will not hesitate to buy another one.	1
Very lightweight and easy to use.  Handy on/off lever so I never have to keep running to the faucet to turn it off and on.	1
As the title says, it works like a champ! Every spray setting you can ever think of and a solid build quality at a reasonable price. You can't really ask for more.	1
I love the way you can turn off and on at the end of the handle.  Has alot of options for water flow to choose from.	1
Came quickly but then no more snow.  Though not yet used, it feels like it is going to do the job.	1
Return	-1
Great purchase	1
I got this during the blizzards of 2015 in Boston area.  All stores were sold out of snow shovels, so I had to order online.  This shovel is lightweight, and non-metallic at the end of the blade, so it is less likely to damage wood and other things you shovel off.  I wish the unit was longer, but its still workable as it is.	1
I didn't get this here on Amazon, but I have this exact model. I used it for hours on end after this east coast blizzard we just had, and I wouldn't have wanted to be without it. The handles are great, and give you a good grip to prevent shovel spin. The dedicated place to push with your foot, lets you push without fear of breaking something. The wide head lets you make a comfortable walking path in one pass, and it can carry a ton of snow. This is simply the best snow shovel I have ever used.	1
Lightweigth but needs a bigger metal strip.  Ergonomic deisgn is over-rated and hard to throw heavy snow	1
My neighbor has this. When I borrowed his and saw all the options I wanted one for my own hose. Very happy with the quality color, and versatility.	1
My wife really likes this spray wand, It is easy to turn on and off with the large brass lever and is well made.	1
This was a great deal and works really well.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone who want's a great deal at a great price!	1
The spray head is similar to what you'd find at a big box store (same patterns and I think made by the same manufacturer) however the arm is a nice feature and the brass shutoff valve is quality.	1
....no complaints here to complain about & do recommend to anyone... ;)	1
They seem to work.  I use it with my SkeeterVac , and after it was worn out the machine doesn't seem to capture as many insects.  Hence, the need for me to order a replacement.	1
SkeeterVac is the machine that works!  I've owned 6 models of Mosquito Magnets, including the $1000.00 model, and they all stop working after a year.  These keep going, and do an incredible job!  Just keep it stored in your garage in the winter.	1
I purchased this as thank you gift for wonderful neighbor doing fantastic job clearing my snow each winter.  HE loves it and especially the metal strip on the edge.	1
Compared to other wands I've purchased the first thing I noticed was how well it was built.  The water control valve, made of metal not plastic, helps you control the flow of water so you're not pounding flowers in planters like a heavy downpour of rain would.  Very pleased	1
Keep it fresh.  I think these are a little pricy but they work.  I tried a substitute and found it to not be as effective and we were getting bit.  I use this lure and OCTENOL3 for the one two combination which allows us to enjoy our back yard again.  In fact my neighbour loves this system so much that he has offered to pay for the propane because it does both our yards so well.	1
Odered and received a couple days.  Will come in handy with all the rain we have had this spring!!!  Highly reccommend	1
This shovel works really well for removing snow down to the surface (steps, deck, sidewalk).  I used it as a supplement to my snowblower.  The scoop bent a bit when I tried to pick up a shovelful that was packed down by a plow.  I'd give this five stars for the handle and metal strip, but a bit less than that for the somewhat flimsy feel when I tried to actually dig into a snow pile	1
Ordered this shovel ahead of the big 2016 Washington DC snow storm that we are right in the middle of (literally, as I write this!).  Husband has been scooting up and down the driveway and sidewalks, intermittently for the past 8+ hours with this shovel.  Clearing huge areas of snow with much less effort than our traditional snow shovels.  While shoveling, he even remarked that it was "pleasant" outside....although we are having a blizzard!  He likes the large area,he can clear in one pass and is digging the back saving feature of not having to stretch at a weird angle to flip the shovelful.  Four stars because he feels the metal strip will not last long.	1
The ball valve on mine leaks a couple of drops per minute all the time. No way I can See to fix it.  The metal lever is also a bad design for me. It is sticking out when the water is turned off, so it tends to accidentally get turned on especially when you put the wand down on the ground when you are done watering.  Switching back to a trigger style valve.	-1
I bought one locally and it broke the same day. Then I ordered this after reading the reviews. Thank you all for taking time to review your items as this helps me decide what to buy. This one has been used a few weeks and is made so much better than the stores here.	1
Better than the grain shovel I have used for many years.	1
It's easy on the back and my son loves using it	1
Was well packaged  what I expected hope I don't have to use	1
If you ever have snow GET THIS SHOVEL NOW!  You can also put a "Backsaver Grip Handle" on it and it works even better!	1
Use this to water a bunch of flowers in pots on a 5 ft wall and hanging baskets overhead. Works great to flood or shower water all of them.  Jet stream works well to clean up.	1
I got 4 months use from this wand, then it fell apart into 3 pieces. Not satisfied and cannot recommend it.	-1
The skeeters just love this stuff. Last year I ordered something that was supposed to be for the Sketer Vac, but it was not. This is the real item.	1
Lent my SkeeterVac to a friend for an outdoor wedding and bought the Lure for them to use.  They said it worked great and caught a lot of mosquitos.  The product is good but I don't use it much anymore due to the cost of materials.  Between propane Lures, and TacTrap, it gets a bit pricey for everyday use.  Good for special occasions.	1
The fuel pump arrived much faster than anticipated. It was difficult to find the right one, but this is it. It was installed in no time. Would buy again if the need arose.	1
Most people buy a similar multi nozzle spray nozzle in the form of a spray gun. I also did the same and found they all went bad within a year. I bought this multi spray nozzle and have been using it for 3 years with no problems. Near as I can tell the difference is in the brass/rubber on/off control. It's going strong. The extended handle is also an added plus.	1
We like this much more than the nozzle sprayers that we constantly go through.  Hopeful with the metal switches that it will last much longer.	1
works great ...love the brass on off switch....well made and sturdy. would definitely buy another. Nice to not to have to hassle with a cheaply made one to get decent flow.	1
Works really well, but is shorter then the ones you find in garden stores.  Seems to have a lot of quality built in.	1
I purchased a similar item two times at HD this year for about $10 each and they both failed after a short time.  This item by Orbit is built a lot better and I expect it to last.  My experience with Orbit products has been excellent over the years.  I use their sprinkler products in my in ground watering system and have been well satisfied.  Highly recommend both Orbit and Amazon.	1
I finally tired of cheap nozzles and decided to buy this wand.  What a fantastic tool.  The spray options are all well thought out and very useful.  The mist function actually mists!  It's metal, very rugged and has a nice brass ball valve as well. Going to buy another one for my girlfriend.	1
I bought these for my grandchildren in Colorado (adult aged).  One showed me a picture of how she used hers this morning (12/15/2015) which was to shovel a path through the snow so her two small dogs could walk with her (she called it "walk" we old timers know what it was. ;-)	1
This will sound odd but I purchased this for rake leaves!  I live in the Dallas Fort Worth area and the snow that we get is maybe once every 2 to 3 years, but I bought this to use with the Shake Rake attachment (sold by http://vmeglobal.com/) for an easier way to get up leaves and acorns.  Since I am not as young as I used to be and owning an ergonomic leaf rake that I have had for years and just love, I felt that the ergonomic qualities of this shovel would be good.  The handles are very nice and while it is very big, it is easy for me to handle.  Just waiting on the leaves to fall so I can give this a try!  I have never had a snow shovel before, I am only rating this a four since I have nothing to compare it to.  At the very least, I am ready for our next snowstorm!	1
Keep one in each vehicle for "just in case"	1
Purchasing and receiving this True Temper shovel prior to any snowfall, I have not had a chance to use this shovel.  However, I did borrow and use my neighbor's True Temper shovel last winter. That brutal winter, which was in 2014-2015, we were constantly shoveling our driveway and walkway.  This shovel allowed me to safely and effectively move copious amounts of snow without jeopardizing my back.  Storing my Amazon delivered shovel in the garage, I know I will easily manage this 2015-2016 winter snowfall.	1
This is probably the best multipurpose snow shovel out there!  The handle and curved shaft allow you to adjust position based on height of user and weight of snow...making it capable of being used by the entire family (take a hint, kids!).  The 18 inch surface allows you to clean a large path of snow, and keeps you from overloading the shovel if you're throwing snow.  It's useful as a pusher, although if you're looking for a purpose built pusher there are better designs out there.  The metal leading edge helps you get under the snow and cuts through the denser lower layers of built up snow.  I expect this shovel to last 2-3 seasons and it is my go to shovel for most situations.[...]	1
The effectiveness of the bait soon fades (In as little as a few days). I remove the bait and store it in a baggie when mosquitos are not present during the day (Where I live). I have also found that by cutting away the top section of the bait station and mixing the hard waxy product around a bit, the effectiveness is once again optimal for a few more days. Doing this is not recommended unless you are vigilant to ensure the product does not come in contact with skin, etc. If you just leave the bait in the unit I find you need 2-3 per each tank exchange for optimum effectiveness and it can get expensive (up to around 60 dollars every 20 days) just for fuel and the baits, excluding any other add-ons you may choose to purchase.	1
I use these in my SkeeterVac. My SkeeterVac does an excellent job at destroying the mosquito population & also tends to eliminate those pesky flies that always want to follow into the house. Highly recommend!	1
Use every year with the Skeeter Vac machine to catch mosquitoes. Easy to order and have delivered quickly. Units are cheap and easy to open and install. Lure is effective in drawing mosquitoes to trap for capture.	1
only used once since my other shovel broke after 30 inch snowstorm we had in the mid-atlantic this past winter. Much better on my bad back	1
This is the first wand I've used.  Having no other comparison, I am very pleased with this product. Easy shut-off valve near my hand, good balance, and several types of spray available on the dial. It seems very sturdy and has made watering delightful.	1
I like the brass lever as  opposed to some plastic trigger. it is well made and I feel will last a long time. Good choice of spray types. I really like Orbit products and their customer service is excellent. I have been purchasing Orbit products for years. I have called them in the past about a couple of different products that have either had defects or had broken after time and on each occasion, they could not do enough to help me. I will always buy Orbit.	1
I like this sprinkler for the fact that the shower is very gentle and doesn't smash my outdoor plants while I water, The mist is great too. The handle is soft to hold. I gave it 4 stars because it drips a little when its turned off. There is a bolt holding the on/off lever so I might be able to adjust that to stop it.  UPDATE: I give this 5 stars, the drip stopped, it sat outdoors for over a year with daily use  and still works perfectly.	1
I bought this after having foolishly purchased one from Home Depot.  The earlier purchase died after a few months of use.  This one has much better quality parts.  It is shorter than my previous 3 footer, but I don't miss the other one at all!  This one should last  a long time.	1
I bought this to use as a large pooper scooper since i own multiple dogs. So my review is based on the purpose that i bought it for at not for snow. So if you are going to use it for snow then please disregard my review. But if you are thinking about getting it for what I did, then read on. I had been using a regular shovel. I have since returned back to using the regular shovel. I didn't think about how wide this shovel was for when it came time to scoop the poop into a bag. While the width allowed me to scoop more, it also made it more difficult to put in the bag opening. The only reason i downgrade one star is because it didn't scoop as well as a regular shovel. The leading edge was intended for snow and not poop so this is probably why. Probably a great shovel for snow though.	1
very good real happy	1
Very small and weak.	-1
Bought this for my daughter and her husband.  They love the style and pretty easy to use because of the design.  It was a good choice!	1
I used to have straight handle snow shovels and I was always disappointed.  I broke a few cheaper ones in some deep snow.  Cheap plastic snapping because snow is too heavy and it's too cold and got brittle.  Or cheap handles that bent and snapped from the weight of the snow or just because they were too thin.  This shovel has them beat by miles.  Yes a little more pricey than a standard snow shovel, but you get what you pay for with this.  The bend in it makes it so you don't have to bend your back.  It gives you a lever point which makes picking up a full shovel full not as heavy.  The tip of the shovel has a strip of steel so you can chop into the snow and not worry about the plastic chipping and breaking.  Also means when you're done you can just thump it on the concrete twice (not slam it) and all the snow knocks off.  We've had days here in Colorado in Jan, Feb, March, and April where we had 15" of snow.  This shovel has made it through all of them with not a twinge of back pain for me.  Mind you it's May now and we still just got 3-4",  I foresee me and my shovel having a long lasting relationship.  The best snow shovel I've ever purchased!	1
Shoveling heavy snow is significantly easier with this shovel than with my previous straight-handled one. It's a lot easier on my back. It's not the widest, but for the price this is a great shovel.	1
Bought for nephew for Xmas. Barely had any snow this past winter.	1
Great price for the shovel! and fast shipping!  For the price, can't complain too much.  Haven't used it yet.....The shovel are light weight, looks good and sturdy. Very pleased with this purchased.	1
Light, well made and easy to handle and use!  The off-set handle shaft minimizes the possibility of back-strain, while shoveling in cold winter temperatures	1
I bought this due to some of the positive reviews on Amazon and some other sites.  It does go through the propane tank quickly, probably in about three weeks but am pleased I don't have to plug it into an electric outlet.  This summer we have practically zero mosquitos in our back yard.  So, you say, this must be working, right?  I hope so.  On the other hand, I have very few mosquitos caught in the basket of this contraption.  Thus, I am not sure if it is the machine that is working or simply the fact that we have less mosquitos this summer as compared to past years???	-1
All I know is that it uses up a lot of propane, and it doesn't seem to catch all that many mosquitoes.  It does catch them, but I'm not sure if it actually makes any difference.	-1
The ergonomically bent handle makes shovelling snow so much easier on the back. I heartily recommend.	1
haven't really had a chance to use this yet but it feels great...like it will take a lot of the stress out of the job on your back....	1
Too early for snow but moves piles of light branches and leaves left over from the fall.	1
Great product !	1
Excellent shovel and really helped during these past winter months!  Made shoveling that much easier! Very sturdy!	1
Did not have the opportunity to use this shovel because of unexpected but delightful end to the winter season but we'll see next winter.	1
This is great shovel that really scoops a lot of snow (and mulch too). It is well designed to help the back and should last a long time. The only draw backs are that wet snow sticks to it, and it is very easy to bend the outside corners of the aluminum blade if you hit something under the snow. The corners can be bent back into place with vice grips or a hammer but should have been reinforced when manufactured to keep this from happening. UPDATE: After several uses, the blade insert that guides the shovel thru snow fell out and cannot be reinstalled. How shovel will work without it is yet to be determined.	-1
Well made snow shovel. It's heavier than our old shovel but will last for years.	1
I let my kids use this.  I love that is folds up, less "kid clutter".	1
It's big and unwieldly so wouldn't recommend this.	-1
2 inches less wide than my first shovel but handle about same height or maybe an inch or 2 more. Only shoveled about 2 inches of slush last night but worked great. Nice grip. Feels sturdy.	1
good shovel and certainly much easier on the back than a regular snow shovel. The way the shovel is attached to the handle is a bit weak and not certain how long it will last, probably would be better of there were better fasteners used,	1
cool tool	1
More ergonomically correct than my last shovel. And since this one is metal I don't think my husband will break this one so easily.	1
Although this is a good quality shovel, it weighs way to much for me.  Maybe it's more for a hugh big guy to use.  Not a medium size women.  I really don't use it.	-1
Regret this purchase and bit the bullet to pay to ship back for refund. Heavy, clunky and awkward to lift snow up and out of the way. Would be okay I guess if you just plowed snow.	-1
Works good	1
I bought this not for snow but for scooping up leaves without having to bend my 82 year old back too much.  Haven't tried it on dry leaves yet since the rains refuse to stop falling in Oregon, but I found it is very efficient in scraping up wet leaves from cement and wood decking, much faster and easier than a patio broom.	1
Great quality!  Bought for our Valet Parking operation in New England.	1
exact replacement	1
As others have stated, well-built and sturdy as these shovels go.  Better than a yellow True Temper and blue Avalanche brand that I have.  I also like the sharper bends in this handle versus the more curved handles of the aforementioned alternatives.  I've had a bad back all my life and shovels like this make a huge difference for me in the winter.  Came in a huge cardboard box from Amazon, it was kind of comical.	1
Looks and feels well made. I simulated shoveling snow and it feels like it will be comfortable to use. Since it's been in the low to mid 60's here in OH, I don't know if I'll have to use it this year. Damn you El Nino!, I want some cold air to kill of the bugs!!!  Update: 6//10/2016...I would change my rating to 3.5 now. The edge of the shovel catches on the small imperfection on my driveway and causes you to stop suddenly. It gets annoying real fast. I stopped using this shovel and bought another that I love.	1
Great Ergonomically Correct Shovel.  I have been using one of these shovels for about five years and bought this for a spare.  Bought one for my daughter also.  Easy to use and saves on back strain.  Highly recommend.	1
Worked great	1
Exact replacement. Worked great.	1
Exactly what I was looking for as a replacement on my rebuilt 1978 Case Ingersoll garden tractor.	1
Easy to install.  If haven't installed before, check out youtube video.  I changed sparkplug fuel and air filter and had a strong battery but still hard to start sounding like not getting fuel.  INSTALLED NEW FUEL PUMP AND ONCE THERE WAS FUEL IN THE PUMP, IT STARTED JUST LIKE NEW MOWER. t worked for me and hope it might help you. sorry for CAPS above but just had shoulder surgery.	1
Easy on the back, great solid shovel, have moved tons already!	1
this shovel looks an feels nice haven't use it yet hope i don't have to but i am ready if an when we get snow	1
Save your back and buy this shovel now(the price is right).	1
OEM part	1
fixed my 20 year old JD	1
This is the best Snow Shovel in the world!!! I did multiple drive ways in the 2015 snow storm, and it's great for ice as well! very durable!! won't bend.	1
all metal, screws, solid shovel, use this thing year round...	1
Why can't all companies and products be this good?  This is a special purpose shovel.  I don't use it as much as my Rugg Backsaver.  I shovel a real lot of snow and when I need it, this shovel is indispensable.  It is unique, nobody makes anything else like it.  Pushing, scraping, and moving giant chunks of snow, it's unbeatable.  Ergo design lets you use both arms.  Not great for tossing snow but that's not what I have this one for.  See the photo.  When you get those big piles of packed snow, I chop a giant chunk of it loose with this thing.  Then I ram the blade underneath and pry the chunk off the ground and drag it to get rid of it.  I have moved hunks weighing at least 100 lbs, easily, like pushing a baby carriage.  Work that would have taken hours is done in a few minutes.  It is also great for lighter snow storms where you have a lot of area to clear.  I push it along and all the snow gets scraped up and accumulates in the scoop.  Then, when I get to the end of the driveway I can either lift and dump or just tilt it to unload if I have room for that.  After a year of abusing this thing, I wore the metal edge out.  I emailed Ames/TrueTemper.  They sent me 4 new edges ups, a day or two, no cost at all to me.  Couldn't be easier......John, Massachusetts	1
So, where I live, realistically I use this once or twice a year.  For a day.  All day.  Because there's nothing like an inch of ice under and three inches of snow.  I thought this shove did really well on the rock/cement drive we have.  I was a little worried the uneven nature of the drive my hinder this thing, but it was a great little bulldozer.  The handle design was good for not having to bend repeatedly with my out-of-shape butt.  It does feel a little flimsy, but it held up fine.  I've since used it for leave removal as well and it worked equally well for that.  Haven't tried anything like dirt or sand, but it's a good shovel, especially at that price.	1
Can't ask for more. Carry's a good size load of snow, nice and sturdy. If anything, it can hold too much snow, making us people of light build feel like a whimp.	1
I've had mine for a few winters now, and I've only had two minor issues with it:  1) the edge has worn down over time, since there is no metal guard like other models  2) depending on the type of snow, sometimes it sticks to the shovel, but I remedy that by spraying non-stick cooking spray on the shovel every now and then  Even though I have a few different types of shovels, I use this one the most.  I have a long driveway with a wide end, and two long sidewalks to keep clear; this shovel makes it easy to get the job done without destroying my back like a metal shovel.  Afterwards, I recommend a cup of&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Swiss-Miss-Holiday-Cocoa-5-Assorted-Flavors-4-Ounce-Boxes-Pack-of-2/dp/B001E4S7JC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Swiss Miss Holiday Cocoa, 5 Assorted Flavors, 4-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 2)</a>.	1
Yes, we finally had a huge (6") snowfall here in Shelbyville, Illinois, and I used this shovel for the first time.  It has an incredible edge that really picks up almost all the snow, and will hold a huge amount of snow.  It seems to be well constructed with a strong handle and should last many seasons.  Occasionally, the snow sticks to the surface, but a slight tap will dislodge it.  Thankfully it is extremely lite and saves your back.  Yes, I like it!!	1
The verdict is still out for me. I used this official Briggs & Stratton part to replace a 20 year old metal fuel pump. It is the correct replacement for my old fuel pump but that is not all that should be replaced according to B&S. In the box this new plastic fuel pump shipped in was a piece of paper with this note: "IMPORTANT INFORMATION: If this replacement fuel pump is being used on a Intek V=Twin engine that was origionally equipped with a metal fuel pump, the fuel pump pulse line must be replaced. Order part no. 694000." I didn't want to wait for pulse line to be delivered so I installed the pump without replacing the pulse line. The fuel pump worked well for 30 days. I have ordered a new fuel pump and pulse line. Fingers crossed.	1
Pumping again	1
Exact replacement part, works as it should. I would recommend. Thanks	1
Master original exactly easy to install	1
The product was received on time and as advertised.	1
OK, but very flimsy. The handle broke in half when chipping some ice-crusted snow (admittedly asking a lot of it), but even with normal use it feels like it's going to snap if you use it too much.	-1
Well made, great for yard work.  I like the handle.  As for moving snow, sorry, I live in Florida and about as close to snow as I get is in my freezer.	1
Got the job done!	1
NICE YELLOW made very strong i am going to buy another and great handle	1
Very pleased with purchase.	1
AS EXPECTED	1
Easy to install	1
Works great, perfect match to my original	1
Perfect replacement pump,installed it mower started rite up	1
Good sturdy shovel, for both pushing or lifting snow	1
I bought this shovel because I live in Chicago and it's winter. Wouldn't you know... I haven't had to use it once and it's already February. 4 stars because the pretty blue color looks nice hanging up in my garage.	1
Great shovel.  I'm 65 years old (female) and this shovel is a breeze!  It's wide, light, and the design is fantastic.  I can shovel snow much easier than with any other snow shovel	1
My old ergonomic shovel lost its metal strip so I needed a new one fast - I live in CT, lots of snow this year. It was shipped timely and arrived 2 days prior to another storm which also featured ice. Thank you for the speedy shipping. The shovel is even better than my last ergonomic shovel, not exactly sure why, but it is. I will never go back to a straight shovel - that is a given. I even think if handled correctly one can experience a healthy workout too :-) The quality of this item is fabulous, the effectiveness of this item was testified this past Sunday during a snowy icy mix. I highly recommend this product. Worth every penny. Hopefully I get a few years out of it and I will be back for another.	1
Works nice and is what we wanted a snow shovel that has a steel blade.  We have used it several times already this winter. I have used it for over two feet of snow and as long as I can lift the shovel, lol, it works great.	1
Lightweight but strong, gets the job done.  Didn't want to get one of those extra-wide shovels because although they may take bigger loads, each load is a lot heavier which more quickly tires you out.  More moderate-sized loads allow you to work longer and with less back strain...what's not to like?  Fair price for delivered product; my local Home Depot was all sold out of snow shovels in the wake of a very snowy January!	1
Worked no problem	1
Solid construction, the curved handle helps with your back but it also makes it hard to break up ice. Buy in the summer to avoid crazy winter price hikes.	1
Great Deal	1
Seems to be an excellent shovel, and it came much sooner than predicted, thank heaven.  With the storms we've been getting these last weeks, a GOOD shovel is a necessity.  My old ones were made of cheap plastic and broke easily.  These seem much more durable, and they're easier on my back.  I researched before buying, and these shovels were rated very highly.	1
Good Quality Shovel. I have used it for over 2 years now and still in perfect condition. I also use it to shovel lawn debris in summer and it has held up well. I would order again.	1
good	1
Love the design and it works a lot better then my 20 year old snow shovel !  Back does not hurt using this shovel.	1
Good shovel.	1
Great replacement for my old metal shovel and is twice as light!	1
Nice shovel for pushing snow or picking up. Only used once so far but seems to be my favorite shovel.	1
Very  good	1
thank you for a excellent product	1
Love this shovel.  It cuts a wide path with little effort, though lifting a shovel full is very hard for me.  I can't really shovel anymore due to my health issues, but I CAN use this to shovel to push snow from the area around my door, create a small path to my driveway and clean off my handicap ramp when the snow isn't too heavy for me.  God bless my neighbor who does the rest!  He uses this shovel, too, to shovel off my stairs and door area when the snow IS heavy.  I only do the small stuff, but believe this does a great job regardless.  I also researched before I bought.  This shovel has a very high rating everywhere I looked.  I like the metal piece on the bottom.  It gets under the ice and snow easily.  I DID push about 4-6" of snow with it. The snow was pretty fluffy, though.	1
Just got this and it took an hour getting the shrink wrap off the item. It was in perfect shape. I will have to see how this show pusher compares to a regular one that just lifts up. Sturdy frame, padded handle and metal scrape guard on bottom of blade.	1
Fits in my trunk without taking up to much space!	1
i have yet to use it but it is great to have on hand	1
Like some others have said, this is what it is.  Standard replacement part.  Works like it is supposed to.  There are several good videos out on YouTube showing how to replace this part.	1
OEM part, works great.	1
Didn't  snow yet, stay tuned	1
I received this shovel about an hour ago and have already taken it to UPS to return it. It was just too heavy for my puny muscles, and that was without trying it out with the added weight of snow on it. I could see how the ergonomics would let the user stand up straighter when shoveling and I'd love to find a lighter-weight shovel with the same design. But for now, I'll just stick with my lightweight plastic-bladed push shovel.  Everything about the construction of the Suncast shovel seemed top-notch, and the wear blade looked like it'd last forever. The shovel arrives assembled so the package is quite big	1
I use it but wish it had a. Different angle so it was easier for me with me being handicap	1
Was easy to use for snow removal without the wear and tear on your back.	1
Great little shovel when I used it the first time. After sitting in the cold the scraper edge has a bad warp and leaves about a half inch of snow in the center. Would not recommend this for anyone. Poor quality plastic used.	-1
I bought this knowing this isn't like carrying a real shovel.  Driving a sedan with limited space meant the last thing I need is a giant shovel or even a small shovel with metal tips that can dance around and damage the interior.  Knowing I really need something for an emergency but can be tucked away neatly but light enough.  With that said, it does its job.  The locking mechanism on the right side of the picture unlocks & locks in place with an ease.  Obviously this is plastic so there will be flex but you're not going to be shoveling 3' of snow with it either.  I have snow tires on my WRX that's all wheel drive but figured it's better to have one than not.  I guess you can technically buy one of the small folding shovel with metal tip and save yourself $5 but again, if you're trying to move a large amount of snow underneath the car or width is the main priority than this will do the job.	1
This is like the "KING KONG" of shovels. Awesome.	1
Haven't used it but no in case of need, will preform like it's big brother.	1
Easy to use just what I wanted.	1
PERFECT! won't scrape composite deck finish yet slices thru ice and snow. great design easy on the shoulders. need to order another to carry in truck.	1
Very lightweight, plastic so it doesn't damage stuff, but is pretty good at scraping, too.  The handle is padded at the end so it is more comfortable when shoveling snow.  The plastic bucket-shovel part had a ton of snow on it and didn't buckle.  It's very good for being very inexpensive, and my husband wants to get a second one for me to use and I would get a second one of this exact shovel but I hate shoveling snow.	1
Nice	1
This was an excellent shovel all winter long. My wife is small / petite and found it very useful for her size. I would buy this again.	1
OLDEST SON NEEDED A SHOVEL FOR HEAVY SNOW REMOVAL.  HE HAD JUST BROKEN HIS WHEN WE SEEN THIS ONE OFFERED.  WE ORDERED IT RIGHT AWAY.  WE ARE GLAD WE DID.  WE HAD A LOT OF SNOW THIS WINTER.  HE REALLY APPRECIATED THIS LITTLE GIFT.  THANKS	1
Excellent snow shovel holds a lot of snow plus pushes snow Great !!!	1
Met expections	1
I built my sprinkler system over 20 years ago and this season two of the main sprinkler systems failed.  I have found that after one year you usually can't find anything to replace anything, but I tried Amazon and they had the same valve, serial number, and exactly what I needed to replace two of my failed Toro valves.  I'm getting too old to replace anything, now days, but this made the job a lot easier.  I replaced both bad valves in a short time at a good price and the wife is happy again...an this is the most important part.  Reuben/	1
Works like a charm. Very well made.	1
No issues	1
O.K... Some said this was the real thing, some said if it wasn't love it'd have to do...  Wasn't love fo' sho... at least the one I got, clearly a cheap knockoff and failed straight away, DOA.  Ordered a fresh one from Mowtownusa, we shall see.  Amazon was kind enough to refund what they sold and sent... thanks.  Will update.  UPDATE: The replacement from Mowtownusa is the bona-fide genuine B&S/Mikuni OE goods, and works perfectly.  I've enclosed two pictures of what I received; in both shots the first, s&s by Amazon, is shown on the left, with the Mowtown replacement on the right. Note the different construction and poor finish, especially the rough hose barbs, on the knockoff. Plus, as earlier mentioned the impostor was DOA. Total Fail.  I don't completely fault Amazon on this, but this shows that clearly it's worth it to source parts from an outfit familiar with machinery.  Now with five stars for Mowtownusa and their excellent OE parts and prompt shipping.	1
Great Product	1
oem pump	1
Super little shovel. I bought this shovel last year before winter; predicting that more snow was on the horizon, and I was correct. It made cleaning the driveway a breeze. Most people actually lift the snow, but I told my husband to push the snow like a plow, and it  worked easily, in less time, and without the fatigue, and back pain...YEAH! I will be getting maybe a couple more.	1
Just received during our latest snow and it performed better than any other shovel that I have ever ownes	1
Good product for the price.	1
I haven't tried it yet, but I am sure will be a comfortable and effective shovel since I have had one of these for a few years which (although has crack at edge of shovel) it is still useable. Anyway, the main reason I am writing this review is for the way it was sent by the seller (other than Amazon). It was shipped as is without any bulky and useless package, it was delivered to my door w/o any issue, and I did appreciate not to mess with a large box!	1
We moved last year and left all our old bent snow shovels in the trash rather than pay to store and then move them. This one has a great edge and is easy on the back - 2 requirements we had. Plus, it fits nicely in the trunk of our SUV when we want to take it along to help shovel out grand-dad.  We have had lots of opportunity to use this wonderful shovel this year with all the snow we have been getting, and getting, and getting....so we highly recommend this shovel.	1
nice price	1
good price	1
Excellent product. Fast shipping.	1
As described.  Fit was exact.	1
worked great	1
Direct replacement of twenty year old units that have finally needed replacing.	1
I only purchased this as direct replacement.  The diaphragm design is weak, leaks at manual flow adjuster screw seat.  I guess that is why it is not manufactured any more.	-1
Haven't used it yet but seems sturdy.	1
Nice handy shovel for walkways.	1
Because I am a senior with back issues, I chose a shovel that I can push and dump the snow. This does serve that purpose.	1
This is just what I needed to clear smaller areas after I use my Snow Blower, well made and correct position for the handle. Saves the back.	1
I have used this snow shovel once since I purchased  it on Nov. 2013. I have  the old fashion kind for about 10 years so as I grow older mid 50' this shovel has served it purpose well for me.	1
exactly like the one on my engine.. great product	1
easy install	1
I like the look, feel and weight of this shovel. Due to climate changes I have had very little experience using this shovel in the snow but it works good during fall leaf clean ups.	1
I haven't had the chance to use it yet - and won't mind if I don't get to use it. However, it is lightweight and I love the design. So, I am pretty sure I am going to love this snow shovel.  Jeannie Walker - Award Winning Author - "Thomas, the Friendly Ghost" - A True Story of a Ghostly Encounter	1
We had a couple of inches of snow here in New England and this shovel is a back saver,the shovel actually made removing snow enjoyable!	1
Universal fuel pump works on many different mowers....priced way better than Kohler's inflated schedule!	1
Google your problems this works correctly and for the reviewer with the complaint about the leak you can readily find information online explaining why that would happen and it's not because of this item it's due to another issue.	1
Genuine Briggs & Stratton riding mower fuel pump. Fit was perfect, both holes lined up great, and all three 1/4" hose barbs where in the correct position. Fit perfect on my 18.5hp Craftsman Intek Briggs & Stratton engine. I would recommend this fuel pump, CPS	1
Works great so far.	1
I bought this shovel from Amazon in December to be prepared for when the snowfall comes this season. My neighbor had one of these and loved the way it worked and how it made the job easier. I had to have it so I actually bought two. Little did I know that while I was Christmas shopping at Target I noticed them hanging there. Color is different but it's the same one. Same manufacturer and same model number. They have it for $20 bucks. I bought mine for $27 and change for each here and noticed they have increased in price since then. Sometimes its better to get out of the house and shop around. You might get luckier than the deals you find from behind that monitor.	1
I've had two of these shovels so far because I wear them out.  To make them easier to use, I drill the rivets holding the metal blade on so that I can remove the blade all together.  Plastic on concrete or brick is MUCH easier to push, and slide and it doesn't grab, which IMO causes more muscle strain than anything.  Sure, they wear out faster, but I still get 5-6 good seasons out of them.  If you have issues pushing it, do as I stated above.  It makes a good shovel great!	1
I bought a new snow shovel/pusher about 30 years ago and it is finally wearing down.  The steel blade is about 2" shorter than when we bought it and it has quite a few bends and signs of age.  Just like me.  We wanted a new one and tried the SnoBoss Pusher and Shovel.  It is fantastic.  My Cardio doc told me to stay away from snow, especially if I am dumb enough to try shoveling it.  Something about blowing out my valve.  This shovel, however, relieves some of those concerns because it is so much lighter than my 1st one and the design makes it just perfect.  I push a scoop full and instead of picking it up (most of the times) I just turn the bucket over to the direction of the grass or the side of the driveway that gets little use.  I can get a full scoop with each pass and the actual job of removing snow has been simplified.  On those few occasions when I have to lift the shovel the two handles about midway up the handle add far more power and balance than the 1st one and others that I have tried.  The black handle is strong, tubular steel and is quite strong.  The SnoBoss is a well made tool and I expect to get a few years use out of its high quality plastic and metal.	1
After a great deal of snow in the Northeast, our Ames True Temper needed to have the rivets reattached.  Down to the workshop and it was usable once again. This workhorse saw a few good years of tough shoveling.  Looking all around to replace the shovel, found it on Amazon and even with the shipping it was cheaper than what was offered at Sears for example.  Since then, no snow!!!  But we expect the replacement, which appears identical, will serve us well!	1
I bought this here on amazon. My mom has an arctic blast shovel and hers looks just like the one in the pic. My came with plain wood handles not the green colored one as show in the pic. Other than that the shovel should handle any snow you are willing to shovel steel should outlast plastic and aluminum.	1
Excellent first use and now after 100 hours on the 22 hp engine and not a issue.	1
Fits engine	1
Match is exact and it works perfectly. It arrived very fast and was packaged safely for the product.	1
I haven't had to use it. Not even once. But I love having it.	1
But adequate for the purpose and it's lightweight and small. I'm more than happy with the compromise. I've tested it and it passed.	1
I have been buying Prestone Driveway Heat for years, works great on my driveway and doesn't do any damage.  I will continue to buy Preston Driveway  Heat Snow Remover.	1
work much bettter than any of the other melters that I have used.  I would recommend this to anyone.  It works much faster than salt with less.	1
best ice melter product I've used this winter. quick and powerful. don't mess around with any other product. trust me.	1
this product is great for snow and ice melting , and it does not harm your cement or stone steps	1
I used this edging in my backyard and it was easy to install and looked great.  Within 30 days my dog slashed his rear leg badly which required surgery - $550.  We had no idea what could have done such damage and we were very worried about our children in the yard, but we could never find any obvious dangers.  At Christmas my dog came in the house, and again had a deep cut on his front leg.  Another trip to the vet, another surgery - $550.  This time the vet asked the specific question, 'Do you have lawn edging?'  Well, yes, but it is fiberglass, not aluminum or anything dangerous.  Well, lesson learned - the fiberglass is just as dangerous as aluminum.  I ripped all of the edging out of the back yard.  For $1100 I could have edged the yard with some really nice landscaping brick.  Buyer beware.	-1
This is the second time we've purchased this edging.  It lasts and blends in well with the grass.  String trimmer doesn't damage it at all.  You do have to dig a good trench before placing it in the ground - otherwise it will lift out.	1
EASY GARDENER 8902 FIBER EDGE" EDGING is a good product, and I believe it will serve our purposes well.  The package lists these features: 1. Will not rust, warp,or rot 2. Faster, easier to install 3. Strong, long-lasting fiberglass 4. Extremely flexible  1.  Time will tell.  There is nothing to rust or rot.  We don't know whether it will warp.  We'll just believe that it won't. 2.  Faster than what?  There was a small amount of digging required to place it. It was much faster than the way we used to make boxes out of wood. 3.  Again, time will tell. 4.  It was not flexible enough.  It broke when it was bent.  Since the bend was near the end (about 18") from the end, we will still be able to use it.  We are not using it to fit around existing beds, as the pictures on the package illustrate.  Instead we are using it as a free-standing bed in the black yard.  We'll grow tomatoes in it.  We are going all out to grow food in our back yard, and we have been looking for a way to make raised beds and boxes.

This year we are planting green, yellow, red, and purple food in every nook and cranny.  During World War II, people grew 40% of their vegetables in their yard gardens, known as Victory Gardens.  We have been writing about growing vegetables a long time, and we have all kinds of ideas about cooking them.

Bought this for my family and they loved it.  Really came in handy this past winter 2010 blizzard season when all of the stores like Lowe's and Home Depot were all out of stock and found mine right on Amazon.  It did take 2 weeks to receive it but it came in handy when the next big snow storm came.  Great design doesn't hurt your hands when you have mountains of snow to shovel.  Excellent product!	1
This is a TRUE five star, Thank you	1
Quick shipment. It is under the seat of my Argo in case the old one spurts gasoline into the engine compartment.  If I had designed the Argo, I would have mounted the fuel pump outside the Argo body to prevent fires that quickly consume the plastic body. Faulty fuel pumps spurt gasoline liquid. When gasoline vapors exceed about 2%, the vapors can ignite. Carry a readily available fire extinguisher. My engine has 200.1 hours and I have replaced the fuel pump twice. The Briggs is a great engine and the Argo is a fine machine but you need to beware of a pulsing gasoline leak.  Carry a spare fuel pump and carry an accessible fire extinguisher.  -- PhD Chemist	1
Exactly like the one I took off my Craftsman ES4000 riding mower.	1
Direct replacement for my 24hp Briggs.  Easy install probably 10 minuets max.  My previous pump had 185 hours on it so I would guess this will outlast the motor it's installed on.	1
We haven't had an opportunity to use this yet. As soon as we bought it, it stopped snowing. But it seems like it will work well for a shovel to keep in the car to dig yourself out in an emergency. I don't know if you'd want to do a whole driveway with it, but it is good for emergencies.	1
As a lifelong Michigander I must say this will make life so much easier as I grow older. I have never had a easier time removing our record snow falls this season. Would make a great present for those hard to buy for. I let a few neighbors borrow for a drive and they LOVE,,,, I told them how to purchase their own because they only get one test drive.  Super price with on time promised deliver makes this a 5 star mega deal for all.	1
I'm not sure where everyone else lives but in the northeast we get ice storms sometimes. This garbage did absolutely nothing. Not even a dent. Maybe use it on pretzels?	-1
This fit my 1996 Briggs & Stratton 14hp generator.  The original pump was cast metal and had become clogged due to old fuel residue.  I installed the new pump and she started right up.	1
Worked like a champ. The company shipped it fast. The price was much better than my local repair shop. I am going to order more of these as I am certain that I will need them as my B&S mower engine ages and the gas still contains ethanol.	1
I originally purchased the first one at the big orange box home improvement store (HD). It worked well enough in soo many ways, we got another. After the first use with a major storm last season, I tried to buy another, and the local stores were out, so ordered a 2nd one via amazon.  Both have now been use for 2 complete snow seasons, and we got a lot of snow for both seasons.  We have spots where we can't shovel snow immediately to, and have to either make piles of small shovel loads and snow blow the piles away, or as this shovel allows you to do...easily scope and either drag behind you or "plow" in front of you a good size pile to another spot. Even with the wet heavy snow, get a load into the shovel, don't pick up the shovel, just rock it back a bit and drag the load away.  For digging and lifting large loads of the light stuff, the different lower handles let you find a position that helps not to cause you to use your back to lift. Also has a great spot to put your foot onto to help dig the edge into the deep snow banks. Once you break off a chunk of snow bank, get it in the scope of the shovel and drag it away.  Eventually all the dragging is going to wear the plastic body thin, and weak. The plastic is very thick, so I doubt it will happen any time soon. So when / if it does, it won't bother me ,  I won't hold it against it. I don't feel / see places in the plastic body where it's flexing under load, so I don't think the body is going to break , at it's designed thickness. I've broken every other snow shovel I've owned in one way or another over the years in a few seasons, it's not been a case of wearing them out, they've broken and I've just thrown them out. Many of the ergonomic bent handle designs work well for saving the back, but each and everyone of them  I eventually snap at one of the bends on the handle shaft.  The two True Temper SnoBoss Poly shovels  I have are slightly different (and I can't remember which one I got where): -One has a wrap around front edge protector, like a U shape, and seems to have dimples in/thru from one side to another to attach/hold it to the front edge of the plastic. These dimples are very well recessed and aren't wearing out. Seems you'd really have to just wear thru one side of the metal protect to get to where it's down to the dimple and the blade won't stay on. The U shaped metal protector doesn't scrape that well for the final cleaning down to the pavement.  -The other one has a single blade of steal and it's riveted to the bottom of the plastic front edge of the body. Well done, good size rivets , but this season the bottom wore enough that the heads of the rivets wore off on some, and this single edge of metal was half hanging off the shovel. This single edge of metal is a much better "scraper" of the pavement than the U protector is. But when you scrap with it , it wears the rivet heads down compared to just shoveling. I found some very large headed pop rivets, and used a washer on the top side (the plastic of the shovel). It worked well, the top side where the pop rivet shaft forms into a much room doesn't impede getting the snow off the shovel. Normally I don't fix a snow shovel, once broken I toss it. But the rest of the shovel and this protect blade seem to have a lot of life left in them, So pop riveting the blade back on seemed to make sense. I'm sure my rivets will last longer than the OEM ones, and a box of 'em was 15 bux, so I have a lot more to use if mine do wear out before the shovel and blade does.  I'd guess the two are different 'cause the manufacturer was trying to find a way to solve the rivet problem??  If I couldn't fix it, and didn't see possible evidence of the manufacturer attempting to fix a small design fault, I'd probably give it only 2-3 stars.  But since : - I can fix it easily - It seems they may have attempted a fix - We do find both versions very useful, and the first we bought soo useful we bought the second. - And it seems the rest is well designed form/function and strong...  I'll give it 5 stars.	1
These are the third and fourth Ames snow shovel I have purchased from Amazon. We have had fifteen snow storms so far this season	1
Got for $30 from BJs, works good overall, wide diameter for pushing snow around, curved design with extra handles reduces strain when picking up when you need to, but mostly just need a quick push over sides of driveway to eject snow from the shovel. Fatal flaw is the design of the wear strip, or rather how its welded on. Rivets are not recessed so they easily wore out and the bolts are now coming off one by one, only after about 2-3 uses!!! Will try to continue using even after wear strip comes off for light snow. Ames... just freakin improve the wear strip design and you'll have a winner!!!  To replace this, I got a Garant sleigh shovel 24 inches that looks exactly like the ames steel avalanche ergo sleigh shovel, but for only around $50. It has a much better designed wear strip and holds a LOT more snow, but is not made for lifting, just pushing.	-1
Exactly like original.  Installs easily. Arrived quickly	1
Perfect fit, good Price, thanks!	1
Perfect fit. Fast shipping.	1
Worked perfectly, was a easy replacement.	1
works like the new one that came with the tractor.  Will buy again if the need arise.  Thanks!	1
Unfortunately, we have had about 2 feet of snow since I got the shovel. It is great to use and really clears a wide path. Easy on the back and makes snow removal almost fun.	1
I use this brush in conjunction with a snow blower. It lets me move the snow away from tight areas and move it to the open for the snow blower. Makes real short work of the tight areas.	1
Perfect, fit  and worked immediately.	1
This pump was a perfect fit for the Briggs engine on our neighbor's John Deere rider.	1
Rivets holding metal wear strip on blade came out after less than a month. Quality is just not there. Too bad because it's a great design and very effective at clearing snow.	-1
TRUE TEMPER PRODUCTS ARE GREAT!! THIS SHOVEL AND THE TRUE TEMPER SNOW SLEIGH SHOVELS ARE AWESOME! THEY WORK GREAT MOVING LARGE AMOUNTS OF SNOW AND EASY ON THE BACK.	1
DO NOT buy one of these for fifty bucks. This B&S one is exactly the same as the one on my Kohler CH20S. Works perfect...and priced right. Thank you Amazon.	1
Easy fix for fuel issues on my Ariens lawn tractor.	1
I bought one of these marked down on sale at my local Sears after looking at them at Home Depot and thinking the regular price was a bit much. It turns out, it would have been worth full price.  This thing clears snow almost as fast as my snow blower, though I prefer the blower when things get more than 4 or 5 inches deep.  At first, it took a bit of trial and error to get my technique down, but once I figured it out, shoveling was a breeze. Here's my technique:  1 - At first I tried using one hand on the end handle and one on the lower grip to push the shovel, thinking I'd get more bite. It turns out, holding with both hands on the end handle like operating a mower, snow blower or hand cart really works best. Just grab each side where it curves up like those old ten speed handle bars and you get great leverage for pushing.  2 - I find the blade hangs up on rougher pavement and cement (particularly the kind with the rough aggregate at the surface) if I try to clear to the snow cleanly off the pavement while removing deep snow. The solution I found was to ease the blade up on the first pass and use the shovel as a snow plow to remove the deep stuff first, then go back and clean up after. I use a coal shovel for the most stubborn stuff that sticks to concrete and asphalt, in particular where car tires may have run over it and packed it down.  3 - I tend to push the snow as far as I can until it's too heavy, then I make a right turn and dump the snow onto the lawn like a wheel barrow. Then I continue plowing along. That gets rid of the most amount of snow in the least amount of time without having to actually lift any of it.  The shovel itself seems solid enough to deal with heavy snow, but the blade isn't nearly as capable. A full metal shovel is really needed for really scraping up the sticky stuff.  Despite the shovel's bulky appearance, I wouldn't recommend chopping ice with it. Aside from the fact that the design of the shovel makes it a bit awkward, it is plastic. Do yourself a favor and get a real ice chopper or (like I use) a coal shovel.  Combine the proper tools together, and your snow clearing with be much easier.	1
Second 1 I have purchased, works well.  I have had issues with 2 mowers not starting quick.  replaced this pump on both of them and it solved the problem on both.	1
Great product. Thanks!	1
XLNT	1
did the job	1
My 6-year old big Briggs-twin started running rough, bogging, and stalling.  No doubt, ethanol had needlessly claimed the life of another small engine!  I popped in a new fuel filter & this pump, quickly restoring the fuel delivery system.  It started and ran immediately!  Highly recommended.	1
Lots of positives about this shovel.  There are look-alikes out there in stores, but they don't have the steel blade and that is a real positive about this shovel.  It can handle ice much better than just plastic blades.  I had a ergonomic shovel prior to this one, so I was used to the advantage of such designs.  It really does make a difference on my back as you lift more with your legs and keep your back straight.  You will notice it right away and especially after a long day of shoveling snow.  I like the "push" option with this shovel as it can really clear alot of snow in one pass. It pushes much easier than my previous one because of the design.  You can use both hands while pushing and that make a huge difference.  It has two lift handles at different hieghts that can be used for lifting and that is handy.  They seemed to have thought of everything.  It's been worth the money so far.	1
Still shovelling away and working great.  I'm happy and like the way this shovel is designed.  ( I bought it because my neighbor had one and I thought it made sense )  I like to push the snow out into the street, and try to avoid lifting it.	1
came quick, great price, does what its s'posed ta	1
I just love this shovel. Just like the one my Dad had for many years. I used his and you cannot beat how well it works. Built very sturdy. It is a little heaver then I thought but at my age every thing is a little heavier. I think it will be better with the extra weight to get down deep. I love the extra piece of metal on the end. I have had a plastic shovel and it wore out after two years. The end of plastic ones wear in odd ways. This shovel once it starts to wear on the bottom it will wear evenly.  Aluminum is the best buy for a shovel with the quality for many years of shoveling. I Had to wait over a month to get it but was worth the wait because the snow is coming now. The wait could of been because of the time of year I purchased it.	1
Just ordered one of these shovels for our SUV.  When it arrived and we saw how compact it is, and how sturdy it appears to be, we ordered another one for the pick-up.  We thankfully have not had a chance to use it, but by the looks of it we think it will be very good for moving soft snow.  We are getting a different type of shovel just to chop into snow that has a hard crust, and will still use this one to actually move snow.  Of course this shovel is not meant for shoveling your sidewalk, however it looks like it will be great for emergency use when traveling in the winter.	1
The folding shovel fits nicely in the trunk. Construction is sturdy. This shovel is not really for shoveling volumes of heavy wet snow without placing stress on your back.	1
Factory replacement product. Correct (perfect) fit. Positive (perfect) function. A 3 minute replacement start to finish. No complaints.	1
pleased	1
Perfect fit as advertised and fast shipping.	1
Just what hubby needed to fix the mower. Good price, arrived prime fast!!	1
Just what I needed. Arrived on time.	1
Fixed my problem... Not crazy that this pump is made completelty from plastic... The old one was all ALUMINUM..	1
I found this one at a local store for $19.99 at an 'end of season' sale and decided to give it a shot. I have been using a one of those 'standard' bottom-of-the-line plastic shovel for a few years now, that has no metal edge or any other sophisticated features. Here are the things I like about this snowboss shovel: * you can use it as a standard shovel. If you fill the shovel too much though it gets pretty heavy to throw the snow away * you can use it to just push the snow away with two hands. This is my favorite use of the shovel. It clears a nice path and then you can just remove the snow that you piled up. The fact that it can be pushed with two hands gives you a lot of power to remove some serious snow. * the metal edge is great. It protects the edge from wear and it can scratch off ice and packed snow (like after you drive on the powder that covered your driveway) * there are two handles to give you more flexibility  my only two points for improvement are: * could use a rubber grip on the handle * many shops carry this for a price that I think is way too high for a shovel... Keep the price under $30 and this would be a real bargain	1
Poor quality item not up to OEM standards.  AZ Imports Co sent a generic item not a Briggs and Stratton fuel pump.  Charged 3 times the price of other suppliers on Amazon for the same item.  No country of origin on the box or the part.	-1
Worked real well excellent price	1
Have purchased from mowtown many times, always quality product and quaick ship. I would highly recommend them. The pump was easy install and works great, problem solved.	1
Works great, universal vaccum small engine pump.	1
great	1
had a briggs professional motor for years, it always started after taking a long time to crank.  Dealer said it was normal.  Five years later on a hunch I replaced the fuel pump.  It starts super fast now- the way it should have always started.  The second pump is the way it should have always been.	1
I love this thing. I live in NH and we had 24" of wet, heavy snow just before Halloween. Couldn't move it with my snowblower, but this Snoboss was great. Used it on asphalt and brick. Found that if I dropped the angle of the handle a bit, there was absolutely no sticking. I think that's the trick to using the SnoBoss. It is not the same thing as a regular shovel. I have a jigsaw and I have a circular saw. They're both saws but perform different functions. I, too, have a driveway that often requires carrying shovelfuls of heavy snow as much as 20 paces before dumping it. That's what I loved about this thing. It's more of a snow MOVER than a dig-and-heave shovel. I keep a small, standard shovel nearby for where I want sharp edges. For pushing, and ever better, dragging like a sled, you can't beat this tool. It carries three times as much snow effortlessly. It also glides up easily over snowbanks to move snow further in. Just keep the angle low. I wish I'd found this 25 years ago!	1
Original Briggs & Stratton - easy to install	1
I have a huge, long, steep black top driveway on the side of a mountain, so we get quite a bit of snow, so much so it requires a plow over three inches. I always shovel the entire driveway after the plow, especially after ice storms ( which I have not tried it on yet ) and its been kill me this year.  The Snoboss is a massive relief. It cuts the amount of time and effort I shovel or rather move snow like a scooped bulldozer. You can literally push it instead of having to shovel and throw, shovel and throw. It also has two handles to then throw snow and a third foot hold to shove when needed.  It's also light, but sturdy. Its not a piece of machinery or a wimpy toy. Rather like a snow shovel sled in a way. My plow guy calls it the bucket from a backhoe.  Other reviewers have said the metal edge on the front sticks or gets caught on things. It does. I've found if I'm pushing it on a flat it gets stuck on large ice or other things that are significantly sticking up from the ground, but its not constantly getting stuck. It also scraps the blacktop clean like a razor, so its very helpful and protects the plastic bucket from shearing. Its also there so when there is ice your supposed to flip the shovel over and use it as a scraper, that's not really going to help me, but a good feature.  I love the top rounded handle on this shovel its a back saver and is easy to use. Very, very functional.  Here's a great video on it that is not made by the manufacture too:  [...]  I wish I hand this four years ago.	1
I have an array of snow shovels, including my great aunt's, which is steel and 30" wide.  It's the best shovel I've ever seen or used, but it's clunky and very heavy.  This light-weight, ergonomically designed shovel makes quick work of heavy snow conditions.  Does it get right down to the concrete or asphalt like Auntie Clare's?  No, unless you go over the surface several times.  It does eliminate enough and most of the snow so that sunny conditions will take care of the rest.  I also found this shovel to snag on stuff...ice, tire tread marks, rough patches etc. but that happens with most shovels.  Repositioning the shovel to glide over problem areas is an easy, quick fix.  This shovel moves a lot of snow and is much easier on the back, more like pushing a lawn mower.  I find it most useful for big bulky jobs like driveways; smaller shovels are still needed for paths and narrow areas.  On heavy snow days (4+ inches), I will use this shovel.  Anything less (or if I want a cleaner looking driveway)--I will resort back to Auntie Clare's shovel.  It's nearly 80 years old.  Let's hope this shovel lasts that long.	1
I live in Minnesota and so far this has been the second snowiest winter on record.  We've had two monster snow storms and tons of smaller snows.  My driveway has a retaining wall and hill on one side so I have to move all the snow to the other side.  Keeping my driveway clear this year would have been a lot more difficult if I hadn't bought this shovel.  I use the SnoBoss to push snow across the driveway into piles at the other side and then use a smaller shovel to throw it over the mountains of snow on the side of the driveway.  It works perfectly for me when the snow is dry and relatively light and less than 4 inches deep.  Any more snow than that and it gets hard to push through when it fills up. When I foolishly waited to shovel until after a 12-15" storm had ended back in December and I had knee-deep drifts in my driveway, it was totally useless because there was too much snow to be able to push it.  But when we had a little bit of snow nearly every day in January, I zipped across the driveway with the SnoBoss, pushing all the snow to one side really quickly.  I don't have enough upper body strength to use this as a shovel, especially with the mountainous piles of snow on the side of my driveway, but someone stronger could scoop and toss a lot of snow with this.  But be careful. It holds so much snow that if the snow is wet and heavy, even a strong person would have a hard time lifting a full scoop of snow.	1
works fine after install, came fast.	1
just as described.	1
What the heck can you say about a fuel pump?  It works, but you really don't have any choice about buying it.	1
Exactly what I thought it would be and was a perfect replacement for my old fuel pump!	1
Very sturdy shovel.  Had to order one here online because local stores never have any in stock.  It was scratched a little on arrival but hey it's a shovel and it's not going to stay pretty anyway! We're ready for the next big one now! Thanks Amazon!	1
Worked ok in 3 uses both sides wore out and busted from concrete sidewalks don't waste your money on it unless you use it for a fully flawless paved driveway if your driveway is concrete forget it if your driveway isn't perfectly smooth and flat forget it i used this shovel 3 times 15-20 mins at a time and shovel head is worn through plastic on left and right of the metal strip on the bottom.$50 gone out the window.	-1
I purchased this shovel at a local hardware store for $32. I "THOUGHT" I had made a very good purchase. That is,until I used it for the first time,last week. We got a decent sized storm here,well over ten inches of very wet/heavy snow. I wanted something sturdy and reliable. Something,that wouldn't be a total piece of garbage. Well,needless to say,this is NOT a reliable/sturdy shovel. This thing is a VERY VERY thin/flimsy piece of sheet metal,barely tacked onto the shaft. The blade is very flat,with a slight curve. It has NO side scoop whatsoever. So,when you attempt to lift the snow,it falls right off. Hence,creating that much more work and strain. I used this thing for all of two minutes,before I got so disgusted and gave up. I have NO CLUE what this "thing" is possibly good for. But,it certainly is NOT good for SNOW!!! Anyone in the market for a "very gently used" piece of junk?!?!?!	-1
This shovel is good for what it was designed to do: push snow.  It doesn't work well getting the last layer down to to pavement because it's angled too steep, and it will catch on the surface.  I finally got to try mine out this week, and had good success getting most of the snow off with the Snow Boss, then coming back with a more conventional shovel to get the last bit off.	1
I really wanted to like this shovel, it looks neat, it looks like it will really save your back, but it is heavier. It does not work the magic I was expecting. That metal strip on the shovel's edge does keep sticking, that is very annoying and why should I have to cut the metal edge off? Sure, if I do that, it might be better for moving snow, but I am not going to and back it goes, I just did not feel this shovel was worth the money.  I picked up my other ergonomic sovel and it was much more comfortable to use.  Like another reviewer mentioned, tossing the snow is a challange with this. This one wasn't for me.	-1
I put it  on my Briggs motor and it works just fine	1
Excellent	1
I ordered the pump on a Friday and received it by Monday. Right part, worked great.	1
exact replacement part works great fast delivery	1
Ames True Temper website calls this exact item (same SKU# too) a 26" (not 24") blade. As of Dec 29th, 2010, you can find this exact item, with the new steel wear strip (which is not shown anywhere), at your local Home Depot & Lowe's for $35. Due to a labeling error by my local Home Depot, I paid $12.97 (no tax) for this.  I used it for the first time today (for our 16" accumulation from 2 days ago) and it's such a well-built unit (made in Canada), it did exactly what I expected of it. The steel wear strip hasn't bothered me yet (if ever).  I workout and with a full blade of snow, this can get a lil' heavy, so if you're a lady or if you most plow packed in snow, you're been warned. It's ergonomic bent frame design is easy on your back.  This is the Hummer of manual snow plow.	1
I placed an order for 2 of the Ames True Temper snow shovels. Living in East Tennessee, we have been blessed with lots of snow this winter. I am very pleased with these shovels, but hope not to have to use them any more this winter. May God bless you and your wonderful business. Keep up the good work. Sincerely, L L	1
Picked up the identical model from a local store, and not only is the metal edge flimsy, the bed of the shovel is weak. After a couple of big snowfalls the body of the bed has cracked, and I doubt it can move much more snow.	-1
Works just fine.	1
I must be unlucky but this shovel is junk.  The shank is mounted crooked into the blade and the plastic handle at the top is not screwed on so it comes off.  Maybe it was a Monday after a holiday when this was assembled.  Update:  Amazon kindly replaced this shovel but the replacement was little better.  It seems the problem is that the assemblers use small screws that are installed with a power drive causing them to strip the threads making them loose.  Replacing them with heavier screws and drilling two additional holes to add two more screws makes the shovels serviceable.	-1
I live in Wisconsin so snows can be deep and heavy.  I have a nice big snowblower so I don't use a shovel as the primary snow removal tool, but I use it often enough when the snow plows bury the end of my driveway that I wanted something with  some durability.  The shovel this replaces also had the ergonomic handle (a must for all shovels I think) but was hard plastic with the steel wear strip on the bottom.  So this one is a step above being all metal.  I wish the sides were scooped up some so the shovel was more of a bowl shape to keep snow from sliding off the sides as you use it, but that's about the only thing lacking in the design.  Nice solid feel, with a "save your back" handle - it should work out fine.   ***EDIT***  After our first snowfall, I found out that this shovel really only deserved one star...  The ergonomic bend in the handle is far too shallow so you still end up bending over too much.  And the wear strip on the bottom is about the worst i've ever experienced (and living in Wisconsin or Germany my whole life, I've used many shovels).  It makes it very difficult to smoothly push the shovel along concrete.  Also, I was disappointed to find this shovel at the local brick and mortar for just $14 when I went to buy a better shovel that was better...	1
Exact replacement. Easy to mount and install. You might want to clean your carb and replace your fuel filter, air filter, oil,and spark plug if they are due. Check your hoses too.	1
I had an old MTD tractor with a metal fuel pump. This plastic pump replaced the original metal pump perfectly.	1
I have a 30 years old lawn tractor and the gas pump died.  This was a perfect replacement.  Fit easily and worked great.  Tractor is back in action, waiting for the next part to break.	1
The B&S number on this replacement fuel pump is identical to the one that was on my machine, 808492.  Don't be confused by this new number, even though it is what B&S is now using.	1
this fuel pump was easy to  install and work just like a diagram pump should. was easy on and easy on just it said	1
Simple to install and instant results.  Fits the John Deere D130 perfect.  I read that the "new" gas causes these to fail if you do not properly stabilize for winter.	1
I was having trouble getting fuel to the carburetor. So I needed a new fuel pump. This fuel pump fit perfectly and is a genuine Briggs & Stratton fuel pump. Very easy to install and now my lawnmower runs great. This seller has a great price on this product. I do recommend this seller.	1
We recommend this pump to anyone needing a B & S 808656 fuel pump. Nothing works as well as the item designed for your engine.	1
Fit perfectly, after some priming and engine turning the pump worked and has continued to work all summer. I would buy this product again from Amazon.	1
Replace the old fuel pump on my John Deere 111 lawn tractor.  The John Deere model would have cost well over $100.  Pump works great.	1
Used to replaced a faulty cheaper replacement fuel pump.  Has been in 1.5 years without any issues.  Good product would buy again!	1
I used the solenoid from this unit to replace a solenoid on a similar Toro valve (which didn't seem to last 3 years). An Orbit universal solenoid I bought from Lowe's didn't work (it fit but didn't work right). With Amazon Prime and free shipping, this made it the cheapest solution to get a working replacement solenoid.	1
I live in an area where the water pressure is over 100psi and I have long runs to the irrigation valves. The end result is a lot of pounding and frequent valve failures. These valves are tougher than most that are rated at 100 or 125psi and easy to service. Highly recommended.	1
I used these to replace the upper jar top with solenoid on old Toro valves that have grown tired after 11 years. Fit perfectly and operate splendid with my new controller	1
Works well	1
This unit was exactlly like the one that was already install, but not working, I used parts from new one  made the installation and it workes  Great. EEL	1
This valve fit right on I didn t have to change nothing	1
Very satisfied!	1

Excellent product and quick delivery...	1
We have been using these to replace commercial valves installed originally by our irrigation contractor on a cycle basis as they wear out. These Toro valves (appear identical to me to the Irritrol model) I would consider high quality and none have failed in the 10 years I have been digging out the old valves and using these for replacements. Unfortunately some of them even have to sit frozen underwater in valve boxes with poor drainage all winter. Of course we have the system blown out internally every Fall. We have 14 valves in our installation so always keep several of these handy if the need arises. The jar top feature is terrific as most valve problems (solenoid, diaphram, etc) can be fixed by unscrewing the entire jar top assembly off in seconds and screwing on a new one and connecting the wires (just recycle the new body as usually it is not worth digging everything up and remaking the water connection unless there is a crack in the old body, this assumes you already have this model installed in the ground). I highly recommend using teflon tape on both threaded connections to minimize leaks and allow a lubricated tightening to minimize the danger of cracking any plastic. Always use male plastic threaded pieces into this valve, never metal and make sure the teflon tape is applied carefully so a piece doesn't enter the valve or a sprinkler head and cause problems. Sorry if you are a professional and this was too basic but is my DIY experience.	1
Just installed eight of these valves.  Brand flipp'n new, yet four of them leak.  System clean and rings (bonnets) tight, yet, they leak (water pools on top of the valve).  I've had great luck with other Toro valves (250 Series)in the past, but obviously there is one heck of a problem with this model if 50% of them leak.  Will cut them out and replace with something that actually works correctly.  Come on Toro! -I'd expect better from you.	-1
I pick up a set of these nozzles to replace some old nozzles that no longer misted.  These work great.  I screwed them into my irrigation system and bam, MIST.  This makes watering much easier in the greenhouse as I can turn it on and let it run for 10-15 min and the planter boxes get a nice gentle soak with out disturbing the soil or harming my seeds.  Highly recommended.	1
Great construction.  I bought these to build a mister for my greenhouse.  They work great.  I'm sure that they work great for mister for fan too.	1
These were exactly what I needed...	1
so good so far, they appear to be better quality than previous units I have used	1
Works perfectly with the Orbit Mister!	1
GREAT	1
Awesome	1
A nice fine mist.	1
a must for the cooling fan	1
As stated	1
It is very good, all right	1
These work great	1
Worked as advertised.	1
I saw a sprinkler stand with a 5-star average review, and thought I couldn't go wrong.  Wow, has this thing frustrated me.  The model I purchased had a manufacturing defect in the uppermost threads-- there was a deposit of extra material that rapidly shaved the threads off the (plastic) rainbird sprinkler head that I purchased to use with the stand.  I was able to repair the threads with the judicious use of a center punch and a lot of elbow grease, but was very frustrated with the experience.  I got it out into the yard today, and discovered the design flaw that should have been obvious from the picture.  The side of the stake where the 'step' is located (the horizontal bar that you can use to get the spike into the ground) is directly under the part where the hose attaches.  If you've already tightened your hose down, you're not going to want to undo that, but you're not going to be able to stomp on the step, either.  So at best, you'll be able to put your bodyweight on the stake, but that won't do much to get it into hard ground.  Between the manufacturing defect and the design flaw, I can't recommend it.	-1
Well made, just what I was looking for.  Received before promised and packaged well. They are all set up around the garden with hose and timer, ready to go.  Easy to use.	1
Works as described.  A good stream and this drip system works well with low pressure water systems.	1
Flimsy	-1
Excellent	1
Best product for aeroponic springkler at low pressur. Fast shipping	1
These are very good for watering larger areas than the drip type attachments. You can adjust the diameter if the spray circle by adjusting the flow knob. These are much more reliable than some I have used in the past and appear to be well designed.	1
Just what my Raindrip system needs, full cirlce & adjustable. Pricing was great and also delivery, pricing.	1
works great	1
not that good.	-1
Has  worked  well  over more  than  a  year  Nice  idea	1
Very poor workmanship on the hose connection to the spike.  Both hose connections had broke off the spike during shipment.	-1
I initially bought a Raindrip setup at Costco. I liked it so much, I contacted the company to buy more. A few years ago, they had an old timer who took orders from the public, and was a nice guy to speak to. He, unfortunately, has gone, and the Raindrip company won't even take your order. The snippy telephone operators want to get rid of you as fast as possible. Sadly, corporate America stamps out any bit of personal service. In any case, I really like my Raindrip products, despite the impersonal service. They hold up well, even through the winters ( I live in the NE). These Full Circle Rotaries create a nice spray pattern that wets the area they service (around 3-4feet). Raindrip also makes a non-rotary head which is also nice, but doesn't cover as wide an area. I should add, sometimes the little rotary head can become stuck and not rotate, but a gentle knock usually restores its' function.	1
These things spray a good spiraling stream of water. They are adjustable so you can get the spray to any distance between 0 and 15 feet. Good rate of flow - not too much, not too little. I'd say about 15GPH.  Get some stakes to hold these in the ground. I've found these to be VERY useful: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BO99IE  You have to get these in the air and plug in your 1/4" tubing to them, and you can adjust the output with the knob on the edge. Try them. They're better than anything I could find in the hardware store.	1
BUY these when you buy a misting fan.  The misters that are sold with most misting fans will soak just about everything in a 8 foot radius. The finer misters (10106) are PERFECT and you can actually sit next to the oscillating fan, and you won't get soaked.  I learned the wet way, and had to wait a few extra days for the better misters to be delivered after purchasing and testing a NewAir AF-520B misting fan.	1
Purchased this with misting fan.  They work great.  Easy to Assemble and clean.	1
fits my magic mister	1
Works great with misting hose or in modified hose	1
Very disappointed, was setting up the Rain Bird I purchase with this and when I was ready to see if it was set correctly the hose popped out and the threads had snapped off.	-1
Great for keeping in the car!	1
Use these to cool down a/c condenser that runs all day. Saves tons of money on hot days. They work great day after day.	1
Well made, I should have seen the size and went after the bigger.  Great product but just flow is small and that's on me.	1
Not much to say about this - but it is well built, solid construction.  I like that when it is pushed in the ground that the sprinkler is above ground quite a bit (maybe 6 inch).  Gives the sprinkler a little more coverage capability.	1
perfect for the cars	1
Well made.	1
I put one in each of my kids cars for the winter, I bought several, and they are light weight been they seem durable for the emergency they were designed for, they are not over wide so I would not by for snow removal around the house, but for the car, the size is perfect.  I will update if I get stuck and need to use it.	1
This is my second shovel brought of this size. When I owned a car, I had one in my car, as it is prefect size to fit in trunk, plus I now use it for shoveling small spaces like the stairs leading up form my basement apartment. My son now has a car and wanted to take my shovel leaving me only the big one which is harder for me to handle . I brought this so he has his own shovel for car.. It comes in two pieces which fit very sturdily together, unlike those fold-a-way ones. You need a sturdy handle to shovel snow over 2 inches deep, like you get when the snow plows the car with snow around the wheels. If you are a tall person (over 5 ft 8 in) you may have to bend a little to use this for shoveling snow around the car. Otherwise this is an excellent shovel for car during the winter months.	1
perfect fpr the snow.  not too heavy	1
works well	1
GOOD REPLACEMENT	1
These nozzels are excellent, and have done wonders for my misting system on my patio.  The system originally had plastic emiitters, but those have all since cracked.  These metal replacements are very well made and sturdy, and the mist that they emit is ultra fine.	1
Great little nozzles that do not last that long (they clog up via water deposits due to the small misting hole), even if you use the recommended filter. I have been using these for three years, and have discovered you can buy them at less than half the price, just by ordering in lots of 20; do this, as you are going to need them. Because they do not last that long before you have to try and unclog them, the cheaper you can get them, the better! The best way to clean them out that I have found, is by using vinegar and water in a sonic cleaner; if this fails, because I play guitar, I can always use a high e or B, ss string to get into the itsy bitsy hole. As a side note, the hypro mister 301AF 0.7-80 (Farmtek WF4015) which has a 1/8" MNPT (male national pipe thread) and requires a different PVC "T" (Farmtek WF1270) than this nozzle, and has a built in metal mesh screen, performs much better than the Orbit. The Hypro has a better fan pattern, and does not clog up like the orbit mister.	1
I needed a flat blade that would fit into narrow spaces. I bought this one to pick up accumulated leaves and mud that had composted on the walks, driveways, and street gutters while the house was empty. I dumped the compost along the edge of the lawn to kill the grass and make a flower border. It was heavy work, so it really helped that the shovel weighs almost nothing.  On the one hand, I found myself wishing I'd bought one with a longer handle. There was more material to move than I had anticipated, so I spent a lot of time bent over. But on the other hand, a longer handle would have been heavier. It's easy to store because it is so narrow and short. I've hand a long-standing rule that any tool I own must try really hard to fit into the trunk of my very tiny car, and this one succeeds; when I take a trip to the mountains I'll be all set. So all in all I think this was the best choice for me.	1
The best you're going to get as a paraplegic that can only shovel with one arm.	1
I use my mist system almost everyday, here in Bakersfield, during the summer.  It is nice to have replacement heads when they start to plug up. we have very hard water here and I am constantly soaking the heads in vinegar, so it is nice to be able to just replace them while keeping it on with enough spares.	1
I built a spray device for my vegetables last year so it would be easy for my kids to water while I was on vacation. As with any spray device, there are mineral particles in any unfiltered water so occasionally I have to clear the nozzles with a fine wire. With filtered, treated water, it does not clog. Well made!	1
Mists well.	1
Works fine .	1
Just used this on the 30" of snow we got - it is nice for tight spots.	1
Just like the misters in the produce section of the grocery store	1
Worked great would do business again. Thanks	1
Great for metal detecting on sandy beaches, might be a bit better if the angle was straighter but it's workable. Nice and light and tough enough in loose sand. I'll toss it in the car for winter just in case...	1
Cant beat the value..	1
bought this to replace one on my mister and it works perfectly	1
I like this, but don't love it.  The spray is so fine that it doesn't reach the ground.	1
Replaced all my plastic misters and solved all the drip problems.	1
A good shovel for the basement cleanups	1
Great quality...	1
I live in Fl. Bought it for cleaning out my chicken coop. Light weight and does a good job.	1
This is a true snow shovel of proper proportions much like you would find used by professionals in building maintenance.  It will pick up enough snow but not so much that you hurt yourself.  I've used a shovel similar to this for years and am glad i could find the same shovel design.	1
light, strong	1
A little softer then I would prefer but it may last longer then expected	1
This shovel had been a life saver when stuck in snow after work. Those foldable shovels are useless, have bought and they break. This little guy has lasted the whole winter with multiple uses, and barely takes up room in the trunk.	1
I have had the ones these replaced for many years. It was time to get new and the price was fine and they got here fast. They work fine.	1
These are better than the ones that came with the fan. They fit better, and spray a nicer mist.	1
These are the direct replacement for the curly stand along two jet misters you hook up to a hose.  And may be better!  Excellent mist.	1
As advertised.  WE'll see when it snows!	1
small size perfect for snow removal from cramped spaces. Very useful.	1
unfortunately needed for all the snow this winter.  Small and can carry in my car.	1
Very well made old school snow shovel. All steel = rugged but also heavier than plastic throwaway shovels. Great to push wet or deep snow like a plow. You can throw snow too but need to be reasonably fit due to the weight. We use the junky plastic shovel for light snowfalls.	1
These are replacements for original ones that are not longer working.  they do a nice job of misting, and a perfect replacement for existing ones that are no longer misting correctly.	1
Too little. Thought they were 3/4	1
Works great for little jobs around the house--just right for what I needed!	1
Gets the job done.	1
A good strong shovel good for getting into tight places.	1
I live in Va Beach...we don't get a whole lot of snow, but when we do, you need to get rid of it.  I used this shovel for this first time this year and it was great!  I think it might be a little uncomfortable for a taller person (I am 5'4 and had to bend down a lot to use it) but I think for short jobs its wonderful.  Its very light, and that made a huge difference for me...last year I tried shoveling with a much heavier flat shovel not intended for snow and it about killed me.  This sped up the process a lot this year.  It doesn't work very well once the snow or ice hardens up a bit, but worked great before that.	1
These did not work right out of the brand new bag, drip drip drip, no misting!!!! Grrrrr	-1
JUST IN TIME FOR FORCASTED SNOW STORM!! WELL CONSTRUCTED AND LIGHTWEIGHT. NOT THAT I LIKE TO SHOVEL......WHO DOES?! BUT THIS SHOVEL WIILL MAKE THE JOB EASIER.	1
This product is exactly as described and does a great job, seems very high Quality	1
As described	1
Great small shovel - very good quality	1
This is for kids	1
Newsflash folks: Those things they call snow shovels at most stores are only good for causing back aches and heart attacks. They are just too large and pick up too much snow at one time.  Look at the shovels used by most professionals in building maintenance and you will see that the shovels used are either pushers or transfer shovels that look like this product.  I bought just about the same shovel in the mid 90's and was glad to find the same design again.  The blade is large enough but not too large so you pick up a practical amount of snow.  I think my ex wife is still using the old shovel, and I expect this one to last just as long	1
Bought for the new air misting fan. This creates a great fine mist for patios.	1
I HAVE PURCHESED ARIZONA OUTDOOR MISTING SYSTEMS IN THE PAST, GREAT PRODUCT, AND JUST ORDERED SOME NEW NOZZLES TO REPLACE THE OLD.	1
They are a nice product...but I ordered the wrong item....I didn't do my research !!!!	1
I paid under $10 for it, and for that price it is great. It is not my primary snow shovel and of course you can't use it for very heavy snow or ice, but for light snow clean up I much prefer it to my heavier snow shovels, especially when working around the cars (plastic blade doesn't scratch them).	1
I like this shovel. The blade is all plastic so it's easy to push on the sidewalk.  I think the metal edged ones tend to get bent and they also have a lot more drag making them  harder to push.	1
good thing i had extras i had one clog up.	-1
Exactly what I was looking for.  I made my own personal misting stand out of PVC and used 2 of these misters.  Works great!	1
These things are a great replacement for the plastic nozzles that come with the MistyMate brand of misters.	1
Shovel is sturdy. Haven't had a chance to use it; wanted to have it before the winter season arrives. It fits in my car nicely. Will update if I get a chance to use for the winter. It has a good feel; not to heavy and not too light (toy).	1
great	1
They work but they are pricey.  Perhaps because of the copper.  I would take plastic version anytime for a more reasonable price.	1
Works just like you would expect. Would purchase again.	1
Weight and size is perfect for me, as a woman. I am 5', and have found other shovels to be longer handled and heavy and clumsy while shoveling the snow. A good purchase for me.	1
When it comes to shoveling snow or raking leaves, you move the weight of the tool as much as the weight of the debris.  Most show shovels nowadays are heavy duty, which means too heavy.  What I like is a cheap shovel with a plastic blade and a light handle.  (I have an ice-chopper, for when I get in trouble.)  This is a simple shovel, better than most, but not as good as the two cheapos that I have been using for the past decade.  Searching in local stores and online, I could not find another shovel as good as the Garant.  Unfortunately, the wood handle is longer and thicker than on my old shovels, adding weight.  They probably needed the extra thickness to permit the extra length.  As with my old shovels, the Garant handle slips into a socket in the blade.  A screw through the plastic secured my old blades.  On the Garant, there is a fancy, click-in fastener, no place for a screw.  If I could get the Garant blade out, I still I could not use my old handles.  (They are perfectly OK, just worn down blades - I could not find replacement blades, either.)  To make things worse, there were several stickers on the blade and handle.  I was not able to completely remove the one on the handle, even with goo gone.	1
These appear to be relatively sturdy, high quality.  I bought one for each of our vehicles to dig them out of snow.  I have not had the opportunity to try them, but I expect they will do well.	1
very good product, works well and is as described.	1
good product	1
I needed the extras my other where clogged bad !	1
nice shovel got it very quickly and used it several times already.	1
Nice	1
I bought the NP091KDU with the intentions of using it in some tight space, like porch steps and around the garbage cans. Its small and compact with a slick finish plastic surface that the snow flies off of real easy. The wood handle is easy enough to hold in one hand. (For me anyway).  I used it for only two snowfalls and love it. Its nice to clean up along the edges of the driveway and sidewalk edges that my brother always misses when using the snowblower. I purchased at a local ACE Hardware Store when I saw 2 hanging up. They were priced at $9.99 and after I read the reviews  about 10 days ago I decided to buy it.  Weight is a shade under one pound.  Shovel is made in Made in Canada. The only problem I saw was the screw used to hold the plastic D-Grip to the end of the wood handle should have been a flathead screw. The Hex Head Screw that Garant used sticks up (see photo)and may cut your fingers or hand. I replaced my screw with a flathead the day I bought the shovel.  The other end of the handle that is tapered into the black gripping fastner is bare wood and may crack, splinter or rot prematurely from getting wet.   See my photo's in the customer photo box on the right hand column.  Update: I have used this shovel now all through summer (of 2014) sweeping up nusance leaves and landscape debrie that blows onto our property from the neighbors houses. Also good for sweeping up cigar butts & ashes dropped on the driveway by a lazy brother.	1
I wanted a smaller shovel to ease my low back pain during snow removal. This one works great and isn't heavy when full of snow.	1
This shovel works quite well.  I like the metal attached to the end of the shovel, great for getting under icy spots.	1
Excellent product, guess the true temper will show this winter.	1
Very small and weak	-1
Great	1
It doesn't have quite as fine a mist as I was looking for.	-1
These nozzles fit the MistyMate Classic misters (and probably Camper 6) and are both substantially less expensive and better constructed than the plastic MistyMate nozzles.	1
Arrived on time and worked as advertised	1
YOU WILL NEED THESE SOME DO GET CLOGGED	1
ok	1
This is an great shovel for small and close areas, it is perfect for steps. I used this last winter and it looks like new, the plastic stood up to hitting ice and the stone steps without a mark on either the steps or the shovel.	1
Purchased as a light shovel for clearing the roof from New England snow.  Works well for moving a lot of light snow just a few feet.	1
bought replacement heads for the Misty Mate 16020...but haven't the need to replace the original plastic heads yet	1
These work fine.  The insert seems to last longer and is easier to clean than the originals I had that did not have it.	1
plugged up	-1
Work great.	1
No Problems	1
I wanted inexpensive and light and that's what I got.  This shovel does a great job and for 17 bucks, it's well worth the money.	1
I started out using plastic nozzles (cheapskate me), but they quickly failed. I switched over to these and they haven't failed me. I drilled and tapped PVC end caps and the little o-ring on the nozzles makes for a no-leak connection. I used a 200 mesh filter to keep them from clogging. All and all a happy experience.	1
Purchased these nozzles to put together a homemade misting fountain in my flower garden.  I have a low pressure Shurflo pump (35-50 psi) with a small expansion tank and 50 feet of poly 1/4 inch hose.  These nozzles worked beautifully and created a large volume of very fine mist that swirls in the wind and looks like fog pouring off the fountain.  The nozzle uses a little less than 1/2 gallon of water per hour and creates a really pretty effect.  I didn't use any fixtures, I just screwed the nozzle into the open end of the poly hose and it is water-tight and securely attached.	1
These work pretty good.  One of them already got plugged, but I'm sure I can clean it by soaking it in vinegar.  Buy some extras and plan on swapping them out from time to time.  If anything, I'd say they put out slightly more water than I wish they did.  We have them installed about 8 feet above our patio, and the chairs below them will get pretty wet.	1
Great to build a homemade mister for home!	1
Works great, wish they were cheaper	1
I broke my snow shovel a few years ago, and was never proactive enough to think to get one before the bad weather sets in.  I live on the southeast coast of Virginia, so we do not get a lot of snow.  But when we do get it, we get 6 or 8 inches at a time.  I got my shovel early this year and it just sat in the garage until today.  We got about 6 inches last night with sleet on top, so I put this to good use today.  The shape is excellent.  I shoveled my front steps and sidewalk and a path out to the street (about 50 feet) in no time, then went over and helped my elderly neighbor with hers.  She has the more traditional flat snow shovel, and she's decided that she is going to get one like mine now that she saw how well it works.  If you live in an area that gets frequent snows, I would recommend a larger, metal version of this same type, but this one works great if you don't have to do too much shoveling.	1
Not very well made	-1
Great Deal	1
Cheaper to buy on Amazon than at your local big box hardware store.  I bought a couple of packages. When rotating my misters, I soak them in a 50/50 solution of water and CLR.  The CLR works much better than the standard mister cleaner that is overpriced. When misters get clogged, there are always battle spares on hand.	1
nice price	1
Excellent replacement for another brand misting system whose replacement nozzles are nearly double the price. Yes they do fit . . . perfectly.	1
Quick repair.  Works great.	1
Satisfactory for their intended use.  SS	1
perfect	1
Better than the plastic ones	1
Quality product and reasonable price. The brass and stainless steel doesn't split like the plastic nozzles. Price is much lower than the big box stores!	1
I love all my Orbit products.  I have three misting systems.  One for the West pasture for the Llama and goats and one for the north patio canopy.  And the front walk way to the house.  That one cools down the bird on the feeders.  I bought a mess of these.	1
I have been using these for the past several years and am well pleased with their performance. Highly recommended as replacements for http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JJT9MM/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_11.	1
Works great-not quite as rugged as the original.	1
The metal ones also produce a finer mist than the remaining plastic ones in my mist line. I will be buying more.	1
MISTY MATE CO. NEED TO REMOVE ALL PLASTIC NOZZLES FROM ALL PACKAGE AND REPLACE THEM WITH BRASS NOZZLES.BECAUSE I PLACE TWO ORDERS AND 80% OF THE PLASTIC NOZZLES WERE DEFECTIVE.THANKS E.P.	1
I've had misters for years.  This year, I purchased Orbit's 160 psi.  That in itself is not bad.  It does help and atomization.  However, some of these tips are inconsistent in their spray patterns Land under pressure.  I clean them with a calcium lime and rest remover and it appears that changed the orfis.  Some of them not do not atomize properly.  Spend more money by some that have built in filters.  A professional great if tips.	1
Seems to work	1
So I just moved into my first house and have been buying garden tools over the summer to start my tool crib.  I have really liked the quality of the Ames True Temper Brand and have been buying online or at my local TrueValue.  Unfortunately I was a loyal customer and stuck with the True Temper Products and this snow shovel just doesn't live up to the same standards.  It cost me $18.66 and its a cheap plastic piece of junk.  I would have returned it but with an $8 shipping charge and 20% restocking fee, that was more than half the cost of the shovel so I just chose to keep it.  Maybe my kids can use it when they get older, if it lasts more than a season.  Two stars because it wasn't broken or anything (not yet), just didn't meet my quality expectations.  Ohh BTW, there is no wear strip on the leading edge in case you were wondering.	-1
Fantastic for shoveling ! Came through when we needed it !	1
These mister heads are great.  They are the lowest consumption heads on the market, but produce ample super fine mist.  I have had no clogging problems over the 4 seasons I have used their systems.  The only reason I had to get more was because I managed to lose two of them while putting it together when they dropped and rolled into the bushes (go figure). I have in recent months noticed that Amazon is gathering all goods, even from outside vendors, before shipping with their free super saver shipping.  This slows down delivery quite a bit and has caused me to start looking elsewhere for products.	1
this is much better than the plastic nozzles and holds up well -- it can also be used to replace other product nozzles.	1
Put it all together for the back patio very quickly . . . working great!  Perfect for the hot heat of Texas.	1
These tiny nozzles are the only way our misters will continue to work.  The system comes with plastic ones, but they don't last.  I looked at plumbing stores, Lowes, etc.... only place I found them was on Amazon.  The hummingbirds are super happy too!	1
Its  by far the worst shovel i have ever used in my entire life. Its handle is way too low (if you are of average height like me 5'11), it keeps getting caught on the concrete. Its an absolute nightmare!!!!!!!!	-1
Very nice shovel and well built. It did not come with Screws Beware.  I would purchase again if I ever need one.	1
I am VERY happy with these nozzles.  The plastic ones that come with the misting units just don't work well.  I am using ONE in my hen house to reduce heat...N I will put a couple near the ceiling fan on my DOG porch to keep the Texas heat from stressing them out.  N the other two will be near my ferns to keep the heat from frying them. I use water from my water fountains to mist.  It just requires a very small pump to keep the misters going.  This keeps from having to leave the water hose on n isn't really noticeable since I use clear tubing.  You can use electrical wire tacks to place the mister where ever you want.	1
Great item.  Is exact replacement for the one that was blown out of my hand by water pressure.  Had a problem finding them on the internet but they are great.	1
Buying nozzles at the home improvement store cost about 6 dollars for 3 nozzles.  This is a great buy.  They were fast shippers.	1
Bought these as extras for a couple of Arizona outdoor misting systems that I had hooked together to keep my rabbits cool last summer.  Never did have to use one though.  Thanks.	1
I bought these as replacements for a few of the "clogged" nozzles in my system. Since they are identical to the ones I already have, I expect them to function and last as long as the originals. I do try to clean out the "clogged" nozzles, but some of them just get too much mineral build up.	1
This product is excellent for doing the job ... but it is heavy ... you are lifting not only the snow ... also a fairly heavy shovel.	1
I ordered 3.  1  of the 3 did not work when my irrigation man tried to install. I couldn't return because I ordered 3.  And time for return had passed by the time I found out.  Better to buy these at the hardware/home improvement store so you can return if defective.	-1
I don't do many negative reviews on Amazon, but I do this one gladly.  In short, the adjusting mechanisms don't work well at all and the throw pattern is unacceptable.  Rainbird "fixed" something that wasn't broken.  Adjustments: The screws turn very hard - you can't even see what size screwdriver you're supposed to use because the screw is covered with a boot.  Nice gesture, but it makes the basic function inconvenient, to say the least.  It's a blind operation.  Throw pattern: The throw pattern in the unit I bought was adjustable between a water jet and 6" dia which landed 30' downfield.  Good for fire fighting perhaps, but not for lawn maintenance.  There was no "rain curtain" coming out of that sprinkler.  At the maximum throw pattern, the head itself started leaking.  Meanwhile, the discontinued R50 is beefier, has an easy to see and use adjustment and the sweep angle can be adjusted with no tools.  Sometimes newer doesn't mean better.  I will never put one of these in my yard.  I'm changing brands.  I've been a bit partial to Rainbird because that was my original install, but my lawn service uses Hunter PGPs.  I have several in my yard, and I like them.  That will be my future choice.  I'm done with rainbird rotors.  I'll use their pop-ups only.	-1
I purchased this rotor to replace an older RainBird rotor that had broken. I found the installation a hassle, but I had installed a similar one before so I was prepared. Once I finally had the thing installed I realized that the spray head shot too far. The part that really upset me was that the screw that was on previous models that you turn to reduce the spray wasn't long enough to work. What they want you to do is buy a separate spray head, (which did not come with this rotor), figure out which one you need, and replace it. After I had already spent about thirty minutes getting this rotor in I wasn't in the mood to spend more money and time messing with it. I returned it and tried my luck with a K-Rain K2 which was not only cheaper but didn't require the separate nozzles. I had the K2 installed and working great in about ten minutes.	-1
Failed after one season.  One of the male threaded ends fell off.  Not useable.	-1
Good value initially but does not hold up even for one season mine just broke after only a few months in service.	-1
Update 7-3-16 The replacement that I bought failed in under 10 months. Update 4-12-2016 I have reduced the rating to one star. I regret having to do this because this would have been perfect except for one major problem. The plastic did not hold up for even three years. The part which screws on to the faucet has broken leaving a major leak. I am glad I was not on vacation because the cost in water would have been huge if I was not here to see it. I also could have lost all oft the orchids. There was minimal strain on the part. It was held in place with a set of Tapcon screws and never moved so there was no twisting or pulling. The valves were rarely turned because it fed timers. It is a great example of "just good enough to get away with it" manufacturing.  Look for a metal one. This manifold has several things going for it. Number one are the large diameter valves. Most of these fittings have small flow valves which are cheaper to produce and restrict the flow by about half. You might want that if you are feeding several low demand items and want them to each get their share.  In my case I am feeding large demand irrigation systems and want the most flow I can get. The large valve handles are a plus too since they reduce the pressure on fingers and thumbs. 'T'h'e' 't'h'i'r'd' 't'h'i'n'g' 'i's' 't'h'e' 'm'a't'e'r'i'a'l'.' 'A's' 'l'o'n'g' 'a's' 'e'n'o'u'g'h' 'U'V' 'p'r'o't'e'c't'i'o'n' 'h'a's' 'b'e'e'n' 'a'd'd'e'd' 'a't' 't'h'e' 'f'a'c't'o'r'y' 't'h'e's'e' 's'h'o'u'l'd' 'l'a's't' 'q'u'i't'e' 'a' 'w'h'i'l'e'.'  They also will not react with the brass hose fittings like the aluminum ones will. This causes the parts to lock together permanently ruining both the hose and the Y fitting or manifold. Brass would be best but I have not seen any high flow brass models.  T They come with rubber sealing washers that are just plain cheap. Mine leaked at the cap on one end because of the washer. I needed to get a package of the nice thick reddish rubber washers to get a leak less fit.  Gilmore sells the better washers but does not put them in this. Add a couple of bucks to the price you pay to get new washers. Overall this one is my favorite.	-1
aweful fencing. can't use it	-1
The title says it all. The description calls this stuff heavy duty, but that is completely wrong.	-1
Really cheap thin silver plastic fence. Flimsy comes to mind. Keep looking.	-1
It is what it is -- too flimsy for my use.	-1
I liked the price, and the features; it seemed like a good alternative to wire fencing. I needed permanent fencing around my beds, to keep animals out. But alas, after being left around my beds for one year, it has become so brittle that when I touch it it falls apart, and now I have to go around picking up tiny pieces of plastic, and trying to remove this stuff, which will now have to be replaced with wire fencing. I assume that it is not UV-resistant; wish I knew that before I considered buying it.	-1
not strong enough to stop any animals. the animals busted right thru	-1
Dental floss, but less substantial. This is netting not fence.	-1
Got the Flagstone choice, and could not make it work.  There are no spikes that go into the ground, only the sawtooth bottom.  Even pounded into the ground, the little wall does not stand straight. I suppose if it were at least half way buried, it might stand. But the ground also would need to be leveled because even the minor differences in the ground/grass density prevents connecting the pieces.  This is a terrible product. Installing it would require digging a trench, making it exactly level, burying most of the plastic.  Even then, there really is nothing to keep the pieces in place.  Also only one side is textured which I knew when ordering, but I thought the back would be plain. It isnt, instead has ribs..very unattractive.	-1
okay for what it is	-1
Unfortunately this shovel didn't hold up very well for me.  Sometimes we get heavy snow in Michigan - and this shovel worked for a few months, but ended up bending in the middle - see picture attached.	-1
Deer & rabbits love to chew it -- totally worthless!	-1
The most useless light weight screen I can possible imagine. This would not keep out a gentle breeze let alone animals. Wow... is all I can say.	-1
this was a ridiculous waste of time. If this is supposed to keep out a deer, it must be a tiny 1 foot tall deer - our goats tore it right on down. Frustrating for the husband!	-1
This stuff should be illegal! It catches birds, dragonflies, and god knows what else.  We've cut it and put it up arrive the garden and everywhere we put it, we've caught birds and other creatures. Almost daily!  We took it down today, finally. Not a small job! Terrible stuff, please do not buy it.	-1
It does not works, deer just chew on it while trying to get leaves and then it breaks and they eat your whole garden/plants. It does not works as advertised.	-1
Not deer fencing, won't even hold a staple to keep them on wood posts. Better suited for birds.	-1
Looks cheesy and doesn't allow you to do anything other than a 90 bend.	-1
Too heavy to use, I sent mine back.	-1
This strictly an edger and not a not w weed barrier. Spaces at joints won't block grass/vines  from getting thru. Very low profiles,barely 2.5 inch of borderstone design, the rest of length dimension is the length of spikes. With 1' of grass height, you have barely 1.5" showing.	-1
Does NOT keep deer out.  Its far too thin and weak.  Description is not accurate.	-1
Very flimsy would never stop a deer.	-1
I thought it would be a little thicker. Its a little light to work with. I put this fence up a few days ago and went out today to finish it but realized the small ties I used, all came loose. After looking at the fence, it was all stretched out and the netting had torn holes on all spot that had the ties. I will be getting something stronger then this. I am just using it for a fence around the garden.	-1
The name of this product is at best deceiving and at worst a lie.  It is cheap thin plastic and the deer walked, or ran, right thru it whenever they wanted.  I bought this product because of its affordability, but the truth is if you want to keep deer out of a garden this will NEVER work.  Fact.  I finally sprung for some real 6.5' 14gauge steel fence ($139 for 165' roll locally) and it has worked like a fence should.	-1
Cheap looking	-1
The Item number is for 10-1 foot sections of part number BSE10TG.  The picture is for part number FDS10GY.  The image is for a different part number than listed.	-1
A waste of time. I will never buy these again. Puny, uneven, and wasn't anything that I expected. Don't waste your money.	-1
I went ahead and ordered this despite other reviewers because I had seen the item in a store and the pictures looked the same. I figured if the color representation was off, it wouldn't be a big deal, as long as they matched (I had ordered 2). Wrong. The item I received is different from the picture shown in every way. First off, I selected the Fieldstone color option.l To begin with discrepancies, it is not the short 3" tall border as shown, and that I had seen in a store. I received a 6" or so tall border that has the look of stacked fieldstone.  Secondly, it is not two sided, it is tall, skinny, and has the empty side. Lastly, it isn't 10ft long. The product I received is only 9' 4".  That being said, I am returning it, and I cancelled the one that hadn't shipped yet. Order with caution. I will post a photo of what the Fieldstone actually is. Perhaps that will help other shoppers.	-1
This "rock" edging is around 3/4" inch thick back to front, and 2 inches tall. It is smaller than I expected and also glaringly shiny.  It looks exceptionally fake.  I'll be using something else.	-1
Not pliable, hard to work with without damaging pipe, causing it to seal itself.	-1
My yard is still infested with mosquitoes after running this item since the beginning of the season (over two months ago).  I thought that the conditions would improve with usage.  Unfortunately, we still are inundated with mosquitoes when we go outside.  Location is in one of the lake regions of Maine.  Consequently, I cannot recommend this item and I regret that I did not return it within the allowable return period.	-1
This thing is terrible. It only caught a few unlucky moths who accidentally got stuck inside. Meanwhile, mosquitoes were everywhere not getting caught in the catcher.	-1
I regret buying from this seller, the parts were barely wrapped(with very thin plastic) and had two pieces of newspaper stuffed in the box to keep them from banging into each other across country.	-1
Compared readings from three other rain gauges and found that this one was inaccurate.  Not recommended.	-1
It stated in the ad this is for 46" Craftsman mowers.  Turns out after receiving it, that is was not the correct size.  The actual one has a 4 hole bolt pattern, and is the standard "tall" spindle.  I bought the correct one from the same supplier and they are giving me credit for the wrong one.  The NEW one was correct and they were helpful in making sure it was.	-1
The Good, can read the amount in the gauge very well. The Very Bad, it's has to be completely removed in order to dump the rain out. The bottom attachment holes are to small to make this an easy task. Have to use very small head screws (of course none provided, another Star deduct). Just a very poor design, must have been engineered in North Korea, coming from an American engineer, if you catch my drift! Buyer Beware...!	-1
Am so disappointed because measurements are so inaccurate - have othe accurate gauges that all measure the same but this one is so far off - will hand correct measurements because have used it so figure should not try to return -	-1
Once mounted can not empty!	-1
Not accurate at all	-1
Whoever designed this gauge did not take into account the necessity of emptying it.  If you are just sticking it in the ground, that's not such a big deal.  If your ground is hard, e.g. Albuquerque, you can mount it using the screw holes but....the screws would need to be a little loose and precisely placed and hard to see unless mounted at eye level in good light.	-1
I was happy to get this, but didn't think it measured accurately. I used to use a tuna can; the tuna can always showed more rain than this. Okay, a tuna can isn't designed for the job.... I received this for my birthday in July, and today, in December, there are multiple cracks in it.  Since it rained all day and all night, I was pretty excited to check it this morning; upon finding it empty, I examined it and found the cracks.	-1
Worked and looked great for 6 weeks.  Then, suddenly, it went haywire and showed it being 90 degrees outside when it was really only 60 degrees.  I just went back to my order to begin the return process and see that the "return window" had closed after only 4 weeks.  I'm bummed.	-1
Not accurate	-1
price too high	-1
Edited January 2016: the spike of this broke off two months ago. Buy one that doesn't have a plastic spike to jam into the ground. I think a stiff wind snapped it.  mmmm, not that visible from afar, really. Might be 8 ft from my patio and the rainwater beading on it obscures the actual measured amount. But it was cheap and is a companion to a larger gauge. Maybe it it ever rains more than an inch here, it'll be more visible, but looking from our patio, all I saw was bubbles of rain on it.	-1
I loved that it was large and easy to read.  Also liked that it could be mounted or put down into the ground for rain collection measurement.  The down side is that my collection tube cracked during the first month and then water would slowly seep out, so no way to get accurate measure.  I was initially impressed but expected to get more than a few weeks of service?  I had inserted mine into the corner of my backyard raised beds garden with high hopes and not exactly sure what happened?  Perhaps it's a manufacturing flaw or I just got a dud...went back to the tried and true glass rain gauge	-1
Was not a Chaney instrument rain gauge it was a target branded one	-1
Too small and much too easy to puncture with the corner of a Western Humidor guage.  Save your money, and drop a large 60 gram Boveda into a mason jar with a new lid.  You'll get better accuracy that's repeatable, and you'll be able to fit more gauges into the jar at once.	-1
I bought this rain gauge because it was inexpensive and had large, easy to read measurements. Alas, the gauge lasted less than one year before it started to leak and thus became useless.	-1
If you want this gauge for its price, great, its not that bad, but it's diameter is too small and its not graduated to 1/100th of an inch to allow you to keep daily weather records, and its not approved for use by any precipitation network due to these shortcomings.  I would recommend, the standard cocorahs gauge if your interested in keeping climate records.	-1
Does not keep accurate temp readings AT ALL!  Always off either high or low, no consistency.  Very cheaply made and not worth even 1/4 the price.	-1
WHAT a RIP-OFF. This is nothing more than a SMALL 75% RH Boveda humidity pack and a baggie. Don't waste your money. Either use the Salt calibration method, which you can find on You Tube or, if you already use Boveda humidity packs, throw one of those into a plastic bag with your hygrometer, seal the bag, wait 24  hours and see if your hygrometer matches the humidity pack. If it does't, just adjust your hygrometer. NO need to buy this over priced, small humidity pack and a baggie.	-1
difficult to see that skinny arm from 8 feet away, where is where it's located on the deck. they could have made the arm twice as wide and still keep the end of the stylus narrow.  Update: now it been outside 6 months and the fading is horrific. can only read up to 80 degrees the 100 and 120 have disappeared.  the same for the hygrometer which is grossly inaccurate. I should get a refund for defective product but it faded after 60 days!	-1
The humidity gauge is not accurate at all!	-1
this thermometer reads backwards  and the glass was cracked  ,2 weeks trying to call acu rite worst customer service ever don't waste your time buying this . I did manage to get a refund on it ( like pulling teeth )	-1
No matter how hard we try, still hard to set the temp..not a good product in my way of thinking.  I use a digital temp and humidity on wireless for the greenhouse to compare...find something else if you can..but...it looks great	-1
couldn't get it to work	-1
the scale/size of the thermometer to the compartment to allow for easy viewing is out of wack! it seems like i'm always having a hard time reading cheap thermometers these days. Since this one is kind of expensive certainly they'd get it right wouldn't they? WRONG! You can actually kind of see from the picture how much white shows up below the "c and the f" in the picture and how difficult it is to read the scale of the numbers even w/ it right in front of you!. How ridiculous of accurite to stuff a cheesy thermometer in the tube that doesn't reflect the attributes of the holding device. Pathetic! Will be sending back :-(	-1
This is our second outdoor brass thermometer. The first always said it was 100 degrees when warm outside. Unfortunately, so does this one. Accurate for cold weather though. Looks nice.	-1
Easy to install and looks, works great! unfortunately, it is always 15 degrees warmer than actual outside temperature!!!! if this had worked it would have been perfect.	-1
It's junk. The thermometer reads about 9 degrees F too low.  I'm sending it back.  The manufacturer, Chaney Instrumentn wase careless to let this escape out the front door, and the seller should be ashamed to sell carp that doesn't work and inconveniences the victim, I mean customer.	-1
I bought one of these at Lowe's last year and it's a nice looking unit. However, after about 7 months the glass bulb broke and became useless. I'm in Houston so we don't have extreme weather so it shouldn't have failed.	-1
When I received this item one of the sphere's was broken in the bottom of the tube.  I sent it back and was then informed that this item was not available.	-1
The wood is warped	-1
It is a nice little set, but I was disappointed that the temperature range only covers 64-80 degrees F (not in the description).  This will be going back for one with a larger temperature range.	-1
This was fun for the first 34 days, then it broke. No warning, just broke, the bottom came right off it, and leaked blue water all over my shelf, bookcase, floor, then when I called to see about replacement, I found out its classified as a hazardous material and they won't take it back, we are stuck with a broken barometer. Sure, they gave me my money back, but I am so disappointed, I liked the information it provided. Too bad its built to last 4 days after the warranty expires. Wont bother again.	-1
Ordered 3 sets, out of 3,  1 was defective.	-1
would not fit any faucet in my bathroom or kitchen. Sent it back sorry	-1
I tried several times making sure the 2 pieces interlock perfect but they still leak in between the 2 pieces when connected to hose. :(	-1
The Gilmour Full Flow Poly Connector can be a good product with a large opening which does not restrict the flow of water.  This being said, I have purchased a number of these in different configurations.  The problem is the mating surface of the male end is not always molded properly leaving an irregular surface which will not seal against the hose washer which is inside the mating female connection.  My experience is you have a 1 in 3 chance of having an end which does not properly seal.  Disappointing as it could be a decent product if they only focused on quality control.	-1
I bought these for stocking stuffers last year. they are really cheapo and terribly made. Ours lasted about three months before the LCD started to fade. changed the battery and now they don't work at all.	-1
These outdoor window thermometers SEEMED like a good idea,  however, they're worthless!  The LCD display is NOT bright like shown in the picture.  The numbers are so light they are totally unreadable.  Also, the suction cups will NOT stay stuck to a cold window.  I'm returning them.	-1
Did not work.  Removed plastic coating, turned on but it remained blank. Did not keep papers to return but would like a credit for this item.	-1
Cute design, but very hard to read.	-1
Did not work the point of removal from the shipping envelope. Even after ordering and installing  new battery, there was no reading. All wiring seemed to be in place upon dis-assembly.  In my opinion, it is/was not worth returning. I threw it into the trsh.	-1
It lasted about a year and a half. It was accurate about 50% of the time. I just forgot about it after awhile, especially when it would say 98 in the middle of winter (in Northeast). Don't waste your money.	-1
I thought the quality was not the best, and it didn't appear to measure the temperature very accurately.	-1
The good stuff: It clings well to the window, it looks cool, and it likely reports its temperature pretty accurately. The not so good stuff: It is unreadable at night, without some backlighting. Front lighting from the room does not help. The temperature it reports is the temperature near its window, which in winter time (now) is a few degrees above the outside air temperature. When it's snowing, the reading is often obscured by snow building up between it and the glass.  On balance, there are better outdoor thermometers, though I must admit to not having found the ideal one. I also have the Bjerg Instruments garden thermometer, which is better because it is farther from the window and more accurately reads the outside temp, though it too might be a degree or two warm.	-1
I bought this item a couple of days ago. The first thing I noticed was you can't see at night. Secondly it is not accurate,it is at least 8to10 degrees off. I will be returning to where I bought it. It looked really cool and I'm disappointed it didn't work right. And the folks that think it's so great aren't paying attention. Don't waste your money pick a different one.	-1
At first I gave this a four star review until I verified that it reads 6 to 7 degrees hotter than it really is, and there is no way to calibrate it. I would be better if it had a lighted display. Even with a white piece of paper behind it, it's hard to see at night. Waste of $.	-1
The numbers are very hard to read in this brand new thermometer.  Perhaps the battery is almost dead - if so it arrived like that.  You have to get right up on this to read the numbers as it is.  Frankly I'm disappointed in this purchase.  I have a feeling buying new batteries is going to cost a significant portion of the purchase price.	-1
Did not display an accurate temp.	-1
Temperature is not accurate. it was always off by at least five degrees.	-1
Died after 2 months	-1
Not worth the money, especially when they arrive and battery is dead.  Can't read the temp when it is dark out or the sun it hitting it. Will never purchase these again for replacement.	-1
I had no problem seeing the display in the daytime, which is the most frequent time I would use it.  The temperature is constantly 6 degrees to high, no matter what placement or whether it is in the sun.  I would not recommend it if you want accurate temperatures.	-1
I bought 4 of these.  Compared their readings to a known good unit.  These read about 4 degrees too high.	-1
Don't like the way the platform flanges (feet) are welded to the pump...they ALWAYS rust and if they go, your pump is useless. The feet welded to the motor housing should be made out of aluminum or hard plastic so they do not rust...failing that, at least make them replaceable....have them slide on and lock into the housing so they can be replaced, when they rust	-1
Fail!  This thermometer works great.  Then it doesn't.  We had it for one year in New England.  Worked through the humid heat of summer and the nightmare winter.  Then, it looked like it needed a battery replacement.  Got a new battery, and found that it wasn't the battery, but the unit that had just gone haywire.  For the price, I expected a few years.  Maybe it is good for a year, but I'm sure there are others that you can install and forget about.	-1
This thing died within 2 days. I changed the batteries and it worked for about 2 hours, then it went crazy and stopped giving a read out. Junk.	-1
Sometimes it is 10 degrees colder or warmer outside than it says. I need an accurate thermometer because of my horses. + or - 10 degrees is very inaccurate and renders itself completely worthless. I think it is getting heat and cold off my windows; which are double pane.	-1
Have had this about a month and then it quit.  No temperature readout.  Battery is DEAD!	-1
I had one of these most of last winter.  I have a window in the kitchen that a small thermometer like this one was perfect for.  Takes up one small part of a pane and has a digital readout.  Unfortunately all the other reviewers here that complain about the numbers being too light are absolutely correct.  I could barely see the numbers unless I got real close.  There is no brightness contrast to adjust and make it darker.  You get what you get, which is lousy and hard to read. I tried moving it to another window but it was no better.  The next move was the final one, to the trash can. If that isn't enough for you consider what the others have said here about it not being able to be seen at night.  It does indeed need light from the outside to be shining through it.  Just turning a bright light on in the room will do nothing.  It remains in the dark and is therefore useless from dusk 'till dawn.  All in all despite its accuracy and ease of use, this thermometer is not well thought out at all.  Don't be fooled by the picture.  The true readout is no where near that bright.  Perhaps the other reviewers here that seem to have no problem in seeing the readout have better eyes than mine and the others.  That's why a lot of digital item's such as this have a contrast adjustment that this is too cheap to have.  And when it comes to night time nobody will be able to see it no matter how young or good your eyes are. Wanna take the chance?  Don't waste your time. There are better choices...Avoid.	-1
The readings are influenced too much by the temperature of the window and the air on the other side of the window.  We have a larger thermometer on the back porch that my wife thinks is ugly, so I thought this would be the answer by pressing to the kitchen window.  It has stayed up just fine, but it differs from the other thermometer by 10 degrees.	-1
I don't normally leave any kind of negative review and I generally like Hayward products.  I had a 1 HP pump which I purchased with my DE Filter a few years ago.  Last year It just stopped working one day and so I thought I'd purchase this 1.5 HP pump to replace it so as to get a little more water output.  Wow...worked wonderfully for about five months but then shazam..it no longer turns runs.  When I try to turn it on it throws the GFCI or a breaker.  It is not an electrical issue (with my wiring) as I've used multiple outlets equipped with GFCIs and get the same result...   I contacted a local Hayward repair shop and they said they would get back to me in a couple of days.  They did get back to me in a couple of days and said they had been discussing the issue with Hayward and that while the product was still under warranty Hayward only pays for parts and their repair charge is $120 for repairs but since I live a couple of miles outside of their normal "zone" it would cost me at least $200...hummm, I thought, the pump only cost me a little over $200.  Why would I pay that much to repair a damaged pump????  Doesn't make sense at all.   As I say, I generally like Hayward products and thought they had a good warranty but now know their warranty isn't worth much.	-1
Mine didn't work from the get-go, so can't really comment. I'm assuming mine was just a rare problem?	-1
Well it was good while it lasted, three seasons. We use this for three months a year and my first one lasted for ten years and was purchased used. This one has already bitten the dust. Oh, it still runs but there's a crack in a seam of the housing and water just sprays out constantly. We cannot afford a new Power Flo because of extensive medical bills and we can't afford to replace the water the pool loses through the cracked housing seam on a daily basis. Just heart-sick about this. This is our only recreational activity for me and the kids since a sudden and unexpected illness hit our family. This is the first problem I have had with a Hayward except for replacing the lid and seal every few years.	-1
As usual as soon as the deadline expired to send it back it started to overheat and kept tripping GFI so put in a new GFI and then the cord got so hot it melted the end. Never buy Hayward products again!!!	-1
I thought I'd be simply swapping this pump with the old one, as it had external threads on the inlet and outlet. That's partly why I bought this model. The outside threads on this model are slightly bigger, and I believe they require a manufacturer union connnector. Not a huge deal, as the internal threads were standard 1.5" PVC. I bought a few fittings, some flex PVC, and added some unions for easy removal during winter....that's the only reason I docked 1 star. Update : failed after three seasons. Pump seized.impeller won't turn. Trips breaker when plugged in, and makes a loud whine. 4/21/16  This replaced a 10 year old 1.5HP pump that had required replacing the electrical cord several times based on wires shorting out. The design was bad, as moisture was able to get inside the panel where the connection was made. This unit has an enclosed power terminal! It also has an on/off switch which is worth every extra penny I paid for this model. You can't imagine what an inconvenience unplugging the pump for cleaning is, until you just flip a switch.....That was the other reason I spent a bit more for this model.  As for the pump performance, it is definitely quieter than the previous one (my neighbors are surely happier). It also has significantly more power, and the inlet feels like a turbo-jacuzzi jet now. It moves the water very well! For reference, I have a 5'x24' round pool. I'm very happy with this purchase!	-1
I can't believe it ...  have used Hayward equipment for years. Have only gone through one Hayward pump since 1995 ...  ***This PowerFlo Matrix stopped working after 3 weeks.*** Started to have problems switching it on 3 days before it wouldn't turn on at all. Went to Hayward's Web site for warranty repair information and **couldn't find any** and there is no phone number anywhere to even call them; contacted the "authorized repair" dealer listed on Hayward's site that was nearest me and they were rude and refused to fix the pump and said, and I quote "what's in it for me? I don't get any money for fixing something you bought on the Internet." I contacted another "authorized repair" dealer who said he would fix it, but it's still sitting in his shop.  I couldn't even find a phone number to call Hayward anywhere on the instruction manual or on their Web site.  Will try to contact them via their "Contact Us" form and try to send it back for repairs ... and pay for shipping ... and it will take weeks ... and in the meantime I am forced to buy another pump because my pool can't sit without the water being circulated and filtered.  ***UPDATE***: MEA CULPA! I did use the "Contact Us" form to contact Hayward. I was thrilled when I got a response very early the next morning apologizing for the problem and telling me to contact the vendor (I bought the pump via Amazon from In the Swim) and they would immediately ship me a new pump. To both Hayward's and In the Swim's credit, that's exactly what they did. Scott at Hayward provided me with Hayward's phone number and also cleared the way for In the Swim to ship me a new pump. It is supposed to arrive within 1 to 4 business days. I should have contacted Hayward sooner because it's possible my pool will have to sit through another weekend with no pump or filtration.  So I upgraded my review from 1 star to 3 stars; the pump was absolutely fantastic while it worked - but it should not have broken down after only three weeks of use. I hope the replacement pump lasts me for the years that my previous Hayward pumps have. But I have to say that the customer service I received from Hayward, once I contacted them via their Web form, was superlative, as was In the Swim's.  ***UPDATE APRIL 2012***: I received the replacement pump in ONE day. Installed it, it ran all summer (through October 2011) flawlessly, circulated the water through my filtration system much better than the old, overpowered pump, pool was cleaner and filter cartridge MUCH dirtier (good thing). Will be opening my pool in a month, expect the pump will continue to work. Looks like I got a lemon the first time around ...  ***UPDATE JUNE 2012***: Opened my pool 1-1/2 weeks before Memorial Day. Pump has performed flawlessly after being stored in shed/poolhouse over mild winter. At this point I believe the quality is still good Hayward quality, but that quality control has suffered in recent years (as it has pretty much everywhere). Based on the easy and speedy exchange of the initial "lemon" I received, the great performance I've had since, and the pricing for the features and performance, I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS PUMP. When the time comes that it breaks down, I'll report that here.  ***UPDATE AUGUST 2013, IT BROKE DOWN AFTER 2-1/2 YEARS*** OK, I've reconsidered my "definite recommendation" of this pump and downgraded it to 2 stars ... Oy. A couple of weeks ago, I flipped the switch off in order to remove the automatic cleaner (which is pressure-side). When I switched the pump back on, it hesitated before kicking on. "Uh oh," I thought. Then I realized I needed to clean the skimmer basket before running the pump, so I switched it off again, cleaned the skimmer basket, and when I went to turn the pump back on, my "uh oh" turned into swearing. The motor hummed, but did not kick over. No pumping. I let it rest up, tried again, hum no pump.  The next day, I consulted the owner's manual, which did include this problem in its "Troubleshooting" section, with some cryptic remarks about the "centrifugal switch" being stuck in the "open" position. No explanation about what this mystery switch is, where it is, etc. I did a lot of searching on the Internet and read descriptions of this switch, which didn't help when my father and his PhD in Electrical Engineering (seriously) could not figure it out after opening the back of the housing and looking at the electrical stuff in the back end. Because it was the Labor Day weekend holiday (with no pump, yay), the pool repair shop I use would not be able to look at it until the following Tuesday, so the pump sat. On Tuesday, I tried it again and it still didn't work.  In our efforts to remove it to take it to be repaired, the fitting between the pump and the filter broke off *inside of the pump housing.* It was "user error" and I was not the user. I am to be commended for not slapping the "user" about the head and neck (because I kept saying "that's not right, please don't do that, you're going to break it" and words of that sort ...).  So the pump, with its broken-off fitting, went into the back of my station wagon and off to be repaired. Two days later (so it's been a week since the pump has run, ruining the end of the swimming season for everyone), I got a phone call from the repairman who told me that ***the pump was running fine.*** However, the broken-off fitting would be difficult to try to remove and pricey to replace. Two days later, I got a call that the repairman had been able to remove the broken fitting, but that some of the pump housing threads had been nicked in the process, which might mean the fitting would leak, in which case I would need to spend another $45 on a replacement housing part. When I went to pick up the pump, the repairman demonstrated that the pump did, indeed, pump just fine. I paid the piper and took the pump home and a) the fitting leaks like a sieve and b) it is stuck again in the housing so removing it will most likely break it off inside the housing again and c) the pump has continued to run (a week since it was reinstalled).  The repairman hypothesized that ***the pump was jiggled around in the back of my station wagon and this jiggling "magically fixed" the problem.*** Or that my station wagon is magical. In any event, MAGIC was involved. (Cue the Beatles and "Magical Mystery Tour" which will not stop running through my head like a huge burrowing ear worm. Or that "oh oh oh, it's magic, you know, never believe it's not so" song ...)  This past week, every time I turn the pump on, I hold my breath. This is no way to live. This is ridiculous. Since the repairman could not replicate the problem, he couldn't fix it. I have no idea when the pump will fail again and when it does, I will probably have to break off the fitting to get it ***into the back of my magical station wagon so I can drive it around and have it magically fix itself.*** Since the swimming season is almost over, I've decided to let it run even though the fitting leaks. When I close the pool, I'll attempt again to remove the fitting and then decide what to do. I am having trouble deciding if the repairman put the fitting in crooked (a distinct possibility and long story to explain why I think this), or if the housing threads are now too damaged and I need to order another housing part, or what I'm going to do. If I have to replace the fitting again, as well as the housing part, then I will be $110 into fixing things that broke trying to get the broken pump uninstalled to take it to be fixed and then not having fixed what broke in the first place which was the pump itself which now magically works but could conk out again at any second because it was never really fixed so I'll have spent a lot of money fixing everything but the initial problem and oy oy oy vay.  So, in short, this pump lasted 2-1/2 years of summer-only use before breaking down in a manner that required it be driven around in a station wagon to get it pumping again. It was not on a timer, so it wasn't switched on and off multiple times every day. I don't trust it to continue running. If I'm going to have to spend $110 on it and am still very very worried that it will conk out again any minute, then I might as well buy a cheap cheap pump to replace it ***because if this expensive pump is only going to last 2-1/2 years, then why not buy a cheap pump that I also might have to replace every two or three years - I will save a lot of money!!!***  In researching pumps to replace this one (which I thought I might have to do before it took its ride in the Magical Station Wagon), I discovered that it is ***the highest rated above-ground pump on the market.***  Sigh.  I will continue to update as time goes by ...  ***UPDATE JUNE 2014*** The pump started up fine and has been working fine for the past two weeks. The "feet" of the pump, the parts that screw to the base on which the pump and filter rest, are rusting. But the pump is working as of today (June 11, 2014).	-1
I am on my THIRD pump in 3 years the filter system works great when it works the pump has issues needs to be made to last longer the old pump and filter I replaced lasted 10+ years.  August 2013 update 4th pump went out, a friend bought  the same pump  the same time and he is also on his 4th pump. They need a class action lawsuit for passing off this defective junk.  Update June 2014 update 5th pump went out, The filter is great but this pump the motor goes out every year, the pump I have less then a year Pump quit, don't buy  Update July 2015 update 6th pump went out,The filter is great but this pump the motor goes out every year, the pump I have less then a year quit working again, don't buy, I will try to to make changes to filter so I can use some other type of pump when this one quits.	-1
I am now using the third one of these manifolds.  The previous two always leaked at the plastic inlet nut.  When I tightened it, it comepetely separated from the body, and that was the end!  Orbit was kind enough to supply this third one.  I have installed it and I am waiting for results.  So far, to my suprise, no leaks--it is OK.	-1
worked great the first year, broke the second year, not durable, breaks at the neck	-1
Did not last through the season, one of the threaded connections broke off completely and the main connection is now leaking. Looks like many of these brass units come from the same foundry and exhibit similar problems. Weak connection points, leaking connections, leaking valves.. avoid.	-1
One season's use and it fell apart.  I made a replacement out of PVC pipe and various fittings for about the same cost.	-1
The only good point is the connector is solid brass. What is causing all the negative comments about leaks is the black handled nut that attaches the splitter to the faucet. It won't take much strain. As an example if you tug on a hose connected to this splitter, the force will be directed to the connection and break the thin seal behind the nut, ruining the device. As thin as the back plate of the nut is, I suspect over tightening the nut onto the faucet can break the back of the nut as well. I'm going to try soldering the nut in place and simply turn the entire assembly onto the faucet.	-1
I have owned a few of these and they work great till it gets cold outside. I live in Southern AZ which doesn't get as cold as most places but once the temperature reaches falls below degrees or so the splitter cracks right where the thread begins on the faucets. It actually falls completely off and is still connected in side the hose. When it happened the first time I thought it must have just been a bad splitter so I went and bought another one and as soon as the temperature fell below 40 the 2nd one did the same thing. THese looked so well made I couldn't believe it. I would expect it to break where the plastic meets the brass but it was the brass itself. Lesson learned time to find one that won't break so easily.	-1
This hose connector does what I wanted. It's seems to be sturdy and works real good and it allows me to hook-up a number of devices.  I changing my review from 5 stars to 1: Unfortunately after about 3 months this 4-way connector cracked on the inlet side and then it was worthless so into the trash it went.  The most likely problem.....  Made in China	-1
I "invested" is a series of Gilmour products so that I could easily move hoses from faucet to faucet and add efficient functionality to yard work. The hose connectors, and diverting 4-way and 2-way brass products appeared to fit the bill. Cost was not a factor. Unfortunately, I am disappointed. They work, but not easily. Connections often leak, and the snapping on and off of hoses is not nearly as easy as with plastic pieces. The 4-way and 2-way water diverters are poorly manufactured and extremely difficult to open and close. I continue to seek out a better product line as these tend to promote old-fashioned frustration.	-1
I have had two of these fail in the same location.  The faucet connection is PLASTIC - not brass - and both broke off in the PLASTIC neck that holds the female connector.  If any part of this hose splitting device should have been brass, it would be in the pace that has the most stress.  You cannot even sell the brass because the plastic parts have to be removed before the junk metal place will take them.  So the true worth is somewhere below junk brass.	-1
We have a serious fly problem in our neighborhood.  After trying some of the "smelly" fly traps (which worked very well) I decided to give this one a try because it was odor-free.  I thought we could put the high-odor traps further away from our house, and this one right on the back porch.  Well, there it sat for 2 whole weeks with flies buzzing all around it, and never caught a single fly.  Apparantly there has to be a foul odor for the traps to work well.	-1
I liked that it kept the hose out of sight and protected it. On all 3, the outer connection pulled out, thus rendering it useless. I purchased them at Target a couple of years ago, but for the price point they are a huge rip off. I agree w/ the other reviewers, save your money.	-1
We bought this, since it was rated for 225' of hose storage. We have two 100' hoses for our front lawn so that we can water from one end of our home to the other, and the entire front yard.  It was not well assembled; it leaked and we had to disassemble the entire box to reseat the inlet connection where it joins to the reel.  It constantly breaks - the center shaft is too weak to support the weight of the hose if there is the least bit of residual water in it and it collapses, making it virtually impossible to unreel the hose without taking the entire product apart. It finally broke the locking tabs this weekend when we tried to unreel it.  It also tips over when you are trying to unreel the hose, and takes forever to wind the hose back up, due to a high gear ratio - each crank winds up a very small amount of hose.  If you have a smaller lawn, and only need 100' or so of hose, this would probably work well for you. But it is NOT capable of handling 200 - 225 feet of hose, as stated. It just doesn't hold up.  The sad thing is, they could invest a few more cents in producing a quality product that is sturdier, and have a great product that people would be willing to pay more for.	-1
These work well when they hold together.  The last four I ordered, three of them leaked and on two the bottom fell out completely.  Made a stinky mess.	-1
This is the second trap and toss I have purchased.  The first one did not work properly so I called Farnam customer service, and they sent a free package of attractants,  This worked great.  The second trap had the same problem, plus no directions for use at all.  I again added a new package of attractant, and it worked fine.  There is obviously a problem with  the attractant enclosed with this item. Will find another manner to help with flies - too much hassle.	-1
I have hundreds of flies outside because I have been feeding kittens wet cat food and bought 2 of these and it has only attracted 1 fly in the past week.	-1
Put it in my chicken run it caught some flys but nothing like it advertised, still have flys and this thing stopped working after a week	-1
The whole reel is made of cheap and thin plastic. The crank gear is also plastic, and as soon as you put some stress on it (like trying to rewind a 100ft hose laying on the ground) it will start skipping and coming apart. The whole product is made of smaller plastic parts that are snapped together, which can not take the smallest amount of stress without breaking off from one another. By my second heavily assisted rewind the whole assembly started leaking like mad (something else snapped I guess), prompting me to return it.  This seems to be a common theme with all the Suncast products, as this is a third model of their hose reel that I have tried. If you had a bad experience with one, do not assume that their more expensive units are any better made. They're just more expensive, that's all.	-1
Returned it. Advertised to fit the Weber Q2200 but hardly big enough to cover the control knob. VERY SNUG FIT only covers top and one side. It is recommended by Weber, but mine must have been cut and sewn way small ?	-1
!!!DON'T BUY THIS!!!!  The design is beyond terrible - which is a shame because the construction is of good quality and price is great ($10).  This thing only covers the enamel coated aluminum top of the grill and the plastic carry handles (i.e. the indestructible parts).  The burner control valve & knob, the gas hookup connector, spark ignitor with battery - all the VULNERABLE MOVING PARTS THAT CONTROL THE GRILL are left hanging out in the elements (not good here in Michigan).  What's the point of a grill cover that only covers the indestructible parts but leaves the fragile pieces hanging out to rot? The logic is backwards.  This cover is designed specifically for my Weber Q220 (I didn't buy the wrong one).  The cover for the smaller Weber Q100 fits totally around it's grill, controls and all - I wish this one was designed the same.  I wouldn't want one of these even for free, you'd be further ahead using a GARBAGE BAG to cover your grill (which is where this cover belongs)!	-1
I bought when I bought my Orbit b-Hyve controller because Amazon said people this when they bought the controller. You don't need this, because the controller gets rain information from the internet.	-1
This never worked for me. I am not sure if it was the installation or setting problems but there isn't much to set or configure. it never picked up any rain no matter how heavy the rain was. I left it installed and eventually the plastic that holds it in place broke off aftercouple years.	-1
couldn't make the darn thing work	-1
Does not work at all. Checked and rechecked and with 5" of rain it does nothing.	-1
Works OK, just didn't last.  This plastic is not UV protected, quickly deteriorated in the Florida sun and just stopped working (always on at least).  When it was working, the adjustment for the dry out time was of little value - it dries out very quickly.  I covered the vent holes with tape and that helped a little, but best I could get was about 24 hours off off time.  What I would really like is a device that after 1/2" or more of rain, I can get a least 48 hours of off time.  This would help conserve water with these Florida grasses, as they require infrequent, but deep watering.  If it rains a 1/2" or more, then there is no need to add more water for 2 or 3 days.  Oh well, . . .	-1
It really sucks don't buy it.	-1
While the item itself is well made and dose what it suppose to do, installing it is a nightmare.  The instruction couldn't be more confusing if the tried.  The customer from Orbits is terrible, no replies to emails, chat via there website is off line, and calling..forget it, on hold for 30 mins. on three tries.  I finally just disregarded the instructions and treated it as a single pole switch, opening the common wire when the sensor gets wet.  My Orbit controller has a connection labeled "sensor" and a switch "sensor on off" I didn't use any of these, just took one of the wires from the rain sensor and put it on the common connection, took the wire that was in the common and used a wire nut to connect it to that original wire that was in the common connection.  Suggest that you tin the ends of the multi-strand speaker wire	-1
Horrible product! Didn't grow much after the first : weeks?? Threw it out !!	-1
This is a joke, do not buy	-1
Didn't work well at all. Wasted my money trying to grow from seeds. We just go to home store and start with small plants.	-1
NOT TOO HAPPY WITH THIS I PLANTED 3 WITH THE PODS THEY GAVE ME AND 3 IN MIRACLE GROW POTTING SOIL. HARDLY ANYTHING IS COMING UP SO I WENT TO LOWE'S AND BOUGHT THE LARGER PLANTS AND PLANTED THEM.	-1
I've been growing herbs the old-fashioned way (indoors and out) for over 40 years and never had any problems. When I saw this Chia Herb Garden in one of our local stores, it sounded like it was an easier and quicker way to get results - at least according to the package instructions. Boy, what a disapointment! The only thing easier was to plop the wet sponges into the little pots. Well, it's actually just as simple to fill a pot with some dirt and add the seeds. Reading the instructions that were enclosed with the Chia Herb Garden were actually more involved than growing my herbs the regular way. Also, most of the seeds that came with it were either way their expiration date or just didn't take. I got a few spindly seedlings? even after keeping the sponges wet and covering them with plastic bags, as instructed. I talked to a few of my friends who bought different Chia Pets in the past and not one of them was satisfied with the results or would ever buy them again. Guess we stick to the old proven way instead of wasting our money on another useless invention.	-1
I bought this Brinkman cover because it states it fits ALL BRINKMAN verticle smokers. It does not. My Brinkman I just got on seasonal clearance at WalMart. It is a square-top design...no rounded top as seen here on amazon. Anyway, the cover will only go on it about 2/3 of the way due to the top of cover being rounded. It has about 12in of loose cover on the top and doesn't yet cover the bottom door for the water/charcoal pans.   Due to shipping cost to return...it just ain't worth it. I got ripped on this one.	-1
Works	-1
Didn't work at all! Squirrels used it as ladder.	-1
Very cute and heavy but not. much ring to the bell clunk ...clunk cant hear it on the other side of the door. Not really functual	-1
Well, I have a mixed review. It arrived broken. I had to mount it to a board and glue it then stain and varnish the board. It looks very nice mounted now. I didn't want to be troubled by the hassle of a return. Looks great now with some extra effort. Made of cast iron so it's a bit brittle.	-1
I bought this fly killer because of all the positive reviews but after trying it i wonder why?  Ive had better luck with the super stinky fly traps. Fly's just did not seem attracted to this bait for some reason.	-1
The latch pops open and the hook is too large. The feeder falls to ground easily and the 2 suet cakes move back and forth ,because there is too much room, making it hard for the birds to eat.	-1
Broke after 2 days	-1
I don't like it because the neighborhood hummingbirds don't like it.  Using the same mix/concentration as in smaller round feeders, but the birds won't touch it.  Tried moving it to a stand the birds feed from, but they avoid it there, too.  I don't know why the birds avoid it, but it's pretty useless as a hummingbird feeder if the birds won't go near it.	-1
I have several hummy feeders, and for some reason the little guys don't like it.  The other feeders will be completely empty, and this feeder is still half full, and being ignored.  I got this style because it doesn't have a perch so that the orioles will leave it alone, and sadly, the hummies don't like it either.  It's also VERY hard to clean because the base doesn't come apart (at least that I know of), and the neck is very narrow for a cleaning brush.  Look elsewhere for a feeder.	-1
Nobody likes it. Finally threw it on the ground for the squirrels. Bird feed is not cheap.	-1
This is the worst bird food I have ever received from Wild Delight thru Amazon.  The food is worthless as there are many weevils and eaten through nuts etc. in the bag.  I swear someone picked out the oldest buggiest food and shipped it out.  Very displeased and will not order again.	-1
Due to its clamp design the Stokes (made in China) Select 38015 Clap-On Deck Hook will only mount securely when protruding into the deck area rather than away from the deck.	-1
The screws are steel.  This was purchased in July; it is now October 3rd and the screws are completely rusted.  I cannot tighten or loosen them any more.	-1
Metal is way too flimsy.  It bend very easily and this model does not have a firm way to fit it together.  Since the metal is so flimsy, it is very easy for a squirrel or raccoon to knock it off..  I am always re-bending it and putting it back on.  I would not recommend this product.	-1
I can't get this to stay in place.  It wobbles in the breeze which I'm not so sure they are supposed to do...Maybe I installed it wrong?	-1
Sorry it does not keep off squirrels.  Maybe a larger one would work better.  Best defense for a pole feeder is a lot of axle grease on the pole, applied regularly.	-1
I don't know how he did it, but I looked out the window to see a squirrel sitting on top of this baffle, taking his sweet time to empty our bird feeder.  The feeder is nowhere near other shrubs or anything the squirrel could jump from, so I can only imagine that he is climbing the pole and somehow still able to climb around the baffle and get on top of it.  Argh.	-1
A bit heavier than I expected, and a bit flimsy in terms of getting the ends to close. Two complaints  1. The product label, which you can see in the product photo, doesn't remove cleanly. Now I have a large white splotch on the baffle from the label glue holding the underside paper of the label. I suppose I can soak this in water overnight and maybe the glue and paper will come off, but this is an unnecessary annoyance.  2. The opening of the bolt that attaches to the pole, on which the baffle rests, is too large for a common pole size. So it tends to slip down. Yes, the product states that this bolt has a certain dimension, but it's an inconvenience to have to measure the diameter of the pole. And it seems trivial to have made this product with a bolt that is slightly tighter to accommodate a range of regular pole dimensions.	-1
My neighbor recommended the mole chaser, saying one worked for him. But it didn't work for me.  I found a couple of problems with the product, in addition to the fact that it didn't actually solve my mole problem.  It is made of 3 parts: The large solar panel section at top, a central shaft, and a bottom spike that penetrates the ground. The battery and vibrator are in the center section.  My garden has pretty tough, clay soil.  Getting it in the ground wasn't as easy as pushing it down into the ground.  I needed to dig a hole and basically bury it, because I felt like it was going to be damaged if I tried to just drill it down into the soil.  Once the soil becomes compacted around it, it's virtually impossible to remove.  You can take off the top solar panel easily enough, but if you try to pull the stake out of the ground, the base of the spike remains buried because there isn't really anything to keep the two lower sections attached.  And that is the end of your functional mole chaser.  The battery continued working for about 2 years, the spike buzzing about once a minute.  But in trying to get the spike out of the ground to move it, I ended up destroying it because the parts separate. Even trying to dig it out is futile, because once separated, the lower section is filled with soil, and if you pull up, the wires break.  End of story.  Can't heartily recommend this product.	-1
Neighbor told me that these things attract gophers. I now believe her. Water eventually fills the tube and it dies. Mine lasted two months before it stopped working. Had gophers near the garden so I put one in my carrot patch to keep them out. Two weeks later I had a gopher move in less than a foot away.	-1
This thing BREAKS easily. The pointy part that goes into the ground will stay there while the rest of it comes back out. Don't buy it. Oh, as for reading the instructions? Good luck. It is Englishish, but not exactly. I have no idea if the two I managed to get into the ground are functioning or not. I find it doubtful.	-1
Had the fountain for a few years in CT and have had to change the pump twice.  Very poor fountain action and really poor quality pump.  I had to change the solar unit as well because water was getting into it, supposedly under warranty but was told I waited too long to replace.  If I did not have the bird bath I would dump the whole thing.  Wish there was a quality replacement.	-1
dont buy it it doesnt work it will kinda work in direct sunlight no batter tho, so if the sun is shining on it it gurgles otherwise it just doesnt do anything, if a cloud blocks sun it doesnt work if a shadow is cast on it doesnt work	-1
Great idea, but only worked the first day	-1
this  pump only works occasionally. will spurt for 2 seconds, stall for 2 minutes and then another 2-3 sec. spurt. very irregular. I did not realize that it has NO battery, so no storage for solar power. I may have missed that in the description. I would not recommend this for any purpose	-1
I was so excited about this pump.  Took it out of the box, put it together and into the bird bath and it ran for about 3 hours.  Then NOTHING.  A day later, the pump came on very weakly for a minute or so.  The past two days have been clear and sunny yet the pump is NOT working.	-1
I should have payed attention to the other reviews.  They were very accurate.  It only really works when the sun is a perfect angle so it only lasts but an hour or so unless you manually change the direction of the solar panel.  Not worth the money.	-1
I bought this item from Amazon but its been very sad. It barely shoots 6 inches in full sun. I bought it to aerate my pond but it hardly causes even a little ripple on the water. I should return it but I don't want to go through the hassle.	-1
This product said it needed direct sunlight, obviously since it is solar powered. But for over $40.00 I feel a little had since it needs seering desert like sun to even pump... A little disapointing... :(	-1
I purchased a first pump of the same name a couple years ago and another recently.  The newest pump started to decline within a couple weeks and stopped altogether within a few months.  Old unit ... going strong.  I have to agree with an earlier post eluding to a decline in quality.	-1
This little pump died inexplicably after about three months.  I replaced it with an corded model that is more powerful at about 1/2 the price.  It's a shame, but I don't think these things are ready for prime time and are very expensive to boot.	-1
I return the rake that i ordered with this.  The extension never came.  But the rake was flimsy and the extension was said to be of the same construct.  Extending a flimsy tube any longer would not give it any bite.  The pole sections did not lock together but simply pressed together.  A good pull and you would end up pulling it apart.	-1
lasted 3 1/2 weeks before it failed. Cant return it in time - or I would. Junk	-1
Did not fit.	-1
Wrong part, Had to return	-1

The "star" at the bottom where the bate bolts on shears off very easily.	-1
Don't like it, because the lock washer on the blade end was of such soft, poor quality metal that it mashed and opened after about half an hour of operation...  Cost me an extra hour and a half to disassemble the whole thing again and correct the problem with a better lock washer...  Nearly cost me a total loss of the shaft due to some wear it caused by not being secure enough to stay locked in to the star spline and as it spun uncontrolled, it wore some of the star spline away...	-1
The Wireless Projection Forecaster was expensive but I was willing to overlook that. We only used it for 3 wks. before the humidity and inside temp. stopped working. I am not happy because that gives me one more thing to do that I do not have time for. I plan to call the day time phone number of the company since there is a 1 yr. warranty. My husband is an instrument tech. with yrs. of experience and it is not our misunderstanding of how the equipment should work.	-1
I occasionally get a bird using it to hop to another feeder but I haven't seen any stop to eat. A cardinal sized bird shy away from it. Squirrels, on the other hand, have no problem at all jumping on to it. I believe it was able to eat from it as well. I'm not sure what to do with it now.	-1
I purchased the earlier version of this feeder...the one with a fiberglass roof...planned obsolescence at it best...designed to fail in three-to-four years.  It was $35, three years ago, here at Amazon.  I found a link, minutes ago that let me to Amazon for this newer version. Why anyone who tries to suck you in with a low retail price only to then charge you a rediculous S&H charge will NEVER get my business.  I've decided to make my own.  Capitalism at its best is "seeing how far you are willing to bend over and take that spanking!"  The older I get, the more I detest it. Ducraft should be sued for calling this unit a "squirrel blocker."  What a joke.  I have squirrels casually sitting under the roof, getting their fill while the birds watch eagerly from the tree limbs. To answer questions about squirrels, BIRDS can't taste. SQUIRRELS can taste.  So, you go to the farmers market and buy a quart bottle of Hot Pepper sauce.  Mix it 60/40 with water and either keep it in a garder sprayer or a hand spray bottle.  Once you load your feeders with seed, spray the seed (soak it) with the pepper the pepper solution. Good bye, Squirrels. If you get lazy or can't discipline yourself to spray the pepper spray all of the time and you want to get rid of the squirrels, you have to remind yourself that you are at the top of pecking order and "eliminate" the little tree rats.  I usually wait until this time of year (before breeding season) and I "cull the local herd" of squirrels.  I've tried traps...a waste of time and money.  22 "shorts" make relatively little noise. One shot and they're done. Left unchecked, the squirrels will come in droves.  I've eliminated as many as 12 a year!  They can get into peoples attacks and cause havoc.  Remember.  They are rodents. Remember, if it is a "luxury" as most bird food and feeders are, the Retailers are starting to make you feel the pain of your pleasureable diversion of feeding back yard birds by charging you accordingly.  After all, there ARE PEOPLE in this country who can't afford to feed their family. As far as the product, No squirrel blockers, here!	-1
I owned an older model of this feeder that lacked the roof, and I was eager to try this version; it seemed like a perfect upgrade.  Unfortunately, I'm very disappointed in it.  First of all, one of the welds on the roof where the posts are inserted is crooked.  It was possible to insert the post and use the feeder, but it looks a bit cockeyed.  NOT the quality I expect from the Duncraft name (and price).  Next, I discovered how inconvenient it is to fill this feeder, not a small consideration for a feeder that holds so little.  With the roofless version, I could simply turn it over, shake out the hulls, add fresh seed, and shake it until all the seed was under the grid.  That can't be done with this one because of the way the roof is attached.  The posts are not fastened to the feeder; the feeder and roof have round holes where the posts just sit.  The roof is only balanced on the posts, not fastened, so if you turn over the feeder, posts go flying.  The washer that holds down the grid is attached to the hanger, which goes through the roof, so the screw and washer can't be removed to lift the grids for filling unless the roof is moved up out of the way.  Bottom line:  The feeder needs to be partially disassembled and reassembled to refill it.  Bare-handed most of the time, as it's a fiddly process to get it all back together.  In the cold and snow.  Every couple days.  The quality and filling hassles didn't stop my trying to use it, though.  What ultimately retired this feeder was that "Squirrel Blocker" turned out to be merely a naming convention, not a description of the feeder's performance.  The squirrels quickly figured out that launching themselves onto the feeder from a nearby tree would shake the feeder enough to spill seed handily onto the ground.  Soon they observed that this also caused seed to shuffle to one side, piling it high enough to reach into the grid and grab it.  Hot on the heels of that breakthrough was the realization that simply sitting on one edge of the feeder tipped it enough to keep the seed piled up for easy access.  This could be avoided by placing the feeder where squirrels can't jump onto it and using a pole baffle so they can't climb up.  If you have such a location, would like to add a platform feeder, and have a setup (e.g., handy picnic table) that makes it easy to work with the feeder when filling it, this feeder might fill the bill for you.  It's attractive and sturdy despite its manufacturing defects, and I think it would last a long time.  However, any feeder can be pretty well squirrel-proofed by locating it where squirrels can neither jump nor climb onto it.  If I had such a location, I would surely use it.  Meanwhile, I can only chalk up another victory for the squirrels.	-1
First off, I can hear the whine these things make. It was annoying at first but now I am used to it. Secondly, I have had THREE of them in my 400sq ft master bedroom/bathroom and the rat I was trying to chase away just laughs at them. Also, we sometimes get bugs in the summer because we live in the woods and today I noticed a small roach actually sitting on one of the plug ins. $20 waste of money.	-1
So we had a mouse problem and I figured they wouldn't work for mice and they did not.  I left them in for about 2 months and did not notice any difference in bugs either.  We get spiders in the spring and there was a spider sitting right next to the thing.  They also make a really annoying popping/clicking sound that drove our dogs crazy.  I would look for something else.  If you need help with getting rid of mice try Victor M252 Electronic Mouse Trap.  This took care of our problem.  Caught 10 mice in a week and haven't seen any since.	-1
It's fun to watch the goldfinches turn upside down to get the seed, while the purple finches are confounded by their inability to get their meal. But the feeder has an inane design. The bottom of the feeder - which has to support about 2 lbs of seed - is a flimsy piece of plastic held in place merely by small, short tabs that insert into slots in the cylindrical body of the feeder. As soon as the feeder deforms at all in the sun, the tabs slip and the bottom falls out. Along with all the seed. It isn't hard to fix by drilling four holes and weaving in thin wire for extra support (thus two stars instead of one), but whoever designed this should be sent back to kindergarten.	-1
Real flimsy.  Poor metal used in stand, but did its purpose.	-1
My old thermometer came off it's flimsy bracket in the recent snow, I went to order a replacement but the reviews suggested it was a common issue with wind and snow, so I went for this one instead - primarily because of the great reviews. It looks great, and the bracket is certainly more secure than my old more, price point is good too. So why only 2 stars? Unfortunately it is almost impossible to see the red line indicating the temperature! You must be at a certain height and angle, and don't dare move an inch! Sadly this one is headed to the trash and I'll be purchasing the old model I had - with some tape to keep it secure!	-1
I bought one of these and it arrived USED - it had previously been mounted on somebody's window. That'[s all you need to know.	-1
Looks good and works but accuracy is not on of it's positive aspects.  This thermometer registers low by almost 10 degrees.  Taylor needs to pull this product from the market.  That is until they have one that is reasonably accurate. I tried to slide the thermometer in the mount but was fearful I would break the glass.  Or stated another way.  I could not calibrate it.  What you get is what you have ,a worthless thermometer.	-1
This thermometer is quite cheaply made, but durable enough, but what can you expect for $14. Ours also reads, in the shade, about 5 degrees high with no way to calibrate it. A calibration feature would have given it a 4-5 star rating. We are keeping it. We have a smaller thermometer in the back on our deck that reads about 5 degrees low, A calculation between the two of them gives us a relatively accurate temperature. This whole procedure is what makes life interesting. lol	-1
Did not work right.  said 100 when it was only 81.  just didn't work right.	-1
Not accurate.	-1
Doesn't show accurate temperature.  About 10  degrees off. Piece of junk.	-1
Cheap price, cheap product.	-1
Temp is NEVER accurate.	-1
not accurate at all China Garbage !	-1
Used it for a few months and now this thermometer is exactly 10 degrees off. No way to adjust it. The spiral that  contracts and expands depending on the temperature is totally exposed to the outside elements and needs regular cleaning. I'm not happy with this product.	-1
Too big	-1
Quit working within a month; so disappointing as it was a gift for my husband and we loved the way it looked	-1
Bought one and returned it for a replacement. second one is working fine	-1
This took FOREVER to receive! And when we finally got it, so disappointed! The plastic is thin and cheap. The vivid color on line is nothing like the real thing! This is a disappointment!	-1
Very flimsily built, The needle assembly flops in the housing and it reads 5 degrees off.	-1
Reading 60 degrees with snow on the ground.	-1
Worked fine all summer, when the temperature drops below 40 degrees, it stops working. It's 28 degrees here, ice and snow everywhere, but my thermometer says 40!	-1
This thing is remarkably bad. I thought, hey, it would be kind of nice to be able to look out the window and see the temperature without having to get my phone out or look on a computer. So I ordered this. I knew something was wrong when I took it out of the box, and it showed +20 degrees inside the house than what the thermostat was showing. But it had only been delivered about a half hour before I looked at it, and it had been a warm day, so I gave it a chance and put it outside. Yeah, no, it is pretty much always consistently wrong. Usually by a range of about 20-30 degrees. It uses some cheap coil thing on the back to control the needle, and it doesn't work well at all. I am assuming it is designed to move the needle by the expansion and contraction of the coiled metal as it heats and cools, but it is always laughably wrong. On 100+ degree days, it buries the needle and shows it as 120+. At 8AM in the morning when every other thermometer I own (mercury, digital, etc.) and the weather services all say it is 65 degrees out, it shows as 85-90. The thing is a joke. Don't buy it.	-1
This Taylor Big And Bold Dial Thermometer, 13.25 Inch Green is one of the most attractive and easy to read thermometers I've ever owned. I couldn't wait to hang it up outdoors near our patio. The green color is really lovely outside. The dial is large enough to see it from quite a distance, which makes it great to read it from inside. This is where all the great things about this thermometer end.  Once I hung it up outside, I started to compare the temperature readings against 3 other thermometers- my old, but reliable outdoor one, my neighbor's and my inside one. The readings were consistently off, whether the thermometer was outdoors or inside. The readings were not just a couple degrees off- but way off. It consistently would not read any lower temperatures below 76 degrees- and we have had many cold 60 degree evenings this week.  All the readings were for warmer temperatures, and to make things even worse- it even read these over 76 degree temperatures off by 2 degrees. The whole point of a thermometer is accuracy, and since this Taylor Thermometer could not give one accurate reading or any reading below 76 degrees, it's failure earns it 1 Star, since I can't give it zero Stars.	-1
I love the large easy-to-read digits but the temperature has been very  inaccurate, as much as 20 degrees off, even when I moved it to a spot as much out of sun as I could find. Worse, the plastic cover on the front of the disk comes off way too easily, I keep finding it on my deck having popped off. Cannot recommend this piece of junk at all.	-1
So props to the merchant for issuing a refund. No complaints at all.  But the product, hmmm, how could I refer this.  Okay, if you need a temp within 10 actual degrees, this is for you.  No adjustment, no changing it to be accurate, this is a general temperature thermometer.  Easy to see, easy to read.	-1
Registers temperature too high by at least 5 to 10 degrees.  Too bad as it looked good and was easy to read.  Returning it for a refund.	-1
This is not very accurate. IT has been 5-10 degrees off since I got it.  I would not buy this again.	-1
Looks good, can see from inside the house.  No back on it so subject to the weather. Only had one season, and it stuck at 60 degrees.  Trying to find another for a replacement	-1
Did not get to use this thermometer since it arrived with the internal mechanism broken. Was not worth the trouble to return. I have had the same thermometer in the past and it worked pretty well for two or three years. Try not to have it in direct sun, just like any other thermometer, or at least know that in will not be accurate until the sun moves past it. I'm sure there are sturdier choices that will at least make it as far as your window, but the price is cheap so it may be worth a chance. I just lost this time.	-1
Worthless. I've reset the thermometer at least 10 times. The temperature shown always ranges between 60 and 70 regardless of how cold or hot it is. Don't waste your money. I missed the return window by a day, so I'm stuck with this stupid thing.	-1
This arrived broken, Pointer Arrow just flopped to side. There was no way to fix. All looked cheaply made and like it would not hold up long anyway. I ordered another that was made well.	-1
Received this as a gift.  Right now it is 29 degrees outside and the bird bath underneath the window is frozen solid.  The thermometer currently reads 80 degrees.  It is under a porch and not in direct sunlight.  Calibration for a 50+ degree difference is impossible.  Cute idea; but, useless.	-1
piece of junk.;  doesn't stay on window.	-1
In Minnesota the temperature changes are fast, it can be 60 during the day and drop to freezing at night. Bought this to monitor the small garden on my patio and this morning it read 48 degree and its 36 degree.  peace of junk	-1
Inferior plastic film from older model which I replaced.  Very disappointing as it doesn't cling and plastic is curling as others have stated.  Very disapointed.  We had older model for years and only replaced because the plastic had turned yellow.  Sorry we did not keep.  Plus this thermometer doesn't appear very accurate.	-1
Pointer stuck on 60 degrees when I knew it was much warmer.  After flicked it with my finger it moved. Numbers came off on window when I removed it to clean window.	-1
Cheap, as in: cheaply made. Not accurate while working, off about 3 degrees. Then, after three weeks of use, the plastic box housing the needle popped and fell to the ground.	-1
Doesn't accurately display temps.  Nice idea, but waste of money.	-1
WON'T STICK/NOT ACCURATE	-1
These do not display the correct temperature.  Installed them next to a few other thermometers and this one was consistently wrong.  The others were much closer to each other (within 5 degrees).  Do not waste your money on these.	-1
This product is just what I wanted but it just didn't register the correct temperature. It was off by 5-10 degrees and could not be adjusted properly. I returned it for a prompt credit	-1
I don't think it works at all...	-1
This thermometer had to be returned....did not work	-1
I purchased 6 of these items for Christmas gifts,  1 was for me.  It installed easy. Easy to read day or night. The only problem is it doesn't give the temperature.  Out of the 6 I know of 2 that never worked.  If you are considering buying don't waste your money.	-1
Product does not work. Don't waste your money.	-1
Won't stick to window and totally inaccurate readings (10 to 14 degrees off)	-1
Not what I thought it would be.	-1
Not put together good at all. Package come in good shape, contents come apart inside the package.	-1
It never worked.  It was cheaper to just dump it than try to return it.	-1
Poorly made-SAVE YOUR MONEY.  Between the  thin decal and the plastic box which holds the temperature gauge, I could not tell you which was worse.  The product arrived at my home broken.  I could not use it-got frustrated at the shipment or Amazon and tossed it in the garbage.	-1
don't work	-1
IT breaks from extreme heat!  Had to buy the La Crosse Technology WS-1025 Digital Window Thermometer as a replacement.  MUCH BETTER!!!!	-1
This is a piece of clear plastic which can't hold the metal spring in place.  It peeled off of the window immediately and went in th etrash can right after that	-1
I bought this just to see if it might work; my memory is that it was pretty cheap, so it wasn't much of a risk.  But it is so far off in accuracy that it is a throwaway.	-1
Apparently the double-paned glass in my office building allows a lot of heat transfer.  In the winter, this thermometer is reading about 10F higher than actual outdoor temperatures.  I will replace with a solution that puts the sensor farther away from the glass... either wireless, or a big traditional one hung some distance away.	-1
Showed 80 degrees.  I was maybe in low 50's.  Was in a covered area, did when arrived yesterday.  Very upset and disappointed.	-1
The appearance of this thermometer is quite good.  The numbers are bright and it's even attractive on the window.  But it has been totally inaccurate since the day it was applied to the window.  It began at 6 degrees too warm and today it was 20 degrees off.  This inconsistency makes it impossible to allow even a certain amount of error in calculating daily temperatures.	-1
Do not buy this item.  It does not stick, and when it finally does for a few seconds, it does not read the temperature.  If the sun hits it, you will have a temperature of 120 degrees.  If the sun does not hit it, you will be at 60 degrees.  That's it.	-1
It's not accurate.  Was hoping it would be but no luck.  Maybe others have had luck with theirs but not mine.  I even tried placing it on other windows and still not accurate.	-1
This thermometer has one thing going for it, it sticks to the window. Other than that, it doesnt work and when the needle does finally move the temperature isn't accurate. Not worth the money	-1
Looks nice, easy to mount. Overpriced and outside reading is affected by heat inside the house radiating through the window pane.	-1
I put the thermometer on the outside of the window. It was hard to get it to stick without bubbles. It eventually fell to pieces in the weather.	-1
I REALLY wanted to like this thermometer. I bought it to replace another cling-type thermometer that "someone" washing the windows had ooops, wrecked.  It is a great design: The numbers are very large and very easy to read.  However, it simply always tells the WRONG temperature. It's slow to react to changes and never, ever reads correctly. I checked it against 2 other instruments and even stuck it into the refrigerator and freezer (each of which have built-in thermometers).  So. .. on to the Kleer Temp to see if that might be more accurate. . . . .	-1
I used to have those white, round exterior thermometers, that require to be hanging on a nail somewhere. And preferably somewhere near a window, so that I could see what the temperature is when I want it, without having to run out to get the information. While the ones I bought were usually big enough, they would often fall down when a big gush of wind tossed them off the wall or post. Sunlight, cold and rain also make the polymers brittle over time, well... there just does not seem to be the perfect one! I found this novel item: a thermometer combined with a dial that is flat and clingy. I installed easily it on the outside of the window right next to my back yard door. Just clean the pane, and for good measure, I scraped it with a scraping blade (the flat side of it, mind you - before anybody gets into some quirky comments!) After that, just flatten the thing to the still moist pane, rub it to chase the air out to the edges, dry it off with a soft cloth, and - bingo! And here is where things turn to the dark side: This was my plan of how to use this thermometer: Every morning before leaving, the temperature info would be right at my height, and eye sight, on the window. It would be fun and also pretty to look at, almost artsy! The other thing I loved about it is that it shows the values in degrees F and C, which might be a great way to teach kids about the fact that in other countries, people use a different measuring unit.  HOWEVER!!! It just does NOT work. Yes, there is a so-called calibration screw on it, but... even that does not set things right. It has been on my window since this morning, and I have monitored it with the help of another outdoor thermometer. This thing, while pretty, is not doing its job. It is simply off the chart, in any direction one can think of. How disappointing! Some people here said that they left it outside for some days and eventually, it sorted itself out. Well, no... I don't think so. A measuring instrument that is based on physical properties and conditions either works right away or not at all. This one hits the spot at "not at all". I called Amazon Customer Service, explained my disappointment, and they are sending me a return label as I am typing this, and as soon as I print it out, it will be on its way back there! One more thing: It won't reveal its country of origin anywhere, not on the packaging nor on the item itself, but here is my strong guess: "Made in China".... once more! This coming from somebody who loves being in China and spends lots of time there! Please, China, stop making crApowski stuff! We are tired of all that junk! Start shipping only products that can actually pass the quality control and if possible with a "pass" rate superior to 90 %. That would be a start!	-1
Lasted about two and a half months, after which it peeled itself off the glass over a period of about 4 days. . It was not placed in the sun. At about 5 pm the temperature would read what it really was outside, but from 10 am to 4 pm it was 120 degrees. I live on the coast, not in the desert.	-1
I bought two of these silly things!  It is 70 degrees out today and the one in my kitchen says 120+  I need to throw them away but havn't got around to it.  Do not buy this product, you will be throwing your money away!  I wouldn't give it one star, but didn't have the option!	-1
Two have already quit on us, very cheap ! Won't buy again !	-1
Total Crap Product. 10 Degrees off & no way to adjust. Tossed in garbage.	-1
Not accurate and has no adjustment to correct temperature.	-1
I purchased 2 of these for beverages for an outdoor event. They both leak!  Disappointing. I expected better.	-1
Item was less than stellar and not happy with the quality and different stylying than shown	-1
Leaks like a <expletive> sieve! Do not buy!!	-1
It leaks.	-1
I bought this to make a water source for my bees (complete with a solar pump so they'll have "running" water! It was a pretty sweet ~no pun intended~ setup!). I got it all set up and everything was great until I checked in on it the next morning to see if my bees had taken to it....they hadn't as all the water had leaked out overnight. I have to return it as this was the whole reason why I bought it.	-1
could be made better bought several all leak a little use for the dogs little worried because coating is coming off in the water the dogs drink out of them. little confused im returning because the seems are glued and have also gotten rust in past. i thought galvanized was better then just steel but the steel one is more expensive it claims it will not rust or leak so trying that one now	-1
The first thing I did when I got it was to dump a 5 gallon bucket of water into it... all the water emptied out of it in about 7-8 minutes. This thing doesn't hold water/ there are open gaps all along the seams.	-1
I have not used it yet but the quality is there and it appears it will last a long time.  Update.  Used this 5-6 times and I found it difficult to clean and one of the dividers broke. Looking for something better.	-1
5 stars for performance - 1 star for cleaning -- This is a very large, heavy duty, rib rack.  It's height does well with spare ribs larger size. But the clean up is very difficult.  I guess you could put it in the dishwasher, never tried. I mainly cook baby back ribs so I don't need such a tall rib rack. Because of the difficulty in cleaning I would not buy this again.  I am not exaggerating.  It's like cleaning a maze.  UPDATE 06/14/2014 I came back to change or update my rating of this item. I recently had a big bbq cookout and just cleaned the rack. IT IS A HEADACHE TO CLEAN!  I still didn't get all the stuff off.  I will never use it again.  I'll Probably sell it or give it away on Craig's list.  Unless you want to waste an hour of your life cleaning something that should take 5-10 minutes don't by this rack.  Look for one that can hold the ribs upright and is easy to clean.  Only Fred Flinstone would need such a massive rib rack. I hate to give a negative review because I like Steven Raichlen's cooking shows and books.	-1
This is an edited review after 2 uses. I received this product on the estimated delivery date.  One of the interior rods was in the bottom of the shipping box.  Since I'm a function over form kind of guy and it appears that the rack will work okay without it, I decided to keep it the way it was.  The overall craftmanship, however, is poor.  The pieces are spot welded with a lot of burrs and sharp points sticking out.  The instructions say that you must hand wash it, so I guess that I will find out just how big a problem this really is when I wash it. It fits my Traeger grill cooking surface and will allow me to cook twice as many ribs as opposed to laying the ribs down on the grid. After using this product twice, I can say without reservation, don't waste your money. On the first use, another of the long rods broke loose from the spot weld.  The width design is too small for a meaty rib to fit easily in the rack.  Because I cook a dry rubbed rib for two hours at 250 degrees and then wrap the rib rack in foil with a sauce application for another two hours.  This produces a melt in your mouth product with a great flavor and no dried out meat.  Because of the narrow design, inserting the wrapped rib racks back into the cooking rack is very difficult.  The rough burrs tore the foil and dumped the sauce and had to be re-done. This utensil will go into the "Well, it seemed like a good idea" pile. Because of the sharp edges and burrs, The hand washing is a tricky task. I don't know who Steven Raichlen is, but I would assume that he is a celebrity type chef.  If I were trying to make money by selling my name for a product, I think I would check the quality and design a little more carefully.	-1
The light itself is a beautiful design, but I guess 240 volt means that it cannot be used in the US.  I tried to buy a converter, it wouldn't fit. I reached out for help, no response.  I will be returning because from the time I have received it until now I have never seen it turned on.  There are 40 and up volt converters but I think they could have at least mentioned that.  I am so disappointed, it is a beautiful fixture.	-1
1 month after having this unit, something inside stopped working. whatever controls the middle 4 lights burned out. so the only lights that work are 2 on each side... i'm pissed off and can't get a hold of Sun Blaze through Amazon... this is garbage to me now. I want a new unit. i don't have time for this.	-1
It does its job for starting seedlings. But I have to move seedlings outside to get good growth. Update - I found out why I was not getting good growth - 4 of the 8 tubes were not working. I assumed it was the tubes, so I replaced them and found those sockets still did not work. So in less than 4 months of use, half the unit does not work. I no longer recommend purchase of this unit.	-1
I'd give less than 1 star if I could.  I bought my light from the local grow shop.  One year and three days after buying this light one of the ballasts died.  The guy at the grow shop told me it had a 5 year warranty but, I couldn't get a new light.  It had to be sent in to be  tested by Sunblaze.  That was 5 weeks ago and I still have no light or even a response.  What I do have is a bunch of dead plants in my basement.  Sunblaze sucks and so does their warranty/service.  If you buy one of these be sure to by some spare parts too.  You're going to need them.	-1
Box says, " Easy Assembly Guaranteed". NOT. Took two and a half hours and a Band-Aid. I love my 10 year old version of this same little grill. It came assembled from a local retail food market. After 10 years of sitting outside the ash pan rusted out so I decided to replace it with the same grill. The new one has cheap wheels that I will have to replace, fit and flues do not control heat, wood handle and wood table are a joke (ZERO minus quality). Still this is a great little patio grill with heavy metal construction and will last for years. Just have to correct the deficiencies. But that I can do. BTW a replacement Ash Pas was available but after cost and shipping was only a few $ less than hole new grill. I should of spent a few $ less.	-1
After four uses, the black paint on the top  of the body peels off completely  from the heat, leaving bare metal.	-1
I received item. Box torn open, must have been return item. I accepted that anyway since it was never used. Then I was putting together and, no English directions just about got it together and, missing pieces. I just about got it all together so I don't want to return unless I can't get the three items and some English directions.	-1
I bought the Char-Griller Patio Pro with side fire box because of the many good reviews on Amazon. The grill is great: not high-end, but with great features; it works well for smoking and grilling, especially after I seasoned it inside and out.  I needed some spare parts and ordered them directly from Char-Griller, from the address in the owner's manual. They arrived fine, but, stapled to the shipping receipt, I found enclosed some literature about "have you accepted Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior", etc. etc.  Now, I am a Unitarian; I don't find Jesus offensive. But I do find evangelists offensive. Be aware that this company thinks it's appropriate to include religious solicitations with their merchandise.	-1
Pros -Heavy cooking grate good for searing -Burns for a long time -Can cook with open even on windy days due to the barrel design -Barrel is a nice gauge of steel. Not flimsy or thin. -Small footprint, doest take up much space -Great for 1 to 3 people and is not a hog on charcoal. -Curved drawer at the bottom that slide out to empty ash. Really easy and no mess. -Once you tighten up things (use a ratchet) its very stable and feels solid. If you don't get things really tight it will feel a little wobbly.  Cons: -Assembly, took me about 25 mins and the directions do not have much detail. Its not hard but just time consuming. -Not good for larger cookouts but it does stay hot for a long time so you can go a few rounds on it. -Legs are kinda cheap but thats how most are these days. -The grates are clearly the weak link with the grill and chargriller offers no warranty on them at all.  Overall I could not be happier with this. Its the perfect size and so easy to empty out that I have not used my $600 gas grill since buying this one. I would recommend getting a charcoal chimney. You open the drawer 3/4 of the way and set it right on the grate. In ten minutes your ready to cook and no lighter fluid needed ever again.  Update: A few months ago I noticed that the cast iron grates were starting to peel off in layers and sticking to the food. No matter how much I cleaned them they continue to peel apart. Chargriller offers zero warranty on the grates (not even 30 days) so my only option is to either thrown away the grill or pay nearly 40% of the new purchase price to by replacement grates and have them shipped. I seasoned them according to the instructions and have even purchased the cover so its never been left unprotected. I lowered the rating down to 2 stars since the grill works great until the grates degrade which IMO should not happen so quickly. I consider it a disposable grill as a result. Stainless steel grates are needed.	-1
It is sad to say but the days of a solid American made product is dead!  The smokers made by Char Griller boast that they are American made, and covered by a warranty...then in the small print it says 'the paint may peel off your smoker upon first use (it should say WILL peel off upon first use!), the paint is not covered by the warranty.'  if you are unfortunate enough to own one of these then you know what I am talking about, both my grill and side smoker are all but devoid of paint.  I called Char Griller and told them that I was appalled by their underhandedness, they didn't seem to care.  well the best (or worst) advertising is word of mouth.  and I have nothing good to say about this product!	-1
The instructions for this otherwise fairly decent product are so poor and lacking that you see before me, numerous owners complaining about them. Some have simply not been able to assemble the grill due to it's relative complexity and a total cop-out on any effort to create a useable instruction set. Here is my letter to CharGriller:  "I bought your CharGriller Patio Pro, Model 1515 and it was lacking 6 lock washers. Your parts listing and packet of screws and so forth call for and supplied only 3 lock washers. Your instructions call for 9. I had to buy some lock washers to finish the assembly.  "Here is the tally per the instructions:   step 8 - 2 lock washers   step 9 - 2 lock washers   step 10 - 1 lock washer   step 12 - 1 lock washer   step 13 - 2 lock washers   step 14 - 1 lock washer  "That is nine (9), not three (3).  "And as you know (I have read the numerous criticisms from Amazon buyers), your instructions are so incredibly lacking that only a sharp and very mechanically talented person can figure this out, and even then it only assembles correctly after several do-overs along the way. What a fiasco and poor excuse for instructions. WHY DO YOU HAVE SOME 6TH GRADE CHINESE BOY WRITE YOUR INSTRUCTIONS?  "As have many others, I am leaving very poor reviews about this product at places like Amazon, simply because your company couldn't care less about putting together a decent set of instructions."	-1
The product has a big gash in the side. This is bad considering it's grass seed. I'm going to lose a bunch of these seeds from them falling out of the bag. Would have got them in store if had known I was going to lose a bunch of seeds to the trash. There going to fall on my carpet and have to be vacuumed.	-1
I followed the directions to a T.  Out of the 5 packages, I got maybe 100 shoots. I had no luck with this product.	-1
About 20% of the Scott`s that I applied actually grew. Buy a sack of cheap grass seed instead.	-1
We tried this product last year, followed the instructions, watered daily, and nothing happened. We returned it for a refund under Scott's guarantee.	-1
Previous use of this product worked great.  This one not so good.  Granted it is hot out in NC this time of year, but even with appropriate watering, my 2x2 area barely had any seeds germinate... bad batch maybe?	-1
Doesn't work as advertised. Followed direction, and after two weeks, I just have lawn seeds on the ground.	-1
Arrived with missing parts, Handle doesn't stand vertical as shown in photo, but only one way to mount it (horizontal).  Also, it was previously used since when i took off the cap to check to see if any parts may be inside the tank, the tank was all WET!!!  Horrible experience, I would not recommend, nor would I trust all the good reviews.  Trust the bad ones regarding this item.	-1
The pump provides a comfortable fit, snug without binding or chafing.  Decent selection of nozzles and a wand with good form factor.  It doesn't leak, on-the-fly pumping is easy, and the unit provides a good long distance stream to ~20'.  HOWEVER, the pump handle is fixed in a forward/horizontal position (not like the photo) at right angle to the tank.  This makes perfect sense for easy actuation during use, but it is a critical design flaw for storage.  The handle is bolted in position and, short of removing the bolt and handle after each use, this thing is extremely difficult to store efficiently.  The manual shows a "folding handle (available on some models)", but I cannot imagine why any sane person would think this should be an optional design.  On a similar but less critical point, the device stores the wand horizontally across the top of the tank using a couple of molded snap locks.  This too increases the storage footprint since the wand is considerably longer than the width of the tank.  A better design would store the wand vertically along the side of the tank.  For a few more nickels in production costs this would be a great product, but based on the storage issue I cannot recommend anyone buy it.  If you can figure out how to replace the fixed handle with one that folds inline with the tank for storage, you'd probably be happy with this tank's performance.	-1
Worked good first year and leaked second year, plus had to replace nozzle. Would not buy it again .	-1
somehow my pump that will "never leak" leaks all over my behind.  also be careful when you put the unit down when carrying by its integrated handle - if the pump handle shifts it can/will chop your hand completely off.	-1
mine broke in 60 days - buy the metal one	-1
what a piece of crap its flimsy and leaks never stops the water flow tried different volumes of water , still leaks	-1
The threads on this thing stripped out immediately. Started spraying outside of trough, never would shut off. Cheap plastic.	-1
Too small so I returned it!	-1
Did not fit the mower seat well at all even though I called to ask what size I needed. Also, the seat has a hole stitched right into the middle of it so when it rains the water actually collects and dumps right into the bucket of the seat underneath. First time I sat down on it, "SPLOOSH" right into a puddle. This thing is waterproof, what's the point if it funnels the water directly onto the seat? I called in and asked about if it was a flaw and they said they're all made that way. Useless.	-1
Don't waste your time here.  The seat cover isn't the issue but the fact it will slide around on you constantly.  There's nothing to keep it from moving around causing you to be uncomfortable and constantly having to adjust it.  I ended up just using black duct tape to fix my seat as this cover didn't work unless for storage purposes.	-1
Baggy.	-1
Too big for a snapper Comet mower.	-1
Very poor quality. Especially in the middle stitching.	-1
It seems to be made of good material and fits my hi back seat nicely, but there is no way to secure it to the existing seat except by the elastic band around the edge of the cover.  I'm considering using a permanent means of attaching it to the existing seat.  It should have come with some kind of tie strap to secure the cover better.	-1
It took 3 weeks to arrive not 2 or 3 days .  Cover smaller then the seat can not tie, I have to add  6" of cloth more around the bottom to make it hold tier.	-1
too big for seat on my JD tractor seat which is average size. Actually makes the seat very slippery. Wish I had not bought it.	-1
wasted more money on trying to find a product that would work for flies..  this is not it.. they flies could care less if it was on the horse.. they still landed and irritated the animal..	-1
Used this on my donkey's nose, horseflies were back the same day. I have not found anything that works, These horseflies awful,	-1
Used this on my dogs as we had a heavily fly covered back yard. We sprayed it on both dogs and rubbed it in on several occasions. It didn't seem to help any with regards to flying insects.	-1
BEWARE: EASILY BENT! 'Manual' post hole diggers always require a bit of elbow crease. Unfortunately for these, while lightweight, easy to use and even feels efficient compared to others used in the past. However, you might not expect to get any serious work down with these. If the ground is less favorable (sloppy clay, fine dirt or otherwise difficult to keep the contents in the digger when lifting out of the hole, one of two things is going to happen. Contents will fall out of the bite back into the hole or the digger will bend up as if it were just plastic. This is a product for perfect conditions (if there is such a thing). I say that because I dug a few holes OK but when running into unfavorable soil, useless!  I love everything about this digger - except, it is quite unreliable and I will have to find a much stronger product.  We bought this a few years back but left bubble wrapped until we moved recently. Now we are trying to fence in the property. THAT project time just increased due to using this  crapware.  Recently tried digging in damp clay. Bad idea for cheap P-H-Ds.  The handles are so far apart, can't reach them to use them effectively. The bottom blades badly flare outwards now, They keep bending near the pivot point. It is becoming too easy to bend them back (by hand, no additional leverage) and thus they get weaker with each use.  Its holes are numbered!	-1
I thought these would be awesome BC of the unique design and good reviews. But wow was I wrong. They are too heavy. They are too difficult to operate. I left them outside a couple nights and the hinged connection basically froze up and made them pretty much useless. I couldn't believe it. So disappointed!!!! In the end I used them a couple times...not worth it.	-1
Very disappointed.  I would love to give these a great review, but cannot.  I had 14 holes to dig for my fence and soil that was "normal".  Just regular dirt, even soft loam.  After the 3rd or 4th hole, I noticed these started to bend a little.  Each dig saw one of the handle bend more and more.  They were starting to bend right above the swivel point near the bottom.  Before they bent, they worked great!!!!  I was happy with them and they made digging holes almost fun, if that is possible!!!!  I was so disappointed.  If they did not bend so bad, I would give them 5 stars!!!!  I hope they make these better in the future.	-1
According to most of the reviews of these posthole diggers, they are the best there is. The ad claims they are factory sharpened to make digging easy. Well, this is pretty far from the truth. The ones I received were pretty dull, the ends had about a 3mm rounded end, which didn't dig very well at all, so I sent them back. If they were as sharp as a shovel, they would probably work pretty good.	-1
As Expected	-1
Hawaiian morning doves love the tape.  It does not bother them at all.  They seem to like sitting right next to it.	-1
birds build nests on my porch light (robins) and I hung the tape and put it around light and robins built nest on top of foil	-1
Only lasted 2 days in 20mph winds.  The very thin plastic shredded and blew away.  A nice idea, but it needs to be much more robust to be useful.	-1
Birds ignored this.	-1
I am having problems determining when this would work well.  Maybe in fruit trees?  Does not deter geese.	-1
Don't work	-1
didn't seem to discourage birds at all.	-1
Doesn't work with swallows under a boat lift canopy	-1
Did absolutely nothing to get rid of birds. I think it might have attracted more.	-1
didn't work for me, birds just played in string	-1
DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT....IT IS USELESS	-1
Pretty but useless	-1
What a waste of money, the birds stayed away for an hour and then came back in greater numbers. If anyone knows of something that actually works without hurting cats, please let me know. Yes, ironically, the birds come to eat my cat's food. The cats(all five of them) don't do anything. I think the birds actually scare them because they're small cats and large birds that come in huge flocks.	-1
Does not help keeping woodpeckers away, I used this with baloons and Bird B Gone Reflective Scare Bird Diverter.	-1
Doesn't keep woodpeckers away.  I used it with baloons and the Bird B Gone Reflective Scare Bird Diverter, there was no decrease in woodpecker activity and damage to the house.	-1
I had robins building a nest on my porch light fixture.  I put one of these up and no more nests.  I just set one strip on the fixture no screws or glue and it works perfect.  Follow up....robins are now building nest on to of spikes.  It worked for a while now the robins are back. Double update...I have a bay window with the spikes on it because the robins were building nests .  Well now they are building nest ON TOP of the spikes on the bay window and porch light!!!  Save your money...They are a nice base for nests....	-1
This tape does not work at all.  No matter how you hang it up or put it, it does not keep birds away.  Do not waste your money on this.	-1
This tape does not work.  Hung it up in low and high places and birds came right up to it.	-1
Birds sat right on these. I had these lined up all over & the birds just sat right on them.	-1
Doesnt work so well. I put it where the birds always land, and now they land 12 inches away and poop there instead. Didnt accomplish anything	-1
The concept sounded great for controlling the small birds which build nests in our pole barn door track.  I made 3' long double streamers and attached them to the metal soffit with Velcro.  Easy to replace if they wear out.  We didn't have them hanging for a day and the birds were back and acting like they ribbons didn't even exist.  The ribbons were blowing around and making a bit of a noise.  I bet the birds were laughing at the whole project.  Back to the drawing board.	-1
Really dissapointed in this product. Mounted them 5 months ago up in barn rafters out of the sun and no rain. They are totally inside and protected from the weather and are heavily rusted. I doubt they will last more than a year. Outside in the elements they would be a total waste of money.	-1
I HAD A TERRIBLE PROBLEM WITH BIRDS IN MY DRIVEWAY FOR APPROXIMATELY 2 MONTHS. I PURCHASE THIS ITEM AND FOUND IT NOT TO WORK AT ALL. DONT WAST YOUR MONEY.	-1
Robins have no problem with these.	-1
A pigeon got caught up on a strip and flew off with it attached to his wing.  I wouldn't recommend this at all. Pigeons are not affected by the tape.	-1
We bought three different items in an attempt to remove or at least reduce the bird population in our backyard. This stuff never worked. We tried all the different ways. Save your money	-1
This product did not work at all.  The birds still hung out and ate my tomatoes.  The tape easily tears and fades quickly.  Would not purchase again.	-1
Poor quality	-1
It worked for the first week, but I think the birds got smart and just ignored it. I still have 75% of the roll left.	-1
Works good until they get used to it. I used this on my boat mouring cover for seagull control and it would have worked if it stayed in place. Right @ the 2 month point, it breaks and then the seagulls get audacious enough to sit next to the broken off streamer. If it didn't break off, it would have worked. I replaced it and it worked until it broke off again right @ the 2 month point again. Too brittle after a time - maybe UV breakdown??	-1
It is very pretty and shiny. Birds really seem to life it... from a distance. It does seem to work better than a fake owl. It is durable and easy to use.	-1
We bought this and the birds be gone hoping to keep purple grackles from flying across our deck, under the roof covering it.  Well, it is good for a laugh...they sat on them, under them.  Finally bought a net and hung that up.  It worked.  No more cleaning up after the birds! we have ordered a roll down screen as a permanent solution.	-1
Installed the IRRI-TAPE on the side of my home to deter woodpeckers.  In the first installation, the tape broke in one week after rubbing the bracket by wind.  I replaced the tape and give just enough tension to keep the tape suspended between brackets and not hit my wall and make noise.  But the tape broke again after one week.    I think the tape will survive longer if I install it very loose, but I couldn't do it because the tape made noise by hitting my wall.	-1
does not work...all it does is advertize my garden to the crows that are within line of sight...also it did not hold up in light wind conditions...jimmy	-1
As others have noted, it works for a day or two but that's it. Similarly, CDs/DVDs hanging from string don't work, either. (At least for peaches, nectarines and plums.)	-1
These tiny ones drive me crazy from 5am to 8pm.  The tape works on all but them.  In fact they perch right on a ribbon.  They don't even notice it.	-1
I tried putting Irri-tape around the yard to scare away the birds who were feasting on my dog's food. It worked for maybe a day then the birds realized  it wasn't a threat and started ignoring it.  If you're considering getting this to keep birds away from your pet's food, try getting a Bergen Aut-O-Dine instead. That worked beautifully for me.  In my opinion, having this tape hanging all around is not only ineffective as a bird deterrent, it looks trashy.	-1
VERY Heavy.  all metal handle and all.	-1
I was excited to get this product, but found it to be completely useless.  Upon opening the box, I notice a few of the metal spikes had come dislodged from the plastic base. No big deal I figured, I'll just snap them back in place.  Not so easy and in fact I found it impossible to get them to stay well enough to withstand even a mild tug.  They are held on by a very small (and finicky) plastic tab.  I resisted using tools because I figured I'd snap the not-so-beefy plastic base.  And then it just got worse.  Figuring a few missing spikes would not be a big obstacle, I brought a few over the the location to think about how to bets install them. Every time I handled them, looked at them wrong, or breathed on them, another metal spikes would fall out.  I was not being at all rough with them, and in fact was trying to be gentle after the first few fell off.  In a few short minutes, I had a complete mess of spikes slaying around.  If the product could not survive my gentle attempts at installation, how was this to hold up to the elements over time, much less a crafty squirrel.  The last thing I need is to be the laughing stock of the local squirrel population as they ridicule my pathetic attempts to thwart their diabolical schemes.	-1
I should have realized we were going to have problems with these bird spikes when I opened the package and found several of the wire prongs rattling around loose in the box.  It was easy to pop them out of their plastic setting, as our squirrel population soon learned.  We screwed the strips to the top of the deck railing to keep the squirrels from jumping up onto the suet feeder, and bypassing the squirrel baffle.  They soon figured out how to knock the spikes loose.  Admittedly, these spikes are supposed to be for the birds, not the squirrels, but that doesn't excuse their shoddy construction.	-1
construction size tool not as shown.  heavy and awkward to handle.  poor packaging as it was falling out of the box when i got it.	-1
When the shovel didn't show up I looked into my account orders...and noticed the $24.77 had been jacked up to $35. No, not for tax. No, not for shipping. Just...$11 higher than the price listed. Also noticed Amazon Prime 2-day had been changed to Smartpost (FedEx gives it to the local PO) with an estimate 1-week to arrive. No, no, no! Trust me, the Post Office will not deliver a shovel to my ranch. They will leave a note in my mailbox telling me to drive to them, park, stand in line...you know the routine.  This is a strange seller. If this is resolved I'll update what they did to rectify this. I believe certain merchants want to cash in on the Amazon selling opportunity; but they don't respect the traditions.	-1
Per the included Prop 65 warning label, this product is made from toxic materials that cause cancer. I purchased 3 gardening tools from the "Fiskars" brand and all of them included the same warning label. This is not a trusted brand and should be avoided at all cost. If the Taliban was secretly adding toxic materials to common items in the US to slowly kill us all with cancer we would go and kill them, but somehow we allow a company like Fiskars to accomplish the same goal.  Amazon should stop selling any items made with carcinogens. Until then, boycott Fiskars.	-1
This shovel looked nice and the reviews were nice so I ordered.  When it arrived the shovel blade had a box around it that seemed to have a hole at the end.  This was put inside a much larger box.  When I unwrapped the shovel I noticed the tip was damaged and looked like it had been smashed into some rocks before they sent it to me.  I did an Amazon exchange and the second one arrived with just a smashed up box around the blade of the shovel.  This one was even more damaged than the first shovel; this time the handle was all scratched and scuffed as well.  I gave up and just returned the shovel and got my money back.  I'll buy one from a local store instead since Amazon hasn't figured out how to ship them yet.	-1
This shovel I thought was the perfect shovel, until I started using it. I was digging up some shrubs to replant them and everything was going well. The shovel was laying out in the hot sun and being black it gets so hot to touch that you better leave it in the shade.  So during the removal of the shrubs I noticed a slight softness in the ground, well it was muddy so I didn't think much of it... Till I pulled the shovel out of the ground and it was bent right where the handed and the shovel meet.  I could not believe it, I thought I had bought a shovel for life and finally let old faithful the fiberglass shovel to its final destination. Boy was I wrong. The steel shovel bent!!! Bent like butter with a hot knife. Is this possible, I am a mear 130 lb person. HOW!!!???  So I know it has a warranty on it and I bring it back to the local hardware store and they stopped carring them because of the returns.... JUNK!  So long story short, don't buy these shovels unless you want a really heavy weak shovel, get a nice fiberglass shovel and don't ever waste your time with one of these. If anyone would like to challenge my fiberglass to your fiskars, lets do it....	-1
Has yet to catch a single rodent.	-1
I found the noise of the metal seems to scare the mice away when they attempt to enter.	-1
First the problems with the device. There are two "door" mechanisms on each trap. On the first trap, one of the "door" mechanisms was jammed so that it would not activate without extreme pressure. After examining it, I found that the "door" mechanism was not completely installed in its proper location. After a little coaxing, I managed to get the mechanism in the right location. On the second trap, one of the mechanisms wasn't even installed. It was just loose inside the trap. This one took a bit more time to install - it can't be just pushed on. The position of the trap doors prevents it from being installed. You have to flip the door to the other position to get it half way on, an then flip it back to its normal position to get it all the way on. As far as functioning, it doesn't. After leaving it for a week without any bait in a location where I know there are mice, it did not catch any mice. I tried it in another location with know mice and still did not catch any mice after two weeks. Maybe I'll try adding some bait to see if that helps.	-1
have not caught a thing in this trap and I have two of them and many mice	-1
I bought this(2) about 6 months and have yet to catch anything. I have baited it with peanut butter and the other have left with no  bait.. Nada not a thing and I was catching a mouse a day with another humane trap I had until they chewed a hole in it and I haven't been able to fine a replacement. This might be good outside but it is not effective in my kitchen cabinets. I wouldn't not recommend	-1
I put these traps out when I get them, even scenting them with peanut butter, but have not caught a thing.	-1
I have had more mice go in then get back out than I have caught with these. I can tell since they leave their little mice treats behind.  Concept is there but something in the design of the ramps and stops let the mice get out pretty easy. Either that, or I got a bunch of lab mice in my area that are used to getting through mazes.  I am looking on how to modify the design to make it more escape proof and will post this once I get it wrapped up.  In the meantime, Go for it if you have dumb mice but if they have any brains at all, I would expect them to get out of this "trap".	-1
This is one of those items that are better purchased from a brick & mortar store.  The quality of the product can vary depending on how thick the plastic is, and how many drainage ports it features.  Additionally, you will probably want a drip try to catch the runoff.	-1
I purchased two of these in June 2016 (2 years and 5 months ago). I recently noticed that one of them has a crack in it. I ordered two more, just to be on the safe side, and today went to transfer my plants from the 2-year-old planters to the new planters. As soon as I touched them, the 2-year-old planters shattered into a thousand pieces. I swept up the dirt and put my plants into the new planters, for now, but I will be looking for replacement planters ASAP. These planters are NOT suitable for use outside. Or possibly for anything other than very temporary use.	-1
Bought box only because I needed exactly 18 inches only to find that they're not 18 Inches.	-1
This item arrived in hundreds of pieces as it was crushed during shipping. The very lightweight resin column is of poor construction and would not be something you would care to have to show off your gazing ball or other piece. Don't buy this item. Amazon made it simple to return so I applaud them for that.	-1
The top of this base was crooked and the globe I put on top of it sat uneven. Sent it back.	-1
Not very heavy.  Returned it.  A strong wind can blow it over and break your gazing ball if it's a glass one.	-1
Burned out on first day. Only works if you can be vigilant about keeping water in birdbath.	-1
I used this for one month - January. It worked find for about 3 weeks and then just quit. I have tested it inside with a proven outdoor extension cord. I connected the heater to the extension cord and submersed it completely in a dishpan full of icewater. It only turns on when the water is very cold. It doesn't turn on - ever.  Whether it is submersed in very cold water or not. For $39, I expected to get a heater that would last for years... not weeks. Will request a refund on this product.	-1
stopped working after about 3-4 weeks of use.  I wish I could return it, waste of money.  DO NOT BUY THIS!	-1
the cord on this is about a foot, so this plugs in very close to the water. this is dissapointing. I don't need a 5 ft cord, but long enough to get the plug well away from the water.	-1
I had to wait to review this until the cold weather arrived.  It worked for about 2 months and then it stopped working.  I contacted Amazon and it had been more than 3 months so they couldn't help me.  The worst part was I contacted Farm Innovators and they NEVER returned my calls or e-mails.	-1
We bought this product to replace a bird bath heater that failed after many years.  Although this product definitely keeps water from freezing, it works a bit too well.  The water is heated too much and steams off.  The rising vapor seems to frighten the birds and they won't go near it.  They use the bird bath we placed next this one instead.  Returned the product to Amazon for a refund.	-1
Don't waste your money, spend the extra money and get a commercial grade blade sharpener. I went back to using my bench grinder. Tool rest is a piece of crap. There is. No guide or gauge to assist getting the angle right, this is all done by eye. I was able to do that with my bench grinder. Not worth the money	-1
will not purchase again, does not find nail or studs accuratly	-1
This thing couldn't find a stud to save its life.	-1
I have had this thing for awhile, and was never that happy with its stud finding abilities, but I don't use it often. The other day I was installing some garage cabinets. I attempted to lay out the studs for the first two wall cabinets. I could not get the thing to repeat worth a damn, so I though maybe its batteries are weak? I replaced them and same thing! I would put a pencil mark every time it would show the edge of a stud. The pattern looked like an old dartboard, with marks all over the place! I kept marking both edges until I had what looked like somewhat of a consensus, took the average of those two groups and marked half way between them. I go to install the cabinets (by myself) and the screws missed EVERY stud!! I went to Amazon, and started looking for a better stud finder. I saw the magnet versions, and thought maybe I still have one from the old days! I couldn't find it, but found a telescopic magnetic nut/bolt retriever and tried it. It worked Awesome! I have so far installed 7 cabinets, and have yet to miss a stud!!  I had never used the level until I started on the base cabinets. That part worked great, but I bought it first as a stud finder, and it sure failed at that!	-1
This has two functions.  Stud finder and a laser leveler.  The latter works.  Stud finder is hopelessly inaccurate.  Given that's half of the reason for its existence, I'm docking half marks and then rounding down because it shouldn't exist.	-1
nothing i can say that hasn't been said already.  laser level works great, makes things easier when hanging pictures.  has on off switch making it hands free.  stud finder though.. useless.  first of all its bulky device and instead of on off.. you have to hold down button.  huge pain when sweeping larger area.  also very inconsistent.  one sec says stud is there than second sweep no stud??  i have retired this to simply a laser level and purchased another stud finder.	-1
The laser's accuracy is downright miserable. For example...a simple project...align two picture frames along a wall. You'll be lucky if you can get within one inch top to bottom. The line "looks" so far off you grab your conventional level.	-1
I do not understand why companies change designs on items, well I do they cheapen them. I purchased it as a gift but was disgusted to see they had replaced the metal buttons at the shovel base with plastic...which are more likely to snap. If it weren't for the HUGE box it was shipped in (could have fir 6 shovels in that box) I would have returned it	-1
This shovel is for a child not an adult.  You MAY be able to use it as an emergency shovel for the car!	-1
I bought this to place in the trunk of my car in case of an emergency.  I thought I'd made a good puchase until I had to use the shovel.  The telescopic handle would not lock in place, causing the shovel to rotate, rendering it virtually useless.  I don't know if this is common to all these Hopkins Shovels, but I will not buy another.  Mine went in the garbage. Do not recommend whatsoever as it may fail you as it did me.  konedog	-1
I usually give 3 stars for something less satisfactory that I don't recommend for people to buy.  This product is worse than that.  I saw this just at the entrance of a well-known grocery store.  I thought it really looks nice and a clever tool.  There is a foam to place your hand in the middle which provides a nice comfortable grip.  The telescoping part just extends a few inches, it should be longer so you don't have to stoop too much.  But the main problem is it breaks too easily. It detaches it the middle where it extends.  Once it detaches, you cannot use it anymore.  Not even super glue can fix it.  This thing is also too light that it feels more like a beach toy.  I hate to call a product a POC, but this one fits the boot.	-1
Cute lights, easy to install.  Only lasted two nights.  Transformer is hot but no lights.  They did not provide much lighting.  Am trying to return.	-1
The water input broke after leaking for some time.  I won't order another one!	-1
I have had one of these about two weeks. It started leaking a little the first week. it is built so that the front tilts down slightly when it is mounted. I thought maybe the fence board I mounted it to was out of plumb, so  I added a small shim under the bottom edge to get it to be more level. It still leaked. It leaks more every day. It now leaks so much I have to turn the water off when it is full and back on when my pigs drink it dry. I also have a poorly designed chicken waterer that doesn't work. It was also manufactured by Miller Manufacturing. This waterer is the last product I will ever buy if it is made by Miller Manufacturing. Save yourself some money and time. Don't buy their products! Amazon should stop selling their products.	-1
Would have been real nice if it were specified that overall height were 4ft. You can NOT use a 4ft. fence like I ordered at the tune of $149!!! Overall allowable fence height is 3'2". Thanks	-1
Above ground height is only 38 inches. The manufacturer says in the Amazon questions that it is 42 inches. From bottom of the post to the top is only 47 inches. Quality of the post is exactly as described but units of measure are a lie.	-1
One tab has already broken off one of the posts.  Easy to install but wouldn't work without stable corner posts.	-1
Verified. you can only buy 3.  I need 10x that much.	-1
This is a light weight, plastic post.  It will not hold up through time, weight or reasonable expected use.	-1
How stupid!! What am I gonna do with only 3 sticks???	-1
Save your money mine did not last 1 year	-1
I put in my first koi pond last summer, partially above-ground, before I even knew what I was doing. As autumn approached I realized I needed a plan for winter gas exchange. Enter the deicer.  It's simply, quietly done its job. I have a plastic preformed pond and the deicer rests against the plastic but has not melted it. As I write this, we are in the midst of the January '14 polar vortex. In West Virginia it's -9. I was quite sure the deicer wouldn't be able to keep up, but I just went out there and there's an open hole around it. All is well.  Update: All is not well.  The deicer failed just when I needed it most. It's 0 again and I checked the pond and there's a solid 4 inches of ice on it. I spent 15 minutes trying to thaw it with hot water and was minimally successful. Perhaps this device just isn't able to handle polar temperatures. But that doesn't do me much good, does it? I have no way of knowing if my fish are alive or dead. Disappointed.  Next year I will buy a heater rather than a decier.	-1
I have been buying this unit for years. None of them last more than a season. This one in particular shuts on and off and the area around it ices over. Extremely not dependable. Liked this unit because of the high wattage, and was hoping that maybe each new one would be better than the last. But this unit is the worst of the many that i have bought. Will look for another brand.	-1
So Far so good,the previous Farm Innovators pond heaters that I've used would maybe last two years.  I just got tired of returning (warranty) them and I thought I would try this version.  Updated review-don't waste your money.  It lasted about 2 months.  No more Farm Innovators for me.....	-1
This is my second Alligator lopper.  My first one I bought 10 years ago accidentally damaged cord.  It should have worn itself out but was a faithful tool in my shed for years!  I used it for branches and bamboo.  I bought this new one and the chain came off after 3 minutes of use.  I was very disappointed.  I can't manage to get the chain back on because the bolts are too tight.  I took it to a mechanic and he told me to throw it away.  I would return it, but I trashed the packaging.  I'm afraid of buying another, but I loved my old one.	-1
Interesting idea but cumbersome to use.  Hardly use it in years now.	-1
If you try anything more than a soft 1" branch, you'll find this chain saw stalls, or the chain comes off.  You can probably use a compound lopper to cut most things that this will handle and you won't have any of those problems.  The only good thing about this saw is it looks like a tool I should own.  Now I know better.	-1
<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Black-Decker-LP1000-Alligator-Lopper-4-5-Amp-Electric-Chain-Saw/dp/B000BANMUY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Black & Decker LP1000 Alligator Lopper 4.5 Amp Electric Chain Saw</a> This seemed to be the perfect product. A genius design, it pretty much completely eliminates the possibility of injury to the user or the chain when cutting limbs and small shoots even in the worst possible conditions. An intelligent seven-year old could safely operate it. However, after a few years of minimal use, a ridiculous factory defect rendered my Alligator saw useless. As I use it, just as the jaws come completely closed, the motor cuts out; stops cold. Slamming the jaws open and closed jostles something inside back into place and then the saw runs correctly for a while... until it happens again. There is nothing wrong with the saw mechanically. When the electrical circuit is correct, the saw works perfectly. However, due to shoddy attention to detail and workmanship, the saw, a perfect machine, is useless. Quality control? Design flaw? Whatever. A great product is rendered JUNK by stupid carelessness. I disassembled the the saw as far as I could go. It was pretty obvious that I would not be able to get it back together, but it didn't matter as the saw was useless anyway. At a certain point I just put the whole mess into a cardboard box and threw it away. I would buy another one, but after getting this lemon, why take chance. Black and Decker, an old tried-and-true company, has shamed itself.	-1
doesn't work for my papayas. through fruit is a round type papaya not like the ones you buy in store. this type papaya came from Dominican Republic via a friends father who brought the seeds over & gave me a tree & I have been seeding & growing new trees over the years.  it will not hold fruit good	-1
I bought 2 of these specifically to pick tightly packed papaya off the tree.  Doesn't work. Not even close. For easy things like citrus, apples, mangos, etc, there are cheaper and better ways to pick the fruit. I use it maybe 1% of the time when picking fruit.	-1
I picked about thirty apples before the plastic arm broke.  I returned it. Useless.	-1
Flimsy.  Difficult to twist while clamping the fruit.  Probably once was a good idea but got " dummied down"  in order to save a few pennies.  It still gets the oranges at the top of the tree but takes some work to keep the orange in the device since it does not clamp.  Basically YOU ARE THE CLAMP and you have to twist while pulling the clamping rope and then you can try to bring down the fruit.  It is not easy.  Overall, I would NOT recommend because of the cheap, non clamping and difficult twisting motion needed to get the fruit.	-1
Okay, was going to say 'I hate it.' But I'll give it two stars. I grow mostly papaya, and reviews were good for this. Nope. It slips off the fruit and does not twist at all! I can see using it for citrus, maybe avocados. But do NOT buy this for papayas. It simply does not do the job. (Or see for yourself!)	-1
This fruit picker is a piece of cheap plastic that would not last a month, even if one could assemble it and get it to function. The assembly instructions are confusing, but after a while I understood what they were trying tell me. There is a piece of poor quality double sided tape that is supposed to hold the anchor (another cheap plastic piece) for the rope to the pole, but the tape would  not stick to the pole. The rope itself came out of the picker end before I could even try to put the whole thing together. I couldn't even assemble this device to try it out.  This seemed like a good idea if, like me, you are always poking holes in your fruit with the "claw" type pickers. But this thing is a gimmick and a piece of junk. Save your money and time; this thing is a waste of both.	-1
I wanted to dissuade grackles and blackbirds from hogging all the food I set out for the birds.  I wanted the little ones - nuthatches, juncos, chickadees, goldfinch and titmice - to dine in peace.  I thought this feeder would keep the large birds at bay.  It does not.  And it also makes it easy for squirrels to access the food. Within two days the squirrels had destroyed the feeder - they chewed right through the plastic.  Waste of money.	-1
OK, so who'da' know'd it...sparrows are clingers!  I guess I should've known.  Put this nice little feeder out. No grackles, no starlings.  However, the Sparrows Crips Gang descended on this feeder like flies on dog sh....uh...that is...like bees to honey.  Seriously, the sparrows mobbed this feeder and completely emptied it on Day One.  And Day Two.  The big birds like the grackles and starlings would have nothing to do with it.  The cardinals, mourning doves, more sparrows, wrens, more sparrows gathered under the feeder to get the cast-offs.  I'll try to block-off some of the holes that empty to the feeding tray.  I used a songbird mix and an exclusive sunflower seed, but the sparrows emptied it each day.  I'm going to try to insert something in the feeder to block off some of the feeder holes.  Not impressed.  Heck , my upside-down suet feeder lasts longer than this!	-1
Here is another one the birds just don't like.  Since it is another one for clingers, I have to assume we just don't have enough of that type of bird.	-1
I bought this feeder to keep the more expensive clinger seed in, hoping the starlings & house sparrows couldn't get at it, but it's a failure. Clinger birds (woodpeckers, chickadees, nuthatches, titmice, etc) love this feeder, but unfortunately ALL the annoying territorial birds I was hoping to keep away (grackles, starlings, house sparrows)learned to use it too. Another disadvantage of this feeder is--unless you seal up the crack around the hanger with tape, etc. the feeder fills with water when it rains turning it into an aquarium of floating birdseed :( The only good thing about it is it's easy to clean.	-1
While it certainly smells good it hasn't done it's job as a deterrent to the little critter.  I've only seen one mouse in the house and we know him/her because of a distinct marking.  I eventually killed it with a the Victor Easy Set Mouse trap.  A small piece of bread and peanut butter did the trick in one hour.	-1
This kit is horrible - when compared to other kits.  With the standard kit you get 5 boards - 3 for the table and 2 for the bench seats.  For this table and two benches you need to mess around with 20 boards!  Clean 20 boards.  Stain/paint 20 boards.  Align 20 boards.  And cut 4 boards to a different length then the rest.  And trying to get 20 good 2x4s that are perfectly straight is a futile effort.  I think the table does look nicer, but it is not worth the hassle and work compared to other picnic table kits.  The reason I bought this kit was for the resin frame.  The picnic table this is replacing is the standard 5 boards with the metal frame, but after around 20 years the frame has become weak and you can no longer sit on it.  Otherwise the wood is still good.  I guess I don't see any reason why one couldn't use a wider board with this resin frame kit - just have to measure to make sure they fit properly.  If I had to do it over I would just buy the 5 board kit again.  I received 2 different types of screws with this kit - one kind for the table and a different kind (regular deck screws) for the benches.  You would think they would be the same, wouldn't you?  I put my parent's picnic table together when I was a kid (standard 5 boards with a metal frame) and didn't have the problems I had with this setup.  Messing around with all of the 2x4s just isn't worth it.  Update - a couple of more things.  The deck screws that come with the bench are 2", so if you don't drive them at an angle you may come out the wood on the other side.  The diagram directions do show the screws going in at a angle, but there are no written directions with the benches (the table has written directions and no diagram directions) so I just wanted to point this out so others don't put them straight through.  I did not have a problem since I put them in at an angle.  Also - shame on you Amazon for putting the shipping labels directly over the diagram directions - on both packages!  Couldn't remove the shipping labels without tearing the diagram directions.  And think about the longterm - when it comes time to re-paint/stain you are either going to have to skip doing it inbetween the boards or you are going to have to remove them.  I would never buy this kit again and wish I hadn't.  8/28/08 - update.  I ordered another bench to do what another person had done and suggested - put a support in the center of each bench to help supoort and firm things up.  I highly recommend doing this (if you were unlucky enough to purchase this kit).  My bench was only 6 ft long, but still had some wobble (probably because of the cheap deck screws).  So, for 2 benches you would purchase 3 of the bench frames and split the one between the two for center supports.  With this bench I received the CORRECT SCREWS!  The shorter, silver, bigger head screws - they secure so much better!  The 2" deck screws I received with the other two benches are just the standard ugly 2" deck screws that if you are not careful to dril at an angle you will put them all the way through the wood.  The heads on them are also much smaller so they do not secure very well and in some cases are small enough to go into/through the plastic slots.  It sure would have been nice to have received the correct screws with everything.  I have spent $181.21  - 3 benches, 1 table, the wood, a gallon of stain and a couple of ultra cheap/disposable brushes.  Not worth the money or time. I highly recommend NOT getting this kit being they can't even include the correct screws.  There are much cheaper kits that are much easier to put together and come with the correct hardware.	-1
I initially thought I liked this product . But I am glad that  I waited a while before writing my review . Although initially this went together well and seemed sturdy enough ... after 6 months or so of use there is a real issue with the quality . The plastic first started to crack in each location where  a screw is used to secure it to the wood sections ... soon thereafter a crack developed in an entirely different area on one of the legs . It seems as though the Suns UV rays has caused the plastic to become brittle . A 6 month life expectancy is very disappointing !	-1
Just buy a table & chairs at Ikea and cal it a day. By the time I hauled the lumber from Lowes (and 2x4's are NOT cheap) and put this thing together with the GARBAGE instructions that came with it, it was not worth the money.  I even checked the website and the instructions are just as bad there, sad from a company in the US that doesn't even have real instructions. ALSO you need to seal the lumber you are using so that is an additional expense. Again, you can buy a nice poly table & chairs that will last longer for less money and hassle than this gave me. I would not recommend this for anyone.	-1
Waste of time and money, if your boards are not flat or decide to twist or wrap later, then your legs will not touch the four evenly and your table will be arockin.	-1
To much work to assemble plus need to buy 2 x 4 boards	-1
Not thrilled at all.  While the plastic is attractive enough, once constructed it is too wobbly for our taste.  The screws seem like they could easily break the plastic once stressed after some sun damage has occurred.  It is comfortable enough, but for the money you are just getting two pieces of resin or whatever and a package of screws, so it would be nice if it felt tight and sturdy at least when first assembled, but it doesn't.  The predecessor bench we replaced, was sun-brittle white PVC that eventually cracked but at least it stayed pretty tight to the very end.	-1
cheap stuff.... looks like trailer trash would like it.	-1
JUNK!  Save your $$$	-1
It just came with the two legs, I still have to go buy the wood and have someone make it.	-1
it is a terrible table the legs are made of plastic I could have built one myself out of all wood very poorly made very poorly put together isn't dumb idea I would like my money back	-1
I bought this to replace one that broke in my picnic table set. The bench has no stability in the side ways direction. The board in the bottom is not properly supporting the bench. I added a board across the ends of the bottom board and some 45 degree braces to add strength to the bench	-1
This is one of the most annoying garden hoses I've ever had.  It seems to get hung up and kink constantly so it is very frustrating to use.  I wouldn't buy it again nor would I recommend it to anyone.  I had to buy a replacement even though its still in good shape (I bought it last year) so I went back to my white Boating-RV hose which I replaced when it finally got a leak after years of service..	-1
We use this hose for our RV. If used in temps below about 80 degrees, it becomes impossible to completely unroll and re-coil for storage, and kinks easily at any temp. The female end tends to leak, even with a washer in it. After the first few trips I purchased a non kinking hose from a different manufacturer and greatly prefer it over this one. I keep this in the RV as a spare for parks where the water is far from the rig and I have to use multiple hoses.	-1
Well, I fell for it... I purchased a Valterra tank wand for cleaning out the black tank in my RV.  Under what, 'others' purchased to go along with that item, was a faucet adapter, and a short hose.  The idea was to connect the wand to the bathroom faucet to use the wand.  While the adapter and hose fit, there is 'nowhere near' the  water pressure coming out of the bathroom faucet needed for the wand to clean the tank!	-1
It squirts a hard jet out sideways quite nicely.  However, I need one that has a light and a camera lens in it so I know when I'm pointing it at something that needs squirting.  As it is a I just blindly squirt and squirt into the black abyss.  My score is zero as I don't think I've ever hit one of the 4 sensors that are not working.	-1
Does what it says.  Not heavily built but it doesn't need to be.  Great to keep on hand while camping in case you need to blast a clog in your tank.  Buy this one to get the job done and you'll look at it to see how you can pick up parts at Lowes for probably $25 to build one that will last through the next 3 RV's.  ** Update ** Changing my review, this is a brittle piece of crap.  Only lasted a few months with about 3 uses.  In fact the head broke off while I was blasting the holding tank and the head went into the tank.  Buy parts and make one from PVC and it will outlast 5 campers.	-1
This worked well for two years but valves quit working with no warning other than dried out plants. The valves must be treated as short term throwaways. It may not be worth risking your plants to this.	-1
What it is: a portable watering timer with several water outlets you connect hoses to. what it really is: a waste of money  The valves have plastic barrels which tend to break if stressed.  They cannot deal well with freezing. None of the valves I bought lasted even a year.  Most didn't even last until the first freeze.  Original review: This unit has a manifold with electric valves that connects to a hose bib.  It has a timer module that can be removed for programming, then re-attached to the valves when ready.  This makes it easier to program and use.  All this is great.  But:  The barrels on the timer valves are plastic, not metal.  That's the "pipe" part with the valve in it that turns the water on and off.  Both threaded ends are plastic, the bit of pipe that connects them (the barrel) is plastic.  If you have high water pressure and need to have tight connections, or if you yank a hose by accident (put stress on the valve barrel), it will break.  If the barrels were unbreakable, or made of metal so they wouldn't break easily, it'd be a different story - these would be a 5-star product. But since they do break easily, it's one-star for a good idea and cheap implementation.	-1
This is my second season using this timer with 3 zones on a 30' x 50' garden.  It helps me utilize my low water pressure well.  I water each zone in series for 1/2 hour each morning.  The orbit fits the bill great for what I need.  I gave the timer 4 instead of 5 stars, because the LCD interface isn't bad, but it isn't easy, especially when you first pull it out in the Spring.  Update 5/17/2013:  These suck. The second season was the end of it - they didn't last.  I treated it well, and it stopped working anyway.	-1
On the surface, this looked to be an ideal solution for controlling the three separate sprinklers that I need for my side and back yard. It quickly became apparent that there are some serious quality control issues with this kit.  Within a week of installing it one of the valves began to "sing."  No water was flowing through it but it was resonating throughout the whole house. I called Orbit's customer service department and they sent out a replacement that arrived within about a week or so. A second valve has subsequently failed. The original 4-port manifold leaked badly and one of the ports wouldn't open, requiring me to replace it with a better-quality model.  What's worse, however, is the ridiculously short life I'm getting from the batteries. One set of three AA batteries will last only about 2 weeks. Upon replacement, I have to reprogram the entire system over from scratch. By contrast, the two-valve Melnor system that this device was to replace will give me two years' service from four AAs. I have no problem replacing batteries once or twice a growing season, but NOT every two weeks and especially not when it comes to having to re-program a complex watering program from scratch.  I will also echo the other complaints about not being able to program the individual valves for different days/times.  This doesn't sound like rocket science - to have a timed system that opens and closes 4 valves when you want them to open and close, yet nobody has successfully implemented it that I can find. I'm almost afraid to consider an irrigation system if timers are this unreliable.	-1
Installation was very easy with the included manifold and the valves fit perfectly onto the manifold itself.  I ended up buying two systems.  However, the valves open only unreliably so keeping a seed bed damp in a new lawn is impossible.  Offhand, five of eight valves open reliably, three of eight open only one time in three.  The timespan between a valve closing and another (or the same one) opening is around 90 seconds.  When the valve does not open, the reset time is similar.  This equals a lot of time waiting for a valve that won't open.  I've also had trouble with the displays blanking out if they get damp (not wet, just damp).  This requires resetting the entire system and reprogramming time, day, and schedules.  All in all, this system disappoints for its price.	-1
The base doesn't fit my umbrella -- the hole is only 1-1/2" inches in diameter.  My umbrella pole is 1-7/8". Nowhere in the Amazon ad is the pole diameter mentioned.  Also, read the fine print: "To prevent rusting, the base should be protected from constant exposure to rain and moisture."  In other words, don't use it outside.	-1
We bought this to go with the Strathwood St. Thomas set and it is not the same color or design but was close enough not to return.  Then a month later we see it is already rusting...we have it out by the pool.  Not happy.	-1
We just got this item a month ago and it's already rusty. The interesting thing is that it only rained 2 or 3 times. In their description it says "To prevent rusting, the base should be protected from constant exposure to rain and moisture." So, I guess you'll need to bring it inside any time it rains. Very convenient! What cheap garbage!	-1

The pump works but head pressure is weak. No where close to its specs for flow. I have it going up 10 inches from head and then routes back down at head level. Using exact same size tubing as outlet on pump. Maybe getting 300-400 gallons/hr. Though I have had no issues for the past few months and flow has stayed the same. I have it pumping clear water so there is no reason it should be delivering higher flow.	-1
Loved an older version of this product, but this one is dead after just a few weeks.  Hoping the warranty comes in handy.	-1
Great little pump	-1
These pumps are fairly basic. Not a whole lot of moving parts to go wrong as long as you use a decent prefilter - the impeller may need replacing from time to time, but that should be it. Unfortunately, I am now going on my FOURTH one in 8 years. To be fair, my house came with the first one, so I have no idea how old it was, but that one died within the first year of my ownership. I then bought a second one, which lasted for approximately 6 years. Not terrible, but disappointing that it only outlived the warranty by 20%. In June 2011, I bought a third one. Just over 10 months later, that one died. There is virtually no troubleshooting online, so I called Danner customer assistance. The woman I spoke with did not do any troubleshooting with me. She just told me to mail it back in and they would repair it because it is still under warranty. I told her about my previous ones, and she told me that 6 years was a good lifespan to get from one of these units, so it is not surprising. I then asked her how long it would take to get the repaired unit back (I have a pond full of koi that are dependent on a working filtration system). She told me that if I FedEx'd it in, they would turn it around as quickly as they could, but that it would be sent back out ground. Unfortunately, the cost to Fedex the unit was outrageous because of the weight, and it would still leave me without a pump for well over a week. Therefore, I ended up gritting my teeth and buying a FOURTH via Amazon Prime so I would get it this week yet and thus keep my fish alive. I will still send unit #3 in to get repaired as it is under warranty, but I will likely end up keeping it as a backup. After all, I pretty much expect the units to die just after warranty expiration. Very frustrating!  ***UPDATE***  (8/26/14) I am now on my FIFTH pump. They seem to die almost like clockwork every 12 months. I checked my purchase history on Amazon, and I have bought a new one every June for the past 4 years!  I suspect part of the problem is that there is not a good prefilter on the market for these units. The one that comes with it has to be cleaned out every week or so or else it gets clogged up and collapses on itself (even though it has a "rigid" brace in it to supposedly prevent that). All it takes is one prefilter fail and the pump dies, which is pretty unacceptable. I'm getting quite frustrated with it, but I have not been able to find any alternatives at this point.	-1
Not happy.  Prefilter doesn't come with foam filter as indicated.  Comes with a cheap plastic cage that doesn't stay screwed together.  It doesn't work with my Pondmaster filter set up-fittings are different. Instead of a cone that you slide the hose onto...it is now a female fitting with treads inside.  I was happy with my old Pondmaster pump-worked great for 10 years....just started to leak.  I am hoping I can find a fitting to make this work....If not I have to send it back.	-1
I bought two of these to run my large pond. Both of them stopped functioning in less that one year. It couldn't have been just poor quality of one pump since they both stopped functioning at about the same time.  Find another alternative.	-1
I think this constitutes fraud. The belt does not replace what it is supposed to. It shows up in a zip lock bag and the ID# and other information has been blacked out with a black marker. The belt is to narrow and to long as the other reviewers state. Save your money and shop elsewhere.	-1

DON'T BUY!!!!!!!!!  THIS IS TRASH. I tried 2 of these.  Nothing!  Moved it around on the roof, tried different spots, put the signal cable in ice water, I mean frozen water well below 30 degrees.  Did not turn on.  Now the company won't return.  By the time we got the first snow, 45 days later the 30 day return was over.  I GOT SCREWED!  This company is a rip off.  Its still on the roof.  Frozen again.  Still nothing!	-1

Not reliable.to many conditions to depend on sensor working.although you might be luck.	-1
While we had great hope for the 200 foot cable, it proved completely ineffective (in Connecticut.)  We purchased the cable together with the thermostat (Easy Heat RS-2 Automatic Roof De-Icing Cable Control).  A roofing contractor installed the cables and thermostat.  Precisely as per instructions.  Soon enough, we realized that the cable control didn't work at all.  Regrettably, we only found out after considerable ice dams had built up and water damage had created havoc inside the house (we had installed an entirely new roof a mere three months ago and had covered the roof entire surface with an ice and water barrier shield.)  In an effort to mitigate further problems, we circumvented the cable control (thermostat.)  Again, it was of no use.  The cable, while emitting some heat, did not control the ice build-up at all.  We will remove the cables after the winter.  It is tremendously regrettable.  We certainly believed that after installing an entirely new roof (with allegedly over-the-top water-proof measures taken), the cable would add another (theoretically unnecessary) layer of security.  Instead, we will be battling not only the weather in the remaining winter months, but with the roofing contractor and the insurance company as well.	-1
Had to wait for weather to get just right (temp & moisture) to see if this item worked. By the time the conditions were right, the return or replacement of this item's eligibility had expired. I now have a complete section of my roof that is unprotected from the ice build up. The RS-2 Automatic De-icing Cable Control. Does not work. So I now have to buy another or just let the cable run on it's own, which will run my electric bill thru the roof. The other units I bought  directly from another Easy Heat are working just fine. I don't recommend buying one thru Amazon.	-1
I have the Easy Heat cable system on our house and love the cable portion of it. However, the RS-2 control units are unreliable.  I installed 2 RS-2 controllers on our system, under the eve as directed. Both controllers failed after less than 5 months.  Great concept........... poor quality.	-1
Followed the instructions and mounted under eave and ran the sensor up along de-icing cable, however the device never seemed to work properly with both moisture and temperature - its indicator light was always on.  Since my outdoor outlet was run to a timer anyhow, I ended up just setting the timer to be on only during the daytime hours as opposed to 24 hours. That was a decent bypass for awhile, however now the unit won't even switch on it's outlet, so I'll need to bypass it altogether with an extension cord.  If the cabling wasn't buried under a slab of snow i'd return it, but now there is no way to do so until my roof melts.  Come spring, it's going back and i'm finding a different vendor.  Bummer, sounded like promising technology.	-1
Installation was easy.  The unit worked great for 2 season and then failed completely half way through its second season.  I was going to give it one more try. But, now that I see other comments from consumers who had the unit fail as well, it sounds like mine failing was not a fluke.  Great product if you want to replace it every year.  For over $100 I'm not willing to do that.	-1
Difficult to get am accurate reading off the provided color chart.  I bought a digital ph meter.  Takes a lot of product to change even the slightest bit.  With that it does work.  Definite learning process	-1
The PH up is crap. I had to use 20x more then the ph down. I'm going to chalk it up to a bad batch, and buy something more reliable. Buyer beware!	-1
