This game is a bit hard to get the hang of, but when you do it's great.	1
I played it a while but it was alright. The steam was a bit of trouble. The more they move these game to steam the more of a hard time I have activating and playing a game. But in spite of that it was fun, I liked it. Now I am looking forward to anno 2205 I really want to play my way to the moon.	1
found the game a bit too complicated, not what I expected after having played 1602, 1503, and 1701	-1
great game, I love it and have played it since its arrived	1
i liked a lot some time that i haven't play a wonderfull game very simply and funny game verry good game.	1
I'm an avid gamer, but Anno 2070 is an INSULT to gaming.  It is so buggy and half-finished that the first campaign doesn't even work properly and the DRM is INCREDIBLY frustrating to deal with.  Once you manage to work your way past the massive amounts of bugs and get through the DRM, HOURS later you finally figure out that the game has no real tutorial, so you stuck just clicking around randomly.  Sad, sad, sad, example of a game that could have been great but FTW.	-1
I bought this game thinking it would be pretty cool and that i might play it for a  week or two and be done.  Boy was I wrong! From the moment I finally got the gamed Fired up (the other commentors on this are right, it takes forever and u are forced to create an account) I watched as it booted up I could tell right off the bat that ALOT of thought went into making this game. If you have ever played Sim city, then this game is a must try as you will easily navigate thru it and its multi layers. I have been playing htis now for a month straight, and I am STILL discovering layers of complexity in the game. There are a few things in the game that could used tweaked, but all in all this is a 5 star game.	1
I have played the old anno 1701 AND 1503.  this game looks great but is more complex than the previous versions of the game. I found a lot of things lacking such as the sources of power and an inability to store energy with batteries or regenertive fuel cells as buildings in the game need power. Trade is about the same. My main beef with this it requires an internet connection. Other than that it has wonderful artistry and graphics. It is the same as anno 1701 but set in a future world where global warmming as flood the land and resource scarcity has sent human kind to look to the deep ocean for valuable minerals. I recoment the deep ocean expansion or complete if you get this. I found the ai instructor a little corny but other than that the game has some real polish. I wrote my 2 cents worth on suggestions on anno 2070 wiki and you can read 3 pages on that for game ideas I had.	1
I liked it and had fun with it, played for a while and got my money's worth.  You can certainly go further than I did but I got frustrated with the fact that here we are in this new start and still taking from the earth rather than living with it. Better than simcity in that respect and maybe the best we could hope for.	1
4 Stars because they like it and play it often enough so don't feel like money is wasted. I got them one each so they can multiplay with each other.	1
I've bought and played ALL of the ANNO games since 1602, and spent more hours than I can even count building massive empires with extremely complex trade routes. I was thrilled to see another installment released, but I absolutely will NOT pay for something that limits my hardware changes and installs.  Wake up UBI, look at all of your other software title reviews, both here on Amazon and on gaming sites. People are not as stupid as you think, and will simply find a different game to fill their time with and throw their money at if their freedoms are inhibited by your software.  By adding DRM you've actually promoted the use of piracy instead of reduced it, because those that really do want to play it will find a way.	-1
Loved playing Dirt 2 and I thought the graphics were good.  Purchased Dirt 3 as an addition to the other...and the graphics are absolutely "Gorgeous"  If you liked Dirt or Dirt 2...you are going to love Dirt 3.  The game was easier to configure with my Logitech wireless rumblepad...and with my EVGA GTX 580, and all detail set to full on graphics at 1920 x 1080 I get over 100 fps.  The game looks good, plays well and is a blast!	1
I'm not quite finished with the game's DiRT Tour mode, but I believe I've experienced the bulk of what the game has to offer.  And I'm happy to say that the game is indeed awesome.  Great cars, great tracks and racing modes, excellent gameplay and graphics.  The highlight has been racing in the snow on various tracks in Aspen.  There are also some really cool obstacle courses on pavement, which are new to the series.  At first, I felt that the game was plagued with the same difficulty spike DiRT 2 had, where you can win any race without trying on casual difficulty, then lose big time on medium.  Then I found the custom difficulty settings where you can choose from 5 levels of challenge, then pick and choose from all the other assists and handling options.  Basically, you can let the game play itself by just holding the throttle and steering, or take gradual steps to reach what you feel works best for you.  Love this feature!  Sadly, there is no option to increase the 360 controller's dead zone or adjust the sensitivity.  I'm doing ok as is, but some tweaking would be ideal.  Much like the previous two games, the handling is a bit flighty.  But that's speeding on loose ground for you.  Still, I feel things have tightened up somewhat since DiRT 2.  Still no cigar, but it's a step forward.  The game runs as smooth as silk on my 560ti wih all the settings maxed.  No issues whatsoever.  If you enjoy racing games, this is not one you should ignore.  It's the best DiRT so far.	1
lot of people don't like RALLY because they already tried gran turismo game. to tell you the truth gran turismo RALLY physic is just boring boring boring. gran turismo only good for racing simulation but RALLY part is suck!!!!  dirt 2 amazed me how much fun it was and now dirt 3 with 3 time more race tracks than dirt 2.  MUST BUY!!!!!!!!!!	1
I had Dirt 2 on Xbox 360 and it was an okay game. I started playing games on my laptop and bought a few new games to build my collection. This game is very fun to play. It is so much better than Dirt 2. If you like racing games you should check this out. The graphics are perfect on my compter.	1
This is a must have for any gamer. Codemasters really hit a home run on this one. I would like to see F1 2011 be this good using the ego engine 2.0 and the physics model in this game is right on the money. This game is the reason everyone should buy the best graphics card they can afford. I am using a nvidia 460 overclocked, and I have on order a 590. I want to run this game with everything on highest level. I swear to you that even with the 460 + , the graphics are very realistic and I really enjoy racing at ground level. This game makes Codemasters the king of graphics realism. BUY THIS GAME !!!!!  December 6, 2011  I saw my review of the Internet and wanted to update it for you. First of all anyone with this program, BUY the extra environments and cars. It is money well spent and a first class job of an addon. I wanted everyone to know that this program is still the top of the heap in graphics. I bought Battlefield 3 and it is good, but not the standard of the ego 2 engine. Codemasters are the king of graphics so far and I find that the more realism a game has, the more adicted you will become. No other program running with all variables to the max, looks like Dirt 3. Thank God for codemasters and I can hardly wait for GRID 2 in the summer.	1
I'm sure I would love the game, if I could play it, I have loved all the Hitman games thus far.  The one star is due to steam.  Steam is absolutely beyond annoying and they do NOT help you if you ask them.  I found out after I purchased it that windows xp does not support direct X-10.  I do have a high end video card but it doesn't make a difference.  I recommend that no one purchase any games or other items that require steam.  Perhaps then they will fix all the problems or go out of business (my favorite option).  I am very good with computers (built mine) so that is not the problem.  As always it's a steam issue.	-1
Update June 2013: Deeply disappointed at the lack of a non-linear open-world environment. But its the restrictive QTE gameplay and final-kill cut-scenes that kill the game for me. I loath enforced QTE. When a mission goes awry and you're trying to escape a hail of bullets, if you happen to brush past an assailant you can't escape QTE mode. Meanwhile you're being shot at from all sides. It just lacks the sense of freedom that Blood Money had, and it takes you out of the whole gaming experience placing you instead into a second-rate interactive movie.  As a loyal fan of the Hitman franchise, I waited years for this. I would have loved if they had added driving into the game in order to rival Saints Row or the GTA series etc. What they did add took away from the game. For instance they should have kept the semi-open-worlds of Blood Money and build-on those beautiful sets, maps and locations.  I would have loved if Hitman had been as open as Skyrim. Overall Dishonored's gameplay is a far superior hitman style gaming experience. But I wish they had had Bioshock Infinite's breathtaking visuals in that particular game.  ==================================================================  Wow after all these years waiting-- this is it.....?!!!  I am still a huge fan of Blood Money. The fact that you can now play it again online for free is a huge plus! To play, all you have to do is watch a 30-second ad on mute and you get sufficient time to play a level. Who can complain about that? But this, what took them so long to produce a bad cousin of Metal Gear Solid?!  Intuition....? STOP! STOP! STOP Please let me use my own intuition! And what is it with the game constantly talking to you like you're an idiot? All this serves to do is kill any the sense of atmosphere, tension and suspense!  You want to know how bad this game is....? They use cut scenes for the final kill, thus killing any sense of pay off! And you can't even skip through the intro level! Hello? This was a cult game... So lots of people know how to play it and don't need this hand holding to be mandatory!  The graphics too are little improvement over Blood Money, and are definitely a let down compared to the current generation of games. There is less of a non-linear feel about this version also. Now you're not quite tied to a string as you walk through levels, but its sub par compared with the freedom of its predecessor IMHO.  Such a shame, such a shame. But good for me as I embark on a career in Video Game Design. It gives me confidence that I might have something better to bring to the table.	-1
I will open with the Pros: Replayability - It's Hitman. What did you expect? You can go back and replay missions over and over to try for a cleaner, quicker kill or just fly right through it in a weekend like I did. Length of game - Do not listen to reviews such as Xbox Official Magazine saying it is a lengthy game. I finished it in one weekend. Friday night, Sat and Sunday. I would estimate around 10-12 hours solid play. BUT..If you go back and replay the missions for a better score, then it can drag out much further. But like I said, to play through and complete the tasks, it is not a long game. Story - Not bad at all. A few plot holes made me scratch my head but not bad. Overall Graphics - Better than the old Hitman games but nothing at all like cut scenes. Don't confuse cut scenes in the trailers as gameplay. Character dev - Although they give you a little info on specific targets, it didn't seem worth the effort to look any deeper into their back story. I just went forth on a killing spree. You point me in that direction? Here I go. There's no option to ever take a person into custody and question them. You kill anyone who you are pointed at. Hand to hand - They kept it simple. between space bar, "Q, W or E" were your controls to hit when it told you to hit that key. It wasn't hard to do hand to hand. It wasn't 100% awesome like Batman but it was pretty good. Cons: OMG why did all the people in close-up cut scenes talk with all their teeth showing? It really got annoying. I have never in my life met a person who talks like that. Also, the timing of the voice acting was bad. Serious delays in dialogue had me thinking the conversation was over then it started up again. So, voice acting wasn't bad, but developers did a poor job clipping it. Graphics - In regards to clipping, I would sometimes get blocked by phantom walls while sneaking up steps. I had to walk back and forth until it let me pass. Also, it would say there was a key point right in front of me (blinking sonar circles) and there was nothing there. No desk, nothing to pick up and it was floating in the air. More developer issues. (Minor Spoiler) Don't read if you can't take hints. Sheer ease of killing other professional hitmen was a let down. I couldn't believe how easy it was to kill hired professionals.  Professional Edition: Do not waste your money. I got some weapons you can't even use in the game. It gives you the loadout at the begining and the weapons around the map are all based off that part of the game. No point in having access to the additional weapons. Sniper challenge is ONE challenge. I beat it hands down and it never took me to a new challenge. It just lets you do the same challenge over and over. All in all, it's a good game discounted at 1/2 price or lower. Don't waste your $ on the Pro Edition.	1
i like bf games and this works with my wireless xbox 360 controller ( i don't have a xbox i use it for pc games)	1
Good game	1
This installment introduces some unusual elements to the series -- mainly the "instinct" gauge, which lets you look through walls and avoid raising suspicions, but I sort of miss the older approach where keeping your distance and hiding your face did the trick. (Plus you have to refill said gauge by disabling or killing enemies to be able to use it once it runs out). The visuals are vastly improved from Blood Money of course, and I appreciate their allowing me to play with my gamepad.  Some have criticized the fact that this game has "too much story" in it. I may be biased (even if I play an anti-hero, I like him having some motivation to pursue a course of action), but I didn't feel that the story took anything away from the gameplay.	1
It's not exactly like previous Hitman games, but it is still true enough to the series and fun in its own right to be a good game. Not great, but worth the sale price. SCORE: 80/100.  Graphics are like most Squeenix games are now: amazing (Tomb Raider, Hitman Absolution, Deus Ex, Sleeping Dogs - they nail it HARD). Played on ULTRA at 1600p and it's a beast. It taxes the ASUS 290x even more than Tomb Raider, but I don't think it looks any better, so maybe not optimized as well. Regardless, stunning.  It is a bit more closed-in and linear but not linear in the way a platformer is or anything. Still multiple ways to solve objectives.  They have already said the next one will be true to form. Update this already beautiful engine, make it open world, and bam, perfect Hitman.	1
This game requires that you open an online account to play the game. A constant online source is required. Gave the game away.	-1
I bought this and the key didn't work.  It was a gift, and the recipient wasn't able to solve the problem.  It might have been a good game, but I never found out because the key failed.	-1
1st shipment received a book instead of the game. 2nd shipment got a FAKE one. Game arrived with a wrong key inside on sealed box. I got in contact with codemasters and send them pictures of the DVD and the content. They said nothing they can do its a fake DVD.  Returned it good bye.!	-1
I still haven't figured this one out. Did everything as instructed but the game never installed. Strange. Since I don't like to rate on something I couldn't get to work, I'll just say that I didn't like it because I couldn't get it to work :P For those that did manage to get it installed, I'm sure it's a great game. I had the first Dirt and it was a scream! Too bad this one bombed. Maybe a bad disc...	-1
Dirt 3 on DVD i collect racing games so had to add this to my collection Son wated one also	1
DiRT 2 was like this.  I'm becoming more & more suspicious of games like this that require a continuous open Internet to play.  It just seems like bait set out for some young naive prey to fall for.  Does anyone honestly believe that personal information is collected for no particular reason?  I don't care what they say publicly.  Any assurances of privacy protection are quite hollow without close oversight, and nobody's looking.  It's quite a different thing to knowingly step out into a multiplayer server where you know you're being tracked, but this type of continuous spying is something more.  That aside, this carrot on a stick has more problems than just security.  CONS - Requires open Internet (Windows Live) to play.  Annoying interface.  Continuous reminders to upload and download things you already selected not to do.  Most settings don't keep between sessions.  Setting up a race takes way too long.  Irritating "music" you can't turn off (it keeps coming back).  Takes too long to unlock things.  Entire career mode is pointless when the game setup is so irritating I just wanted out.  Video stuttering (possibly my equipment).  PROS - Eye candy.  Plenty of game modes.  Enough tracks to get going.  Fairly good variety of cars.  Scaled difficulty levels from casual to advanced.  I think this franchise, like many others, continues soley for the purpose of farming user information; where it seems the real money is.  If I can't turn it off, and some else controls the on-off switch, that's a problem.  Sometimes it might be worth it, but not here.  I found some entertainment value, but very briefly.  Anyway,  just my opinion...	-1
This game was a rip-off.  It has less terrain, less tracks, and less features than DiRT 2.  The graphics are about the same.  Not worth the money, at all.	-1
The game itself is great, but Games for Windows Live is such a frustrating piece of garbage.  I wish it would just die and stop bringing down my PC gaming experience.	-1
If you like rally cars get this game you will have fun. It is more oriented to "European market" since here in America there isn't a huge rally fan party. Music it is very European and even the voices from the game very "English" accent. The multiplayer isn't the best but it works just ok.	1
It works as advertised. No issues or problems. The product was received as expected. The product worked as expected. Excellent product. Well done.	1
Overall this is a well done racing game, with very good graphics for its time period. My family has has enjoyed playing it a great deal. I personally think a steering wheel controller is almost a necessity for this game, but an x box type controller would probably work. The keyboard would be almost impossible, and not very fun. The "windows live" system detracts greatly, since you must log in and be online to play or save game progress. There was a mees up with my "Live" log in and the game would no longer accept my activation code and I had to rebuy the game if I wanted to play. There is no customer support at all. Dirt 2 suffers from this serious flaw as well. 4 1/2 star game 1 star Windows Live feature.	1
Crashed in Vista.  Codemasters told me they don't support it in Windows 8.  Couldn't get it to work even after looking on the Internet.	-1
I really enjoyed the Dirt series of racing games.  I actually started with the Colin McRae Rally 3 demo, which came before Dirt.  Dirt 1 was a nice game with lots of different types of races in varied environments, including Pike's Peak.  You got to race semi trucks, cargo trucks, trophy trucks, SUVs, and rally cars in Dirt 1.  The advancement was like a pyramid, unlocking levels as you go. I have a Toyota Tundra, so it is easy to like a game that has a Toyota Tundra to race in it.  Dirt 2 made it more radical with nice music and an attitude.  The races were longer and became more X-Games like. I enjoyed the Baja races very much. But, I did not like the Microsoft Live part of it where it takes a long time to get initiated, patched, etc before you can actually play for the first time. Once you get past this, things get better. The choice of vehicles were more limited, but the liveries try to make up for it. Dirt 3 keeps the same attitude and cool music, but also has the same Microsoft Live treatment: sign in, patch , etc. before the first game time.  Once you get past this, it does get better.  At first, I could not get used to the way the game downshifts automatically in the turns to automatically slow you down.  I moved the difficulty up a notch to intermediate and it was much better and more of what I was expecting.  I use a gamepad to play on the PC.  I was pleasantly surprised that my 9800 GTX 512 MB plays this game rather well at 1680x1050 (no AA).  The races are largely rally with some interesting winter-time truck races in the snow.  The cars are not quite as varied as I would like.  I also hate that there is in-game content that can be purchased additionally from Microsoft Live.  Come on! I already paid for the game and there are some levels that are pay to play, so you won't really finish the season until you pony up more funds to Microsoft Live.  Many of the cars are available to purchase too.  That is cheesy and not appreciated.  You don't need to purchase these to advance though.  The gymkhana events are interesting and challenging. Being a hoonigan takes practice, patience, and many banged up cars. The Ken Block videos on youtube really inspired me to practice as I had no idea what gymkhana was before Dirt 3.  I do miss the Baja style of offroading from Dirt 2.  Dirt 3 seems to have a focus on other things, but it is still fun overall. For $12, I got my money's worth.  Maybe I will get Dirt Showdown for some demolition derby excitement, or maybe not.	1
I can't tell you what a piece of dog**** this game is. Like everything else Microsoft makes- it doesn't work. When are they going to take a cue from Apple and make things that actually work the first time and every time. To log onto this game they make you jump through a series of hoops that takes like 15 min. to accomplish. If you want another disappointment from Microsoft, buy some "Games for Windows Live" games.  I just wanted a simple arcade like driving game when I have a young boy visiting. If that's what you want, don't buy this. If you want to hire a consultant to help you run this game, then buy it.  oh, one more thing, every time I do get this game to play my joystick stops working (there's Windows 7 for you)	-1
I initially gave this one star because it was crashing on me constantly but I recently narrowed it down to a plug-in I was using for my porsche wheel. Game plays well and looks gorgeous when image spanned across three monitors. I would have given it five stars if it wasn't for the annoying Microsoft Games for Live application that makes you go through hoops to set it up and causes problems of it's own (occasional crashes)	1
Installing the game was a struggle (because of games for windows live bugs).  Some championship races and cars can only be "unlocked" by buying them as an addon to the game. I paid nearly 30 dollars when the game was new. I don't like the idea that I have to keep paying to keep playing.  I noticed no improvement in the physics or graphics compared to Dirt 2.  I tossed it in the garbage and vowed never to buy another codemasters game. I'm really tired of arcade style rally/racing games anyway.  I'll continue to get my fix from Richard Burns Rally, and you should to. :) http://www.amazon.com/Richard-Burns-Rally-PC/dp/B000C97156/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1341886844&sr=8-1&keywords=richard+burns+rally  Thank you for reading my review! If you enjoyed it, be sure to rate it as helpful.	-1
In today's game market it's easy to miss racing games that aren't part of the license-heavy Forza or Gran Turismo franchises. Dirt 3 for PC is in an even worse boat than most since it's been a giveaway for a couple years now with every DX11 compliant ATI video card. As a result a lot of people who get it send it straight to eBay and most people who do play it have not bought it new.  This is a shame because Dirt 3 is a fun little game. There's a great assortment of multinational tracks, and a wide array of classic and modern rally cars to choose from. As a rally game, Dirt 3 ditches the comfortable confines of tracks and sends you headlong across snow and gravel in a world where keeping control of your car is a greater skill than making it around the turns. Dirt 3 wears a veneer of noisy, fun arcade-style game play, but under the hood it calls for quick reactions, a good understanding of road surfaces, and nerves of steel. Sadly, it also calls for a gamepad or wheel- you will almost certainly find the keyboard too all-or-nothing for serious racing.  PROS: -Visually stunning engine that makes full use of DirectX 11 effects -Soundtrack is an appealing mix of classic prog rock and modern music that does a good job of being vaguely European and not too intrusive -Successfully models an arcade-like complexity of play with a surprisingly deep simulation of track conditions and vehicle handling -In-car camera gives a stomach-churning stream of nonstop thrills as you launch over crests and 2-wheel hairpins -Probably the most realistic depiction of drifting/powersliding to appear in a video game (it's frightening, nauseating, and usually a bad idea) -3D support!  CONS: -Lower difficulties aren't much fun, highest difficulty is brutally hard -Small fanbase of hardcore racing nuts may make multiplayer a bit hard for newcomers (Dirt 3 players seem pretty nice though) -Essentially requires some sort of analog input -May confuse players who aren't familiar with the rules and conditions of rally-style racing  Other thoughts: -You need to plug your youtube credentials into the game to let it export your highlights to YouTube. I don't think CodeMasters wants to rip you off, but if it makes you uncomfortable, create a new Google identity for use with Dirt 3. Easy! -LEARN THE TRACKS. Learn the tracks, learn the tracks, learn the tracks. -If you want to win, employ a Fin!	1
I have been playing car racing games since their early beginning on PC. I currently have a logitech G25 force feedback wheel to play with. I have played most of the Colin Mc Rae, Need for speed, Grid and Dirt2 games before. I also tried my hands at more simulation oriented games like GTR, GTR2, GP Legends... Dirt2 came in as a nice and pleasant surprise. Dirt3 tops it off.  As I am sure many will detail everything about this game, I will limit myself to the most important points for me.  Pros: - Amazing graphics - Amazing physics - Challenging but entertaining races  Cons: - Gymkhana - Interface  What went through the conceptors mind about gymkhana? Racing is not easy for most but gymkhana is really a pain in the neck. I saw the videos of Ken Block on Youtube and indeed he is really impressive. Am I even dreaming of doing the same? No! Racing require good racing skills to start but Gymkhana requires a perfect control of the vehicles and most of us will never achieve such level. So I find the attemps slightly pointless and extremely frustrating.  Now, what about the interface? Simply put, it does not remotely compare with Dirt2's interface. It is messy, I had to search online to figure out where to find my best times. There are not enough info about the cars, the races, the sponsors... It leaves a lot to desire. A complete miss.  Conclusion: As far as rallye racing. This game is the best out there today. If you are one who needs crazy challenges, try the gymkhana and good luck! In spite of my criticism, I definitely do not regreat this purchase.	1
I would like give this game 4 or 5 stars, if I could get it to run. Like others the game crashes on start-up or in the game and Codemasters has been absolutely no help in correcting it. Why they can't get their asses in gear (pun intended) and fix it I don't know, but with so many folks reporting the problem it isn't just occasional. I assume they either can't replicate the problem or just don't care. Lacking any help from Codemasters, I've tried the various fan fixes, including uninstalling Rapture 3D. Also tried installing on Vista and Win 7 and that didn't help either, which is a shame since from the other reviews it seems like a great racing sim.	-1
The metal bookmark has a couple of weird flaws in it.  I wish that all the cloth maps that were included with the books individually were included in this set, but it's worth losing those to get this cool set.	1
Awesome	1
Glad I got this for my collection	1
Very nicely put together.  Crisp and clean and very good detail.	1
The box it's in perfect condition and the books are awesome, with great details, just a must have for every Zelda collector.	1
Amazing value. I cannot believe this set is available for this price. Everything from the packaging to the quality of the paper is stellar.  This set feels like it was put together with care in mind. Also worth noting is the fact that the Ocarina of Time guide can only be found in this set. Only criticism I have is that the cloth maps were not included for  Twilight Princess and Wind Waker. Still, Im very happy with my purchase.	1
Just starting to collecting.this is one of the best item i get.	1
great set of guides. no shipping damage. all books are in great shape , no misprints or upside-down pages.well worth the investment.	1
I'm a huge Zelda fan and I'm so happy to add this to my collection ^.^	1
Bought for future investing/collecting. Paper included isn't personally signed by the guy,its just a copy. and this actually dropped in price 40% in the last 9 months since I purchased.	-1
Very happy with purchase	1

great product ,	1
Wish there was more room for future game guides.	1
This is freakin awesome	1
Let me start by saying this is the best product I've ever purchased. Only $107.89 for 6 amazing great quality guides in a well built chest and a golden bookmark. These are top notch guides, well written, and well put together! HEADS UP: There's only 50,000 copies being released, and my number according to the certificate is around 49,400. That's how many they've sold in just over a year. If you want this, don't hesitate. Also, these guides are going for so much seperately! I've seen used copies go for more than this set alone! Imagine in 5 years.... These will be well worth more than you pay right now.	1
a great collectors item i don't want to get rid of anytime soon	1
best idea to put all these books in a collectors case.	1
All the major Zelda games in super cool hardbound guides.  A must have for the Zelda fanatic.	1
A must have for all Zelda & Link fans. Neat, easy to use & read, colorful, rich in text & content.	1
A nice gift for Zelda collectors.	1
Great Order. It has the guides that I need. Great Price, Gets down to every little detail in the game.	1
This is an awesome set of deluxe The Legend of Zelda video game guides. The box it came in is just great and I'm so happy they took the time to add to some of the books. While I did have some of these books already, the new and thicker Skyward Sword guide is really top notch.  My only complaint is that the box comes full. I have other guides and Zelda books like the historia book that I can't cram inside it with the others, but that's ok. They need to sell the chest on it's own as I could fill another chest with the Zelda guides I already have.  If you're a big Zelda fan and love the hardcover deluxe guides that they release with each game, this is a great box set and totally worth it!	1
ZELDA! WOOT! Good quality product, love it.	1
Great collection in one safe case. Thank you (  ^ _ ^ )b	1
A must have for any Zelda fan or collector.	1
This is a must have for a Zelda collector. Even if it just goes on a shelf to never be opened, it looks great! Some of the guides in it I never saw released (Twilight Princess) and I wonder how I missed them. Great buy for the just over $100 I paid. A lot of the guides by themselves are selling $40-50 ea.	1
The Legend of Zelda Box Set looks spectacular, awesome, masterpiece & magnificent . It's truly miracle, fantastic & unbelievable & incredible. The guide books inside are very handy & useful. I'm completely satisfied & accepted with the method & way David Hodgson authorized the Legend Of Zelda Full Box Set	1
I Just keep it around my house to feel like an awesome person. Sometimes people come over and high five me.	1
This box set is a wonderful addition to any Legend of Zelda collection! This set includes 6 Prima Guides, a metal bookmark, a certificate of authenticity, and a magnetic-closure treasure chest. The Prima guides included are for the games: Ocarina of Time 3D, Spirit Tracks, Phantom Hourglass, Wind Waker HD, Twilight Princess, and Skyward Sword. The guides speak for themselves, they walk you through all aspects of these games, giving you tips and help to complete the games. All of the books are high-quality hard cover, with gold-edged pages. I am a huge fan of the Legend of Zelda, and this box set was a perfect addition to my collection. I would recommend this box set to any fan of this franchise, plus the price on Amazon can't be beat!	1
This is a really great set of player's guides for the recent Zelda games and I would recommend it to all fans of the Zelda games.	1
This is really quite the treat for collectors. The presentation is stunning - from the fun box to the sturdy books to the certificate proving the uniqueness of your set. For the hardcore Zelda fan this both useful for strategy and cool as a keepsake.	1
I haven't opened these. I have paperback versions that I use. I wanted this as a collectible only.a a a	1
Just amazing.  High quality and all the Zelda feels.  Do yourself a favor and get this.  A must have in any crazy Zelda fan's arsenal.	1
I bought this set for my son. I am not a gamer, so I will state what I know about quality, and what my son has shared with me.  I was quite impressed with the quality of the books. Hard covered, gilded edge pages, good binding.  My son is thrilled with the content. Good graphics and he says the information is helpful.	1
Great gift set just as expected a must have for any zelda fan. Will keep for ever priced fair too	1
These books are much higher quality than the standard release strategy guides.  Obviously the books are hardbound allowing them to be more durable, but also the pages are printed on 80lb paper so they are thicker more durable pages than the original magazine releases.  The material has also been revised from the original print so they are the most complete and accurate of the guides to date.  I just received my guides recently and I have copy number 49647 of 50000.  When these are gone Prima has said that they will not be reprinted.  They have also released a collector's guide individually for A Link Between Worlds that I grabbed as well.  Again the quality of the information inside is excellent as is the quality of these books that will surely become collector's items.  Here's hoping they also release books for Majora's Mask when it inevitably releases on the 3DS as well as the new Zelda adventure for the Wii U later this year or Spring 2015, whenever it is ready.	1
amazing  cool awesome interesting guides of the legend of Zelda  excellent collectors edition item  great for Zelda fans  super cool	1
I already have all the Zelda Collectors edition guides but I decided to purchase this as well just to add to my collection. Everything is so great in this little box I recommend it to any fan that either missed out the first time or if you're a collector since they come with specially marked numbers.	1
he loves zelda and loves anything that has to do with zelda so anything will make him happy. he loved the box it came in to. Also the packaging was really good and sturdy	1
I am a Zelda fan and I am absolutely delighted to add this to my collection. Any die hard Zelda fan would and should add this to their collection as well.	1
The only down side is that these guides are not from Nintendo, so there's very little original art work and a lot of information. How ever the hardcover and golden side shets make it an elegant product.	1
As a big Zelda fan this treasure chest is magnificent and since I own all of these games it was a no brainer for me. As i've gotten older it's been harder to enjoy Zelda games because of their vastness and depth so i was really happy to see that now i don't have to worry about missing something in each game because now i have a gorgeous guide for each game from the last decade. The golden bookmark is is beautiful and the chest looks like its from Wind Waker. The guides are printed as top class books that look luxurious and are marvelous to read through. If you love LoZ and own these games get this before they're gone.	1
Came packaged amazingly so that the collector box did not dent or anything. I do not mind that the cloth maps were not in the books since I've heard that the quality for them were not that great. The bookmark and certificate all make up for it, also the "chest" the items came in. For $107, this is a bargain! The books separately are at least $30 each. This is a perfect LoZ collectors item.	1
This is one of the coolest box sets I've ever purchased. I like the minimalism of the books themselves. Hylian crest and gold embellishments around the borders, different color for each game, titles on spine. They simply look amazing. The chest box is pretty cool too, but I'm not as impressed with it since I generally prefer to display books in the traditional upright position on a bookshelf. But it's a great tie-in to the games since opening chests is always something you associate with Zelda games.  My only regrets are paying extremely high prices for individual new/sealed guides a year ago before this set was announced. I paid closer to $200 to get them all brand new on eBay. This set will surely devalue my existing ones since I'm planning on now reselling them. But I had to get this set since it included the OoT 3D guide that you can't get separately.  I really don't get why they would release this set so close to the guide for A Link Between Worlds. Did no one have the foresight to either include a blank spot for the new guide, or actually include the new guide in this set? In a way it makes the set feel instantly out of date right at release. But oh well, not that big of a deal. I will be purchasing that one separately before it also becomes sold out everywhere and triples in price like Twilight Princess did.	1
this is a great price on this set, the treasure chest is a great addiiton. they are limited to 50k so buy it up!	1
In recent memory, strategy guides have become less of a necessity and more of a collector's item.  For every game nowadays there is a guide to accompany it.  Sometimes there's a collector's edition guide as well.  For collector's these are sometimes a lot of fun.  For Zelda fans that enjoy Zelda lore this collection is a fantastic buy.  There is a limited number in print and it's simply amazing to behold.  It's great packaging and actually has things in there specifically for collectors.  Before I begin I want to stress that this review won't be going into the content of each guide.  With the exception of the Skyward Sword guide, each of these guides is exactly the same as their standard (and separately released) collector's edition counterpart.  The reason Skyward Sword is not the same is because this copy was revised and expanded upon.  Aside from that, the other five guides are largely unchanged from their original releases.  There are subtle differences but nothing that greatly changes the actual content in the guide.  To begin, the guides come packaged in a box that looks like a chest.  When you open it up there are six hardbound guides in there.  The covers all look very similar.  Each one having an embossed Hyrule symbol on them.  The covers and the borders are different on each guide.  The six guides included are for Twilight Princess, Phantom Hourglass, Spirit Tracks, Ocarina of Time 3D, Skyward Sword and the Windwaker HD.  All the guides have gold leaf pages that are shiny when looking at them from the side.  There are a couple of things to note about the guides themselves.  The first is that it seems just a little strange that the guides themselves are not actually individually shrink wrapped.  This seems a little odd.  It's not that big of a deal but when you open the packaging they're already loose.  Considering each original release came shrink wrapped it's a little strange.  Perhaps the thing that some consumers might mind is that none of these guides come with their respective extras.  Anything that was considered a bonus for getting the collector's edition guide isn't here.  Likewise, when this particular collection was announced, The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds simply wasn't planned for the package.  So anyone hoping this guide comes with the collection are out of luck.  That's no big deal.  There are also a couple of things to note here about only a couple of guides.  The first and most obvious is the Ocarina of Time 3D guide.  Prima NEVER actually released a hardcover edition of this guide.  Ever.  This is the first time that Ocarina of Time 3D players will get to grab this guide in hardcover.  Originally the guide was only in paperback.  This makes the collector's value certainly worthwhile as it means that the guide will have much more limited hardcover run than all the other guides here.  This boxset is more or less your only chance to get it.  The second thing of note is that the Skyward Sword guide included here is NOT the same as the one originally published.  It has been revised and expanded.  Even the layout is very different from the original guide itself.  It has been revised and expanded by over 100 pages.  It is almost a completely new guide from the original one that was released.  So yes, this one too is a rarity because you won't have much luck finding it outside of this particular box set.  There are a couple of subtle differences between some guides and the originals.  Most notably is the Ocarina of Time 3D guide.  The original guide was around 224 pages and written in three columns.  Here it's 288 pages and is written in two columns.  It's a lot easier to read and a lot cleaner as a result.  Much of the text isn't so cramped.  Some moments in the Ocarina of Time 3D guide pop out a lot easier.  It just looks better and more organized overall.  The Legendary Checklist in the Ocarina of Time Guide is also better looking.  The tables are easier to read and easier on the eyes.  Likewise, the Legendary Checklist in the Twilight Princess Guide is A LOT easier to read and A LOT less cramped.  In the original guide the entire checklist was on a single page with just the location.  Here it's expanded to be in a table format, the font is bigger and it now lets you know your first chance to complete it as well as telling you what's required.  The Phantom Hourglass and Spirit Tracks guides are virtually unchanged from their initial releases.  The Windwaker HD is pretty much the same as well.  So for those wondering about whether or not they've changed some things from the original guides, the answer is yes.  Quite simply put some of them are a tad easier to read.  The set also came with a few bonuses of note.  The first and probably most valuable of all, is that you get a certificate of authentication from Eijo Aonuma that is signed and numbered.  The second is a laser etched metallic bookmark.  For collectors this package is a pretty sweet deal.  It's invaluable.  The only thing I wish we could've gotten would have been to actually get all the extras the guides themselves actually came with.  It is more or less the only thing I feel is missing and keeping it from being a complete package.  Part of what made the guides collector's editions aside from the hardcovers was actually getting little bonuses that didn't come with the guide otherwise.  Nevertheless, for the fan of Zelda this is a good buy.  But let's be clear.  If you are buying this, chances are it is probably not to actually utilize the guides themselves.  After all, many of the games these guides are for have been out for a while and, truthfully, you could just buy them on their own if you really wanted them for strategy.  They are a collector's item.  And it is certainly a nice one.	1
I have been looking forward to receiving this set since I learned about and pre-ordered it back in August. I am a huge Zelda fan and always wanted to get my hands on the strategy guides, but never seemed to get around to buying them when they first released and, over time, they became very expensive. This works out great because we can get all of the Collector's Edition guides, plus one never released and only available in this set (Ocarina of Time) for a great price - each guide ends up being less than $20 each not including the packaging.  As other have said, the packaging is wonderful. The treasure chest box is better quality than I had anticipated and the gold, metal etched bookmark is gorgeous! The actual shipping packaging was great, as well - very well protected with lots of foam so it arrived in pristine shape.  The guides themselves are gorgeous! Great detail and amazing artwork. I also love how the paper edges are golden - it gives it a very classy look. I have yet to actually read through them, let alone use them, so I can't say how accurate and useful they are, but I am sure the do their job and then some. I was very concerned about the Skyward Sword guide because the reviews for the original version were absolutely terrible. Fortunately, however, I read that it has been updated to meet the quality of all of the other guides, so that was a huge sigh of relief.  I do have a few gripes for this set, though. They are quite minor in the grand scheme of things, so it didn't kill it for me too much - they are just things I wish they would have included.  First, I am very disappointed that no guides were made for the older Zelda games, i.e. Zelda I and II for NES, Link to the Past for SNES, LInk's Awakening for Gameboy, etc. I wouldn't even mind if they threw several games into one or two books to make it more efficient - it would just have been nice to have guides for every Zelda game in one set.  Second, I was disappointed they didn't leave an empty slot for A Link Between Worlds. They've had this planned for a while and have had to have known the game was coming out the same time as this, as well as the collector's edition guide. Not a huge deal, but again... would have been a nice consideration.  Third (and this is just something I would have thought to be cool - not dinging this set at all for not doing it) it would have been INCREDIBLE if they had some sort of audio device inside that makes the chest opening music from say Ocarina of Time when you open it - similar to when you open a greeting card with pre-recorded messages. Perhaps someday I will figure out how to do it myself - until then I will have to just sing the tune myself :)  Finally, I am sad that some of the bonus content that came with the guides when they were originally released weren't included. I will be honest, I don't know which guides came with what, but I have seen others complain about this, stating that Twilight Princess in particular came with a few goodies.  Overall, I am very happy with this set. For Zelda fans, it is a must buy especially if you don't own many or any of these guides already. Thanks for reading!	1
it was fun finding the differences in the pictures, but it got boring when the same pictures kept comming up. it would have been better NOT to have a time limit on these games.  that just makes it harder and frustrating for beginners like me.  i am handicapped and disabled and don't move that fast.  also i just turned 61, so i'm not that fast mentally either.  there should be an option to choose if you want it to be timed or not.  there should be that option on ALL games.	1
I am great at solving games i get within either a day or a couple of days so i am constantly buying new games. Well this one has me stumped. I can't get past this certain level so right now I am giving it a break. LOL. The game is fantastic. More for tweens, teens, adults. Not little kids.	1
I bought this microphone to further enhance my Rock Band experience.  I was not disappointed.  It kept in tune well (which was a problem I saw with other microphones) and was light enough to not be a burden of any kind.  I don't mind that it is not wireless, since I wouldn't move around much anyways.  Also, the fact that it doesn't have buttons didn't bother me, mainly because I don't mind using a controller to navigate.  I do think it could have been packaged better, but I don't fault the microphone for it.  Overall, a very simplistic, yet functional, design that works well.	1
Works great with Xbox 360. I have 2 of these using Xbox usb hub and have no problems using with rockband. Not very good if sharing a mic from sides, works best by pointing voice directly on top of mic.	1
It sometimes go out of wack when the clapping parts in a song show up(like you hit it but it doesn't register no matter how hard you smack it) and the game doesn't register you as singing onkey when you know for a fact you are but other than that it works great!	1
Too much delay and sensitivity out of this microphone for rb4 ps4.  Makes it unplayable.	-1
I own Rock Band 4 for Xbox One and I learned that you can add more vocals to tracks.  I saw that this was cheaply priced and has a high rate of success from other buyers.  though the mic does work, and had no problems with utilizing the tambourine my only real complaint is that the USB Cable length is too short when compared to my original Rock Band Mic (from RB1).  I fixed the problem by adding a usb extension cable to each mic.  This added an extra $5 cost per mic and gave me 3ft.  For 6ft it would have been a $5.50 increase and for 9ft, $5.80.  Even with the extensions you're still looking at a cost savings over the "Rock Band" mic of $10	1
works really well i've had it for a while and it hasn't broken	1
Great!	1
Didnt work for me on xbox one and rockband. Not sure why.  I blame obama.	-1
Works well with most of my Wii Guitar Hero games as well as Just Dance	1
works great	1
Very nice!	1
This microphone is unbelievably good for what it is. It's not studio-quality, but you simply will not find a mic this good for less than $50. The only problem I had with it at all was trying to get it on a mic stand (since it doesn't have a screw) but even that wasn't hard to overcome.	1
This was a great replacement mic for RockBand. We always had a hard time with the tapping portion of the game with OEM. This picked up the taps perfectly for that 100% score while singing! More cowbell anyone?	1
Awful controller. Tamborine slaps in Rock Band 4 just don't register. Went with the official mic and things are much better now.	-1
Works great, sounds great!	1
I bought these to use with band hero and with the voice games for xbox 360.  It worked well, plugged into the xbox 360 without any issues.  The microphone worked properly and was just as seller had described.  My voice is heard clearly on it and we were able to play both games usuing this mic.  Great deal with the price.  I would recommend it.	1
Just got this to use with Rockband for my PS4 and its works!	1
Works well for the most part, there has been two times were it was making this static noise but once we unplugged it and then replugged it in is had been ok.	1
Bad product not working with my xbox and PC	-1
I bought this microphone for the game Michael Jackson: The Experience to sing the songs. My niece and nephews love it. As soon as it arrived, we hooked it up right away.	1
Doesn't work with xbox.	-1
Works better than the rockband one. Although it might be because my rockband mic is as old as the second rockband.	1
Absolutely Horrible...It wasn't even Logitech.  It was Konami and it froze my xbox one repeatedly when I unplugged it.  These also sound horrible with Rock Band 4 compared to the mic the game comes with.	-1
Only downside is there is no mute. Great sound quality.	1
Loving it so far. Works really well. :) Also has a nice grip to it.	1
There are no problems with it, it works great for Rock Band, detects an accurate pitch and everything.	1
Works good! recognizes my voice well and I have no issues playing Rockband besides just not being good at vocals in general! 10/10 would buy again!	1
Love it. It works on the Xbox 360 and the WII U	1
good	1
worked great!!	1
This microphone hooked right into the Xbox and worked on par with all expectations.	1
GREAT	1
Good	1
my grandkids (and their parents) love playing with the microphone along with the guitar we got. this really is a lot of fun for everyone.  would totally recommend getting this if someone has an interest in music (singing)...	1
I love it! Use it all the time. Really works perfectly with all games that you need a mic for.	1
THANK YOU FOR A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE THANK YOU AND SEE YA AGAIN! YOU ROCK! A+ ALL THE WAY. A+ A	1
I cannot get this thing to work with my Wii Rockband 3. It might be related to the USB hub that I'm using, but it simply refuses to be detected by the game.  Cosmetically, it's a microphone. Bit on the ugly side. I would be wary of compatibility issues with this one.	-1
We plugged this microphone into the Wii and it just worked. We find USB easier to deal with on the Wii than using the microphone jack.  With all the noise of the games such as Rock Star, I can't really tell how good the audio quality is, but that also means that it is good enough for Wii.  It seems like it is well made, but we have only used it 10 - 20 times, so I don't know how it will hold up over time. The previous two microphones (different manufacturer) didn't last long before we had to start holding the cable in certain positions to make them work.  This microphone does what it is supposed to. Nothing lacking.	1
Works great!  Another cool thing, even if a song doesn't have "harmony" (parts for more than one singer) you can still do fake-harmony as all mics plugged in remain active.  However, the back-up singers will not be rated and will actually mess with the lead as the game doesn't differentiate what mic is being used for lead UNLESS there actually is a harmony part.  Meaning = if you're just singing to party, you can use all three mics on any song and they'll all just be treated as lead.  Pretty cool when you have a room full of mic hogs around the house like we do.  lol  It's just like when people would gang up all on one mic during a song, but now they actually feel like rock stars having their own mics.  For this reason, we just always keep all three mics plugged in and anyone can just pick one up and join in.  Just don't expect a good score ;-)	1
We bought this item for our Wii. It does not work at all for it. :-( So that was a disapointment. We did decide to keep it though because it works wonderfully on our x-box 360.	1
just what i needed	1
This was exactly what was needed and has worked flawlessly since being received. I recommend it, if you need one.	1
While the product is what it is described as, it unfortunately will give me no signal whatsoever. I believe it is a fault of the a/v cable side, as plugging that in, unplugging it, blowing on it, hissing at it, calling it names, then plugging it back in seems to make it work again. I did check and have the problem across more than one tv, so it's not the tv's fault. I have no way to determine with confidence if it is a fault of the Wii, but I doubt so, as the Wii has no problem with its standard definition cabling that it came with (why, Wii, did you not include component/hdmi cabling by default? HD isn't that rare). Ah, but it is the most inexpensive version of this cable I could find, and the picture is markedly better using this than the original cabling.	1
I rated this product as I have because it exceeded my expectations. Also, I would recommend this product to others.	1
i got this to hook up me will to my 72inc h/d tv it set it up to 1080i not 1080p but besides that it's a grate cable!!!	1
The movers packed my Wii cables in a separate box so I couldn't find them. I ordered this as it would be quicker and I wasn't disappointed. It is inexpensive and it works. I did have my Wii setup manual so it was no problem to get up and running right away. Sometimes you get what you pay for, and sometimes it is better.	1
I was very disappointed in this item.  We thought we would get a better picture than the standard WII video cables, but definatley took a leap in the wrong direction.  I would not recommend.	-1
The video quality is fine but if you have your hdmi plugged directly into your tv and have a separate receiver for audio, the cables are way too short to fit in both, so right now if I want to use the better video signal, I have to use the tv audio. I'll try to rip open the cables to make them reach but this is really a design flaw, although many newer receivers have hdmi connectors on them, there are a lot that don't.	1
This product is very good and works fine. Buy it if you want it. it lets your we display in HD format of 480p which looks alittle better than normal Av cable it comes with. To the untrained eye you might not even notice the diffrence.	1
works perfectly with my wii u game pad	1
My 5 year old son decided to murder my gamepad, and this is EXACTLY what i needed to repair it. The damage appeared to be from a red ink pen which he furiously scrubbed into the screen after he removed my screen protector(not a good day for anyone). The touch screen and its hard cover were both damaged.  Before you buy this part, look up some youtube videos on how to replace it, and decide if you're comfortable doing this.. It took me about an hour or two, to cautiously tear apart, and replace it. You will also need a special tri wing screwdriver to open the casing. It's nothing overly complicated, but you will be tearing your gamepad down to its bare bones since the screen in on the "bottom" of the device.  The screen i received had black trim on the front, which matched my black gamepad. Your mileage may vary on the color since it didn't specify in the item listing.  In the end, I replaced the screen and saved myself the pain of buying a new/used/refurb gamepad for $150-$180. If done properly, no one will ever know you opened the gamepad. There are no seals to break, or anything that would tip off Nintendo or Gamestop that you've tampered with it, in the event you send it in for warranty or trade it in.	1
the installation took a bit of work, youtube video's help quite a bit. but what the video I watched DID NOT MENTION, is that if you replace your touch screen with this, then you'll see a very noticeable silver boarder around your screen, that is from the LCD panel it's self. you'll need your old screen, SO DON'T TROW it out yet, you'll need to pry off the plastic black square (carefully) and place it on your new touch screen. With this installed, the black square will cover up the silver boarder, and make your tablet look just like when it was fresh out of the box!	1
It works!	1
I enjoyed the first Hawx game. However they left out some key things in Hawx 2  1) No coop mode - I really enjoyed that 2) Can't choose your own plane right off the bat. You have to use whatever they tell you.  Those two things will make me not play this game anymore!	-1
Anyone who has ever played a flight sim can tell this is not like A10-warthog just by reading the info on the game. This is an arcade type game with some sim stuff add to make it sell more and be kind of fun and fast to play. Sometimes we all just want to blow the (blank) out of things and unwind. This is fairly well made and the graphics are ok for what it is(a game). If you want a real flight sim this is not it. If you just want to get online and have some fun with others for a while this is it. The target aircraft can do hard right and left turns that would take the wings of any aircraft and thats not right but this is a game and not a sim. This was made sometime ago and graphics have come along way but it is ok for it's time. You will not have any issues installing this or running this game on most systems with a gtx460 or better. You can max out all setting with one evga gtx560ti 2gb video card. The install dose take some time to get done and it will update for you when you run the sim the first time. This all takes 30min or so counting the install of the game. It is what it is and thats a game not a flight sim but it is fun to play a few hours now and then. I have a solid system and have had no issues running this at all. If you are looking for a real flight sim that has ture reallistic flight of the aircraft and working cockpits, this is not for you. Try A10-warthog or wings over europe or wings over vietnam or IL-2. These are flight sims and run well on any solid sysetm with xp or windows 7 running.	1
This is a nice little arcade game with good graphics and some good chatter. It's fun to play with after spending time with DCS Blackshark.  It's a good shootem up. enjoyable!	1
excellent	1
I loved the first Hawx PC game when it came out. Playing Hawx 2 got boring after several missions, is just a shame.	-1
Does what it says it should do! I don't use it much now that I have a PS2 again and a Nintendo 64, but my little brothers and sisters use it, and it works just fine. Toodles!	1
It works fine for PS/PS2 controllers, though rumble isn't supported. In analog mode, the D-pad is mapped to buttons 13-16 instead of a hat switch as you might expect. This can mean extra configuration for some games, but it does allow it to register simultaneous presses of opposite directions (eg. left+right), which has always been one of the odd things about PlayStation controllers. In digital mode, the left stick reads as centered but the Z and Z Rotation axes (right stick) are either all the way up or down, which can cause some trouble.  The N64 side doesn't work at all for me. I tried it with both an OEM Nintendo controller and an InterAct MakoPad 64 (both tested and work perfectly with a real N64). With both of them, all buttons and axes (even the ones N64 controllers don't have, like the right stick) constantly press and unpress on their own.  Note that there is a switch on the left side of the unit that switches between N64 and PlayStation modes. Away from you is PlayStation (left/red LED), towards you is N64 (right/green LED). I say this because there are no instructions and the switch is completely unlabeled.	-1
I was interested in this product for the n64 part.  Retrolink makes SNES and NES controllers for PC but no N64. Trying to get a PS2 controller to work on a PC is stupid because every major PC gamepad company has a PS2 copy of their controller that goes through native USB.  I tried all of the following on Windows XP SP3 32 bit and GNU/Linux Kernel 2.6+, same results.  PS1 Controller: (Both official Sony controllers) Dualshock (Analog sticks): Worked, but the back L and R buttons (L2 and R2) would not trigger.  Both analog sticks tracked perfectly. Original (No Analog sticks): Worked perfect.  Back L and R buttons work.  PS2 MadCatz Controller: Didn't work at all.  It was however a madcatz and not an official sony controller. Had no authentic ps2 controllers to test.  N64: I had two controllers to test with it. Transparent purple:  Every button worked, but the analog stick would not go %100.  Jamming it to the right shows only a slight movement even though I moved it %100.  Windows configuration was impossible since the C buttons kept firing like someone was pressing them all madly. Gray:  All buttons worked but the analog stick and all of the C buttons went haywire and fired constantly.  Maybe I got a bad one, but I really think this thing sucks.

I can't get full range on the analog stick.  I can't find any other adapter except this one on the internet... as though this is the end-all be-all answer we were looking for.	-1
My son sayes he is still learning how to customize the levels and is having some trouble changing ships. He liked 2006 better as it is easier to use. Will get in there and read the book..	1
So I got this and first it was kind of tedious but then I added weather and well the titanic in a hurricane can be a hoot I got 08 cause my laptop is horridly slow but when I get my hands on more computer power I'm going to get ship simulator extremes you tube gives you a good idea what to expect check it out there and see if its for you	1
I got the ship simulator but I tried to install it an it was confusing. 1 day later I install it and this time it did work, when it was time to play it, guess what it didn't went through! It sucks! O.O	-1
It looks interesting at the beginning but I was bored after less than 25 hours of play. Not enough variety in the missions.	-1
The most amazing graphics you could see! If you own a flight simulator yoke and/or throttle quadrent you can make your gaming experice easier. The Crash effects may not show in trailers or videos, but in the actual game you can see the damage. I higly recomend to purchase this product. Happy Sailing! To Reader: THIS IS NOT A LITTLE LITTLE KIDS GAME IT IS COMCLACATED!	1
My father is a seaman. I have seen many ships, sailed with him around the world numerous times. So ships are in my blood. When i saw this game I bought it without batting an eyelid. Well I wish I didn't because I now regret my decision.  The game is unique in its concept. We never really had a maritime ship simulation that wasn't centrally focused on war and sinking other ships :). This one happens to be just peace-time shipping simulation with different kinds of detailed ships ranging from cargo, to passenger, to rescues, to towing, to even trying to alter history by succesfully sailing Titanic to New york on its first maiden voyage etc. The game creator has gone to great details to simulate as much as possible the Intricacies of piloting as well as managing huge ships operations. Any aspiring sea captian or sea salt will identify with some if not most aspects of piloting a ship as simulated in this game. But to me thats where all the goodies end.  The cons associated with game are just too game-breaking to me and i have essentially stopped playing the game. Until these issues gets addressed i am not spending anymore money on this games series.  First and foremost this game badly needs a voluntary "Time Compression" feature. Not all of us have 2-3 hours to devote each time we decide to play this game to have some fun. Sometimes it take an hour or so just to get out of harbour and tag some hours more on this to complete the mission. With a game in which you are looking at ocean waves for hours this gets boring really fast. This is just plain very annoying and game destroying factor to me. I know some people have all the time in the world to savour and enjoy games but a lot don't too. Since its not a action oriented game the passage of time is felt even more. If they can incorporate a Time Compression feature it will make the game lot more open to different segments of gamers.  Second is the still dated graphics engine. I see lots of people commenting on how good the graphics look. I have a pretty good rig and i can play games like Mass Effect and Silent Hunter 4 in almost thearatical quality but even with everything maxed out this game just looks medicore graphics wise. The ships and ocean etc. looks very simplistically rendered from today's standard. The graphical quality of this game released in 2008 is kind of dissappointing though.  Last some of the missions in the game are just plain novice or fillers in my opinion. This game is geared towards people who like to pilot huge ships yet we have a lot of missions devoted to speed boats for stunts, hover boats etc. I bought the game to simulate a ship expirience not go around flipping in speed boats.  Anyways..i wouldn't really recommend anyone spend $40 bucks on this game. Wait until it gets to $19 or so bargain bin. And i hope the developers put some real effort into make a more viable ship simluator for its next incarnation or you are not getting any more money from me.	-1
This game is a good way on getting at the helm of the RMS Titanic and I am very well satisfied with it. I do hope that any of you who does decied ot buy it will also enjoy it.	1
the graphics aren't very good and the ship to shore radio is so distorted and accented that it is impossible to understand what is being said.  The game can be fun, but if you are looking for an ocean going version of microsoft flight simulator this isn't it.  It's not a lousy game, nor is it a great game, it's just okay.	-1
made the controller easier to grab, easier to hold, and more comfortable in the hands. overall I would buy it again. its cheap and a great addition to the controller	1
I've bought these before.  They slip right on and unless you get one with an obvious defect, they should last for years.  These are a must have if you are afraid of your kids messing up your controllers.  Then again, maybe they should get their own! lol	1
Put on my controllers so it would like not get wear and tear and they are great! BUY! THEM!! AMAZING	1
I bought this from amazon seller likeelectronic Ship FM Hongkong for under $3 shipped.  The one I got fits the controller excellently! Smooth rubber, it feels very comfortable while playing games, you don't even notice it.  My hands sweat a LOT during Call of Duty hours sessions without this case on it, adding this onto my controller pretty much has eliminated that.  Great Case from seller above.	1
I was scared to stretch the silicone during application, but afterward it fit very snug.  It makes the controller feel much better.	1
My son loves it he says it makes it more comfortable and easier on his hands for those marathon Black Ops 2 sessions.	1
I like this product because it means you can have little to no cleaning maintenance kept up on your controller which is cool and it keeps the controller nice and smooth which is great for long gaming sessions.	1
Unlike others on this site, these fit very good and the material is durable, which is of utmost importance to me.  I'm glad I found this item.	1
covers the controller more then others and is pretty durable, great grip to it as well and keeps its color, looks solid.	1
My brother had one of these for the longest time so I used his until he wanted it back.  I found this a lil while ago and have been loving it ever since, giving the controller much needed grip and makes holding it for long gaming sessions much more comfortable.	1
Not love but like. This rubber grip gives you alot of grip but needs to be smoothed out with a razor blade before use. I'm happy.	1
This silicone cover has a very nice feel to it! Don't use this with dirty hands, dirt will stick to it. This is a ok product for your 360 controller.	1
As soon as I slipped this on my controller, I knew that I'd never take it off!!  It makes the controller much more comfortable in your hands, and does not slip if you play for a long time and tend to get sweaty fingers!	1
This is a good buy but... if you get the thumb grips for the xbox 360 controllers they will get stuck on the silicone so its not like the picture and it shows at the joystick the silicone is way back its really up close to the sticks and you will have to cut it back IF you get the thumb grips, now it could just be only my silicone case but I don't know.	1
I'm revising my earlier review. i had only rated my transaction 3 stars previously due to shipping problems. After the seller contacted me to do what they could to help with the problem I have to reconsider. They contacted me promptly and went above and beyond in their effort to make me happy. Thank you. This was the second case I've purchased and would recommend it to anyone. Thanks again.	1
This thing is so inexpensive and makes the controller much more comfortable to hold for hours on end. Item is very well manufactured and fits like a glove. It also helps your hands breathe a little bit if you have sweaty hands. For less than the cost of a gallon of gas You can't not afford to get this thing! Better grip, looks sharp, and is thin enough that it does not make the controller more bulky in anyway.	1
easy to put on and take off, good grip, cheap price, just don't rip it apart to see how strong it is and write a review about it and it's be fine :D	1
Good silicone protective for the price. Fits well on the joystick. I extremelly recomend it, since its up to task.	1
Awesome sillcone cover for my xbox 360 controller. Fits well, but collects dust sometimes.	1
Easy install and feels great. The skin fits really well and functions properly. I did have to trim up around the triggers because they moved around while I used them, but after that it was perfect.	1
this is a great quality skin. I was surprised of how comfortable it is. Especially how it'd keep the controller clean.	1
Grips the controller amazingly, great for long gaming sessions as your hands get sweaty and hot during those times. The cover literally wicks it away, feels very rubbery, yet thin enough to be really comfortable!! I simply love it, it can get dirty since it catches dust rather easily, nothing a little simple green and a wipe can't take care of. 5 stars, this product is absolutely needed, wish the consoles came with it, out of the box!	1
This is not the first one of these I have had, in fact this is about my 8th. There are many different skin types and different skin makers, so you have to judge each on it's own merit. My controller skin arrived today, well ahead of expected delivery, just as described solid black and silicone. Fit is just perfect, and installation had no problems. Good comfortable smooth texture, while still providing a much better grip than on the hard slick controller plastic. I like to clean my game equipent regularly, and I always clean even new items before using. This is a great way to test the quality of the item, I cleaned the skin using isopropanal alchohol, no gumming (like you get with lower grade skins)and no color bleed onto the rag, this tells me it is definitly silicone not some rubber stuff. Once on the controller grip is good, comfort is good, feel is natural. I am very pleased with this controller skin, I have been needing to get one for my extra controller. I will definitly be ordering a few more later, a friend has a birthday coming up.	1
Have had this skin for almost 2 months and so far there are no signs of wear or tear which is good. Its sticky just enough to be grippy but not overly so. It protects the controller fairly well. Keeps it from getting dirty as fast especially if you have a white controller.  Overall it feels good and is comfortable even in long play periods. The only problem I have is there is annoying little piece up by the triggers on both sides. Its right in between the trigger and the bumper buttons and there is no tension on the piece so when you switch between the bumper and triggers it can sometimes flip up and your finger will catch it. Not really a deal breaker or a big deal or anything since I plan on cutting it off anyways. Plan on buy another so far after this one falls apart. Will update my review if it doesnt last long.	1
nice skin for xbox controllers makes them more slip free and smooth softer too good deal and nice stuff try one	1
I love this thing, It makes your controller look badass and is so soft.  It has a great feel to it, way better than plastic, even if you have a Black controller this will improve it.  The seams on the side are my only tiny concern.  Add this with the Grip-it, blue analog covers and you have a great controller for cheap.  I can`t say enough about the comfort.  fantastic!	1
Considering its just a rubber cover for the XBOX 360 controller, actually, it's made well...and the price--not bad at all. Excellent product for an excellent controller.	1
don't really need cards larger than 8MB and the 8MB by sony is most compatible with all games but these work too	-1
This memory card works but i have to take it out and put it back in every time i turn the system off otherwise it won't read.	1
This is the best ps2 memory card I know of. It's perfect if you have games that take 1,000KB or more of your memory. If you need more memory, this is for you.	1
I was hesitant to buy this memory card because of the inconsistent reviews of "my carrying case" memory cards, but this thing is working perfectly. Saves and Loads games with no problem. Sony made a fortune with their puny 8MB cards. This is the exact same dimensions, and it holds 128MB. It seems they ran out soon after I bought mine. Sorry! I would definitely recommend this company and their memory cards based on the price and mine working perfectly with every game I've played so far. I'll update this review if the status of my card changes.  *UPDATE* Stopped working after a couple months of use. Sorry for the long delay in updating my review :^\	-1
Saved one game and now it will no longer work. stick to brand name memory cards	-1
ok	1
Arrived earlier than expected and a great price!	1
GREAT BUY & HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!	1
Saved and loaded correctly for a while... then put a 2mb game file on it and it crashed/corrupted all my data... buying sony genuine from now on...	-1
great	1
Great price	1
Great and still working after several years!	1
AWesome, works without issues thank you!!!	1
I'm satisfied.	1
And at 128mb you will die before you run out of room on it. I remember when the memory cards were 8mb and i only ever needed 6 of those for my whole PS2 collection.  Overall its great, and must have for anyone still stuck in he 90s	1
I collect consoles and I love to play them as well	1
ok	1
It's great	1
LOVE IT	1
So much more storage space, love it.	1
excelent	1
Good	1
Works great.	1
Works well have not had a problem with it and hopefully I never do lol	1
Great product, as advertised	1
Works great	1
works good thanx	1
This is a great buy. Works just as well as the Sony ones at a lot better price. Would definitely recommend and order again.	1
works great and came sooner then i thought ! 2 thumbs up	1
I like it	1
Seems to be working fine.  Although, not all the games we have are recognizing it, as an available memory card.  I have read, in other reviews, that if you copy saves over, from a smaller capacity memory card, those games will recognize it.  I don't have a smaller capacity card, with which to test this.	1
Massive memory , 50 save spots on Final Fantasy 12 .	1
A+	1
Great price	1
works as expected.  Good quality product	1
You read right. 128MB. Not the normal 8MB almost all the cards were. You get 128MB and you also get to use them, (PS2 slim is what I used). The memory card manager reads you have ~126,345KB free.	1
Does what it's supposed to and worked great for my kids.	1
Thank u	1
This thing is really great for those with a big PS2 collection. The only issue I came across was that Kingdom Hearts games would not recognize them, thus being unable to save. It was unfortunate, but I already had an official one from SONY to handle those rare exceptions. Would certainly recommend.	1
I was really mad that on the buying site it said it was made buy Sony and found out later it was made in China! Sony makes their own stuff in Japan! This is false advertizing!	-1
Loaded most of my old PS2 saves on it due to several of my memory cards are missing files from 9 years ago. I am satisfied.	1
So much data space! Works just fine.	1
This is a lot of memory for my old PS2 so I can store huge amounts of game data. All for a very low price! Perfect.	1
everything worked as promised. seemed to hold more data than stated. great	1
Pretty good	1
as advertised!	1
I bought this as a gift for a family member and he has not had anything negative to say about the product. He seems to be quite satisfied.	1
Good value and work perfectly in my PS2. I actually bought two of these last year and they are still working great! Fast shipping from seller Mahmaou!	1
Works great a lot of space for data! Came fast in the mail! :-)	1
Best price and won't need any other memory card again.	1
Reliable device	1
great item	1
works good	1
It turned out to be a 64MB card. While I would usually return it, I don't have another card to transfer all of my files to. 64MB is still a ton of space though for PS2 saves.	-1
It works great, I transferred all of my info from my other memory card and it works great. the only thing I noticed one of the screws was a little loose but I read that's how it supposed to be, if they are too tight card may not work. I'm a happy camper now because I can play all my old PS 2 games again.	1
Works	1
All I can say is... wow. This works perfect. It is more space than I will ever need, but the more the merrier. Right? Oh, one more thing: A lot of people said that it takes a long time to save, and boy they were right! Plus, I unscrewed the screws slightly so the little PCB chip moves around a bit. It came in an OK time, but gosh it was worth it.	1
it`s good.	1
It was delivered as described - new item, never opened.	1
ps2 would recognize memory card but didn't save	-1
Excelent product!!!	1
haven't used yet, but PS2 is reading it as the full 128 mb storage	1
better presentation and would be a five	1
IS GOOD	1
Great.	1
My daughter found the old PS2 game system for her youngest son and didn't have but one or two games, no memory cards, etc. We found what we needed on Amazon!	1
Good memory card it has a good saving memory I like it after I lost my other one I got this one buy it I recommened it	1
These cards allow me to save a large amount of downloads, and they are compatable with my PS2, they rock!	1
I am glad that I had purchase this 128MB memory card. This was recommended to me here in Amazon by another gamer.	1
daughter still loves her play station needed a bigger memory card for a couple games so searched amazon and found this to order for her.	1
Cam quick and works like new.  It is everything that I expected it to be and plus it was cheap.	1
This memory card has unleashed my games from start, but don't stop gameplay to awe yeah, now let's get some lunch... Save! gameplay. Holds up well, saves and loads reliably, does what a card should do: Save my Games!!	1
this has huge memory for ps2 and is great because it can save a more than a few games and save you some money	1
Works great!!! I suggest this to anyone! It's a great price as well! Overall I'm very happy with the purchase!!	1
This product is not actually distributed by Sony. As well, Playstation 2 consoles, to my knowledge, do not have any existing memory cards above the 8MB in size. There's some nasty hack for it that simply doesn't work and this card will never work like they say it does. It's essentially a regular memory card without the 8MB memory limitation, therefore making the PS2 overwrite previous data because the memory card is full, but the PS2 doesn't understand that it's full, thus causing corruptions.  My source of this information? The Internet and the two 16MB memory cards I bought years ago, not off Amazon, though.  Seriously, don't be fooled by this.	-1
I have the old, fat PS2. So far no problems at all with this memory card. Very inexpensive, lots of storage space! Great buy!	1
Not much you can say on this item except it does what it is suppose to do. It stores a lot of games	1
I want to play ps2 games and i needed a memory card and this fits the bill just fine. It can hold many games so if you buy it you will be able to own more games	1
These are great little cards to store games on.it save you money also. they come in very handy. Thank you Brenda ONeal	1
Does what it's supposed to do. Nice to have the extra memory. Now I can store more game saves. Satisfied with purchase.	1
Why was every memory card 8 mb when i was young, i could have just owned 1 of these and not had to budget my memory space. i cant even fill a tenth of this thing, awesome	1

Ever since the Playstation and beyond, companies have put out tons of items that help give new life to an old thing.  This memory card is no exception to that rule. I have had this memory card for well over a year now and it has not failed me yet. (This is not to imply that it will last forever, you should always make backups just in case) Imagine now being able to save ALL your game saves on 1 memory card instead of having to look for spare room on an existing 8-meg memory card. Being able to hold 16x more than what a normal memory card can is pretty remarkable. Although there have been a few odd moments that make this a bit of a... well... not so much a problem as it's more of an annoyance.  (One example of annoyance you will have to deal with is that certain games will "READ" your card first before it will "WRITE" to the card to save. This can take as much as 2-3 minutes before it will finally do anything, and that can cause a problem if either you are not a patient person or you suddenly get a power spike to hit while in the middle of a save where it READS before it WRITES.)  Other than that, the card works on just about every game I have played (Numbering 150+ games on my PS2)  Overall, all I can say is I have not had that much of a problem with it and it has kept working for well over 1 year now. Of course, like any electronic device, experiences will vary from person to person. But for the price, you can't beat it.	1
So far so good it saves the games that need to be saved.  I would buy another one if I had to.	1
PS2 Memory Card 128MB for Playstation 2.  This will help me keep from having so many memory cards nothing more annoying than having to get another card cause you filled yours up if there was only a way to have save states on this system:)	1
Love it very nice Love it love it love it there is not much more I can say but I love it	1
I've always hated dealing with running out of room on my 8 MB and 32 MB PS2 memory cards, but now that I have this bad boy I never run out of space. Fantastic product for such a cheap price. Wish I could have found this years ago.	1
the Play Station 2 memory card works quite well and I can store as many games as 16 8MB cards	1
THIS IS A SCAM! DO NOT BUY!!!!!!! they take a the case (as seen in picture) and put a 64 mb save card in it expecting you not to find out! these are NOT 128 mb card! they are 64mb cards with a case that tells you its 128!!!!! DO NOT BUY THIS YOU WILL END UP WITH A TERRIBLY MADE 64 mb CARD!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THIS PRODUCT IS AS MUCH OF A SCAM AS CAN BE!!!!!!!!	-1
on time and in good  work good  and i will like more  to see like that  think you  very much	1
Work great and plenty on memorey. I love it. This is great if you play slot of games. You won't run out of memory.	1
it is very I am enjoying it very much and I really love it thanks a whole lot appreciate it	1
Quite simply, if you have a ps2 you need a memory card. The 128MB card should do the trick for any gamer.	1
The PS2 memory cards are essential for a PlayStation 2 system.... particularly for the `Slim' models, which do not allow for the use of a hard drive and with 128 MB... more than enough storage space for games (and saves from starting over each time when playing games).  Great deal.	1
Got it and it works perfectly. Did not have to loosen to screws on the back to make it work. A great buy.	1
For a third party memory card, it does the trick for saving your favorite games. Instead of having piles of memory cards, you can now have just 1 to save a lot more save files. I'd recommend this to anyone that has had to either delete old save files or get another memory card to save more of their games.	1
Great to deal with.  Got exactly what we ordered and in a very timely fashion.  Trustworthy vendor for ordering product.	1
It came on time in great shape!! It is so new! Looks better then I tought it would!! LOL! I can not wait to try it out!!	1
I chose this product rating because it had great shipping, great product discription. I would recommed this product to any one who plays PS2 games.	1
It works only when wanting to, I thought it was initially cause the console was old, so i purchased a new one last week, and it acts the exact same way. sometimes it loads up, sometimes it don't, sometimes it loads up but says its unformated, others, it says it doesn't have enough space for a save, when it has more than 90% of the 128mb still available. and also sometimes it will say no memory card in slot available.  This is so worthless, I think I'll rather use this for a databank sort of holder, and just play off of a normal 8mb one, copy and pasting within the ps2 browser option, cause this is to frustrating to deal with on a regular playing basis.	-1
Very good article, very good deal nice, very good price, item arrived on time, the packaging had an acceptable size	1
How can you go wrong with obtaining a 128 Megabyte memory card for the PS2! It's exactly the same size, there is no size fitting issue, it looks and acts like a regular memory card, and has fifteen times more space for saved games then the regular 8 Meg cards!  The only problems I have encountered with this card is that some games it is not compatible with, and the game will say there is no Memory Card in the PS2, or sometimes it doesn't read it at first, so try again and it should. I've never had to try more than 2 or 3 times.  The only games I have found it wouldn't work with was "Stuntman Ignition" (possibly "Stuntman" too, but I have not played it) and I can't recall the other one, but currently I own around 100 PS2 games, and it's been fine with all but 2 or 3 games! But don't complain, just use your existing 8 meg card, or buy one from a pawn shop or somewhere for a dollar or two, and use that for those games, and the rest on this awesome card!  Known games this doesn't work with that I have found. - Stuntman Ignition. - Guitar Hero games. (works fine with Rock Band tho) - Action Replay Max (cheat device can't save data to it)	1
This item is just great. it has 128m storage. You don't have to worry about memory storage for ps2 anymore. you can play hundreds of games without deleting saving file.	1
If you want a lot of memory , then this is for you.  Best quality , best priced memory card on the Internet	1
Hello, i must say this card does just what it says, it holds all of my PS2 game saves, i have always wanted to use one "Memory Card" for all saves. The card holds 128MB and after saving all my saves i have 110MB left and i have well over 60 Playstation 2 games, it`s like having a "PC Hard Drive" in the PS2 and now that i know the card really do work, i will be ordering quite a few more before they are no longer in stock. It does not take much to make me happy and this makes me very happy, now i must get more PS2 games, i have 2 PS2, 2 PS3, 1 PSP, 1 Tablet, 2 Laptops and 2 Desktops all for gaming, i love gaming and proud to say i am a 56 year old gamer, started in 1992, love it.   Thanks<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/PS2-Memory-Card-128MB-for-Playstation-2/dp/9629971372/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">PS2 Memory Card 128MB for Playstation 2</a>	1
I saw the ad and I was in need of new PS2 memory cards, so I ordered them.  The ad was accurate.  The company shipped them ot promptly.  They arrived in my mailbox in excellent condition.  I would buy from this company again.  Fantastic job!!!	1
I bought this thinking that an 8MB card would be to small. So I figured getting a larger one would be alright. I was wrong. One of the problems is that it hardly works. There is one main causes to this.  The casing in incorrect. It's too loose to fit properly and make a clean connection to the contacts. This results in the PS2 recognizing the card about 2% of the time.  So don't buy this. Just go get an official 8MB. Besides 8MB will go a long way.	-1
Lo recib hace cuatro das y estoy super contento, funciona excelente, tanto la consola como la tarjeta de memoria. Excelente resolucin, cero calentamiento. Lo recomiendo a ojos cerrados.	1
EDIT: This _is_ actually a 128Mb card according to my PS2. However, apparently some games aren't able to see that much space. Persona 3 FES, for example, calls it an 8Mb card. Otherwise, it appears to be a good value for the money. If your games do not have difficulty with the size, then go for it. (End of edit 28 Jan 2012)  If you think the price is good for an 8mb memory card, then by all means, go ahead. Although the card and the packaging are both labeled as 128mb, unless you are more fortunate than I, you will find yourself with no more than 8mb when you insert it into the PS2. Funny that the guys at the local game store had never even heard of a 128mb card for PS2.	1
I keep using it almost every time I play my ps2 games.	1
Holds all the memory you need, and Great quality and Great price, Mega Fun, So go get your game on,	1
If you insert the card in your PS2 and it doesn't work, untighten the screws on the back of the card a bit. (there are 2). you will need a precision philips screwdriver.  Put the card into your PS2 and boom, it works! Someone else suggested this and it worked like a charm. Seems like they are tightened too much at the factory and in some way, it interrupts the memory on the card.  This card is great, holds a ton of memory, the most you'll need really. Haven't had a problem with it since. Fairly sturdy for what it is.	1
I like this because I have multiple game consoles and a dvd player. This let's you hook up up to three game consoles or dvd players. As long as you buy this from a us store it works. I bought it from china once and only one game console port worked. But I bought this one from NY and all three ports work. I have no complaints now. I currently have 2 game consoles hooked up to it with one dvd player. I have 2 tvs and this let's me play a game and watch tv at the same time so cool. I give this product a thumbs up...	1
Works way better than expected.	1
awesome product	1
This is perfect for multiple console owners, at least for older consoles.	1
Bought this in late 2011 and is still going strong.  Works great and has stood up to three kids. Solid. No issues.	1
Nice	1
Great !	1
works great. Glad i bought this. It switched the signal perceftly. we have a WII, PS2 and DVD player hooked up to it.	1
I've been wanting one of these for a while. I would find it so annoying having to unplug my cable to plug in my Xbox wires and then having to do the same again when i felt like watching tv. But with this i just have to flip a switch and it's done.	1
Very good product.works great for the many systems and players we have and for the price you sure cant beat it.	1
This worked great for my needs, my kids are able to have all their games hooked up.  Easy to connect and set up.	1
The item did not work at all.  After plugging in all of the cords, nothing happened.  The idea is good, but the product is junk.	-1
saves so much room!!! everyone need one of these, play the ones you want, when you want. your kids will love it.	1
what can i say? very cheap - works great. if u need a simple switcher for rca plugs, get this	1
No problems.  Plugged it into my son's old SD TV that has one AV input and it works just fine.  I have threee different connections going in and he does not have any  trouble switching between any of them.  Cheap and easy fix to an old TV.	1
when theres not enough plugs for your consoles this is your solution. have seen other ones not as nice as this one that costed way more happy I found it	1
I bought this because my HDTV only had one S-Video/AV input. The rest were HDMI/DVI-Audio/PC/USB inputs. Seeing as though I like to play game consoles such as Dreamcast, N64 & the Wii, I've decided to buy this to hook up such consoles into it. The AV selection works nicely. You just switch and that's it. This device is highly recommended.	1
i wish i did not buy this thing.  it gets in the way all the time, the cables are everywhere and when i dropped it the thing cracked down the middle.  i recommend radioshack items	-1
I purchased these for my Wii as Nintendo no longer produces Wavebird controllers by virtue of them being sued by a patent owner over the technology. I didn't want to pay for a used Wavebird on eBay, so I bought some of these. I sit back from my HDTV about 9 feet so I needed these for the wired Gamecube controllers and they work very well. Even with Mario Kart Wii, there is some lag with the Wavebird, but there is no lag with these extension cables. Highly recommended!	1
Great	1
Great extension cable. Quality is solid and range is decent.	1
This is a good product, I like it	1
Cheap and quality product. Almost doubled my controller wire so now I can sit far away from the TV. Doesn't seem to add any noticible lag or such.  Recommended product.	1
Perfect, just what I was expecting	1
Works exactly as advertised. Bought these along with a 2-pack of controllers for the GameCube, as my TV is a ways away from my couch and i wanted to play multi-player with my wife. The controller plugs into the extension cable about as snugly as the controller (and the other end of the extension cable) plugs into the GameCube, which is to say plenty snug enough to keep it in while moving the controller and cable around semi-violently, but not snug enough to keep a controller attached after being thrown across the room (just an example). One major concern I did have when I bough these was the possibility of lag due to the signal from the controller having to travel farther. This concern was unwarranted, as I have noticed no difference in response time either way. On durability, I've had these for almost 2 years and they haven't shown any noticeable signs of wear. Throw in a reasonable price ($4 when I bought it from Amermedia in 2012) and this is a heck of a deal for people that need a product like this. I would recommend.	1
I bought these to extend the length of the game cube controller reach. Everyone that uses these has no issues with poor controller reaction times and can sit just about anywhere to play.	1
This Cable extender worked great! I used it when and had absolutely no problems with it at all! It adds a good 6ft of extra cable length. I tried hooking two together and I found no extra input lag using these cables.  Great if you need the extra cable!	1
And now I can sit back far enough to see my entire TV and avoid wielders burn in my retina.  So simple, yet so obvious a necessity given how freaken short the big "N" made their controller's cords.  Buy them now and heal your spine!	1
For people who still have a GameCube, but don't have a wireless controller (don't bother, you'll be disappointed because none of them come with the damn adapter,) these cords are fantastic. I can take my controller all over the house with them if I please, and they don't cause lag or short out to any degree I can tell. They're not shoddily-made and have lasted well so far. I'd buy them again.	1
My nephew wanted an older gamecube game to play in our Wii. Once I purchased the game for him, we found out that the Wii controllers won't work with the gamecube games when played in the Wii. After doing a little research, I realized we needed the classic gamecube controller and a gamecube memory card. Once we got both of those, the gamecube game that we bought finally worked! After playing the game for a bit while being "tethered" to the Wii system because of the cable for the controller, we decided we needed extension cables to have a bit more freedom. So we got these controller extension cables. He is happy!	1
These cords worked great for me and makes my gamecube controllers long enough so I can relax on my couch and play gc at the same time Also shipped fast I recommend this product	1
I bought 4 of these, 1 of which was shipped to me with defects, and 2 more became defective within about 2 weeks of normal use. I would not recommend these to any one, but couldn't give a 1 star as1 of 4 cords still works fine	-1
This is a great product that works exactly as the product page states - it extends the reach of the gamecube controller cable by 6 feet. Seems sturdy, and the connection is nice and tight so it doesn't fall off by itself. Not detecting any latency between hitting the controls and actions happening in-game.	1
These awesome-sauce things make any GC controller as far extended as a wavebird. Given these days any games I have time to play are all via the Wii anyway, having the extra length for GC controllers is great.	1
With the amount of interference I kept getting with the wireless controllers, I was stuck far too close to the TV to enjoy many of the visual aspects of the classics. This cable extension cord made playing some of my old Gamecube games just as fun as the day it came out. A big must have if you can't get the wireless format to work properly.	1
this really cam in handy we need a extra length for the controller and it was perfect exactly what we needed	1
When the gamecube came out, we all had 19, 20 or 24 inch CRT televisions.  The standard 6 foot gamecube controller cord was acceptable.  But now that we have these 50+ inch TV screens, 6 feet just doesn't cut it.  I've used 2 of these cables for about 6 months to play games on my gamecube and wii.  Everyday I wrap the cords back up around the controller and tuck it away.  All that twisting of the cords has had no effect on the connectors.  They operate just great.  The 2 pack was enough for me to sit about 15 feet back from the console and still have slack.  I'd recommend this to any gamer that uses their gamecube controller on their wii or gamecube and wants to sit back a bit from their TV.  Their "may" be a wireless alternative to a gamecube controller for these older games, but I couldn't beat the price.  I didn't bother even looking for an alternative.	1
These things work really great and can be combined for even longer cable lengths but be warned that the rubber shielding seems to slip around the plug head. Not a big deal, but could lead to eventual short.	1
I rated this product as I have because it exceeded my expectations. Also, I would recommend this product to others.	1
The gamecube controller wire is length has always been annoying. Once got these that solved that problem. They work great, fit right, and do not cause any controller lag. Great buy.	1
I can now sit on the couch to play instead of putting a chair in front of the TV. There are no problems.	1
With this older non IR system I need to extend the controller with a reasonable item. This fit the bill with no problems.	1
These extenders work as expected. I bought them when I wanted to buy Double Dash for the game cube to play on my Wii. If you're used to playing the Wii, you probably sit much further away than a standard GC controller will reach, so definitely pick some of these up.	1
At 6 feet and at 4 dollars each its a good deal, ive seen some other cables for much more and these work just fine, i like that they're black  and they connect into the controller with ease. buy it with confidence.	1
This isn't a particularly deep product. They are wire extenders to be used for the Nintendo Gamecube controllers. They come in a pack of two which is fantastic for the cheap price. They extend approximately 6 feet in length, and with the already fairly long wire on the Gamecube controller already, these come in handy if you need to sit somewhat far away in a regular sized room. I have had no trouble with these at all as they function properly and connection just as easily to any controller. Getting these beats paying the higher price for the Wavebird wireless Gamecube controllers. I'm on a budget so I'll just stick with a wired controller, no big deal.	1
I bought this for my gamecube contoller to plug into my wifes wii. It as more than enough to allow comfort and ease of the controller.	1
I play Brawl and Melee all the time with my siblings and friends, and sitting squished together 3 feet from the tv was a pain. So I got these cables because it was cheep and could solve most of our problems with this, even if it did not look like they would last long from some of the reviews. but when i got these they worked great and did not seem cheap at all. I expected there to be lag with the controls, but there wasn't. They have survived a month of intense fighting and are still in top-notch condition. These are great if you need room or do not like sitting 3 feet from the screen.	1
I always hated how Gamecube controller's cords were so ridiculously short. Since I use them on my Wii now, it is much more hazardous for my Wii if someone trips over the short cables. This was a perfect solution to my problems. So far I haven't had any problems with them and they allow me and my friends to not sit 6 ft away from the Wii. Another great thing about these is that you can plug them end on end to make a longer cable.	1
They're awesome cables though!  They work great and add those several feet you always seem to lack.  Now I can play my Gamecube games on my Wii from the couch!  No batteries to change!	1
I bought 2 sets of this product (so 4 cables total). I was not disappointed. They all work perfectly and they accomplished what I bought them for. I have 2 big screen TV's and the 2 rooms I use for these have couches that sit back a lot further than the standard gamecube controller cord would reach. Hook 1 of these extensions up to each controller and problem solved. I also like the length because I still had room to go back farther but this allowed each cord to rest on the ground so there is less of a tripping hazard for those people that never fail to walk in front of everyone and don't pay attention to the cords. They even work for Bongos so that is a nice feature to be able to move the bongos back as well for those games.	1
i bought the 2 x Wii Gamecube GC Extension Cable Cord  but after a few uses, it started working wrong, duplicating signals  if i press A in the controller, the game detects A being pressed two times, this is for all buttons,  without the cord the error is no longer there.	1
This is not the right cord for this game system.	-1
Great	1
Bought a Gameboy Micro here on Amazon. It didn't come with a charging cable. So in a pinch I ordered one of these. It was to my house within 48 hours and it works great!!! This product does not work with Gameboy Advance or Advance SP, or the Nintendo DS/DS Lite/3DS/2DS lines. This is specfically for the GBMicro	1
charges my micro just fine. take it with me most the time. worth getting if you have a micro	1
It does what it's supposed to do, charge a GBA Micro. Quality of materials is low and the plug to the GBA Micro is a tight fit but for $4 I wouldn't complain too much. If you need a new charger for your GBA Micro then this will get the job done.	1
Blew up in the first charge . Horrible quality, avoid like the plague!	-1
The charger tore up, and wire came off.	-1
It's a charger, it does what it needs to, that's all there is to say.	1
Works.	1
Good product. As it says in the announce	1
glad to find a new plug for my gameboy micro! :D	1
Fits great and works	1
Hey I can play pokemans again!	1
Charges the gameboy! What a wonderfully futuristic and awesome age we live in!	1
I thought it didn't work so I sent it back. Bought another and I think I've learned the problem lies in my GameBoy Micro :(	1
It didn't work. Do not buy	-1
Looking for a replacement? Buy this, it works. Have had it for about a year or more now and it hasn't let me down.	1
This charger is constructed as well as one would expect for the price. I don't abuse my chargers, so I'm not worried.  Retractable prongs are a plus. Works well. I'd buy another if I needed it.	1
the charger is okay and works perfectly it is also the original nintendo one with the logo and everything !	1
Seriously its a small adapter that charges a Micro Game boy. Yes it charged my Game boy fine, and that's all there is to this review.	1
they just don't make any chargers for this and are hard to find so this is just a life saver for me	1
Its a charger. Not name brand. But it worked. Would buy again if I needed to. Need four more words.	1
I bought an old game boy micro off the internet and ordered this charger separate. I worried it would not work, but it fully charged the unit within an hour. Great product!	1
This Is Eaiser Than the first one, but it's pretty fun i liked it. You get to play some original characters like, Bad Mister Frosty, Taffy, The Blob,  Bonker& Ickybodclay(My Favorite).  If You liked this game then check out, Clayfigter, C2: Judgement clay, Clay Fighter Extreme, Clayfighter 63 1/3: Sculptor's Cut, Clay Fighter: Tournament Edition.	1
I bought this game way back and recently played it again.. well..  the game was easy to beat when i was 6 and its still as easy.  Well, my problem(s)?  Not enough characters and its just not very fun and.. yeah that makes it boring.. but if ur a fan of the older games ( like me ) you may like this game ( unlike me )  It's cheap now so, I guess it wouldn't hurt to pick it up.. it costs as much cash as to rent a game at the videostore..  so do what you want with it.	-1
I have been a fan of the whole of the Clay Fighter series and i have to say that i am slightly disappointed with this one.  The graphics are okay, there are plenty of characters to choose from, but i think that it is far to easy and that the game had been rushed.  The price is excellent and i recommend to everyone that you get this as the price of this game won't be around for long.  If you want the best fighting game on the N64 then i wouldnt recommend this, but if you want some fun then this is the game for you	1
I liked this game alot, it's challenging and it took me awhile to beat (longer than most other games). I do recommend buying the strategy guide because it's easy to miss alot. Anyways if you like the original Myst you'll love this. Great graphics, only flaws was there was a glitch here and there but nothing major.	1
The Playstation version of Riven is definantly not as good as the PC version, but it still adds up to be a great experience. Solid gameplay, crips graphics, and top-notch sound. But still falls short in some areas. Disc changing can get very tedious. That's one reason why I recommend the DVD version for the pc. But it's no doubt this game will suck you in and keep you sucked for a long time. Get ready to experience a whole new world.	1
Back in 1993, a little game called Myst appeared. Everyone went crazy for  it -- it featured amazing graphics, addicting search and explore gameplay,  and it was actually educational. A main part of the game was reading, so it  figures that many parents were so supportive of it. It was also, though,  terribly spooky at times. You could be anywhere in the world of Myst and  still feel a general sense of... well, spookiness. But Myst was in 1993  -- and even though it held well throughout several years (which is  amazingly good), it started to be noticed more as a classic than current  technology. So how well can "Riven: The Sequel To Myst" hold up  against "current technology" and the original classic? By simply  making the adventure more intresting, more long, and with more  "spookiness" -- an original Myst-cliche that adds drama to the  game. "Riven" is even more rewarding than "Myst" so  much to the fact that it is sometimes speechless. There's five CDs to the  game -- that's clearly enough for anyone to buy this game. Even as it  starts out, you better look for clues. The developers made it so that if  you do not look for enough information, you could go from one disc to  another in less than 20 minutes. The graphics, while nice, aren't the  best in the world. Even the control (using the Playstation controller) is  sometimes sticky. But believe me, you'll get used to it. It's definetly  worth a buy from any fans of the "Myst" era.	1
i've played all the capcom maevel games and this is the best the hulk is actually green .not pink or grey but green like he is suposed to be.the rounds go fast	1
I still remember when I first bought this game back in 1997.  It was when I first got my PS and I wasn't disappointed. The graphics were pretty crisp and clear and it had a nice little selection of playable characters including Spiderman, Iron Man, The Hulk, Psylocke, Wolverine and others.  For those who played Marvel vs. Capcom 2 before this one, the movement may feel a little slow to you.  However, this was the first of the Marvel vs. Capcom style games so don't expect it to be as good as MVC2. The default controls for this game are the easiest to work with of any of the Marvel titles.  You'll find it easy to learn and it fits the PS controller perfectly.  Air combos can be pulled off easily but it may take a while for some to learn how to do them. On this game you'll find that the characters hyper combos are much more powerful than they are on MVC2.  However, since this was the first of these type of fighter games, the characters have less moves to execute.  The thing that really separates this game from all of the others is the Gems.  There are 6 Gems that you may use during battle and different ones have different effects on certain characters.  For example when Juggernaut uses the space gem, he turns silver and gains super armor.  When Psylocke uses the Power gems she creates 3 copies of herself so then it's like fighting 3 of them at once.  The final boss on this game is Thanos.  He's better than the boss on the other Marvel titles because he's actually a challenge.  He automatically starts the match with all 6 gems and he also has 6 different hyper combos he can do with each gem.  Also this game actually has endings for the characters and the music is superior to all of the other titles except for Marvel vs. Street Fighter. I recommend you buy this game if you can find it for a reasonable price.  You won't be disappointed.  It may seem outdated for those who played MVC2 before playing this but it's still enjoyable.	1
Don't you remember the times about 7 or so years ago before the vs. games like X-Men Vs. Street Fighter or Marvel Super Heroes Vs. Street Fighter were out, when you were at your local mall's arcade room, and you spent so much time and needed money on this one game everyone was lining up to play, you kept winning and no one could beat you, you had a blast and you ruled the arcade, you used the Amazing Spider-Man, or Good Ol' Stars and Stripes himself, Captain America, and maybe a little Incredible Hulk was throw in just to show off your skills with multiple players, and you used the Infamouse Yellow, Blue, Green, and all other Gems you could get your hands on to build Speed, Strength, Power, Defence and pretty much eveything else with your character! Well I do, and I was so stoked when it came out, and now you can bring those great feelings back with the PSX Version of this classic fighter from Capcom!  Gameplay: Almost arcade perfect with minimal slowdowns, barely noticeable, and you can still pull off everything in here that was possible in the arcade version.  Sound: Perfect, unmuffled voices that match perfectly to all characters, and music is still here(and still rules)with no remixes(Thank God)! Music plays just like you would hear it in the arcade!  Graphics: Great considering the Ram limitations of the PSX(like that was a problem for this game in the 1st place), and they were done with POLYGONS, yes, POLYGONS!  Characters: You get a line up of the following characters: 1. Spider-Man (My favorite! "Maximum Spider!")  2. Captain America ("Justice Will Prevail")  3. The Incredible Hulk (What's to say, he's a "Monster" hahahahahaha...sorry.)  4. Magneto (He rules and can pull off great combos!)  5. Wolverine (The cheap one)  6. Juggernaut (He's huge and probably deals more damage than anyone!)  7. Iron Man (With the Infamouse "Proton Cannon!")  8. Blackheart (A good and Cheep caharacter, but not as much as Wolvie.)  9. Psylocke (One of my favorite X-men, and overall choice over Wolvie, to bad Gambit wasn't included.)  10. Shuma-Gorath (Not used by me, but still deals damage needed to prevail in this game.)  Over-All: If I could, a 9.3/10.0, but I can't, so 4 out of 5, the reason being, could have been one point better if it weren't for the PSX limitations, but man, that definetly didn't stop me from getting it AT ALL! GET IT IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT!!  Thank's to Amazon.com for posting this review and YOU for reading it!	1
Mega Man Legends is a great new series for mega man.  The story takes him to an island searching for energy crystals on his dig adventures.  Game play is fun and easy to learn.  The game has plenty of secret goodies for you too discovery adding hours of replay value.  easy and fun to play but not easy enough that you'll only spend oh...one week or so one it.  Loads of fun a most have for hardcore mega man and new mega man fans of all ages!!!	1
Forsaken 64 is one of those games that you never heard of and play it anyways and you find it to be an awesome game. The single-player is intense and the multiplayer is crazier than that. The game itself has six-degrees of freedom so you can shoot upside-down, sideways, etc. The single-player has tons of missions and you will not get through it in one setting. I never actually figured out how to save the game, but I will figure it out eventually. The multiplayer you can either play with bots or with your friends. The game supports 4-player multiplayer, even thought sadly I've only played it with only one other person. The multiplayer game is like a deadlier version of hide and seek because the maps are so big. One thing I like about playing it with bots is being able to play it splitscreen so it's like there are 3 other people in the room with you. Overall, the game is great and is a definite buy for every N64 fan!	1
This game was a blast! At least 7 years ago for me. But I have fond memories of it, and enjoyed playing it with friends. That's all I have to say about that.	1
very boring game.  The graphics are the average 64 graphics that many 64 games had at the time.  Very dull textures.  Even though this game has a neat aspect of movement in every direction, it still lacks fun gameplay.  The music is very annoying and i have heard better on the SNES system quality wise.  I don't reccomend this game even if you are a collector.	-1
I think after buying this, my wallet is Forsaken... I am Mistaken that this game is what I bought, it came in a box called Forsaken, I played this game about 3 times before giving it up cause I couldn't control the characters or understand the plot line.  I know that I have skills... but this game made me look stupid.  Cut your losses and buy something else like Quake II... now that rocks.	-1
One of a kind game, a classic by kenji himself	1
husband loves it so I love it too	1
Game works great, amazing story that brings back childhood memories, i love it!!! Awesome game to have that is old school.	1
Looking anywhere else people will charge more than $80 for an old wonderful game like this. Classic games like these are hard to come by, wish I had traded in LESS of my games when I was young.	1
Megaman legends is capcoms answer to bringing Megaman into the 3d realm on the original playstation. However this game is extremly diffrent then any other megaman game out there. In fact it has a lot in common with zelda: ocarina of time and a few rpg elements such as final fantasy while still somewhat feeling like a Megaman game. Coming from the NES and SNES Megamans I never thought I would ever compare zelda and megaman together but surprisingly it works well. Its not the greatest  game or even the greatest megaman game ever but it is really fun in its own way.  Most people do not like the graphics in this game but i think there done really well. The only problem graghicly is due to the early psx hardware most 3d games looked blocky and pixely at the time and this on tries to smooth things out kinda cel shadish but not quite this leads to some blockeness but its still better then most 1998 and before graphics. Kinda a 3d playable anime style to it. The sound isn't to bad in this game. Voice acting can be really good or painfully bad andThe music is catchy maybe not as much as the nes megamans but still good. However there is moments without any music. Technically speaking I would say the game has aged well.  The thing I find most memorable about this game is the gameplay. Like I mentioned earlier this game takes megaman into zelda like enviorments with a few rpgs elements. There is a open world which was decent in size for its time, which the game takes place in a small town. There are dungeons to explore which you do so in order to find upgrades to your equipment. Speaking of which you can purchase and find diffrent armor and weopens with diffrent specs (attack, fire rate, etc) in a rpg like menu. With that being said it still manages to feel like a megaman game. There is plenty of missions of which you are running and gunning while jumping on platforms. The bosses while set up like zelda can be taken down easier by weopens you find around in dungeons.  As for the story it isn't to bad. It is a little childish but its still pretty good. The characters while the voice acting can be off at times can be good are very memorable. Tron Bonne makes her debut here as a villian who became popular enough to get her own game misadventures of tron bonne and a apperance in marvel vs. capcom 2 and appearing without megaman in the 3rd. There is also a N64 port of this game which isn't as good but if you don't have a psx its still playable plus a sequel. Anyway while the hardcore 8bit megaman players may be turned off by this i would still recomend getting this game	1
Good game overall. Its fun and easy but rewarding. The voice overs are so cheesy that its actually funny and enjoyable to listen too. If you have not played this game yet and you enjoy mega man get this game.	1
I remember playing this when I was 12. The story was great and I played it through more times than I can remember.	1
I am very satisfied with the product, it came in a good time and the customer service provided was great.	1
Legends is one of the rare Megaman releases that takes place in a 3D world as opposed to the traditional 2D side scroller most MM fans are familiar with. Both Legends and Legends 2 are among some of the best made story driven 3D adventure games the PSX has in its massive and sometimes daunting library.	1
I will never forget the first time I played this game. A friend of mine had been talking about it for months when I was finally able to borrow a PlayStation and rent a copy of this game. It is really a fun Action RPG with elements of Mega Man, Indiana Jones, and Zelda.	1
This was my first action RPG and its the best basically if your an older player like me, 23, may not hold up  graphically today but it is a very fun and expansive game for its time.	1
I already own this game but it's in terrible condition. This is due to me lending it out, which is something I certainly don't do anymore. My favorite Megaman game period, along with 2, I had to get it again. And I have no regrets. Besides, I have 2 copies of the game now: One with only case and disc that have seen their better days and a newer complete copy that reminds me of my original copy in its prime.	1
Megaman Legends This is my undisputed favorite game of all time. I bought it in 1998 or so because I had played and loved&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Mega-Man-3/dp/B00004SVS5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Mega Man 3</a>&nbsp;for the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Nintendo-NES-System-Video-Game-Console/dp/B00004SVYQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Nintendo NES System - Video Game Console</a>&nbsp;when I was young. This game was nothing like that game or any other Megaman games. It was in 3-D and had a story that would blow your mind. I have played through this game around 50 times and no every single part of it by heart.  Graphics- 7/10 The transition to 3-D for Megaman isn't an ugly one, but a decent one. Most of the trees have a 2-D look to them and a lot of characters are blocky. Still, you can tell what everything is easily and there is no slowdown at all. Not to mention, there is hardly any load time to wait through in this game.  Story- 10/10 You are Megaman Volnutt. Roll Casket and her Grandpa, Barrel Casket, have raised you since they found you when you were a child. Following Barrel's footsteps, Megaman and Roll become Diggers. Diggers are people who search through ruins, infested with Reaverbots, to find parts and other things. The main thing a lot of Diggers are looking for are Refractors, which are extremely powerful crystal-like objects that power society. The world is almost entirely ocean so people must use flying machines or boats to get around. Megaman, Roll, and Barrel crash-land their flying ship, The Flutter, on an island called Kattelox. You go on to discover the island's many secrets and fight off the treasure hungry pirates.  Sound- 7/10 The music and sound effects in this game are decent. Nothing will blow your mind away but nothing will annoy you to death. Some tunes even become catchy, like the Apple Market tune.  Gameplay- 10/10 You play as Megaman: exploring ruins, fighting pirates, and just helping people out. There are a lot of side quests you can do. You can join a secret gang, fill a museum with underground arts, help a little girl recover, play in game shows, and so much more. The main storyline has you exploring the Sub-Gate ruins in hopes to learn more about the Island's great treasure, or disaster. While in Sub-Gates you can find all kinds of items to do things with. It's not just in the Sub-Gates either; you can search in other digging sites for parts. You have a primary weapon called a Buster Gun, which can be upgraded with 2 buster parts initially. These buster parts can be bought or found and change different aspects of your Buster Gun's shooting. You have a secondary special weapon that can be equipped and upgraded as well. You will get many different special weapons in the game and one of the most fun parts of the game is upgraded your weapons to perfect ability.  Difficulty- 4/10 (Note- This is how much I like the difficulty) Since this game is more story based, the difficulty is slight. There is hardly a time where you feel that you are going to die, minus a few bosses. Once you beat the original game, you can go back and play it on a new Hard Mode option. The game is still not that much more difficult but some of the bosses will give you more trouble. Also, to top it off, the game isn't that long. Even the player who likes to talk to every single person and gets lost often can still beat this game in less then 15 hours. That includes the main storyline and all side quests, minus special weapon upgrading. I can now beat the game on Hard Mode in around 5 hours.  Overall- 10/10 Despite the game being easy and not having the best graphics or sound, it's still 5 stars. The game's storyline and gameplay is so good that the rest doesn't even matter. You'll still find yourself going back and playing this game over and over again.	1
This was a very chanllenging game for me it. Took me about three months to beat the even old original 64 verison way back in mid 2000 I think it was when back when I was about and was midway through my final and last growth ssuppert. I belive I later when I was about 14  got the newer playstation version. I unfortunatley due to a couple years lack of experience had to use the invulerability and zeeny to comple in a lower completion time of about maybe 10 to 40 hours compared to the original  completer time of about maybe 30 to 80  hours maybe more or less. This game will be fun once you get used to some changes. One megaman like in the later  games of the original series was original drastically increased in size at a huge height of abou 4 to 6 six feet tall and abhout probaly weighs about  130 to maybe 350 pounds witrh his armor on this is the biggest mega man ever made.  Once you learn how to concort the stroneger boss with high atatck strenght and to dog them this may be a piece of cake.  To beat Jungo increas e every thing one the midssle launcher to max this will give you infinite ammo. With this one the ammo update to unlimited if you pay up enough zeeny You cane beat juno easily. Just hold down the button the missle will shot of function like heat seakers. As long as you have infinite health slash cantina points one you can sit there turning your missle into the ultimate automatic fire weapon. Pushbed the out fire down and  keep shooting them of at rapid speed. Even if you get hit you should be able to take this boss down and complety both parts of the battle in about maybe 45 second  20 minutes maybeless. This  is a fun games I hope you enjopy it even though roll is now longer robotic, and Rusha and Beta no longer exist. If you like this and want a really challange to test your patience and enduranc eplay the insanly hard megaman legends 2 also avilable in playstation format.	1
This game was very good. The first 3D megaman game to be released.	1
If you find Street Fighter Alpha 3 overwhelming, then you should try Street Fighter Alpha 2.  18 characters containing some of the most popular characters from the series: Ryu, Ken, Dan, Chun-Li (has her Kikoken fireball, but not her Spinning Bird Kick), Akuma, Sakura, Zangief, Dhalsim, Sagat, and he-plays-just-like-Guile Charlie.  Each character has his/her own ending. You don't need to worry about what strength to use when using super combos, because each one takes only one "power" bar.  Great soundtrack, if you played Puzzle Fighter, then some of the music should be familiar to you.  Graphics are great, taunts are outstanding, and game control is excellent.  If you have a chance, grab this classic.	1
Finally, after YEARS of seeing Mega Man in 2D shooter side-scroller gameplay, Capcom began to realize the video game scene was changing, and realism was becoming more important than ever.  So in 1997 Capcom decided to take the classic gameplay of the old Mega Man games and bring Mega Man to an ENTIRE new 3D world.  I finally got to experience the 3D Mega Man adventure a few days ago, in July 2006.  So it took me NINE years to finally play it!  What can I say?  I'm slow!  I have a few problems with certain parts of the game but overall, I'm happy to report that the jump to 3D was a good one (not to mention a NECESSARY one!)  Mega Man spends the entire time in Legends jumping and shooting through a unique 3D environment.  I'm surprised so many people hate the graphics in the game.  They're quite wonderful if you ask me.  Sure, the graphics may be dated because the game is nearly 10 years old (and walking around in Mega Man Legends is sort of like walking around in a giant land of legos) but none of that should matter because you have to take into account the amount of FUN a game provides.  Mega Man Legends provides a LOT of fun.  I really loved one of the very first boss fights in the game where I had to keep running and hiding behind buildings because these giant walking blue, red and yellow machines were throwing bombs and shooting laser beams at me.  The first time I completed this battle it took a good 30 minutes ONLY for a bigger, badder machine to come in and defeat me in seconds.  At first I was angry because the game wouldn't let me SAVE before fighting this fourth boss.  "A half hour of work flushed down the toilet" was the thought that went through my head.  That led me to think the game might be too hard for me to handle, but it turned out I just didn't have the right upgrades for my X-buster equipped (actually I didn't have ANYTHING equipped!) so when I went back to do the battle again I defeated him (her, actually) rather easily.  Most of the enemies throughout the game are rather easy to defeat (including the boss fights).  Many of the boss fights will keep you on your toes, though.  The strategy to defeating many of them is to KEEP RUNNING and only turn around when the moment is right and BLAST them!  The only boss who isn't easy is the very last boss (who sounds like Michael Jackson) because he has TWO forms.  The first form you can figure out with practice, but on the second form he turns into a giant machine and THEN the challenge increases.  But it's possible to find enough money to carry up to 10 Sub-tanks to help you out DRASTICALLY.  If you were to carry 10 Sub-tanks he would be a VERY easy boss!  Despite that, the game provides a nice challenge because the way the story unfolds forces you to do a LOT of things.  You have to go HERE, you have to go THERE!  You have to collect THIS, you have to collect THAT!  You'll find out just how many items and weapons are in the game when you hit the Start button and see everything in your inventory.  It's borderline INSANE.  You see, to help make the game easier, what you have to do is go around searching for things (things located in treasure chests or holes in walls) and then you have to bring the things you collect back to this yellow vehicle where your female friend (or sister, I forget who she is) will be inside.  She can find ways to turn many of the things you collect into important weapons for you to use.  She must be smart!  I think I explained myself correctly, there.  It's kind of confusing because there's so many things you have to collect and that's the main reason I can't give the game a perfect 5-star rating.  TOO MUCH!  In Mega Man Legends you will find SO many weapons and SO many upgrades that it can easily confuse someone (like me) who's normally not exposed to this much activity in a video game.  You have to find a little dancing monkey to save your game.  When you're lost, he can also help you by telling you where to go, unfortunately many times he doesn't provide enough information.  So you can be left wandering around for hours until you finally have no choice but to find a strategy guide on the internet to help you out.  The music in the game is nice.  It's usually played quietly which is odd because most Mega Man music is RIGHT in your face.  If you can actually hear the music, it's pretty much what you'd expect from a Mega Man game.  Listen to those sound effects!!  Sound familiar?  Think South Park!  One of the children (or "pirates") sounds JUST like Butters, and a newswoman who appears later in the game sounds like Kyle's mom!  Some of the animation looks like South Park, too.  When did South Park come out?  1997?  Hmmm, makes you wonder...  Once again, the graphics.  They aren't as bad as I thought they'd be.  Sort of blocky, of course (since this IS Playstation ONE we're talking about here) but I can't bring myself to really hate the graphics because there's a certain mysterious charm about them.  Mega Man Legends LOOKS like a children's game but it's not, really.  Most children wouldn't be able to complete the game because some boss strategies require careful timing and it would be difficult for a child.  The play control... goodness.  It's definitely not easy to figure out at first.  To make Mega Man walk straight, you have to hold down the L and R buttons (this rotates the direction Mega Man is facing) while at the same time you have to use the up, down, left and right buttons to make Mega Man walk forward.  So, because you have to do a lot of running in Mega Man Legends, when an enemy is chasing you and RIGHT behind you, you have to turn around, use the L and R buttons to face him, and THEN hit him.  In the middle of hitting the L and R buttons will probably be the time you take the most hits.  It may take a few hours to properly pull off but you *should* become better at it with practice.  A trick to help you: when an enemy is chasing you, run as far away from him as possible and THEN turn around.  Usually the enemy will be far enough away that you will have time to control Mega Man so he's facing the enemy directly.  Then, simply wait for the enemy to get close and fire away!  I wouldn't blame you if you couldn't figure out the controls- it's not the greatest way to control a character.  I'm not sure if Capcom improved the play control in Mega Man Legends 2.  I find it funny and insulting that when you find a hole in a wall, many times a *very* small amount of money will be located there.  Small enough to not be able to afford ANYTHING.  It's funny because Capcom made it like "wow, you found money!" only to insult you with sofa cushion money.  To find a LOT of money you have to run around shooting enemies.  Just running around shooting enemies and collecting zenny (money) is a lot of fun, not to mention addicting.  A pretty good game worth picking up.	1
To me, Mega Man Legends is one of those games you'll remember years after playing it. The game itself doesn't break any new ground and has its share of flaws, but the overall experience is definitely rewarding.  Mega Man Legends pretty much plays like the earlier Tomb Raider games control wise. Unfortunately, there are a few problems with the control scheme, such as a lock on system that doesn't allow you to move while locked on an enemy (which was fixed in MML2), and the fact you also must contend with moving the camera manually in order to compensate for the lack of a better lock on system to hit your mark.  Legends also uses a pretty similar graphic engine as Tomb Raider as well, complete with all the flat, 2D scenery that rotates with the camera and all the pixilated surfaces and clipping problems that accompanied that era of Playstation gaming. Unlike Tomb Raider, the environments in Mega Man Legends are much brighter and colorful, adding to the games cartoon-like feel, rather than the dark, dank death-trap ridden tombs that Lara Croft raids.  The pretty low difficulty level of the game is also an important factor to look at as well. Considering this game is somewhat geared towards an younger audience, this isn't an error so to speak, but older, more experienced players will fly through the game in a handful of hours (especially considering most of the game bosses can be defeated by constantly circling around them and firing). Thankfully, Capcom added an unlockable difficulty setting to make the game harder for those looking for an additional challenge (oh and is it ever a challenge). Add to this Capcom increased the difficulty on Mega Man Legends 2 a few notches, and all can be forgiven here.  So with all these problems, why is Legends such a good game? Heart, and lots of it. Mix in a good story, a wonderful cast of characters (and enemies), and throw in some of Capcom's more respectable forays in voice acting department, and you got a winner. While some may claim that Legends carries a "kiddy tone", I actually find this to be one of the game's charms and strengths. Honestly, if you don't laugh when one of the Lego Men, err, I mean Servebots messes up and angers Tron, there is something wrong. Seriously, it isn't anymore kiddy than a Mario or Zelda game (or most of Nintendo's gaming library for that matter).  The other thing that makes the Legends series so great is the fact Capcom decided to quit while they were ahead. While I myself still wish they would churn out a Mega Man Legends 3 (considering some of the unresolved issues in Mega Man Legends 2's ending), at least Capcom didn't make a zillion sequels and drain the series of all it's fun and respectability, of which they have done a fine job of doing to the original series and X series.  In the end, Mega Man Legends is not a game you'll remember for amazing graphics, razor-sharp control, or challenging quests. Instead, you'll walk away with a overall memorable experience.	1
For the "Ace combat" initiated, this game is a lot better that the original "Ace Combat" for it's graphics and play, although I have to say how much I enjoyed "Ace Combat" too, in the beginning. Not only have the grapics been improved but the game now includes a scannar that actually tellls you which way the enemy planes are pointing - a must for the correct deployment of missiles. Missions are plentiful and, in addition to the possibility to select a wingman (or, indeed wing"woman" as sexual equality aware NAMCO has included) you can even direct him or her to take on a certain part of the mission, or do the mission without support, as you wish. There are the usual night missions and canyon-runs, and plenty of planes to choose from. Game action is very smooth too. The planes available in the more advanced stages of the missions are great. An enjoyable game!	1
My first Ace combat game was Electrosphere or number 3 in 98 so 12 years later i decided to give this one a go.  It's a lot of fun, and after you configure your controls to how you like it becomes even better.  Compared to 3, this one is a bit more fast paced, but the graphics are noticeably lower in quality.  The one quarrel I have, though it is a given for all pre 96ish (i think) PlayStation games is you can't use the analog sticks, which i always used in the third AC, and even though it's just a little stick, not having it really takes away from the flying feel.	1
This is an excellent game for spending some time on. I have played it before on a demo cd long ago so that's why I decided to buy it. It's about passing missions and destroying planes, bases, ships, etc. It find it very fun. The missions happen in different ambiences and time of the day which makes it more interesting. You can get new planes with different attributes according to what you want. A great title for the ps.	1
There seems to be a curse on Ace Combat akin to that on the Star Trek movies. And by that I mean that the odd numbered members of the series are forgettable, while the even numbered (save perhaps zero, but zero is the absence of value, right?) are stellar. Ace Combat 6. Awesome. Ace Combat 5. Uneven and over too quick. Ace Combat 4. Perfect. Ace Combat 3. Had half the missions removed for the U.S. release. Ace Combat 1 (Air Combat). Stone Age. And Ace Combat 2...  If you're into classic gaming and love the Playstation (and especially if you love air combat games) this is a definite buy. The sheer imagination that was put into this game is wonderful. You have night missions, sea missions, desert missions, high-altitude missions, ravine missions, and oh-so-wonderful city-liberation mission.  I've said it before and I'll say it again, there's more to graphics than just how many polygons you have and how detailed your textures are. Graphics, even low-res graphics, can and should be BEAUTIFUL. And beautiful this game is in all its Playstation polygon glory. The lighting, the jets, the far off cityscapes and the clouds in the sky, it's all just beautiful (to me at least). And better yet, unlike other air combat games of the era, everything moves at a rocketing speed. Even when you get close to the ground (where other games look like you're moving in slow motion), the game keeps a great sensation of speed.  The controls are uniformly tight, utilizing the analog controls to the full. And you can bank and pitch completely upside down, something that many similar arcade-style games of the time don't allow. The game also features a wonderful cockpit view that brings you into the experience even more. There's also voice chatter as you go, some nice arcade style music, and full voice command briefings (nice). Of course you also hear "Bingo!" every time you hit a target and get a comment every time you miss too, but that's just keeping with the arcade feel. The enemy A.I. might not be as good as you can get now, but it's definitely good for when this game came out, and you can still get shot down if you play on hard and don't watch yourself.  In my opinion this game was the first great console air combat game. If you love arcade style air combat games and play Playstation games, you just have to get this game.	1
works well for me, except i can't get my championships to show at the end. Im not sure if that is a glitch or not.	1
This game is a classic, I first played it at the arcade around 1996, but the game came out around 94-95. Of course, you won't find beautiful visuals, this is piece of history, one of the first 3D fighting games ever created. It was groundbreaking for it's time, and to this day I still find it addictive. Each character has a unique fighting style, and these styles keep getting inherited on every sequel, most noticeable Paul, Jack, Yoshimitsu and Law. The Playstation version actually expands the arcade version, adding ending movies and extra characters. There is an arcade version in Tekken 5 as part of the bonus arcade history games, Tekken 2 and 3 are also included. If you enjoyed games like Rival Schools, Mortal Kombat 4 or Dead or Alive, you definately need to play this.	1
While the game may be outdated and not as fun to play as some of the more recent titles, I can't fault this game because this is where it all started.  On its own merit in 1995, it was a smash-box hit and everybody was ahhed by the graphics, 3d environments, and the musical score. Back then, we were used to Super Mario World and Final Fight. This was something completely different. No one cared about the flaws the game had back then. It was par for the course.  Now, in 2012, a whole 17 years later (really? that long ago...), a person can easily recognize the flaws of gameplay, sound, and playability. Sound effects are lo-fi, almost like comparing a cassette to a CD. The soundtrack is still amazing though, as if it were mapped on an entirely different bit format. Playability, there is one overall mode - the 1P Arcade mode (unless you count options and 2P). Every successful completion of the game with a character unlocks a new character to choose - the same one you fight in round 8. After that, you have all of the characters and there's not much else to do. There's no team battle, no survival, just...1P Arcade. So it works for 1995. The ending movies are pretty bad, all having the same soundtrack and really blocky ugly CGI. Of course in retrospect, this WAS 1995.  The movies never got better in the series until much later, but they did improve some.  Overall, Tekken deserves a place in your PSX collection, right next to 2 and 3. You won't play it often because Tekken 2 covers all of those bases and more. So to me, at least, this game is merely a collection piece.	1
Ever since I was young, I have been in love with the Tekken series. Brings back a lot of good memories. I bought this game to bring back the memories and the fun. Though the graphics aren't as top notch at games these days are, but it's still an entertaining game to play. If you collect either Tekken stuff or video games, this is a must own.	1
Never actually owned the original Tekken but I played it. Since I'm the best Tekken player in the universe, I've decided that I want to own the game that started it all....	1
Well i bought it because i wanted to collect all the tekken games(i did :D) and it brings back alot of memories	1
The graphics and gameplay are very out dated. The movies at the end are stupid and only the first eight players have them. The only reason I even got this game is because I loved Tekken 2,3,Tag, and 4. The only reason I don't sell this is I want to have all the tekkens, but if you want to buy it, don't pay more than $2 for it.	-1
THIS GAME WAS GREAT. THOUGH IT DOESN'T COMPARE TO ITS ORIGINAL ARCADE MACHINE, THIS HOME VERSION IS NICE ANYWAY. THE FIGHTS ARE ALL FUN, THE GRAPHICS STILL LOOK FANTASTIC EVEN THOUGH THIS GAME IS NEARLY A DECADE OLD NOW, AND THE CHARACTERS ARE ALL GOOD AND THE STORYLINES ARE ALL INTERESTING. TO UNLOCK THE BOSSES [WHICH IS THE MAIN THING], YOU HAVE TO BEAT THEM ALL WITH THEIR ALREADY AVAILABLE COUNTERPARTS. THE FIRST TIME YOU BEAT HEIHACHI [WHICH IS THE MAIN BOSS FOR THIS GAME], YOU GET HIM UNLOCKED. BUT THE REST OF THEM, YOU HAVE TO PLAY AS THE COUNTERPARTS TO GET THEIR BOSSES. EVEN WITH THE PLAYSTATION 2 AND X BOX AND STATE OF THE ART SYSTEMS LIKE THAT ON THE MARKET, MANY OF THE GAMES THEY PUT OUT TODAY CAN'T COMPARE TO CLASSIC GAMES LIKE THIS! THIS IS ONE OF THE ALL-TIME GREATEST FIGHTING GAMES EVER AND I DARE SAY THIS MIGHT BE THE BEST OF THE TEKKEN SERIES. EVEN HAS GREAT MUSIC.	1
The first time I played this game I was amazed by the sheer quality coming out of this game. The grahics were absolutly incredible and the gameplay was out of this world. This was all in 1995. Now that tekken2 and tekken3 had arrived on the scene it seemed as though tekken had faded to a fairyland. Back then in junior school everyone was in conversation about all the characters and the secret ones and how you unlocked them. And know that games like tekken2, tekken3 and soulbade coming to the playstation tekken was suddenly never an issue. All I know is that tekken was a fantastic game at launch and had also beaten virtua fighter on the saturn which was a rival to tekken. If tekken had never come out then I believe with a 100% that none of the existing games that I have mentioned above and their sequals would have been in existance. Despite these games being in existance tekken is still a soulfighter and is the game that made namco famous on the playstation.	1
After defeating Xenogears, I was looking for a game that was fun to play, and didn't require me to do much thinking. Xenogears was a monster game that had a fantastic, yet confusing plot that really made you think. Breath of Fire 3 is a complete change of pace. Instead of going for an engrossing and confusing plot like FF7 and Xenogears, Breath of Fire 3 continues a simple, but fun plot that feels refreshing to play after finishing a monster game like Xenogears. Breath of Fire 3 doesn't have an overly confusing story. Once long ago, there was a clan on earth known as the dragon clan. After gaining enough power to destroy the world, the dragon clan suddenly disappeared. You play as Ryu, a young boy who suffers from amnesia. He soon befriends two thieves named Rei and Teepo. After he gets into trouble with the authorities, he soon finds out he is an ancestor of the dragon clan. So he embarks on a journey to uncover his mysterious past. Sound original? Sorry, but if it's originality that you want, you won't find it here. Even the battle system is painfully unoriginal. As you play it, it will feel like you have played something else exactly like it. The story, the battle system, everything feels like it was used many times before, and i hate to say this, but the ending is very disappointing. However, with all gripes aside, Breath of Fire 3 is a fun and engaging quest. My favorite part of the game was the characters; they are interesting, and very funny. I also liked that the plot never once got confusing. Even though it was unoriginal, it never got off target and it even sometimes kept you on the edge of your seat. With all the complaints aside, Breath of Fire 3 is fun game to play through. After playing through a monster game like Xenogears, it is refreshing to play. Unfortunately, don't get too excited about the ending.	1
Breath of Fire III's old-school graphics capture the feel of old RPGs, and how good they were, playing on NES and Super NES, back in the old days. Now  I still play SNES, playing such good games as Super Godzilla, Breath of  Fire I, and the Final Fantasy series. The storyline goes as follows--Ryu is  a survivor of an ancient race of dragons, the Brood, which nearly destroyed  the world. However, he is a good dragon. He allies himself with Yraall  Region thieves, Rei and fellow dragon Teepo, who at the time doesn't know  he's a dragon. He aligns himself with the young Princess of Wyndia,  Princess Nina, and the daughter of a smart scientist, Momo, a mutated  vegetable named Peco who has a lot of significance at the end of the game,  and a Guardian of Urkan Tapa who's race once fought and defeated the  dragons in a war, Garr. Together they quest to find Ryu's origin and other  members of his race, and to find out if Ryu is evil or not. With beautiful  music, surroundings, and a great storyline, this is one of the best RPGs of  all--with many mini-games abound and a fantastic battle system. Definitely  get this if you're a fan of Capcom RPGs.	1
Breath of Fire Three is the third part to what was a very good series of RPGs. Breath of Fire One seems to be what most people I talk to about games  consider the best. Even though I loved Breath of Fire 2 the most. I  expected a lot from breath of fire 3. Perhaps this helped lower my opinion  of Breath of fire 3, but I did not like this game. As far as game play  goes like all BoF games in BoF 3 you have the ability to turn into a  dragon. Like BoF 1 and unlike BoF2 when you turn into a dragon you stay one  for a while. While you're a dragon you loose MP every turn to keep you from  staying one forever in that combat unlike BoF 1. All the character seem to  get their own special power. The character list is short and one of the  characters on the list of the book never fights with you as a character.  The training system you can find people to help you with is actually kind  of pointless weird and honestly I didn't like it. The town to town walking  is slow and you never get fast transportation. As far as plot goes the  plot is the plot starts off okay. Then about two hours in goes in a  different direction. It is fine for a while then but around the end is a  large dungeon that is boring to go threw and leaves the any not very much  of a climax. They lost any suspense you could have built up similar to the  Tales Of Destiny ending. Also the characters don't have very strong and  noticeable personalities. Also if you keep up with it you won't like the  direction the plot takes thirds of the way threw. As far as control goes  it's basically standard of with noting exceptionally notable about  it. The graphics to this game are not very good. It is done in sprites.  Sometimes I myself prefer sprits but I do not like the character drawings  of this game. On the walking town to town map character looks chubby and  short. The drawings are basic and too simple. There was only one of the  dragons I liked the look of. However there is a little onion that can  follow around with your party who beat all other RPGs in cuteness of a  single character. The cute hopping onion is defiantly the main reason to  buy this game if you do. And finally as far as length of time it can stay  interesting the game is longer them many RPGs won't be beaten on a short  rental. If you get this game buy it. Overall this game is the worst of  the BoF series. I don't recommend buying it unless its finishes some  collection you are working on, or if you have to see a hopping onion follow  people around.	-1

Breath of Fire III arrives almost three years after the fun-but strictly orthodox-Super NES title, Breath of Fire II. Although BOFIII isn't a radical departure from the earlier games in the series, don't let that turn you off; it's reassuring to see that sprite graphics haven't given way entirely to origami-style polygons. Sporting a quasi-medieval European setting, a heroic story line, and turn-based battles, BOFIII will appeal to fans of Square's Final Fantasy series and Working Designs' Lunar titles. An Epic Journey Breath of Fire III starts with the discovery of a tiny dragon that goes on a deadly rampage before it's captured. The dragon escapes and is transformed into a young boy named Ryu, who is befriended by a pair of delinquents, whose thoughtless pranks get them captured by some truly evil people. Ryu is left for dead, but his dragon powers revive him, so he sets off in pursuit of his friends' captors, unaware that he's about to be drawn into an ever-deepening pool of danger, deceit, and death. Like earlier BOF titles, Ryu can befriend several partners during his epic journey. Nina, the princess of Windia, makes another appearance in the series, although in this game she's apparently unrelated to her earlier incarnations. Ryu, too, shares the name of a character from the series, but he's also unrelated. However, Gobi, from the first BOF game, makes a cameo appearance. Nostalgic Graphics Graphically, BOFIII is leaps and bounds ahead of its predecessors. Texture-mapped polygons are used to create the backgrounds, terrain, and buildings, while sprites are used to compose the various characters. More animation, colors, and special effects have been added to this version, but the look of the game will still be familiar to fans of the BOF games. The three-quarter-overhead view field map can be rotated somewhat so you can peek behind obstacles, but not to any great extent. Battles are fought directly on the field map, with characters and monsters displayed diagonally in one of four directions: Two are seen from the front and two from the rear. Solid Craftsmanship The battle system is turn-based, with some consideration given to quickness: Characters move in sequence to their speed parameter. For example, in some battles you may want to use light armor so that your character moves quicker instead of heavy armor which can slow you down. Also, certain characters have speed parameters higher than their enemies and may get extra turns while fighting. Beyond the usual manual, magic, and item attacks, characters can transform into dragons. Initially, only Ryu has the power to transform (and only when he's far into the game), but the other characters gain that power later. Transformation, though, requires crystals called Dragon Genes and AP (magic points) for the Genes chosen. By combining up to three Genes, different dragons can be created; the more Genes you use, the more powerful your dragon, though you'll use more AP. AP is also consumed at a constant pace while the dragon is in battle. Finally, you can learn monster skills for special attacks and spells. The construction of Breath Of Fire III's battle system-and of the whole game, for that matter-is very polished-thanks to excellent controls. You won't be moaning about the way this game handles. Sound Bites However, all isn't well in BOFIII. The sound effects are fine, if not particularly inspired. In battle, the characters emit rudimentary shouts, screams, and spell names, but not much more. And even though the sounds can get annoying, they're not anywhere near as badly done as the soundtrack. The music veers widely from unmemorable electronica to hopeless schmaltz, and more often than not, it doesn't add to the atmosphere of the story. The music seems more appropriate for a corporate infomercial than a heroic fantasy RPG. Aside from the inexplicably bad soundtrack, BOFIII is worth a long look from RPG fans. Although it doesn't possess the visual and aural magnificence of Final Fantasy VII (which few games will ever accomplish), Breath of Fire III holds up as a very enjoyable RPG in which sure craftsmanship is easily evident.	1
this is an excellent game that really has some substance! the graphics are not the best and it is oversahdowed by the bigger game final fantasy VII. if FF7 was too long for you, get breath of fire 3. the story is good and the battle system is great!	-1
Breath of Fire III is one of those games that can induce a trance of nostalgia upon thought.  I can say this about few games because most are powered by processors that reflect obsession with graphics and innovation.  Innovation is necessary, and appreciated, but games like BOF3 need never disappear.  It caters to the old-time gamer in all RPG veterens, delivering a simplistic save the world storyline and involving gameplay.  And what gameplay!  It's simplicity and charm will, hopefully, impress those who give it a chance because it is very deserving of credit.  Last, I must mention the fishing system.  It's incredibly addictive, simple, and enjoyable.  Nothing else could more easily describe it.  Throw in about another hundred fish and a wider variety of rods and bait, and you'd have a full game that I would have to own!  It's that good.  For everyone: whether an RPG-newbie or a hardcore veteren, you should give this game a chance.  Fun doesn't begin to describe it.	1
Many may disregard the Breath of Fire series as just another RPG but Capcom has done a beutiful Job with this title.  They pulled out a lot on this case.  Beutiful 2D graphics that only Capcom can do, good music, simple controls make this an excellent purchase.  Chances are you may find this at a good price somewhere so I say go for it.	1
With the genre monopolized by the the Final Fantasy series, it is not suprising that this game is absent from most people's top RPG list. To clarify, it is not as good as an FF game, but it is nonetheless enjoyable and fun. The story is pretty linear, the characters are well developed, and part III offers much of the same fun that was the original BOF for the SNES (which was produced by Squaresoft, not Capcom). The only drawback is the clunky controls, which can be frustrating when you are trying to move down stairs or bend around tight corners. And while the graphics are not on par with Final Fantasy IX or Chrono Cross, this is still a great looking game. Try it. I think you will like it.	1
Basically, Breath of Fire 4 stole a lot of ideas from it's predecessor, this one. It's kinda like a degraded Breath of Fire 4 actually, but still truly brilliant, and well worth buying.	1
"Breath of Fire 3" is a very interesting and well made game.  The plot is pretty good, and the characters are interesting and memorable.  One thing I do miss from the older "Breath of Fire" is the way they transformed into dragons; the process in the current game is excellent (I just prefer the older methods).  My favorite part of the game is that you start off playing a young version of the character, and then later in the game, you get to play a more mature version of the same character.  This game is a lot of fun and suitable for most people who enjoy the genre.	1
This was the only Breath of Fire game I've beaten.  But I must say that it was fun.  The story and side quests kept me going. One of the downers was that you can't hardly change your angle. A big thumbs up going to the fact that you don't have to change screens to get into a battle (like Chrono Trigger).  This saves lots of time and makes thing more dramatic!  Fighting in narrow hallways and thick forests was great! I'm not going to spoil it for anyone...but the ending sucked badly.  But not enough to stop me from buying the next sequel.  ^_^	1
Tekken 2 it the huge sequel to the best selling fighter, Tekken, this game includes advanced fighting and secret characters to die for. Not only theat, but it had a plethera of gameshark codes to make the game easier. this game also introduced the 10 hit combo, the automatic win. Namco has done it again and they have done it with flying colors, this game is a must have for the fighting fans.	1
This is my family,s favorite fighting game. From my six year old daughter on up to my 10yr. old son they love this game.  The graphics along with the sounds and moves are excellent also, there is a great character selection to choose from.	1
a+	1
I like this game . I love fight games!	1
Awesome, love it.	1
This is one of the best fighting games of all time! Definitely a timeless classic 1 2 and 3 are by far the best in the series!	1
This was the very 2nd one I played,part 3 as the 1st. Its nice seeing the younger versions of the characters and the events leading up to Tekken 7. Yes,SEVEN IS YET TO ARRIVE as of this review!!! Anyway....Easy mode is still hard by the time you reach the 7th fighter. The music is awesome especially King's. You can set the music to Arranged or Arcade. A great set of moves to learn so hop to it and buy it.	1
ok	1
great	1
what is there to say. this game has everything you want in a fighting game! plenty of characters to choose from and the gameplay is top notch for a ps1 game. definitely one of my favorites!	1
I remember Tekken 2 being one of my first fighting games I have ever played, and one that I kept coming back to. It wasn't just the nostalgia that kept me coming back, but the overall gameplay as well. Almost everything about this game was done right, and there is very little to complain about.  Tekken 2 takes place 2 years after the events of the first Tekken. The plot isn't very well developed and isn't really involving, but everything else more than makes up for it. The graphics (for the time) were amazing and the animations were also nicely done. The roster includes 24 characters who are all unique and feel very well balanced. The game is very accessible and almost anyone can pick up this game and get a pretty decent grasp on it. The controls are simple and intuitive, and I always believed that this control scheme (each button controls a limb-ex. left punch, right punch) is one of the best for fighting games.  For modes, you have your basic arcade mode which you complete to unlock new characters. You also have a vs. mode, a team battle mode (which is very enjoyable), a survival mode, a time attack mode, and a practice mode. All of these modes offer allot of replayability as it is easy to dump countless hours into any of these modes.  The combat system is still excellent to this day. The amount of combos that each character can do is pretty substantial and you will discover new moves without being too overwhelmed. There also aren't really any cheap tactics unlike some of the more recent iterations of tekken (such as excessive juggling).  Overall, this game is one of the best fighting games that I have ever played. With plenty of characters to learn, plenty of modes to choose from, amazing looking backgrounds, and a terriffic combat system, there is no reason to skip this game. If you still have a ps1/ps2, BUY THIS GAME. I recommend this game wholeheartedly, and you won't regret it at all.	1
Thank you.........Wonderful....and Trusting product and seller. Recommend. Word Word word word word word so many words required almost done.......and done	1
Though this review may be 14 years 2 late,n my opinion TK2 is the best of the PS1 Tekken games. From the cool fmv intro 2 the ending credits TK2 is by far the best looking/sounding 3D fighting game on the ps1 console. TK3 backgrounds,music,fmv cinemas,light source shading,animations/combos just doesn't measure 2 the standards set by this 1996 classic and it was release 2 years later,go figure!	1
The sequel to the very popular Tekken, Tekken 2 takes everything that the original had and expands upon it. More characters, more levels, more moves, Tekken 2 is a classic and should be in the library of any fighting game lover.  The combat in Tekken is one of best ever. There are so many possible combinations, it's almost impossible to remember them all. Each Tekken gets better and better. Another thing I love about this game is the music. It suits the stages, and characters, well.	1
Ever since I was young, I have been in love with the Tekken series. Brings back a lot of good memories. I bought this game to bring back the memories and the fun. Though the graphics aren't as top notch at games these days are, but it's still an entertaining game to play. If you collect either Tekken stuff or video games, this is a must own. This sequal is too good to miss out on. Buy it before it's gone for good.	1
Same goes for Tekken 2: played but never owned. Now that I'm officially the best Tekken player period, the urge to own all of them, even the first 2, just consumed me....	1
the cd worked for about 4 days and then...BAM!! it was skipping like crazy, it froze wen i picked Jack-2 or Kunimitsu,and now it won't come on at all. IT WAS A PRETTY CRAPPY COPY	1
Well, I just recently bought this game again, after finding it broken from unkown causes quite a few years ago. People keep on saying, "Tekken 2 has HORRIBLE graphics and the gameplay is horrible!", To those people, did you ever think that this game came out during the 90's and was probably awesome graphics back then? If you're a fan of good fighting games, I reccomend this. It has lots of characters, fair graphics, and is a good collectible for your Tekken collection.	1
THIS GAME WAS A VERY GOOD GAME. BUT THIS AIN'T AS GOOD AS TEKKEN 1. LIKE ITS PREDECESSOR, HAS GREAT GRAPHICS, GREAT LOOKING MOVES, AND GREAT BOSSES TO UNLOCK, WHICH GIVES YOU A REASON TO WANNA WIN THE GAME WITH EVERY CHARACTER. THE MUSIC IS GREAT HERE TOO. THIS IS A DEFINITE GEM. GET THIS AND ITS PREDECESSOR FOR THE ULTIMATE GAMING EXPERIENCE!!	1
From the cool first cutcene to the classic music that plays while picking a character, you know this is special. Don't just button mash, learn the combos because this is the only game(out of 100)that has made me curs at the TV. If you're a beginner, start of with someone with fast kicks like marchial Law and not Jack 2. BUY THIS because it's an ABSOLUTE CLASSIC.	1
all i can say is that this game is a classic, possibly the best game ever made for the playstation 1.	1
i love ryu i love wolverine, ryu invented the fire ball not goku, goku who? you could suuuuper juuump and throoow fire balls fire balls bring out your second character fire power	1
I personally like many types of fighting games and FUN is the thing that keeps me coming back for more.  A game can have pretty graphics sound great, and have all the bells and whistles in the world and still play like [...].  This game might not be as pretty as the Saturn version, but who wants a Saturn? One of the biggest flops since the future flop of Sony's [...]PS3.  A few frames missing and slowdown which I have not experienced personally are by no means reasons to dismiss a game that combines X-men with Streetfighter very well.  One more thing to mention about the price.  Not to insult anyones intelligence but simply supply and demand. It is discontinued, there are fewer and fewer copies available thus causing those on the open market to raise in value.	1
To say that the PS1 version of Capcom's X-Men VS Street Fighter is butchered is saying it lightly.  What made the game so great in arcades was the tag-team feature in which you picked two fighters and could switch at any time during the fight.  This feature made for great fighting fun, but because of the PS1's RAM inabilities, that feature had to be omitted.  It's obvious Capcom released this game to make a quick buck on the X-Men and Street Fighter licenses, and while on it's own it can be a solid fighter without the tag-team feature, the graphics are painfully watered down, the game is loaded with sloppy frame rates, and there is loads of slowdown.  If you can get past all that, this may be worth checking out if your a Street Fighter fan, but the Marvel VS Capcom games that would be released later on next-gen systems are more worth your time.	-1
I actually played the Saturn version with the 4MB RAM cart, and I have to say that the PS1 version SUCKS! Why? Because tag-team was taken out because the PS1 could not handle it. It did not have enough RAM (Random Access Memory) to switch fighters since it takes about at least 40 MB of RAM, and the PS1 only has 32 MB.  If Capcom did put in tag-team, then it would take forever to load up a character once you tag-team with it, you can tag-team with the same character, but it does not feel the same.  I suggest get a Saturn, (it is only $10 bucks or less) get a 4MB RAM cart which you can find at EB.com, or any Video game store, and get the Import version of X-men vs. Street Fighter, trust me you won't be disappointed.	-1
When a system is incapable of doing justice to a game, one would think a company would be smart enough to not release the game on that system. But for reasons that are probably based entirely around making money, Capcom has released a completely butchered version of its arcade fighter, X-Men vs. Street Fighter, on the PlayStation. The only thing added to the game is super cancels, which allow you to string multiple super combos together. Super cancels were lifted out of Street Fighter EX without much forethought, so some characters' cancels work better than others. In fact, the entire game seems to have been designed without much forethought. Even if this were a perfect translation of the arcade game, the simple fact remains that X-Men vs. Street Fighter is a terrible, unbalanced, pound-on-buttons-at-random-and-win-anyway fighting game. One of the few things the arcade version (and the Saturn version, which was an arcade-perfect translation) had going for it was the graphics. They weren't spectacular, but the characters were large, colorful, and used a lot of frames of animation. The PlayStation, a fairly weak machine when it comes to 2D, simply can't handle that much data. So Capcom chopped out tons of frames (Juggernaut does a whole lot of standing still, and his attacks are about two frames). The graphics look very washed out, and there is a completely unacceptable amount of slowdown. Ken's Shinryuken super combo had most of the frames chopped out, and it still slows the game down to a crawl. The slowdown and missing frames are so bad and so noticeable that they have a detrimental effect on the already bad gameplay. The arcade version's big selling point was that you picked two characters and could tag-team between the two at any time during the fight. Your teammate would also come out and help in a two-level team attack, as well as in Alpha counter-style attacks. Since duplicating this on the PlayStation would require keeping four entire sets of animations in memory, the tag feature has been completely removed. You still pick a second character (cruelly taunting players expecting the full functionality of the arcade version), but he only makes his presence felt during the team attacks and counters. To make up for the shortened play time, the one-round battles of the arcade have been extended to the standard two-out-of-three format. Characters also slowly regain life, much like your backup character would in the arcade. This game just shouldn't exist. At some point in the development cycle, someone should have stepped in, seen that the PlayStation simply couldn't do justice to the original game, and pulled the plug. It took an additional 4MB of RAM to get the Saturn, which already has more RAM than the PlayStation, to run a perfect version of the game. I like the Street Fighter series as much as the next guy, but this is taking it way too far.	-1
I wasent as inpressed with this game as I thought I would be.  First of all, the load times are forever.  Second,  this game has cartoon graphics.  Theird,  I hate the street fighters in this game. Forth, I love the x-men (they are absolutly fabulus).	1
Well here I am. Making a review of a game made in the mid 90s in this year, 2011. What can i say? This bring backs amazing memories.  I could remember the time i went to the arcade with a friend, I found this game and i just HAD to play it. The graphics were weak in the arcade, but then they had it on ps1, which the graphics are much better.  I won't say this is the best game i ever played, but hey, it's not fair comparing a 90s game to a current. SO let's just put it this way because I'm bored.  Graphics: 4.5 Sounds: 4.8 Controlls: 5.0 Replay Value: 4.8 length: 3.5 Overall: 4.5  I'll recommend this to anyone who's enjoying classic games or is a street fighter fan,,, or to anyone who likes fighting games.  - A noob	1
From all the fighting video games around Street Fighter has always been the mother of all. From it's beginning it has been a game who deserves admiration and if it did good as a 2D game it did way better as 3D.This game gives us the opportunity to enjoy SF even more with a lot new things such as great graphic,combos that will blow your mind,lots of new options and lots of characters to chose from. It brings us a whole new SF with the same stuffs we like. Old characters in their 3D version which is just perfect and a whole new cast all with their uniques techniques. This game has new options never seen before in any other SF game. The arcade,versus,Team,ect,modes are all new and better. This game offers you a great deal of exitement as you spend more time playing it. By far,one of the most revolutionary and why not controversial among fans from all the SF games. Buy it,play it for 2 or 4 hours and I guarantee you this game got nothing to envy other SF games.	1
I'm going to fly in the face of convention wisdom and assert that Tomb Raider is not a good game. I like the concept, the puzzle solving and exploration. I like that it's a great diversion from the standard shoot-em up. The problem is with the tedious game play. The game is tough, just from the mental standpoint and it takes some effort to figure out what you're supposed to be doing in each level. But that's part of the fun, figuring things out. Unfortunately, it's moving through the levels and getting from point A to point B that is problematic. There are way too many places where you have to make a pinpoint precision jump or other move with absolutely NO margin for error. In some cases this means you fall somewhere and have to climb back to your starting point, or in some cases you die, meaning you have to start the whole level over again. And after trying one of these jumps over and over and over, you finally get frustrated and give up. There were instances where I tried a jump over and over, and then suddenly made the jump and had no idea what I had done differently from the previous numerous attempts. For any game to be that touchy is just a disgrace. It's too bad, I think I could have liked this game but the tedious pinpoint controller movements ulitmately ruined the game for me. I know it's one of PSX "greatest hits" and very popular, but if don't like tedious games, you'll want to avoid this one.	-1
Ive had Tomb raider since July and this game is off the meters!! When I first played it, I was frustrated with the controls, but once u learn them, this game is the best!!! The worlds are long and puzzling, but its never too hard to finish. The action and suspense make u feel like its a movie. I reccomend this to anybody who likes action or 007 fans like me. You WILL love it, trust me.	1
This is the best game I have yet to play.  It took me six months to finally defeat,figure out and fight my way to the end of this game.  This game was like a very suspenseful movie that I was controlling. Many times in the game I was actually sweating from fear. You don,t know what,s waiting for you around each corner, waiting to jump out at you and scare the crap out of you. Even my family and onlookers were startled or to afraid to play this game because of the  realism captured in enormous worlds and creepy CD sounds.	1
This game realeased in 1997 (I think), was the first in the Klonoa series (which includles a few more games in Japan), and was defenently a "sleeper-masterpeice" for PSone. This game however feels a little bit different than the other games in this series, though I'm not excatly sure why. I think the main reasons it feels so different are: the graphics, the story line, the music, and the character differnces. Graphicaly wise, you can tell it's older, but the graphics have a certain charm to them. The few out-of-engine motion scenes though, are magnificent! However, the graphic style is drasticaly different from it's sequels. The plot is overall, a little more "classic fantasyish" and feels kinda like something you might read in a book (which is probably what they were aiming at since it has a "book theme"). It has a bit of a melancholy feel to it; which makes it feel slightly more intense than it's sequals. Actually, I think it's the best story of any of the Klonoa games. As for the ending, I loved it! Sad and moving without being overly sad. I think it's my favorite vidoe game ending! The BGM is a different style than Lunatea's Veil also, (It's PS2 sequal) less solemn and RPG like, and a little more lively, or something, not really sure what the word is, it fits the game well. What I mean by character differneces is that it has no familiar characters other than Klonoa and Huepow. Klonoa, however, is quite different than in his sequels. Dispite these differences, the gameplay is practicaly clone-copy of the others in the series, esspecial Lunatea's Veil. From what I have heard, many people that played this were dissapointed with the sequel. I think that it was probably because they were used to this style and didn't give it much of a chance (personaly, I was dissapointed with THIS game at first, then started to really like it after I got used to it). Anyway, bottom line is, that if you've played all the other Klonoa games, expect this one to be a little different, but defenently get it, if you enjoyed the others, you'll enjoy this! If you haven't played any of the other games in this great series, it's based on engaging gameplay with simplistic controls. This game is one of the few "2.5D" games in existance. It plays parellel to a 2D game (people still hanging onto their old copies of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 or Mario Bros. should try this). In this game, however, you are in a 3D environment (don't worry, the paths are clearly defined, you won't have any trouble figuring out where you can and can't go). You can interact with the background by throwing things into it, this is esspecially key in some bosses, This is the 2.5D part. There are 12 levels (not counting the final boss)in this game, plus an unlockable time attack level. This game is pretty easy, and if your looking for an extreamly hard, nail biting, challenge, this probably isn't for you. This is more of a fun, relaxing game. However, I love this game, and recommend it to all who own a Playstation!	1
Went back and played this again. Good but it has aged badly.	1
This is the best Tomb Raider along with the 2nd one. Graphics are actually still all right now 20 years later. Buy this on here or on psn, its a wonderful game from a simpler time. Reminds me of my youth when we didn't have video walkthroughs.	1
Thanks	1

This is an amazing oringal game that I purely enjoyed playing. The storyline is so original for its time and its graphics are amazing on wide screen tv's. In the game, you are Lara Croft, a tomb raider and have been given another opportunity to explore more for artifacts in Peru by Jacalene Natla, a millionaire investor who holds a dark secret. You soon realize she is not what she claims and you do undercover research and she betrays you. You travel thru the dark cold and abandoned caves of peru, ancient underground Greece, the catacombs of Egypt & Atlantis all to find 3 pieces of the scion for which Natla asked her to get, all while blasting out animals and creatures you wouldn't expect and collect secrets along the way. This is a great game that had a greater sequal. But this is my favorite out of the series. Original playstion graphics, great music and sound affects and great storyline!	1
it was just as described	1
Thanks a lot, It's a great product & service	1
LOVE IT	1
IT'S TOMB RAIDER, WHAT ELSE DO YOU NEED TO KNOW???	1
a legendary ps1 game	1
Excellent item!	1
Despite awkward controls that seem to be designed more for a computer than a Game System (and get used to it, because that lasts until the PS2 era-- aka, the sixth game in the series) this has to be one of the funnest games of all time. It gives a challenge on multiple levels & inspires you to keep playing to find out what happens next as things get progressively more dangerous and more bizarre. Was re-made as Tomb Raider: Anniversary, but I'd prefer the original any day.	1
Brought this game for myself, it brought back memories when I was 6 playing this all summer long. Game came as described and fast also.	1
The original Tomb Raider was a landmark game for the Playstation and the start of a very long running series. It holds up well, but is a definite acquired taste.  Tomb Raider begins with adventurer and treasure huntress Lara Croft being hired by business woman Jacqueline Natla to search an ancient cavern in Peru for a piece of the Scion, an ancient talisman of great power. However, after finding the piece, Lara is betrayed by Jacqueline's men. Now it's a race across the world to find the remaining pieces of the Scion before Jacqueline attains its mythical power. Tomb Raider is an early Playstation game, and unfortunately the graphics haven't aged very well. Although many set pieces in the game are very impressive all the levels tend to feel very samey. Despite this the game's length is impressive. There are over fifteen massive levels with hidden caches of ammo and first aid packs, giving you a great sense of exploration throughout the game. Lara moves in a very stiff fashion. Her controls are tank-like and You have to hold down a button for her to walk. She takes very long jumps, but running jumps have a delay that requires you to plan your jumps ahead of time in most cases. Fortunately there is a training mission where Lara instructs you on how to play in her home. The game is primarily a puzzle platformer. Each level contains a series of puzzles that will test your problem solving skills.  Scattered throughout the many ruins and caves are vicious animals and hired goons all chomping at the bit to impede your progress. This is where combat comes into play. Lara starts off the game with twin pistols that have unlimited ammo. Through out the game you will find a variety of firearms, however these weapons do have limited ammo, but the pistols ensure you will always have a fighting chance in battle. The last gameplay feature to talk about is the process of saving your game. The PC version of the game allowed the player to quicksave wherever they wanted. The console versions of the game on Playstation and Sega Saturn do not have this luxury. You can only save with the use of crystals that are placed along the path you are intended to follow. Unfortunately, once a crystal is used it is gone. This makes it really difficult when you've got a very long stretch ahead of you and not much health. Some areas have multiple crystals forcing you to carefully plan how often you save.  This game has many flaws, but it is a very rewarding experience. I would recommend the game for those expecting a challenge. The later games in the Tomb Raider series ironed out many of the issues experienced here. If you're curious about the beginning of the franchise you won't be disappointed, but maybe a little stressed.  For classic PC gamers I'd recommend Tomb Raider: Unfinished Business. This is the original game plus two bonus missions with two new levels a piece.	1
Tomb Raider was one of the first games I completed and it was tough. Really challenging throughout and educational, one of the most intriguing and fun games to pass while shooting at random things and at Dinosaurs and Bears and other animals, really great!	1
If you are a fan of TR you're gonna love to have this one in your collection!! The graphics are better though on the pc version...	1
Hated it  constantly fighting the controls and it wass just terrible all in all, will never buy an old tomb raider again!!	-1
This game is a winner, and a true classic.  This game redefined the role playing wheel, when it was released on PS1. It was a smash hit, and has since spawned many sequels to the original game.  The graphics are a nice step  forward from earlier RPG platforms including: NES, SNES, Sega, etc.  The controls are challenging, and to someone who doesn't want to take the time getting used to it impossible. However, when you buy an RPG you want a challenge, and Tomb Raider delivers that on all levels. As far as game control goes, it will definitely take some patience to learn the many skills Lara can do. She can do a variety of things like different jumps, flips, crawling, fighting moves, etc. If you have no patience, this game will drive you crazy. It really is a shame that some people tear down this game, when they have no idea what they are talking about. Who wants to play an RPG with no challenge, not me. This game takes time to learn how to master the acrobatic moves, fighting moves, jumps, etc. I like that, and if challenge is what you want, this delivers. Once you learn how the controls operate, you realize it is quite easy to use.  The graphics are really well done, and definitely an improvement over older platforms, too. The characters, and scenery are much sharper, in higher definition for then previous platforms, and more with more colors. One of my favorite characters is the huge T-Rex you must fight. It looks like a T-Rex, too. The graphics are just awesome. I love how the blood flies, when you kill an animal. Previous platforms didn't really do that, and  in such detail.  Another thing that made it better over older platforms is the continued ability to move freely about the landscape unrestricted, but with even more vantage points. You can view yourself from pretty much any angle. Top, bottom, sides, any angle, at any given moment. You can watch yourself from the side, then go to top view, bottom view, etc, etc. It's just awesome the advances over previous RPG platforms.  The music in this game is very well done, and of CD sound quality. The music is crystal clear, and fits the game perfectly. The background music is often very hauntingly eerie. Also, the sound effects are of nice CD sound quality, too.  This game has many, many hours of game play that will keep you busy for awhile. Lots of different scenery in different places of the world. You find yourself in a variety of places, and not just dungeons, and caves, but there is plenty of that, as well.  If getting through the many challenging levels, and trying to stay alive isn't enough for you, there are many, many hidden secrets for you too find, also. Some are easy to find, some are pretty challenging to find.  If you love exploring caves, catacombs, dungeons, and having to constantly fight, then you will love this game. Lots of challenges, puzzles, and lots of ways to die, too. The game requires patience, and if you are a true RPG fan this game is a must have.  Highly recommend, 5 stars.	1
I absolutely love Tomb Raider. It is definitely my favorite game of all time. It has everything you need to make a wonderfully fun game. There is action and adventure, thriller, problem solving, and an entertaining story line. I love the challenge of the problem solving. It isn't a game you can finish in a couple hours, but take a long time to get through all of the different puzzles. You definitely get your moneys worth with play time on this game. It will always keep you thinking. I couldn't ask for a better game.	1
This takes back memories when I first played Tomb Raider.  It's both chalenging and fun.  Its remake is just added stuff and newly improved stages.	1
I had to go back and play this game after playing (and loving) Tomb Raider Anniversary. Playing Anniversary and then going back to the original really makes you appreciate just how awesome this game was. The level design was just amazing with all the different areas you get to explore. I haven't played the original since it first came out so I didn't realize just how much Crystal Dynamics took from this game. They took a lot. Some of the level designs are almost identical. The biggest difference between the old and the new is the difficulty. Anniversary is way easier. But not because the puzzles or enemies are easier. It's because of the controls. Back in Tomb Raider 1, the controls were pretty terrible. But what do you expect from a game breaking new ground in the world of 3D? So I'll over look it and give it a 5 out of 5.	1
OH YES....this game is what it's all about.  Sure, it looks totally archaic now with its primitive low-polygon 3D (cf. Lara's Madonna-style pyramid breasts) and jerky low frame rate - BUT WHO CARES.  "Tomb Raider" was one of the first fully-realized 3D games, with huge environments and a camera that lets you explore them fully - something next-gen developers still seem to have a problem with sometimes - and, of course, best of all, an action hero that players across the board could instantly connect with.  Yes, Lara Croft - men want her, women want to be her...lol.  Forget about her later misadventures on celluloid and (worst of all) the PS2 platform.  Even on the PS1, all the new innovations in graphics and AI that cropped up in subsequent TR installments couldn't improve upon the originality of gameplay you have here in the debut.  The puzzles, the secrets, the at-times relentless action, this game has it all.  Much like Indiana Jones, we first encounter Lara as she explores some ruins in South America - allegedly the village of Vilcabamba, an actual archeological site in Ecuador, although as it appears in the game it's more of a generic hotch-pot of pre-Columbian art and architecture.  Of course you have the rolling ball traps everywhere, and of course she eventually finds a golden idol - more nods to Indy.  Later she explores Las Vegas versions of Rome and Egypt, slaughtering more endangered species in the process than are even left on the planet (PETA just loved this game) before proceeding to - where else? - Atlantis, which is naturally swarming with freakish and bloodthirsty mutants.  All this because she's in search of an artifact whose magical powers, if in the wrong hands, could destroy the world, or something.  It's easy to punch holes in the ridiculous plot, but that doesn't affect the entertainment value - again just like with Indy, you know it's stupid, but you're more than willing to suspend disbelief just to go along with the wild ride.  Getting through the levels is not always easy; you'll need to sharpen both your combat and puzzle-solving skills.  There's also a lot of replay value owing to the oftentimes diabolically-hidden "secrets," which usually contain caches of weapons and the infamous "medi-paks."  Play this game - it's almost like a cool retro thing to do now - and forget about everything that came after.  They have a new TR in the works now but it's got a lot of bad karma to overcome...so far nothing has matched this original masterpiece.	1
Ok, sounds perveted. It may be weird to have a crush on the sexy, adventurous, and alluring Lara Croft, but many other people do too. Anyway, this is it. The first "Tomb Raider" game. It has classic written all over it. Despite being dated, and encountering countless predecessors, sequels and dissapointing movies the game manages to have to a strong following and is considered to best game of them all. It was orginal back then, where archaeologist Lara Croft, a female Indiana Jones, is called upon to use her intelligence, amazing physical skills, and her big guns to solve complexed and ancient puzzles, battle hard enemies and travel the whole world in style. I forget the storyline, since I haven't played this game in ages, but it's good. You should ask my mom, who played and beat every "Tomb Raider" game(Sorry mom). I'm not kidding! She did! The graphics are surprisingly good to look at, as well as the hard puzzles to solve(which made it famous to play) and the fun movie scenes. Check out the dinosaur too in this game. it's a blast! Anyway, a highly reccomended game. But I liked "Tomb Raider 2" way better then this one.	1
If I could have give 6 stars for this game, I would have.  I played this originally when it first came out in 1996.  Back then, games such as Resident Evil and Tomb Raider were ground-breaking milestones in entertainment known as video games.  I won't talk about Resident Evil here because everyone knows about that. Tomb Raider was the first game to give players control of a character in a true 3D environment.  Sure, you had games like Doom and Wolfenstien, but they played only on a single plane with your character spinning on an axis.  Tomb Raider allowed you to control Lara, the feminine version of Indiana Jones, an use the environments such as cliffs, roofs, etc. to progress through the levels.  Level design in Tomb Raider is really what the game is centered around.  Beautiful, stunning, breath-taking, eerie, surreal, all describe the level design here.  Nothing short of ingenious. The game mechanics and control of Lara were never the best, but they were also adequate to get the job done.  Lara spins on a fixed axis when the player turns left and right, and forward makes her run in the direction she is facing.  Turning can sometimes be a chore, especially when the action is turned up a notch.  Luckily, the circle button makes Lara do a somersault tumble, for a quick "about-face".  The shimmying and climbing from ledge to ledge and jumping has always been amazing.  Combine that with sliding down angular rock formations and time jumps and grabs to ledges, and you are bound to fall in love with the action that Eidos developed (NOTE: This kind of mechanics shined most for me in this game as opposed to all the predecessors, including Angel of Darkness for PS2.  This kind of action became less and less as the series went on, save for Last Revelation, maybe).  The swimming sequences and puzzles are also a really wonderful treat as well. There are plenty of surprises in this game that I don't want to give away, however, I will tell you that some of the levels in the game will stick in your memory for a long, long time after.  For example, "The God Room" of St. Francis' Folly has got to be one of the best and most memorable and beautiful levels of any game that I've played. So why am I writing this review now, 7 years after the release date?  For a few reasons.  First, being that I can't get the game out of my head for more than a few months.  Every six months I go back to it.  The second reason, is that when I bought a PS2, I knew I would be playing the original Tomb Raider again and wanted that backward capability.  And THIRD and quite possibly the most important (and the reason I titled this review "Dear Eidos") is that Angel of Darkness was the single reason that I sold my PS2 for an X-Box.  At first I enjoyed AOD, but the game has rampant problems.  I've always welcomed a new Tomb Raider game in my life and gave AOD more than one chance.  I loved all the other PS1 Tomb Raider games, including III, which got a lot of harsh and unwarranted criticisms in my mind, but whatever.  I hated AOD and want Eidos to know that.  And FOURTH reason is that I repurchased the new and compact PSOne last week.  I still own my Tomb Raider from back in the day.  Last night I played it and the magic was back like from the first time I played it.  Sure the graphics feel older, but they are by no means bad at all considering that I play games like Halo, Crimson Skies, Prince of Persia, and Rainbow Six 3 on the X-Box.  There will always be a large place in my geeky video-gaming heart for this true classic. EIDOS: TAKE THE POWER BACK!	1
So, this is where it all began - the original Tomb Raider. In November 1996, Britain was changing. With the phenomenal success of the Spice Girls and the phrase "girl power", there wasn't a better time to bring out an all-female computer game heroine who kicked [rear]! Enter Lara Croft. The game went straight to No. 1 all over the world and shifted more than 10 million copies to become THE biggest selling PlayStation game of all time. Lara soon became a cultural icon, gracing hundreds of magazine covers the world over - and not just computer magazines, mainstream magazines such as Rolling Stone and Time; undoubtedly the biggest magazine names in the world. Four sequels followed in the form of Tomb Raider II, Tomb Raider III, Tomb Raider IV: The Last Revelation and Tomb Raider IV: Chronicles. The five games have sold a combined total of 40 million worldwide and secured Eidos Interactive and more importantly, Lara Croft and Tomb Raider, a place in video gaming history as undoubtedly the greatest, most popular and enjoyable computer games of all time. The story of Tomb Raider is simple really. Lara Croft is a semi-famous archeologist adventurer and has been hired by a mysterious woman, Natla (last name unknown) to search the globe for an ancient artifact, known as the Scion, that is beleived to have come from the lost city of Atlantis. Lara sets off on her travels to find this artifact but before she can find it, she must search other areas of the world to find clues and hints that will open the way forward to her ultimate prize. Around halfway through the game, while uncovering clues about the artifact in question, Lara also unveils the truth about Natla; a story told through amazing cut-scenes. The storyline is intriguing to say the least and keeps you on the very edge of your seat as you beg to know more, yet never for the game to end. The game begins with simple, pedestrian levels for newcomers to get to grips with the controls. The enemies are only small in the first few levels; bats, dogs etc. that can be eliminated with a single shot of Lara's Pistols - a weapon that she has with her always that features an unlimited amount of ammo. The game has a massive 16 levels that will keep you playing for months - it took me 10 months to complete. In fact, I finished the week Tomb Raider II came out so once I'd finished with the first, I spent the next 10 months playing the second one! This has been a regular oocurance and has resulted in me playing all five Tomb Raider games for around 6 years without a break! I remember the days when I bought this game...I was only 10 and it scared me to death! The enemies may not look very real, but remember that controlling Lara is! You control her every move so her life is in your hands! At the time the game was released, the graphics were unbelievable and the scenery breathtaking. The former is not so much now, but the latter still stands. Graphics in computer games have come a very long way since 1996, but half an hours' play on Tomb Raider with Ms Croft, and its superior excellence shines through. The final levels are set in and around Atlantis, and are classic moments in video gaming history. From the rocky cliffs of Asia, to the hot muggy forests of South America and the haunting and eerie lost island of Atlantis, there's something here for everyone. Buy it now! OVERALL GRADE: 10/10 All in all, Tomb Raider is the ultimate PlayStation game. Everything about this game is so enchanting and memorable. The atmosphere, the sounds the animals make, the noises Lara makes when falling off a rock, the music that cues to tell you something exciting is about to happen - everything! This is a true classic in video gaming history that deserves all the critical praise it recieved 6 years ago. If you haven't got Tomb Raider in your PlayStation games collection, it is not complete. Only when you purchase all 5 Tomb Raider games will your collection be complete. With the soon-to-be released Lara Croft Timb Raider VI: The Angel Of Darkness, all six Tomb Raider will keep me playing for decades, literally. I will still be playing Tomb Raider when I'm 60 years old, and I'm sure I'll not be the only one...	1
It's great to play if you have nothing to do well anyaway. The level's are so cool it's get's better each time you go to a new level. Each level have something you must do before you go on. There are alot of little places that you can fine little small heath pack's get those you will need it because there is always someone trying to stop you and kill you O, if you fine anything useful get that too. Sometimes the informate is right there in your face you just got to look that's all. This was my only game that I own for my playstation. That the time I did't know if I sould play it or leave it alone will I play it and you know what, I like it for once a woman is doing the thing and I said it's about time, do you know what I mean?? Well go have fun I did. Take your time and do it right I did and I got good at.	1
From the ruins of Rome to the futuristic setting of Atlantis, Tomb Raider takes the gamer through a variety of wonderful worlds.  Unlike its sequels, it stays in the tombs and out of other settings.  I believe that it is one of the best games ever made, and it certainly is a classic.  However, I believe that its sequels in many aspects overshadow it. The scenery in Tomb Raider is better than most games, although it is mostly cubed and flat.  The game play and plot are wonderful, and the graphics and sounds are acceptable.  However, the artificial intelligence enemies are less than intelligent, and the gamer is often left feeling underestimated with the ease of some of the puzzles.  Laura's moves are limited, and the weapons supply is less than perfect. I would recommend this game to any fan of the Tomb Raider series and to the average gamer.  However, I do feel that other versions have better qualities.  Tomb Raider II offers wonderful AI and is perhaps the best for a gamer seeking combat. Tomb Raider III combines the better aspects of the previous two, and Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation offers the best plot and character mobility.  If you are looking to stay in the tombs, or if you are not into puzzles, stick with this game.  However, don't miss out on the other great qualities the Tomb Raider series offers.	1
Like I've said before, Tomb Raider will always stand as one of the most influential games of all time. Back in 1996, the only competition in this genre was Mario 64. Nowadays, every other game is a 3d adventure "in the vain of Tomb Raider". The game is very solid. Well placed and thought provoking puzzles. Some nice action, great graphics which still hold up today, and lots of fun. The only complaint is the lack of a decent ending, and that I have to shoot a fellow human at least 60 times in order to kill him. How untrealistic is that? While TR 2 is the best in the series, this one will be the most remembered. Story: 6/10 Graphics: 8/10 Sound: 7/10 Fun: 8/10	1
Old school fun	1
Fun, classic PS1. I like to collect old games so it was a nice surprise to me that it was a collectors edition. It has some playable demos and some watchable demos at the beginning.	1
great condition wasn't for me though was a gift for my friends b-day	1
Got the game. After I came home from work, it was on the kitchen table. My brother probably got to the mailbox first. I hope it is good. My little nephew wanted to play it with me.	1
Fighting Force was the wanna-be "Streets Of Rage" for PlayStation. If you grew up in the 90's and owned a Sega you'll know what I'm talking about. The game had tons of flaws such as the lo-fidelity sound effects (sssshhhhheeeewwwmmm) and the blocky PC-like design of the characters. Heck, it looked like a Windows 95 platform game.  There are four characters to choose from : two chicks, a big giant and the handsome one. They each have their own moves but have serious shortcomings. Smasher can take a lot of damage and deal it too; but he's slow as a mule. Hawk is a decent fighter but is open to a lot of hits. Alana and Mace are both quick (alana moreso) but are weak and fragile.  The game was unduly hard due to the overhaul of the game's engine. Back then, games overloaded easily especially if they were not rendered correctly. The load times on this game tell you there's a lot of extra space here. An obvious pitfall is when there are many enemies/items on the screen it evokes slow command response but ONLY from players' controllers (remember trying to grab a guy and your player executes an 'air grab' 1 second after you press the button?). This resulted in getting beat up from 5 or more directions and having a briefcase hurled at your head. Not fun. Items were also a bother as you found that punching a guy mysteriously involved you picking up a crate first. Then you got kicked in the shin and you dropped the crate as two more guys fired shots at you and you're spinning through the air. Fun! Yet when you want to pull a pole off the wall you instead invoke a reverse backhand that misses and makes you look like an idiot. And for that ugly move sir you get a pipe to the face.  You eventually either get frustrated with the game or you learn to live with it. The game experience for me is always bitter sweet because even though I've learned to live with the quirks they still get in my way. The game gets progressively harder as you advance through the levels and sometimes you white knuckle your controller to keep from using a continue (which, by the way starts you over on the level...totally bogus!). When you finally DO finish the game it seems underwhelming. You'll see what I mean when you finish it.  All in all, despite its obvious and frustrating flaws, the game is still a classic. If you don't own it you owe it to yourself to take a trip back in time. Re-live the polygonal loading-screen glory!!	1
I played this game when i was a kid and forgot all about it. Then remembered it, ordered it, and have been having fun playing it.	1
i would recommend getting this game for many reasons you have 4 characters to choose from you can pick the route you want the levels are well designed along with the chaacters , the fighting style are also great you get to pick up weapons & use tit against them the playstation version is the best one to buy	1
You know you're in trouble when other terrible video games are compared to you. Though only a little worse than Charlie's Angels (GameCube) and not as bad as Hidden Invasion (PlayStation2), Fighting Force is the difinitive bad adventure-fighting game that fits on the same crap list as Burning Fight. Even Brawl Bros and Peace Keepers are better than this, and that's saying a lot. You get your pick from four forgettable crime fighters: pixie-pig-tailed Alana, gruff Hawk, leather-pants-wearing "Look at me, I'm Nabiki Tendo" Mace, and prison inmate Smasher. They're out to get a psychopath who believes the world should have ended at the beginning of 2000 A.D. and is now determined to make that happen. Maybe he should have waited through the other 23 times it turned New Years day across the world. Many Sega Saturn owners didn't realize then how lucky they were that this game was cancelled on their system. Nintendo 64 owners were not so lucky, and I wasn't so lucky after getting the PlayStation version. The controls are sloppy, the hit detection is horrible, especially the dash attacks, and the character animation is almost jerky enough to look like an old claymation cartoon. If there is one redeeming factor, it is the music. Though not great, the musical scores in this game are a nice touch. The only reason you should buy this disc is to pop it into a CD-playing radio or computer and skip track one since that's just a data track ... meaning all you will hear, if anything, is an annoying buzz. Start on Track 2, sit back, and enjoy the only good thing about this game.	-1
Alrighty, let me just start off by saying don't let people who play "Final Fantsay 7" sway your judgement about this.  While "Final Fantsay 7" is an amazing game, it varies VERY HEAVILY from "Fighting Force", so what some people like (fun fighting games)and others love (RPG gamers) we are at war with the worlds.  It's better to agree to disagree here.  Okay, let us begin with the review.  I love this game.  From the very beginning where you can choose your favorite character (Mace Daniels is my personal favorite), to the last moment when you deliver a crushing blow to your enemy.  It is ingenius.  I love how you can pick up weapons like guns and bats and that you can deliver really "snazzy" throws/blocks.  Like people have said, it is like a "Streets of Rage" for the now.  Let me break it down overall for you:    Graphics- Compared to now, it is not up to bar.  Compare it to when it frist came out, bar none!  5/5, although the animation can sometime slow down.    Sound- Ain't nothing more prettier than hearing your enemies bone crunch!  5/5    Control- Obviously this is the black-sheep of the family.  The controls are clunky and choppy, and sometimes they interfere with the great gaming experience.  Thank God for infinite health codes!  3/5 (ouch)    Overall- Aside from the controls being what they are, the game is a smooth ride of fun fighting and brainless beat-'em-up.  I feel this game is totally undercredited, and that we need to change that.  ONLY YOU CAN PREVENT FOREST FIRES!	1
This game is very fun. I have only played a demo that my cousin has but I'm dying to pick up a copy. The demo is short and we like to come up with different themes to it like we're going to a party at the building at the end of the demo. This game is kind of funny. Some of the enemies are pure fools. I like to run around the van with them chasing. Then I turn around and and knock the crud out of them. I like the guns and sticks that you can pick up and when you run out of ammo you can throw your gun at the enemies. That's pretty funny too. The characters have awesome moves. I love fighting games and this is one of my favorites. If you like fighting games and games that are just plain fun, buy this game.	1
This is a pretty fun game. if you like hardcore killing games then this is for you. this game rocks	1
If you love castles,goblins,monsters demon vixens and skeletons swinging swords this game is for you. I thought the graphics were excellent and solving the levels wasn,t difficult. Some may fine the dismemberments a little to gross, but my kids enjoyed it.	1
Tomb Raider 2 is by far the best sequel game out right now. Lara kicks way more...in this one then in the first. Some of the reasons why are listed here: Excellent 3D levels such as - 1. The Great Wall 2. Venice 3. Bartolli's Hideout 4. Opera House 5. Offshore Rig 6. Diving Area 7. 40 Fathoms 8. Wreck Of The Mario Doria 9. Living Quarters 10. The Deck 11. Tibetan Foothills 12. Barkhang Monestary 13. Catacombs Of The Talion 14. Ice Palace 15. Temple Of Xian 16. Floating Islands 17. Dragon's Lair Epilouge: Home Sweet Home Kick...weapons like - Pistols Uzis Magnums Shotgun Grenade Launcher M16 Machine Gun Harpoon Gun Awesome new enemy's like - T-Rex's Raptors Guardian Of The Talion and A Dragon Tomb Raider 2 is an awesome game, but, my favorite in the series has to be Tomb Raider 3! Below i have included a list (in order) of my favorite Tomb Raider games: 1. Tomb Raider 3 2. Tomb Raider 4: Last Revelations 3. Tomb Raider 2 4. Tomb Raider 5: Chronicles 5. Tomb Raider...	1
From the Great Wall of China to the canals of Venice, Tomb Raider II is the rare case in which a sequel is better than an original. In fact, I find this game to be my favorite of the series. In it the legendary Lara Croft sets out to find the Dagger of Xion. In her quest she navigates the globe, and even takes a couple of trips to strange and magical new worlds. Tomb Raider II offers significant improvements over the original, and its game play exceeds the other games that follow in the series. The game has drastically overhauled weapons and artificial intelligence. Though the puzzles are not as hard as later versions, they still are quite difficult. Lara has new moves, many new weapons, and more dangerous foes. What more could a Tomb Raider fan - or even the casual gamer - ask for? I highly recommend this game, whether you are an avid Tomb Raider fan or somebody new to the series. I don't believe you will be disappointed - in fact, you will probably find many hours of action filled entertainment. And if you do enjoy it, I strongly recommend other games in this series.	1
Tomb Raider II is the best of the series, followed by the original. After this, the series went downhill. The first level is actually quite challenging! They don't mess around they throw you right into the fire. But it here or on psn, either way get this game	1
a+	1
Thanks a lot, It's a great product & service	1
great game	1
I received tomb raider in excellent shape.	1
I absolutely love this game, this game is really hard, but fun once you get the hang of it, long, I've played more than 20 hours, and I still haven't beat it,	1
Excellent item!	1
An astounding commercial success in 1997 and still holds up well today, Tomb Raider 2 was a step in the right direction.  It had vast improvements over the first.  From using flares to light up rooms, to driving some vehicles it was a lot of fun.  Also Lara's moves are improved.  The back flip and doing a 180 in the air combo was one of the best. The game was a lot more challenging than the original.  The first one you only fought a total of 4 different characters with guns.  In this one you fight multiple enemies with guns.  Also the gauntlet you run on the first stage is probably more challenging than anything in the original.  I played this game so much I can still play it through beginning to end, and get every secret without any hints.  One of my top favorite five video games of all time.  And a true high water mark for Play Station 1 and maybe video games in general.	1
They took what was great about the first and somehow made it twice as good. These games are still great for people looking for a challenge, but I would advise first-time players to play the series in order, as each game builds up from the hardest point of the previous one by making difficult-to-learn skills from the previous one rudimentary things you NEED to know in order to play the next, as well as adding a bunch of new tricks and surprises. But, even though there isn't as much actual "Tomb Raiding" in this one, it is definitely a step up from the previous version. Also includes an awesome bonus level at the end where Lara's house is raided by a Mafia strike team. Although, does not include the other bonus levels from the extended version of the game. (The extended version has two more levels, but it's only for the PC)	1
Theses are real video games, the ones you work on for weeks before you finally reach that last awesome cutscene concluding the game. You'll never feel such joy until you play this. It's definitely different than the first. In the first there were only an handful of human enemies and this one is loaded with them. Making you more carful to conserve ammo and medi packs. The weapons human enemies carry vary from regular old pistols to flame throwers. There are also Doberman's, sharks, eels, tigers, vultures, rats and spiders. Plus some swordsmen in the Floating Islands, you'll see... You earn more weapons as you progress including pistols, harpoon gun, uzis, shotgun and M16. You can drive motorboats, ski mobiles.  there are other things to look out for besides enemies like suspicious pressure pads, doors that you are approaching (which sometimes open and an bat wielding goon comes out) Or simply break away floor boards. If there is one hint I can give you is that *Always* draw your pistols when your going down an new hallway. You'll be glad you did. This game is still full of an lot of things, and quite frankly it still freaks me out to play. It's sheer awesomness and I recommend.	1
This game is amazing!!! The level design and all the awesome puzzles make this game the best TR game I've ever played!! This one is perfect to start if you are too young and never had a chance to play the Tomb Raider classics from PS1. After playing this one, play #5, then #1,  then #4. Tomb raider...THE BEST SERIES EVER!! (ESPECIALLY THE CLASSICS ONES FROM 1996 - 2000)	1
This is one of those classic games that everyone who was a fan of Playstation 1 must own, aside from the 1st Tomb Raider of course. Got it used, but it works great.	1
I recently backtracked and played all of the earlier Tomb Raider games. (avoid Angel of Darkness.  Horrible game)  TR2 is about as fun as they come. Graphics are outdated of course, but there is so much to do and to much fun to be had.  The game is long, keeps your interest, has plenty of cool weapons, and a good story.  I'd love to see this game redone with today's technology.  "10 out of 10".  If you're a TR fan and haven't played this, I'd advise that you do.	1
I recently started re-playing this game to find that it is actually quite fun. I remember first playing this game when i was a little kid at my friends house but never gave it any attention. I just thought of it to be boring and hard. But since i remembered it, i sadly asked him if i could borrow it and he said sure, keep it. So i did. Anyways, when i started it up, i remembered everything about the first mission, very hard especially without anymore ps1 memory cards. When i finally beat the first mission. "The Wall" It sadly took me hours, because after those tumbling rocks after you, you got ran over easy and died. Every time you die you have to restart the whole mission, so this is what took me the most time. Soon i got on to the second mission, i got pretty far but then the disc "old and scratched up" quit on me. It kept freezing. I have had this problem many times before on the first mission, so i had to restart it back up again. After that i pretty much quit. This is why i keep all of my games in their cases. So they will work about 10 years later. Sorry for such a bad review but later i looked up online and watched the whole thing, well the missions in speedy time. And saw how good the game layouts and graphics were. I really enjoyed this game, well the first couple missions of it. So maybe i will buy a ps1 memory card and start to savin' soon.	1
this is a good game here and i recommend it to anyone who likes adventure type games. 10 out of 10	1
this game lacked the ability to live up to name "Tomb Raider" its more of a "City Raider" half the levels deal with city-time scenery. and 80% of the enemies are humans. more like a 007 than a Tomb Raider - but the game play is fun in the cities (Venice) so i cant complain too much - just wasn't feelin the whole China scene. I liked to level skip those. and the twist at the end was a lil boost - so all in all ill give it 5stars - but it lacked challenge for me - i beat it in a week. just run around and jump for the most part.	1
The first Tomb Raider was a classic in terms of its 3D gameplay, sense of exploration through massive levels, and a unique main character.  The 2nd installment in the TR series is not much different.  The levels are still HUGE, and exploration is still the name of the game.  But this time around, the environments and enemies are more varied, there are more action-based enemy sequences than the first, and the difficulty level has been approriately increased.  In terms of the level of challenge, I feel that this is the best in the series.  The later Tomb Raider series felt frustrating and downright cheap at times.  This one is definitely not a cakewalk, but is very possible without a strategy guide.  You don't feel as though you have to play for half an hour just to get into the next room.  Progress is slow, but steady, and you don't ever need 6 or 7 different items to move on.  Progress is more based on actually getting where you want to go rather than finding the right items or hitting the right combination of switches.  Some of the level designs are incredible, such as the Venice-based levels, the Opera House, the beastly Barkhang Monestary and the massive Temple Of Xian.  This is the key strength of the first two TR installments, and why the more recent ones have been less inspiring.  Resourcefulness and attention to the environment is extremely key, as medipacks are in light supply in this game.  Also, every level has 3 secrets in the form of dragons.  You do not receive the bonus items unless you find all 3 dragons in the level, making exploration even more vital in building your inventory.  Finding at least 2 of the dragons in every level should be quite easy, but some levels have one especially well-hidden dragon.  The gold dragons in the first two levels are remarkably difficult, but the reward of finding them (especially the first one) is worth it.  If you didn't like the first Tomb Raider, this game won't change your mind.  If you were blown away by the first installment (or even the 3rd, 4th or 5th) then this game is a real treat.	1
Tomb Raider 2 is my absolute favourite PlayStation game of all-time! I bought the game in December 1997, around the same time I got my PlayStation. But I never really liked Tomb Raider 2 and only managed to get halfway through the first level, before forgetting about it for a while. Four years later, in the summer of 2001, I dug it out again and decided to give it a go with the help of a strategy guide. What a shock I got!  After the phenomenal, worldwide success of the original Tomb Raider in November 1996, the Eidos Interactive guys put together the sequel, which, in a rare case, surpasses the original with flying colours. To save the game in the first, you had to find a crystal before continuing, wheras in Tomb Raider 2 you have the ability to save the game whenever you feel like. This comes as a great help, especially before taking off into a running jump over deep caverns and steep slopes. Lara also has much greater weaponary comapred to the last game. The first game featured Pistols, Shotgun and Uzis - that was about it. But with this game, you get weapons such as the Grenade Launcher and an M-16 Assault Rifle. While Tomb Raider 1 focused more on enemies in animal form, Tomb Raider 2 has a more worldly feel because the foes are mostly human. But the most notable change on Tomb Raider 2 is the welcome addition of vehicles. Tomb Raider featured none what so ever, but Tomb Raider 2 has a wide variety from the enjoyable speedboat in Venice and the snowmobile in Tibetian Foothills. Lara also took advantage of a make-over. The graphics where background scenery is concerned is still the same as the first game, but Lara herself has changed a lot; her hair is no longer tied in a bun, but flows freely down her back in a pony tail. The reason this wasn't featured in the first game is because the technology wasn't good enough for her hair to be in a pony tail - they couldn't get it to move in motion with her body (rather silly when you think about it now). Lara also possesses the ability to climb certain surfaces. The improved engine also served better lighting facilities, which allowed Ms Croft the ability to wield flares whenever she finds herself in dark areas. When it comes to the levels, the highlights are Venice, Offshore Rig, Tibetian Foothills (short but sweet - involves driving to one end of a road over pits to find a key, before driving all the way back to open a door that allows you to exit and begin the next level), Barkhang Monastery (HINT: Whatever you do, DON'T shoot the monks, they are here to help! They will dispatch any henchmen who try to kill you so you don't have to kill them! Accidently shoot one, and you'll have hundreds of monks trying to kill you!) and Temple of Xian.  OVERALL GRADE: 10/10  Tomb Raider 2 is, in my opinion, the greatest PlayStation game there has ever been. Yes, the graphics are laughable now because they have come so far since - especially on the PlayStation 2 and X-Box, but it all boils down to how enjoyable the game is. And in that category, it is still the most enjoyable and exciting game ever. Hundreds of titles try to replicate the suspense and adventure that is seen in the Tomb Raider games and fail miserably. Buy this now from Amazon - it'd be a shame not to and to ignore it would be missing out on one of the most classic video games of all time...	1
This game is great to get into and back again never mind. So the level's are great you get to go Tibet, China, Venice and a sunken, ship. The background is not so good but it's ok. And you get small heath and large heath packs. These heath packs will be somewhere in the game keep a good eye out for them. Arm yourself with: automatic pistols, harpoon gun, rocket launcher, M16 rifle, Uzis, shotguns, flares and more! Kill them or be kill by: monks, yetis, great white sharks, killer eels, dobermans and more. BE CAREFUL PLEASE!! Your quest is for THE DAGGER OF XIAN.It's hidden somewhere out there I know do you? And the good news is lara is BACK!	1
I thought id reviewed already, but here goes.  Not your typical ninja game, as most are stealth, this one is more the action side of things, tons of weapons, some special powers, projectiles, and level kind of puzzles. Think ol school brawlers (final fight) meets 3D as a ninja. Cool art to be seen but not cool enough to forget it takes awhile to load as you look at it (load screen).  Fast paced and fun, easy controls and cool lvl design. One other thing is graphics, moderate maybe for ps1, but just bad by todays standards when some ps1's still hold up better.  But that is overlookable as it doesn't hinder gameplay, and is so much fun to play, your just a bad azz ninja. In short bad grfx, long loads, but still so worth being this ninja.	1
I used to love this because the graphics were great with the best cenery seen in a Ninja game on the PLAYSTATION. The problem is you collect power ups for your shurikuns(throwing stars)that make them pretier and powerfuler, when you die you have to look for more treasure chests as you progress through the game. I've recently bought NINJA GAIDAN for XBOX and that game reminded me of this with the great cenery and graphics.	1
yeah the cpu is like  completley retarded gulie does not counter with his flip kicks ryu doesnt ever do his shukoken uppercuts to counter but  some of the characters can be pretty hard like T. Hawk but i just don't get the street fighter arcade - like feeling	-1
Street Fighter is perhaps the definitive fighting game series. Should you feel it necessary to buy absolutely every individual cartridge/disc of the six games contained on the two SF Collections, then do so and spend a ton of cash. They are all excellent titles, but the two collections of a game that defined the fighting genre are perfect. Street Fighter Collection, the original that is in the spotlight, is actually the more up-to-date one. While it does not contain the original Street Fighter II, it does contain 3 classic Street Fighter games. First is Super Street Fighter II: The New Challengers, released on SNES and Genesis in 1994. It was mindbendingly good the first time I played it. It had a solid 16 fighters. All 8 from Street Fighter II, the bosses, plus 4 new characters never heard of before: Cammy, Dee Jay, Fei Long, and T. Hawk. You might think, "Oh wow, a new edition with new fighters. Never seen THAT before." Well, you're wrong. Super Street Fighter II did contain 4 new arenas (respectively the ones for the new fighters). It also had newly mixed music, newly animated profile shots, and newly animated backgrounds. Basically, it was a perfect upgrade. Super Street Fighter II Turbo is also included. It may seem like Super Street Fighter II with the speed like Street Fighter II Turbo, but it added something. Each character had one SUPER MOVE. From Ryu and Ken's Shinkuu Hadoken to Chun Li's Kikousho, they really gave a great new edge to the series. Akuma is even hidden in this upgrade. Also, the definitive of the three Street Fighter Alpha games, Street Fighter Alpha 2, gets upgraded to Street Fighter Alpha 2 Gold Edition. Cammy is added on, and Evil Ryu becomes playable (YAY!). What's strange is that some of the cast gets an additional playability in their SFII:CE animation. So it's definetely worth picking this up...if you don't already have all three of these games for your SNES (Alpha 2 is also on the PS).	1
The one thing people are missing to consider about this game is that, if you notice, the collection is a collection indeed, and a fine one at that, but mostly shows how the Street Fighter series evolved.  If you note that it goes from Super Street Fighter II, to SSFII Turbo, to SF Alpha 2 gold.  Well, my point is that it shows in order how the series evolved to becoming more complex and technical with Super Combos added.  1st it starts with Super II, no supers at all, just classic, then goes to Super II Turbo, where the super combo made it's debut, and every body had only one super, then goes to Alpha 2 Gold, where it really shows what you can do with a super combo, plus more characters, and every body had atleast 2 super combos. Lets go over it: 1st - classic with no supers lots of characters 2nd - classic with supers making debut same amount of characters 3rd - advance from 2nd with more characters and 2 supers for each Not only that, but it's a classic game, mostly to me, just an example of the evolution of the series, if you are still looking for what you thought this game would be, get the 2nd one, otherwise, it's a wise decision to go with this one.	1
Forgotten amidst the blood of Mortal Kombat and 3-D presentations of Virtua Fighter and Tekken, the Street Fighter II series initiated the fighting game craze.  Whereas its successors won their fanbases with graphical geegaws, Street Fighter II's strength was superb, well-balanced, uncomplicated gameplay that was simple to learn but exhausting to master.  Street Fighter Collection accurately reproduces that gameplay, making for an excellent anthology, but not a flawless one. Firstly, the omission of the first three iterations of Street Fighter II is glaring.  Given the lack of complexity of those games, one has to wonder if Capcom's developers were too lazy (or their marketers too greedy) to finish those titles for this release, instead leaving them for Street Fighter Collection II.  Graphically the games are preserved admirably, although CD audio forces the game to start each track over when speeding the tempo up, unlike in the arcade games.  The long load times are excruciating, as is each title requiring its own Memory Card block, when the high scores for both titles could easily fit into a single block. The inclusion of Street Fighter Alpha 2 Gold is nice, but seems out of place in what is supposedly a historical collection.  Perhaps the developers felt they rushed the original Street Fighter Alpha 2 to market, and tried to save face by placing the more polished Gold version in this compilation.  And since this third title requires its own Memory Card block, Street Fighter Collection actually requires three blocks in all, not one as is advertised on the packaging. Still, all three games have withstood the test of time, and are worth purchasing for gameplay if not historical value.  But the aforementioned drawbacks of the Street Fighter II games and dubious packaging do detract from the compilation as a whole.	1
This wwf game sucks... Boring...Graphics are alright...It was just plain awful EVEN FOR IT'S TIME! UGH this game was slo[...] get this game.. GET NO MERCY!  BEST WWF GAME EVER!... This game was very dull and boring... If I could give it a zero I would...THIS GAME FLAT OUT SUCKS! good thing I Baught this for a 2 bucks....But still that was a waste... Later	-1
I have had this game since it came out. too many people see this as a bad/old game, but i remember when this first came out...it was  revolutionary. this was the ORIGINAL game to use the engine, while attitude  was a sequel, and ECW just plain copied it. If you have a choice, though,  you should buy it's sequel, attitude.	1
When I first got this game, I found it to be boring not too soon after getting it. When I play it today, I still think it's boring! WWF War Zone is the first real WWF wrestling game to be released on the Playstation. I don't really consider the In Your House game to be wrestling wise, but more Mortal Kombat like.  War Zone is based off the WWF roster from late 1997 to early 1998, featuring only the most popular stars in the game . Among the wrestlers in this game, you can choose to play as Stone Cold Steve Austin, Shawn Michaels, Bret Hart, The Undertaker, The Rock, Triple H, Mankind, Goldust, Owen Hart, Ahmed Johnson, Farrooq, British Bulldog, Ken Shamrock, and The Headbangers.  The opening of the game is cool, as you're given a Raw like intro that used to open Monday Night Raw back in the mid to late 90s. From there on, you're taken to the menu screen that's in the form of an elevator. In the menu you can look at the wrestlers' biographies that let you listen to their theme and see their attires they wear in the game. There's also a Training mode on the menu that lets you pick a wrestler and learn how to perform their moves before you go into the game.  Once you enter the game, you can either play Exhibition matches to get adjusted to everything or go straight to Challenge Mode. Among the match types available are Singles, Tag Team, Tornado Tag Team, Hardcore, or Steel Cage. The Steel Cage match is probably the most frustrating match to play. When you climb the cage, I didn't know what button to push to climb down. I pushed down but I just ended up climbing back down to the ring. I lost most of the Cage matches.  Challenge Mode involves you choosing a superstar to play as and guide them to the World Championship. Unfortunately this was a boring and irritating mode to play. Once you play one match, you've played them all. You have to fight the same opponents at least 4 or 5 times before you advance to newer ones. As you progress through, you'll be met by a woman in a limo in the parking lot who will either show interest you for winning a match or insult you for losing a match. Oh yeah, that's another thing. If you lose 1 or 2 matches, you're automatically sent back to the beginning and have to start over from match 1 to go up. It ultimately screws you over and you're forced to play a lot of the same boring matches again.  Overall: I found War Zone boring then and I find it boring now. In my opinion In Your House is more fun to play than this. Even the sequel game to War Zone, Attitude, is more fun to play than War Zone. So if you don't want to be bored, skip War Zone and buy In Your House or Attitude instead	-1
Use to play this as a kid and when I played it, it brought back all kinds of memories from my childhood. Definitely a game to have if you are or were a fan of wrestling.	1
I *hate* this game.  Let me state right away: graphics in a WWE wrestling game mean absolutely NOTHING to me.  The graphics in WWF War Zone are pretty good (and original, back in the day) but who cares?  It seems the only thing wrestling video game fans today are interested in is looking at their television set in amazement because the wrestlers look realistic, and their movements true to life.  Who cares?  When War Zone first hit the scene in the late 90's yeah, the graphics WERE cool.  Not now, especially when the only thing the WWE cares about these days is impressing gamers with realism.  You know, WWF War Zone was the very first game that brought the graphics to a whole new 3D level.  A whole new level of crap.  You see, it makes me sick that the WWE wrestling games for 10 years now are all basically the same.  Let me explain why this is a bad thing.  You know when you buy an updated sports video game (such as football or hockey) and the only thing different about it from the previous year are a couple new player names, and maybe some new options here and there?  That's exactly what the WWE has done with their video games.  For the last 10 years all the WWE games have been WAY too similar to each other, and it completely sucks out the fun when every new wrestling game that hits the market only offers a slight difference over the previous years game.  It doesn't matter if it's Smackdown, Smackdown 2, WWE Raw for the Xbox, WWE Wrestlemania for the Gamecube, etc.  Those games are all the same- a lousy attempt to impress gaming and wrestling fans with realism.  I'm all for realism, but it DOES NOT MATTER in a wrestling game.  A wrestling game is like any other video game in that it SHOULD be all about having fun with it.  And I can't have fun with a wrestling game released today that, more or less, is exactly the same as a wrestling game from 10 years ago.  It makes me sick to think 10 years later, hardly anything has changed in the world of wrestling video games.  Before WWF War Zone, you had WWF In Your House which, to this day, is a game that completely stands apart from other WWE wrestling games (along with WWF Wrestlemania: The Arcade Game).  Before those games you had the button-smashing delight of WWF Raw on the Super NES and Sega Genesis.  Once again, the formula in those old-school wrestling games didn't stick around and overstay its welcome.  Over 10 years with games just like WWF War Zone IS too much.  The very second WWF War Zone came out on the Playstation and N64, it all went wrong.  Game companies got the idea that people wanted realism in their wrestling games, so from that point on ALL the WWE games had to be about having realistic-looking gameplay and wrestler appearances, and the fun factor washed away like sandcastles on the beach.  It's hard to have fun with a game when the year before you were playing the same thing.  After a while you get sick of it.  WWF War Zone is an innovative game for taking wrestling to new heights, but it was the WORST thing that could have happened.  Graphically, WWF War Zone is the first of its kind.  Being the first means it's bound to have some flaws (despite the fact that existing is its biggest flaw!)  Another MAJOR problem with the game is how SLOW it is.  After the adrenaline-rushing WWF In Your House, we now experience wrestlers walking around in the ring VERY slowly.  Painfully slow, in fact.  Going from WWF In Your House to WWF War Zone is like going from a cheetah race to a snail race.  Your grandparents can wrestle each other faster than the wrestlers in this game.  To be fair, the ONLY thing WWF wrestling games today have improved is the speed.  Everything else is the same as it was 10 years ago.  WWF War Zone also started the popular "create a wrestler" mode.  But it doesn't matter because, as I mention above, wrestling games for 10 years have had that option.  It's an option that has lost its charm because of overkill, and it's time game companies got rid of it, or did something to drastically change it.  It was a fun and interesting idea at first but now, 10 years later, I don't want to have it in a wrestling game ever again.  I tried getting rid of WWF War Zone at a yard sale but no one wanted it, so I had to get rid of it by throwing it away.  No way was I keeping such a crappy game in the same shelf with MUCH more deserving Playstation games.  If only WWE was more innovative with their wrestling games today, instead of repeating the same formula every year, I wouldn't have to keep going back and pointing out WWF War Zone as the game where the downfall began.  After 10 years, updating the graphics and adding just a few new options and wrestlers doesn't get the job done.	-1
Kartia: "The Word Of Fate" (recognized as Rebus in Japan), crams  fabulous innovation in one decent Strategy/RPG. Although Atlus has released  a few worthy games on the PlayStation console, Atlus begins to grow as a  company who'll soon promote their selves into a house-hold name. Like the  arising empire of Enix. Despite the humiliation from their most  embarrassing game, Eggs of Steel, Atlus is gaining momentum with their  not-notch RPGs.  Taking corresponding steps alike with Ogre Tactics and  my all time precious- Final Fantasy Tactics-, Kartia packs  charming  innovations. Sure, Kartia may not have the excellent job systems like FFT,  or any archers for the matter, yet it brings temples of innovations to bury  the burden. It has Phantoms. Once the player ons his PlayStation, the  player selects his  decision to accept the role of Toxe or Lacryma. Each  character has a totally different story process.  The niddy-griddy fun in  Kartia is concentrating on your arsenal of Phantoms. They are  paper-rock-scissors monsters.  All phantoms can be defeated by a specific  one and vise versa.  Phantoms play the most basic role.  During the game,  the player uses them to create elemental magic or specialize weapons.  Assembling the player's own infantry takes a critical job for victory or  instant death. The objectives in Kartia are alike with FFT's system. From  claiming the lives of your adversaries to escorting a vital character,  Kartia has the same fundamentals of any Strategy/RPG game.  What really  amazes, is the addition to disturb the environment. Players have the  opportunity to cut down trees down for a bridge and order a magician to  freeze a pool of water for walking.  Battling enemies on the vast  terrain is exciting, but the game loses some valuable points from being  completely linear. Gladly, there is another innovation that covers that  burden as well, the 2P Mode. Final Fantasy Tactics could have been truly  flawless if Square decided to include the 2P Mode. Kartia takes  Strategy/RPGs deeper. The 2P Mode allows two players to battle their armies  on saved data. Players can also trade items.  The ONLY downslope going  for Kartia is the abrupt end.  Kartia is an engrossing story. With  a tale like this, why not bring an anime in the movie industry?  Both  characters have dissimilar story progressions. Loxe is a young boy who  enjoys the elegance of swordplay a bit too much. Lacryma is an incredibly  robust Shrine Knight. It's up to these two heroes to protect the land from  barbaric rebels. Heroes fighting the bad rebels may sound dull and boring,  but once the backstabs roll in, there's no way the player can let the  controller free again. Someone, anyone, make Kartia an anime!  Graphically Kartia is a 3D splendor. The vibrant colors hold an artistic  environment. When a person speaks, a dialogue box is set above the screen  and the character's faces appear. At the FMV department, the videos are  dark, and morbid that triumphantly stimulates your daily dose of eye-candy.  Music thrives to hand the player spectacular soundings.  The beats can  really adjure you in an edge of your seat thrill.  Atlus has succeeded to  create a game that goes beyond the redundant  RPGs today.  Don't be fooled  by Kartia's age or lack of popularity. This is a solid buy.  FFT fans, run-  kill only if necessary- to grab a hold of this monster.  2P mode shines and  awaits for your arrival. In return for your forty bucks you'll get the  chance to trade items with a friend, and get sucked into a extremely  addictive play!	1
Snowboarding games are a dime a dozen these days, so it's nice when a good one comes along. Although it's rare to see a snowboarding game play out like Mario Kart, it makes for a really fun game. You play as one of 6 grade school children, collect items and weapons, knock off enemies with these items and weapons, do tricks, and get money while trying to win the race. Even though the childish characters may intimidate many who see this game, this still is a great game. The game looks pretty nice for N64 standards, the controls are tight, the sounds are good and the music is very catchy. This game also uses great ideas, such as saving money to upgrade your snowboard or playing on really wacky (but really enjoyable) courses. In fact, some of the courses have no snow on them! But that's the fun of this game: getting to snowboard down unimaginable terrain, while at the same time, hitting your opponents with pie-pans, bombs, rocks and other items. It releases some kind of childhood glee deep in your brain that I just can't explain. But it's not all fun and games though. There are some problems. First, is the game's image. Many are really going to be turned off by the childish nature of this game, though I liked it so much, I didn't care. The biggest problem is that you need a Conroller Pak to save your data. The real gripes here is that there is no battery backed memory option along with the Controller Pak use and since the game requires 121 of the 123 pages in the Controller Pak, you'll need to spend more money getting more Controller Paks if you have other games that require it also (Mystical Ninja starring Goemon, Rugrats In Paris) or games where you want to save data for safe keeping (Wave Race 64, Perfect Dark). But even with these issues, the game is still really fun and worth playing. If you like it and still want more, try its sequel, Snowboard Kids 2. But try the original first to see if you like the style of play. I'll bet dollars to donuts that you'll enjoy it, though. Great Job, Atlus.	1
The game works great. no problems after several sittings. Fun game and worked great what is not to like. Came in the mail fast.	1
I played this game a lot when I was little. It was always fun and I enjoyed it. The music in the background, the colors, the graphics; its all great. The coolest thing is that this game is one of a kind, and it is really a good one to add to any Nintendo 64 collection. Gameplay is easy and overall a really awesome game!	1
If you like Mario Kart 64, then you will absolutely love this game! Its sort of a rendition of Mario Kart 64, but instead of riding karts, your riding snowboards. Now in my biased opinion, I love snowboarding games, and this one was a classic among my friends and me.  I recently played it again and noticed several pros and cons that made it such a good game. It had hilarious sound effects, great controls, a few varieties of boards to chose from, and solid looking graphics. It is also fun to get power ups and shoot down your friends to get in the lead. What's really cool about this game is the chair lift at the end of the run. To get back to the top of the mountain you have to go up a chairlift, but the chaos that happens to be the first person to ride the chairlift is hilarious. The only thing that turns people off from the game is that there are only four riders to choose from, and they're all little kids. In other games like Mario Kart, there is more characters to chose from, but the character choices are only a minor con. It also has an incredibly babyish look towards it that can be a slight turn off for older kids.  But once you can "read past its cover" the game can be so much fun to play with friends and family. It is almost nothing like the immature style the game gives off.  Overall, I rate this game a solid 4.5 out of 5 because it is fun and exciting, and in my opinion, better than Mario Kart 64.	1
This wasn't widely released in America though those who have played it swear by it as being just as fun as Mario Kart 64. I agree with this comparison. However this has some fun twists that Mario Kart 64 lacks. One such twist is that laps occur when you get to the bottom of the hill and jump back on the lift. This can cause for some HILARIOUS chaos! If two racers have a good lead on opponents but are trying to bump each other out of the way to jump on the next lift chair, it can give other people a chance to catch up and possibly sneak onto a chair first if their opponents knocked each other over. I love this dynamic! Because it makes it more than just your average Mario Kart racing clone.  Other features include the ability to buy new boards and perform aerial trick to earn extra cash. Money earned during a race can also be used to "buy" weapon items encased in boxes littered throughout a course. I also ought to mention the music; it's wonderful!!! It features bubbley techno music reminiscent of dance/pop groups like Aqua. You'll dig the energy the music provides.  If you are a fan of Mario Kart 64 style crossfires, I think you'll find this is a unique addition to your N64 collection.	1
This game is a lot of fun, with a creepy atmosphere that revolves around the disappearance of Agents Mulder and Scully. I've heard some complain that they wish Mulder and Scully were in the game more, but I think you  still see enough of them to keep most fans happy, plus I found the  character of Agent Willmore (whom you play) to be very likeable. The  storyline is very strong, the puzzles make sense, and the full motion video  (FMV) sequences are very good. There are not very many FMV games around  anymore, so if you like your adventure games with video sequences, this is  really a "must have".	1
This was not the best mystery/adventure game I've ever played, and I'm not even a big fan of such games to begin with, but I am a serious X-Phile.  Despite the seven CDs full of Full Motion Video than make up the game, it wasn't a whole lot like being in an X-Files episode.  Instead, it was more like being one of those "other agents" who make brief appearances two or three times per season.  You actually have to do some of the tedious legwork to collect evidence instead of having it conveniently handed to you after the commercial break.  Of course, the up side to that is a more immersive, believable feel to the game and a feeling of accomplishment when you finally do spot the crucial clue. Fans of the series will find plenty of references to themes, conspiracies, events, and trivia from various episodes, as well as the familiar faces.  While it's not strictly necessary to recognize all the references to the series in order to solve the mystery, it does add quite a bit to the game. If you're not a fan of The X-Files, there are better mystery/adventure games out there.  If you find mystery/adventure games frustrating, you probably won't like this one even if you are a fan.  On the other hand, if you do enjoy both this type of game and the series it's based on, you'll have a lot of fun with this game.	1
This was a pretty good game, but not a great game. I'd probably rate this closer to 3 1/2 stars. You are agent Craig Wilmore. Scully & Mulder have disappered and it's your job to find them. You have several locations to go to and many people to talk to in your search. A couple of the features I really like was you actually have a shoot out that you control in one location and in another location, you have to do a real time search to catch the "bad" guys towards the end. Most of the cast members from the show are here (Skinner, The Cigarette Smoking Man, & The Lone Gunmen), but they weren't used nearly enough. There were some cool explosions and the story was pretty good, but they could have made this a little harder in some aspects and a little easier (like being able to get a password for your own computer. Why was this so hard?). Overall, a good game, but just a few more additions and changes and this could have been a great game.	1
We stopped watching the series (lack of time) and so this was a nice way  to keep the excitement going. The game is good, perhaps a little  disorienting at first. I spent the first hour sitting at Craig Willmore's  desk, doing nothing :) Once you get the hang of it, though, it follows  quite nicely. Because you have so much freedom in navigation (you decide  where to go, but things won't happen until you come back to the right place  at the right time), it feels like the game is non-linear. In fact, it is  rather linear, although you have a few variations. I wasn't disappointed in  the ending, but not thrilled either, it didn't blow me away. We got stuck a  couple of times, but we managed to make it without a walkthrough in about a  week. The rule of this game is SAVE OFTEN. And organize your saves. Keep  the last save before you change CDs (they correspond roughly to major  developments). You might need to restart from there because you forgot to  do something crucial. Or because you died (I got killed a lot too). You  need lots of frequent saves, and a few less recent, and a few even less  recent not to have to restart from scratch if you believe you forgot  something at the beginning of the game. But overall, the storyline is quite  intuitive and you'll be fine if you make connections. Buy this game if  you like the series but you're not a fanatic (you'd be disappointed). And  you'll have a good time if you can stand occasionally being stuck and turn  it into a challenge rather than into a frustration.	1
As a fan of Myst and Riven, I would not put this game in the same  category.  However, it does equally well for it's type.  Myst and Riven  don't have a main character that you are per se, whereas in this game, you  have a name and a face. The game puts you in the shoes of one agent Craig  Wilmore.  He is put on a case to find the missing X-files staff: Agents Fox  Mulder and Dana Scully.  As an X-files fan, I found this game very  entertaining.  As a gamer it was well within the genre of adventure games.  There were hints, stuff to pick up, things to do etc.  This was well  within the capabilities of non-X filers and should be equally entertaining. I likened this game to the Gabriel Knight 2: The Beast within and  Phantasmagoria.  Unlike Phantasmagoria, there were no gory scenes (of which  I was thankful). The people were movies of real people and not cartoons.  The dialgue though limited offered enough variability. One important point  would be to save often.  I got killed alot. The game had enough of a  plot you could figure out what to do next.  That is essential rather than  blindly clicking on everything you could pick up. All in all a good buy.  When's the next one?	1

Excellent, not a scratch and perfect case.	1
Arrived on time, works great	1
pretty good game. especially for the price.	1
Flying the Star Wars ship was super fun and bringing down those Imperial Walkers is super fun!	1
Thank you.	1
I've always been a fan of the Twisted Metal series, and this third installment doesn't disappoint. Some familiar characters from the other two games reappear here, but there are also some cool new characters. The music rocks and the stages are full of challenging situations. Be ready to get your drive on!	1
Twisted metal is a great game!	1
Thanks The wonderful packaging I'm so happy To deal with you	1
Where to begin with this train wreck of a game.  Twisted Metal 3 is like an abomination that should have never been made.  989 ruined the whole spirit and everything that made Twisted Metal 2 one of the best games ever made.  The only thing I would give this sequel over the previous game was that the cars graphically look a little better.  The game is so frustrating from the controls that it makes it no fun to play.  Everything got worse instead of better.  Story and Characters They brought back the taxi from the first game, added a grandma and a Flower Power 60's car.  Yeah not a lot else needs to be said all 3 suck.  They got rid of some of the fun characters from the 2nd game like Shadow and Mr. Slam for those 3 and changed some of the names probably a copyright issue between the companies.  Not a big deal but still why not just keep the names the same.  The story is pretty much the same but uses 3D graphics instead of the animation theme.  I personally thought the animation from 2 was great and added a lot of fun to the game.  I loved beating TM2 with each character to see the multiple endings.  This game is so frustrating you will get none of that same enjoyment from this game.  Play Control Is ridiculous in this game it is way over responsive to the point where it is hard to even drive the vehicles.  Just driving over power ups seems like a chore to pickup when they should be easy.  The wonderful freeze element in TM2 does not work near as well in this game.  The play control in TM2 was outstanding, every vehicle was easy to learn and play.  Not so in this monstrosity.  Stages & Backgrounds The stages and backgrounds seem cramped and you don't get the feel of exploration you did in the previous game.  The cars all stay pretty close to you, so you don't do much searching for opponents on the other end of stages.  Gone are the fun elements of Antarctica falling to pieces or environmental dangers such as Moscow or the ruins of Latin America surrounded by lava.  Instead you get Egypt, The North Pole, Washington DC, London and Tokyo.  None of which is very exciting. I found the background boring and uninspiring.  Challenge This game is cheap as hell, but not in the way you would think.  Instead of all the cars fighting each other, it seems like all the opponents just gang up on you alone so the odds are always 4 to 1 or 5 to 1 instead of even.  When you get a few opponents life bars way down they run off looking for your health powerups, that's right they wimp out stop engaging and run for health before they start attacking you again.  When I first saw this in the game I thought you have to be kidding me.  What programmer would add that in.  It really ruins the gaming experience and is frustrating.  When I died in TM2 I was eager to start the stage over and get revenge on the car that destroyed me but that does not really happen in this game because it takes so much longer just to destroy an enemy car because they are running after health the whole time.  The bosses are pretty much the same I thought the final boss was not unoriginal. The radar in this game is not nearly as good as with the previous game making it hard to track your prey and see where they are at on the grid.  Verdict Avoid this game like the plague.  The cars and graphics may look better but you will have a better time beating your head against a wall that playing this game.  the endings and stories are not as good, the play control is awful.  The challenge is way to high because of cheap tactics. The radar is not really helpful.  All in All it is the worst game in the series.  I hated this game save your money or just buy the Twisted Metal 1 or 2.  Gameplay: 3/10 Play Control: 1/10 (over responsive to the point of frustration) Story\Originality: 2/10 Challenge: 10/10 Fun Factor\Replay Value: 1/10	-1
Classic Game,came as expected, lightly used no excessive wear.	1
Stays true to the original. Mass destruction over multiple different levels of tracks. Its fun to play with a large group of people.	1
Still have my N64 and this game.  Lot's of fun.	1
So happy I got a childhood game of mine. This is absolutely amazing. I missed it so much, I was 6 when I first got this, along with bomberman, and mario party. N64 is life. Thank you.	1
Still really fun, n64 does a great job with flight and race simulaters.	1
The main reason that people hate this game is because it came right after Twisted Metal 2 and people were expecting A LOT of improvement, but the expectations were in vain. :(  The game isn't all THAT bad, I mean... Mr. Grimm still cool, there is a new Viper car, you can use "rain missiles" as weapons, some of the characters and stories are VERY funny, the graphics were improved, the Rob Zombie intro song was AWESOME, and the London, Spaceship and Blimp stages were GREAT. NOW! The reason that this game suck's is because EVERYTHING in the game looks like fake plastic, the special effects are NOT shocking at all, you can't make ANY massive explosion or massive destruction, many characters look lame, if your car turns upside down you have to wait for 5 seconds for your car to stand up, and many stages are VERY small.  P.S: This Twisted Metal sequel is terrible, but at least is NOT GARBAGE as Twisted Metal 4!!! That game wasn't even a Twisted Metal game, that was more like "The Circus War". X(  Adios.	-1
Having played the Twisted Metal series for a few years now, I can honestly say that Twisted Metal III, while having an initial gleam at first play, it wears itself out fairly quickly. The gleam I'm speaking of is the slick graphics and the incredibly different game play. It tries to be something new, which it is, but it improves in all the wrong ways.  Allow me to explain :  Weapons Inventory. Instead of a max capacity of the total number of weapons in your inventory, you are limited to how many of each weapon you can have. For example, I can pick up 10 homing missiles but no more. The rest of my inventory has to be stocked with other useless weapons like Speed Missiles (more on that in a bit). In previous TM installments, you could keep building your homing missile capacity, and carry only those, as long as you didn't exceed the max capacity. Annoying.  New Weapons. Okay, so initially I thought the (((Rain Missile))) was the best thing since sliced bread. But really, the rain missile doesn't do very much apart from visual appeal. The missile shoots into the air and you detonate it, and a ring of fire falls down like five mini-napalms. It doesn't do the damage the napalm does, but only allows the cars to drive through so they start on fire...at least until they turbo (stop-drop-and-roll in TM maneuvers) out of it 2 seconds later. Minimal damage done.  The introduction of the (((Speed missile))) was the worst mistake of the weapon category. It's a fast missile that has the strength of three machine gun bullets. If you can fire them fast, you can do some damage, but they're so useless during combat that it really doesn't even matter.  (((Remotes))) are plenty but do much less damage than in TM2. (((Freeze missiles))) (the left-right-up maneuver) do not hit enemies like they used to. It is much harder to freeze an enemy. This can be frustrating.  Enemies. New characters are added, some are great, some not so great. Your enemies now have the A.I. that allows them to steal items from in front of you. If they need health, they will race you for it and take the health. This is especially frustrating when you are fighting Minion and you have one shot left to kill him and he quickly finds full health. *Cue controller hitting floor*  The levels are not very large. Not much scenery and not much to discover. There's a few hidden places you can find to explore, but for the most part it's very limited.  All in all, TM3 falls flat. The previous installments are much better both in game-play value, and in overall playability.  If you can find this cheap, get it. Otherwise pass it up.	-1
Rogue squadon is somewhat fun to play but the majority of the missions are hard to beat. the 3D enviroment is cool looking and on some levels there are places you can see that are straight out of the movie such as Jabba the hutt's palace on Tattoine. The main problem i have with this game is on the Hoth and Deathstar mission.(use password DEADDACK to get to them)on the Hoth mission you wrap a cord around Imperial walkers to trip them which is tricky to do. As for the Deathstar mission, the scenery is wrong. In the movie Luke fires at the exhaust port at the end of the trench, in the game the target is on the ground. But that's not what bothers me most though, After you hit your target it just says "Mission Complete" They should've had a cinematic sequence where the Deathstar blows up. That doesn't happen in the game which leaves you feeling angry and unsatisfied.	-1
Trust me, Do not buy this game.  I am the local TM lover and know-all.  I bought TM4, TM2, and TM3 (sadly I can't find a copy of TM1)  After i bought TM2, I was looking forward to cool characters, cool battlegrounds, and semi-pixated graphics.  I found none of these things.  There are only 4 new characters, Club Kid, Auger, Flamethrower, and my favorite new driver, Flower Power.  The levels, especially Washington DC, is a small open level, which is no fun.  The North Pole is annoying, and I hate the boring London level.  The graphics are cheesy, and 989 studios tried to make them look too real.  The cars flip over with every tight turn you make, when another car hits you, or you drive onto a hill.  This game is not realistic.  This game should have 0 stars and is a disgrace to the TM title.  I warn you, do not even look at this game.  It is the worst.  The car combat genre is in shame.	-1
Twisted Metal 3 is overrated - because it's not normally considered the worst Playstation game.  I can't believe how unfun this game is.  The  control is laughable.  The gameplay is incredibly boring.  The music is Rob  Zombie, which is bad enough before you hear it 5,000 times in a row.  The  game also adds almost nothing new.  Don't even rent this one.	-1
game is crappy and unfair enemys cheat and respawn making it impossible to compleate missions you either defend your man all the time or die	-1
this game is the hardest game ive ever played, and that takes away the fun. also graphics very poor even for nintendo 64 cannot even recommend for people i dislike don't waste your time or money worst n64 game ever	-1
this is the stuppidiest game i've ever played. I advise everyone not to play it or buy it. It really sucked.	-1
This game is very fun to play, but be warned off by this review from me!  It has the highly severe computer worm in its installation cds that Symantec's Norton web site refers to as: "IRC W32 Tibick Activity".  Also the XP update for it also has a computer worm in it! To check out the details off what it does to infected computer systems go to: [...] That page at Norton doesn't specifically refer to "Final Fantasy VII", but for those that want to know for sure that what I'm stating is correct you can use the shorter web site address at Norton by using the web address of: [...] In the web page that pops up into view; enter: "Final Fantasy VII"  into the search box on that page and hit the enter key on your keyboard.  A page with three options will comeup.  The top one is about the worm in the FF VII installation cds.  The next one is about the XP 1.5 version upgrade, and that has an additional worm in it.  The final option refers to a worm that infects FF XI & FF XII.  That worm is even more dangerous than even the one on the FF VII installation cds.  Thast one will automatically go to the computer's  email section and send ZIP versions of itself to every contact listed there.  Also all three worms will every time the computer is turned on check for a specific website to get upgraded versions of itself. My advise though Norton doesn't state it; is to destroy every copy of the PC version of "Final Fantasy VII" that you have to prevent infecting the computers in the world. In the file about "IRC W32 Tibick Activity" the Norton people mention how to completely remove the computer worm from infected computer systems.  That process can take a while though as that worm infects several other programs on the computer as well.  Norton lists all the programs that it infects as well. I myself have two copies of FF VII and even a copy of the cds I made as well.  I'm going to destroy those cds as well to follow my own advise.  Those people sure did a very mean stunt to the makers of Final Fantasy VII in ruining possibly the best rpg game they ever made!!!  Personally I think those people at the least should be sent to a federal prision<sp> for the rest of their lives!!! grrr!!!	-1
The game looks fine, but it doesn't work.	-1
the game's okay, although i don't think making the charactersin 3d was a very good idea, plus at some points game gets outrightboring,and all the main characters smoke...  although the game will crash sometimes, and it might get stuck, overall, the game is pretty much okay if you don't count crashes and how the characters act and look...  END	-1
Meh	-1

Lara Croft games have NEVER been any good.  I remember when the very first one came out 10 years ago.  Teens were practically DROOLING on their controller every time they saw Lara's pretty face.  Tomb Raider must have been advertised like it was the most groundbreaking video game to ever hit the freakin' market.  The thing is, the games are boring and Lara Croft isn't very pretty.  If polygon-breasted girls are your thing, go for it.  But they aren't MY thing, and I know I'm not the only one to think so.  Lara Croft isn't good-looking to the millions of internet gamers who understand that a blocky-looking computer babe isn't going to automatically make a game any fun to play.  I'll give Lara Croft SOME credit.  She was one of the originators of the "running around half-naked female shooter/adventure" type of video games.  In fact, you might even say she was a MAJOR influence because soon after her very first adventure, more and more game companies were making the main characters in their games half-naked chicks.  Lara brought something new to the world of video games and I will give her credit for that.  Sometimes influence doesn't matter when a game is really bad.  This is one of those cases.  The Tomb Raider series on the original Playstation is a joke.  I absolutely *groan* when I think about playing a Tomb Raider game because I remember how ugly and dark the environments are, the glitchy problems that dominate all three Tomb Raider games, the annoying and difficult jumping style of Lara Croft (which makes it nearly impossible to progress to the end of the game.  Good luck- she NEVER jumps where you want her to) and of course, mentioned above, Lara's supposed beautiful face (she's NOT pretty, remember?)  It also doesn't help that the puzzles you have to solve are ALWAYS really awful (and appear frequently) and, because of the jumping problem, very frustrating to complete.  Trying to aim your gun at an emeny isn't exactly a walk in the park, either.  The whole series has been an overrated disaster up to this point.  By the time Tomb Raider 3 was released people were REALLY getting fed up with the series.  Now, these same people will tell you this was because they kept releasing more and more Tomb Raider games, but I actually think people got sick of Tomb Raider because games like Resident Evil and Silent Hill came along with a similar style and improved on it *drastically*, making Tomb Raider look awfully dated by comparison.  At least the third Tomb Raider game has SOME decent-looking background levels.  I guess the company who created Lara Croft finally understood that Lara's pretty face ALONE isn't going to get the job done anymore.  I mean, at least in some places the backgrounds LOOK good .  Not exactly the prettiest environments available on the Playstation of course, and most of the time all you see is darkness or candlelight.  But what's THERE is okay to look at, at least.  Tomb Raider 3 features a challenge that is mostly only challenging because of the above-mentioned jumping problem.  She simply doesn't jump the way you want her to.  You'd THINK the game company would've dealt with this problem with all the new moves for Lara they added to the game, but no, none of these new moves make the game any easier.  The artifact-finding storyline had potential but unfortunately the frustrating challenge ruined it.  BOY am I glad I never bought any of these games (all these years I've been watching OTHER people play them).  Reading reviews for the more recent Tomb Raider games on the Playstation 2, I see NO improvements have been made.  Let the series END already.	-1
This game is ok, but mostly mediocre. This is the best that the N64 had to offer alongside the wrestling games and resident evil 2? Just goes to show that the nintendrone cult are way off the mark. The Sony playstation 1 had better games and far better immersion due to having the CD storage.  This game like i said is ok but hardly as good as the nintendrones have made it out to be. The production of the game is basically weak, with the menu intro being pathetic, and the music repeating over and over and over on each board. The gameplay is ok in that i can mow down enemies while running, but the aiming sucks and it gets boring having to mow down enemies that keep spawning over and over while i figure out how to complete the mission. Finally the multiplayer is wayyyyyy overrated. I remember playing it with 4 other players all day for  a couple days and never feeling into it. the quad split screen was a big nuisance.  Thank goodness for online play today - the games today completely own goldeneye in every category, especially the funfactor. So yeah - there you go nintendrones - the playstation brand rightfully won that gen and your crowning achievement in console gaming has turned out to be a dated and weak title. Oh yeah Rare is now exposed as being mediocre - your cult like devotion to nintendo made them rich at least. They haven't made anything decent since though	-1
The game looks fine, but it doesn't work. I bought 6 games from this seller, 5 of which did not work.	-1
Every once in a while I experience a piece of entertainment that is *so* overrated it's hard to believe I'm even living on the same planet as those that actually believe this is supposed to be the best. The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is that very piece of overrated entertainment. Talk about a video game that not only doesn't live up to the hype (not even close) but it doesn't do a darn thing to impress me even *if* I were to ignore all the exaggerated hype. This is a serious letdown of a video game. But again, please understand I'm not from the same planet as those that enjoy this game. I care about gameplay and replay value more than anything else. Apparently most Zelda fans believe puzzle-based dungeons and soulless overworlds are what defines the Zelda series.  One thing that positively stinks is that the land of Hyrule, despite being presented as beautiful (and realistic- don't tell me Nintendo wasn't riding the 3D high in 1998 and going for realism here) it's basically a gigantic piece of nothingness. Simply a means of getting from one area to another. A large, colorless empty field that Link either runs or rides his horse across. Nothing magical, medieval or interesting about *any* of this. It feels too much like taking a typical walk across the field beside my house. Going into this game after a Link to the Past, you'll be scratching your head wondering what happened to the huge variety of overworld enemies, pretty and colorful environments and enticing obstacles. Remember all those trees, rocks, grass and water sections from Link to the Past? Remember how rich and vibrant they looked? Ha, nothing nearly as diverse is featured in this bland and inferior overworld. Oh sure the monsters come out at night (in predictable spots) but that's it. As far as I can see, only one monster actually comes out (named Stalchild). Terribly lacking. The trees are spaced apart in a way that feels lacking too.  The dungeons is where this game severely misses the mark to such an extent that it's almost unfathomable to believe Nintendo thought releasing the game the way it is was enough to be sufficient. Again, where ARE all the enemies? Why am I roaming through temple rooms that are way too big for their own good? Are high ceilings and deep pits supposed to justify the lack of enemies because the tradeoff is that it feels like I'm really inside a castle now? Give me a break guys. The rooms are so big they basically have no life whatever. Instead of being loaded with enemies around every corner, these castles are alarmingly empty, lifeless and unacceptable. But... that's apparently okay, because Ocarina of Time is the first 3D Zelda game so its legendary influence and innovation makes it leaps and bounds above the sequels, right? Not in my world baby. The games following Ocarina of Time perfected the Zelda formula way more effectively. Wind Waker and Skyward Sword leaves this dated mess in the dust.  While normally I don't care about graphics in a video game, you gotta admit that bright vibrant colors really make the epic heroic adventurous theme of the Zelda series more engrossing. This is just... gross. Only the realistic-looking (flawed) overworld is a sight to behold (which of course now looks significantly better in Twilight Princess). Clearly the effort involved in designing the dungeons isn't much to admire. I don't really mind the occasional choppiness concerning the edges of buildings, trees or other objects that are all part of the Nintendo 64's datedness. Sometimes these unintentional features can be quite charming or, at the very least, forgiving. What I DO mind however is when these features are all over the place to the point of being a distraction, or having a game entirely too long so we're forced to persevere these issues time and time again. In other words I'd be willing to forgive this particular shortcoming if the game made up for the choppy/uninspiring graphics in other areas. Sadly, it doesn't. This isn't even much of an issue compared to the other complaints I have (which I'll mention below- keep reading). These graphics -especially the ones in the dungeons- resemble the ones found in the ruins of Mega Men Legends and the walls of the Quake series. The graphics in Link to the Past are unique and cannot be compared to any other game.  Let's discuss the dungeons, shall we? Despite being ridiculously and needlessly large with boring surroundings, most of them have such a small and uninteresting variety of enemies that it's almost a chore going through one generic room after another. Ocarina of Time shows the makings of early 3D development at its most obvious- the platforms are predictable square structures that requires the player to spend most of his or her time lining up Link in order to make proper jumps by turning the camera until Link is positioned enough to reach the platform directly ahead. When you combine the constant requirement of having to change camera angles with having to position Link correctly all for the purpose of being able to see what you're doing and where you're going, it's enough to make you think you're playing with string puppets. Again, early 3D design flaws and datedness.  The storytelling is really basic and predictable. It's never elaborate like in Wind Waker or Skyward Sword. It's mainly about rescuing or saving these mountainous cave creatures called Goron's for the first half, and going back and forth from the past to the present in the second half. This is a really uninteresting way of time travelling that feels almost nonexistent due to being so poorly and unsatisfyingly implemented. It doesn't even feel or look like you're going 7 years into the future as Link's appearance is supposed to be that of an older person but he doesn't appear to be much different from his younger self. Oh sure he's slightly bigger as an adult and slightly smaller as a kid but it's very subtle. The music is the one area where the game succeeds quite amazingly however. All the theme songs are not only appropriate for the environments, but melodic and memorable. Several dungeon themes are well-made and believably chilling and haunting. The right ingredients were definitely put into the music-making aspect of the game. The Hyrule overworld theme is enjoyable too and won't get on your nerves despite all the time you will undoubtedly spend there.  The dungeons are either incredibly simplistic with strategies that involve the overbearingly dull and overused crate-pushing to open up portals or switches, or hopelessly generic "I'm stuck in a maze and I can't get out" frustration that is an inconvenient trademark of early 3D game design. But... these aren't any ordinary mazes. These are mazes where your surroundings look identical around every turn, hence the flawed early 3D game design. A cheap way of making a maze seem more difficult than it has to be, or in other words, needlessly difficult chores instead of exciting castle exploration which is what made the 2D Zelda's so memorable. Sometimes you have to light torches with arrows or by other means, and quite often you have to collect 5 silver rupees to activate a switch/open a door. Collecting these silver rupees is WAY too similar to Super Mario 64 with the red coins. The Lost Woods is a tunnel-infested maze with no personality whatsoever. The Lost Woods -if you plan on getting everything the game has to offer- will most definitely be the source of endless frustration.  The enemies, or rather, what little enemies you will stumble upon on your "adventure" through the temples, is probably the most aggravating part of the entire game. These dungeons are sorely in need of something to spice them up and make them pleasurable. You will often go 3 or 4 rooms at a time without seeing a single enemy. Why even have a sword? In the 2D games the idea was simple- just load or overload the rooms with a variety of enemies and, guess what? *Now* the dungeons are exciting. A genius idea really. Here? In Ocarina of Time? It's all about atmosphere. It's all about featuring as little opposing danger as possible so you can absorb what was once Nintendo's most recent creation back in 1998. But... Nintendo forgot to take into account that technology will inevitably advance and a game relying on atmosphere above everything else will eventually suffer and become inferior one day. What was once a brand new puppy in 1998 is now a tired old dog thanks to the surroundings being boring and incredibly basic in their design. Video game technology is destined to advance making a game like this completely forgettable. That's exactly what has happened with Ocarina of Time- it hasn't stood the test of time.  Do you really think those poorly animated mechanical blue tektite spiders in the water dungon are worthy of a Zelda game? Seriously? Their animations are so stiff due to the Nintendo 64's limitations as a console that it's unbearable to deal with them and laughable at the way they lunge towards Link. But even then, *most* dungeon enemies fall way short of acceptable. Big Skulltula is a laughably bland attempt at being dangerous- it's more like a nuisance when one of these comes down out of nowhere while you're running around. The spikes that roll around are incredibly basic and uninteresting. Somehow *all* the enemies manage to never once be memorable. Ever! Ocarina of Time has dated horrendously, seriously. Wolfos are unintetionally funny with their choppy movements and the dated howling sounds they make, Red Bubble is basically the same thing as Big Skulltula but on fire, and Gibdos are boring. The ReDead's let out a hilarious scream that freezes Link in place which is inconvenient when you're trying to get up the ladder right in front of you and even more inconvenient when you're stuck in a room with two of them. Mummies are poorly designed since all you have to do is hookshot them, run behind them, and slice them with your sword. To be fair, some enemies are cool such as Deku Baba where it's best to snap its vine with the sword for an instant kill- creatively well done there. The Deku Scrub where you can block or sword swipe its shooting seeds with the shield and ricochet the seeds back at them is neat. And the Lizalfos and Dinalfos basically serve as mini bosses due to being somewhat harder and more sophisticated than the other ordinary enemies.  The game overall has a shortage of rupees. They're really not that important which is odd. This is the first Zelda game I've ever played where rupees feel more like an afterthought. Not something to take real seriously. If you don't feel like collecting them, then don't- no harm done. The bosses are alright except for the irritating one in the water dungeon. You have to repeatedly hookshot him while standing next to the platform. It takes FOREVER (and no, this boss is *nowhere* as fun as the water dungeon in Link to the Past in case you're wondering). The hookshot is used MORE than the sword throughout the game because it serves as an effective weapon quite often. The hookshot is a highly recommended weapon to use in a variety of situations, but especially important when collecting these things called gold skulltulas. After you collect 10 gold skulltula tokens, you get a beneficial reward. You can only collect them after defeating the gold skulltula enemy (usually found on walls). I admit I love the witches you face in the Spirit Temple. While the temple itself is really short and boring, it's probably worth going through it so you can face the two witches that make for a rather entertaining boss fight. You have to use your shield to reflect shots at the *other* witch, and it's really fun and creative. The hookshot's basically a required item to properly deal with hard-shelled or spiked enemies in the dungeons and it's annoying that it's used WAY more frequently than the sword throughout the game. Due to how much precision is required to use the hookshot, using this item becomes a very tedious chore after a while (especially if you keep missing your target) and it slows down the pace of the game by a lot.  If you haven't noticed yet, the water dungeon in Ocarina of Time is just abominable. I bring it up often to remind people how terrible a dungeon can be in every possible way. Also, the worst influence ever occurs here- the importance of playing the ocarina musical instrument for a variety of reasons (mostly for warping from one place to another). Nintendo really overdid this aspect of the game by implementing the ocarina WAY too many darn times. It's overdone. Just hurry up and play the darn song and move on for goodness sake. Don't make it so you have to play the ocarina up to 50 times, if not more. I never really counted how many times I used it. It was a lot. It severely drags the gameplay, atmosphere and excitement down and immediately drags the game to a screeching halt having to frequently stop and play these songs on the ocarina. Watching Link stand around and play the instrument is the fruitiest thing I've ever seen. No wonder people think Nintendo makes nothing but kids games these days. This game is partly responsible for that belief due to its influence.  Ganon's castle is supposed to be exhilarating and suspenseful. It's supposed to be filled with dangerous traps, tricky puzzles and enemies all over the place. But... the one in Ocarina of Time falls way short of being presentable by normal Legend of Zelda standards. Instead the castle is dominated with mini quests where you have to go through 6 trials to dispel the main barrier. The problem is that each trial contains really simple and short rooms where you only spend a couple minutes in each one performing the same tasks that you already had to do in the previous dungeons such as collecting 5 silver rupees. This is the complete opposite of being overwhelmingly threatening. Another bonus point for Link to the Past. Oh and the Ganon fight? His strategy is stolen from Agahnim's battle from Link to the Past but takes SEVERAL more minutes to bring down. Remember how you fought Agahnim? Yup, same exact strategy but in a 3D world. Sigh. The second part of the Ganon fight (after a looooong and tedious time-based departure from the top of a castle) is to shoot arrows at Ganon and hit his glowing behind several times. It's really easy, all of it. However fighting him in one of the early dungeons (Forest Temple) is actually one of the most memorable in the entire Zelda series. This is because Ganon rides a horse in and out of these picture frames hanging on the wall making for a VERY unique graphics effect and perhaps an original concept. Reminds me of a Harry Potter movie.  A few other complaints. Fishing is sort of fun but nothing really noteworthy. It's better than most fishing games I've played in other games I admit. Expect to be sitting and fishing a while in order to get the heart piece however. Most heart pieces are pretty challenging to acquire and take some serious effort to get most of them. That's a rare compliment I can give. Some of the other mini games such as riding a horse and shooting targets is pretty fun. I don't really like that part in the desert where you have to follow a ghost through a dust storm. If you fall behind even a *little* bit you'll lose. Performing this same ghost-chasing task earlier in the game in order to obtain the hookshot is more exciting since you're dodging fireballs. The other task earlier on in the game in the Ice Cavern that involves throwing blue fire over red fire is really overlong and entirely puzzle-based. Having to do this once or twice would have been suitable- not 15-20 times. This particular place is a victim of platforms that are basic and uninteresting.  Basically, when compared to the 2D games, Ocarina of Time only feels like half a game due to the dramatic change of turning the Zelda series into 3D but only giving us a small portion of what's available in Link to the Past. As a result the game feels incomplete on too many occasions. It's because the Nintendo 64 is a limited console that's really only able to handle so much. Ocarina of Time comes up way short. Even the first couple hours are disappointing since it takes forever to actually get going. Avoiding being detected by guards isn't fun after the first time. Oh and speaking of avoiding detection- this game actually has a Metal Gear Solid stealth-style mission later on where you have to free these imprisoned carpenter people. The stealth is so underutilized and simplistic that this is the second biggest chore in the game next to the water dungeon. Equally annoying is upon freeing the 4 carpenters, these red sword-swinging enemies appear on screen. The SAME EXACT ENEMY 4 times in a row with *no* differences between any of them. At first these battles seem hard until you realize all you really have to do is lunge your sword directly at them about 5 times, and they fall over and die.  Reading text and having boring discussions with Zelda, trees and other semi-interesting characters doesn't get the job done either. Ganon even seems significantly less threatening than usual (that one conversation with Zelda and Link with Ganon patrolling the hallways nearby in Hyrule Castle comes to mind here). I will admit that some of the flame-covered cutscenes involving Ganon riding his horse is very intimidating. The cutscene outside the bridge of Hyrule Castle comes to mind here. Otherwise, Ganon's presented uninterestingly. You're *supposed* to get a feeling of hopelessness that Ganon is going to take over the world and wipe the people out but... due to a culmination of the above mentioned problems, Ganon being a ruthless villain doesn't ever materialize (at least, he's not as scary as he *should* be).  Recognize Ocarina of Time for making the 3D Zelda series exist. That's fair. It allowed Wind Waker to eventually be created which in turn made the 3D Zelda formula better starting from that game until now. By 2003 Nintendo was working with the technologically superior Gamecube console which allowed the Zelda series to be fully realized in all major categories (gameplay, graphics, replay value and excitement). I say avoid Ocarina of Time but hey, nobody will listen or agree with me anyway so carry on and have a wonderful day!	-1
I thought Red Alert was a pretty fun game. This was just a clone of red alert though. The people that make C&C need to come up with some more ideas. All the C&C games are exactly the same. I didn't like Red Alert to start with so Tiberian Sun has to be worse.	-1
Unless you intend to cheat and mod the game don't waste your money. Uneven gameplay,and few options plague this game,it is also way too short even at this reduced price. Spend your money on a game,just not this one. Hope this helps,I hate to have games collecting dust,but this is one of those and I own about 50 recent games so I know what's what.	-1
There's many that love this so-called masterpiece, but the only thing I like about this boring/repetitive game is the great soundtrack. Sticking to the superior original.	-1
Banjo-Kazooie is a strange platformer, but ultimately misses the mark in all key areas of being entertaining.  It tries to be funny without actually being exciting to play so the game feels like a big misleading tease.  All the attention on humor and yet, the game itself is hardly ever fun.  This means children would probaly be able to overlook the games flaws and focus on the humor, which I'm sure was Nintendo's intentions- to market the game for kids and assume they wouldn't be able to detect the lousy game design.  I guess the Nintendo 64 struggling to make a profit at the time meant Nintendo had to do absolutely anything and everything to try and get *any* type of crowd interested in their products despite the poor quality we're forced to persevere, so that explains Banjo-Kazooie's existence.  Anyway, Banjo-Kazooie is basically nothing but an item-collecting quest with graphics that are admittedly prettier and just better than 90% of the stuff the N64 was pumping out at the time.  The waters, grassy lands, mountains... everything is a beautiful sight to behold with crystal clear authentically pleasing environments.  Probably on par with Donkey Kong 64 in terms of graphics but definitely NOT in terms of gameplay or the sheer size of the overworld which is incredibly tiny in Banjo-Kazooie.  But seriously, why am I basically doing nothing but walking around collecting items the entire time?  If you think "That's what ALL platformers do!" guess again: many of them focus on exciting enemy variety, diverse surroundings and a gradual increase in challenge which this game sorely lacks.  The only challenge is to avoid falling from high narrow platforms while collecting musical notes- these are dirty tricks and artificial challenges.  I found sharks you have to swim away from, crabs you can stomp on top of, and weird gigantic green enemies that come out of walls while you're trying to make your way across high paths without falling.  These enemies only appear like 10% of the time- the rest of your surroundings aren't very threatening.  Let's see all the things you have to collect.  Honeycomb pieces, jiggy pieces (mandatory to open entrances to new locations and you need to obtain a certain number of them per world), 100 musical notes which is a total ripoff of Super Mario 64 with the 100 coins needed to get a star, mumbo tokens used to cast spells, and jinjo tokens used to win vehicle parts.  You can turn into animals and insects which is somewhat satisfying for the sake of seeing the occasional brief moments of diversity, but otherwise nothing to get really excited about.  Often you have to climb trees or mountains to reach the items on top and it gets boring after a while, believe me.  The snowy and dessert areas are incredibly generic too, as are the underwater cave sections and grasslands.  Oh and the game is a victim of underwater tragedies- you're constantly adjusting the camera for a more appropriate angle but finding that it's much harder than it needs to be.  I will never understand why Nintendo refuses to fix water portions in 3D platform gaming.  It's mind-boggling.  They didn't even fix them in Super Mario Galaxy 2, a game released a good 10 years after Banjo-Kazooie.  The characters are all forgettable, including the ponytail-sporting female bear and Banjo himself.  Kazooie the bird is probably the only tolerable one of the bunch.  Whereas the Mario series can be enjoyed by kids and adults respectively, Banjo-Kazooie is certainly intended solely for children and no other age group.  It's too shallow of a game overall to satisfy adult gamers.  Banjo-Kazooie is like walking into the nicest looking restaurant in town and everything is great except for one thing- you get a small quantity of food so you ask yourself "Is it worth my time to return here again?"	-1
All right, the graphics are nice and the terrain damage is something new, but that doesn't make up for the gameplay, which could be summed up in one word:SLOW. Skirmishes take a real long time to get going; I mean, at least a half an hour before you can get a sizeable force. And then what do you find yourself doing? Protecting your base with them, and attacking with missle launches. I'm dead serious, the only way to attack is with missle launches. To attack with your men (Especially tanks) takes like ten minutes to even get to the enemy base! That being said, the multiplayer is a total waste of time. If the person your playing saves you the trouble of teching and attacks you early on with engineers, consider yourself lucky. Don't get caught up in a 3 hour game that is just about to be resolved, when you or your opponent loses his/her connection. And don't consider engineering a cheap way to attack, it's the only way anyone attacks... THe campaign is allright I guess, if you can stand the poor gameplay to get from cutscene to cutscene (Which aren't as good as Red Alerts were). .... Come on, you can't tell me NOD doesn't have a huge advantage over GDI. They do. Let's hope Kane bites the dust soon, before the C&C series turns as twisted as "The Forgotten".	-1
Getting this game would be a waste of time and money.  For halfthe price of this I'd rather get a game that offers better graphics,better realism, and better everything.  If you haven't already guessed it's Red Alert.  Even though it looks pretty good, after about a week you won't want to play it anymore.  With Red Alert I continually go back to try just one more strategy... I think they just sat down and set a deadline for this game and the guys making it waited until the last week to do it.  Right now all you need to do is type in the search box up there "Red Alert" and buy that game... You will have a way better game and not spend as much.	-1
Let me clear something up: This is by no means a bad game. It is decently enjoyable. However, the reason for the lower score is mostly due to my disappointment with this game. Everybody built it up as the "Best Mario Kart Game". However, my experience with it made it turn out to be my least favorite in the series. It doesn't play fantastic, the graphics are ok, and the game is fairly smooth. However, this game is far from deserving of the unreasonable prices and high praise it gets.	-1
I have the wii version and is HORRIBLE. JUST LIKE YOU HIT AN OPPONENT WITH A SHELL, PASS, AND WITH NO ITEM, THE CPU BOOSTS WAY AHAED. HORRIBLE	-1
If you like the story then get this. For me, multiplayer is where it counts and I have more fun with Rage Wars. FRAG TAG IS AWESOME!!	-1
Seriously, it's one of the worst games ever! Terrible graphics, especially compared to the PS Triple's, no voice acting, boring puzzles, and above all, it stars a little fruity fairy boy who wears green panties and never hits on any of the babes in this game. Plus why is the main villian black? That's racist!  For a good Zelda game, I recommend Link: The Faces of Evil, The Wand of Gamelon, or Zelda's Adventure.	-1
mario kart is not fun there is no secret characthers or secret places[i think]. I tried the game for an hour and was completly bored now i don't like racing games. The producers should have tried a little harder on this game i was completly unsatified.	-1
Miyamoto slacked off on this one. 1. This is certainly not the best game ever. Not even the best game on Nintendo 64. Super Mario 64, and Perfect Dark both stomp this game into submission. 2. This is not a role-playing game. Role-playing games have a lot of text and character involvement. This game has a script that is about two pages long, maybe less. What you say or do in this game really has no effect on the games out come. 3. This is not the best Zelda game. The Legend Of Zelda, Links Awakening, and A Link To The Past are all much better games, especially for their time. 4. This game is not 256 Mega Bytes. It is actually 256 Mega Bits, which is equal to 32 Mega Bytes. So sorry the game isn't nearly the size of a 650/700 Mega Byte CD-ROM. 5. The game has no replay value, I played through it once, then about a year later, I attempted playing through it again, I couldn't bare it, the game is just too boring. I played through Final Fantasy VII and VIII twice each, and those took alot longer than this to finish, they were both great both times through. I loved the good old Zelda games but this just doesn't deserve the Zelda name, lets just hope that Zelda on the Game Cube doesn't turn out the same way.	-1
I found Half-Life to be somewhat interesting, although it started to run thin by the ending levels. Not many of the levels were amazing, either. Just long hallways, small rooms, and an occasional elevator shaft that you  climb up. I like 3D games that let you be outside, looking over vast plains  of enemies and obstacles. Half-Life just didn't cut it in this  arena. Another thing that I found most disturbing was the extreme  gore/violence that is present throughout the game. When your science  project goes wrong, you walk out to find a scientist lying on the ground  with about 10 gallons of blood spread all over the walls and floor! Were  the programmers just trying to be sick here or what? When you reach the  levels in which you begin to fight the army grunts (who are the best  enemies), it gets even more grotesque. If you let off an entire clip of  bullets at one guy, expect to see a wall covered with blood. Sure, you can  turn it off, but it does very little good. The blood is still very  disturbing. This is one aspect of the game that is extremely unacceptable.  I am not a parent saying this, either, I'm a teenager. Aside from the  violence and lack of interesting levels, the game is pretty much void of  any lasting qualities. If you want a weekend of pure hell (both keeping you  stuck to your computer and grossing you out entirely) then buy this game.  Otherwise, don't bother.	-1
Horrible...game was broken	-1
Disc was scratched and won't play properly on my son's PS3.	-1
I have played this game before and it is very fun! That is why I came to Amazon to order myself another copy of the game so that I could go back in time and enjoy a classic game. However, I bought it from the seller "Warehouse Deals, Inc" and I did NOT get my game and there is no place for me to get in contact with them. Watch Out!	-1
I just wanna review out something no ones said yet.  If you still ever play this game, it is a great game, it's 5 stars, provided your into this sort of thing.  But recently when i played the playstation version, i noticed they jibbed out and didn't include certain things that the PC version and better version had.  First off - There is no train. The PC version has a fully working train that you can hijack and even put into reverse.. sure, it may be useless to crash into another train, but it was entertaining. The PS version doesnt have a train.. but yet, it has the tracks for it, so go figure that one out.  Next, lack of vehicles. The PC version doesnt have spots where cars just disapeer and it feels like your walking around a ghost town.  And something no one can say wouldnt be better... you can edit the PC version, not only can you put whatever car you want into the game by downloading a simple quick device them importing a car you can download or make yourself, but you can also change everything in the game with simmilar tools. You can not just add cars, you can add missions, put more cars into things, edit the exsisting map, or hell, make your own city from scratch.  When I play this game, i like to ride around in Knight Rider, or maybe the General Lee, try and eulude cops driving lambourghinis... gouranga!  Convinced the PC versions better? Makes you feel like the PSX you played was lacking, huh?	-1
To this very day I still cannot understand why everyone loves Tomb Raider so much. Aside from the odd improvement here and there, the games haven't changed vastly (I think Doom to Quake is vastly) at all. I find controlling Lara very clumsey, the 3rd person view not help. Plus, Lara does all the aiming so the satisfaction of blasting something's head off from a distance is non-existent. I found myself fart around half the time. Where's the fun in climbing up a rock face? I'm all for puzzles but I find these games boring and labourious. Oh, and Lara Croft is not fit because she's not real and if she was she'd fall forwards due to her massive mammaries. So stop ogling at your screen, you sad people!	-1
I was so happy when I got it but it turns out it was BROKEN! Do not buy instead of this by star fox 64 I'm dead serious	-1
Even when it first came out I tried out this game but could not get into it and I hate the n64 old style 3d graphics where the camera angle ends up getting you killed every five seconds, espessially in pits.  Of all the Mario games to date including the amazing Wii titles except for Super Mario Wii this has to be the worst Mario game for me since Mario Nes.  The graphics are terrible, the music is annoying and it's just boaring.	-1
I recently tried playing this game, and by this point, my N64 is lucky it didn't get chucked out the window. The first few passes through the first few stages were fine, and pretty fun, but the rest of the game ends up being one long, annoying, tedious, impossible, and frustrating chore.  To start off, the control just isn't good enough to pull off HALF the things you need to do in this game. There are instances where you must execute specific jumps to get you from point A to point B, but half the time, the controller is non-responsive. Especially when it comes to levels that put you high up, this usually means falling...over and OVER again!  To add to this annoyance is the fact that there are no check points. If a level requires you to go to the top of a mountain, and you spend half an hour just getting up there and then you fall, you have to climb the whole thing ALL OVER AGAIN! So if you're like me, and find your self wondering off cliffs every other try because of the awful camera work, you will be playing the same stages over and over with no payoff but one big headache!  Now let's talk about the camera. Throughout most of the game, I found my self fighting IT more than I fought Bowser. It's simply impossible to judge distances based on where the camera is facing at any given time. Pressing the C buttons will move it around, but you have to keep perfectly still in order to avoid suddenly gong sideways or backwards. If you are in a stage where there is a time limit or a complicated jump, this can be particularly fatal.  Adding to this frustration is the fact that it is incredibly easy to over or under jump! This wouldn't be as much of a problem if it weren't for all the levels which require you to get to "the top" of things. Again, if you fall once, that's it, you start all over again. If the game designers weren't going to give you any continue points in these levels, why-o-why did they make it SO FRIGGIN' EASY FOR YOU TO FALL!!!???  There are plenty of levels and stages in this game, and lots to do in all of them. But by the time I cleared one stage, I really questioned whether or not I wanted to even GO to the next. Finally, after reaching a mere 52 stars, my answer is no.  So that's my two cents on this game, I can't beat it, I don't want to beat it. I'd rather go to a Morrissey concert with Kathy Griffin as the opening act than try to play it again. It would me MUCH less annoying than this game!	-1
I'm pretty sick and tired of people calling Super Mario 64 a classic.  It's not.  Just because it's significant and influential in helping pave the way for future Mario titles doesn't mean Super Mario 64 is deserving of its classic status, or that it's any fun to actually play.  Super Mario Galaxy came along and pretty much improved every single aspect of Super Mario 64 so you basically no longer have to play this game other than to get a dated taste of mid 90's gaming history.  The only other possible reason someone would play Super Mario 64 is because they desperately seek open world exploration, and this is basically the only Mario platformer that can at least attempt to satisfy gamers with that particular appetite.  Not that I personally believe the game succeeds at the exploring aspect either.  The biggest problem is that so much of the land you explore consists of emptiness.  Oh sure you'll see trees, ramps, castles, buildings, enemies such as goombas, chain chomps, badly and laughably animated thwomps lifting up and slamming down, pokeys, rolling boulders, and other things that have become a trademark of the Mario series, but the amount of items to find and collect is *extremely* limited to coins (both yellow and red ones) and the occasional power-up that enables Mario to either fly (which admittedly is pretty fun) or obtain the incredibly boring metal cap that makes Mario invincible.  An alternative to the starman perhaps, with lousy side effects (Mario can't jump as high or far while wearing the metal cap).  When you're not experiencing the endless disappointment that is running across empty and boring lands and basically doing nothing but wasting time, you're jumping across a series of unspectacular and very ordinary-presented platforms over and *over* again.  This stuff seriously resembles a beginners course for developing platforms.  It's extremely basic game design.  The platforms are generic square-shaped tiles for you to jump across that quite often are all the same exact size.  It gets monotonous almost immediately.  Only unreasonable Nintendo fans would eat this stuff up, seriously.  Anybody else would obviously be able to detect flawed, repetitive gameplay.  The 2D Mario games move at such a swift pace that you don't even have time to stop and notice the platforms (unless you're an extremely slow gamer).  This is mainly because you don't have to stop and situate Mario a certain way for the purpose of making the perfect jump which is what severely ruins Super Mario 64's gameplay.  And don't EVEN say my skills are horrible when it's obvious through countless youtube videos that several gamers have the same exact issue.  While I'm by no means someone who cares about the best graphics available, you gotta admit the ones here have dated horrendously with embarrassing blocky shapes pretty much occupying most areas of the game.  The buildings, water and trees in particular are just awful for the eyes.  Nothing appealing whatsoever about any of the graphics- even the bright inviting colors don't lure me in but rather rub me the wrong way and force some of us older gamers to recall the unpleasant days of Mario Paint.  You have to collect 120 stars in order to complete the game 100% but guess what?  Many of the stars are flat out boring to collect due to being pathetically easy and basically being handed to you within minutes.  What kind of challenge is that?  The one where you have to swim around and open treasure chests in a certain order is baby-ish, and the one where you swim around collecting 8 predictably located red coins inside a basic building near the beginning of the game is offensive.  Or how about simply stomping a post into a ground to release a gate and thus, release the star?  Don't even *think* about mentioning the ones where you walk up to Toad and he simply hands you the star.  Granted, the game seems to always alternate easy star-collecting challenges with longer and more drawn out ones as a way to balance things out but that's the problem- the stars are either too easy or too long.  There is one star mission so awful it makes your inevitable death seem like something to anticipate- the one where you have to jump across a series of moving poles.  You have to jump at *just* the right moment while making sure you're positioned in the right spot.  This takes forever and is dreadfully annoying.  Also, what's up with all the little baby games?  Grab a baby penguin and slide down a snowy hill?  Chase the bunny so he doesn't hop away?  These are not suitable for anyone who recalls the challenging portions of previous 2D gaming such as Super Mario Bros. 3 or Super Mario World (and yes, these bunny grabbing missions are flaws in Super Mario Galaxy too, in case you think I'm intentionally favoring Super Mario Galaxy for no reason).  At least the cannon-shooting parts are cool.  It's fun figuring out where to launch Mario so he can land safely on upper grounds.  I can't help but feel the red star collecting is overrated.  When you collect red stars in Yoshi's Island, you feel like you're given a really elaborate and perfectly executed assignment since you also have to collect flowers and stars to 100% complete a stage.  It's a lot to do not to mention really darn exciting and satisfying once you've acquired all these items, and constantly keeps your attention span in check while searching for them.  Super Mario 64 basically takes that one red coin-collecting element of Yoshi's Island and makes it a main priority here.  You often have to collect 8 red coins per stage (opposed to 20 in Yoshi's Island) to obtain one of the 120 stars.  Ugh.  But nothing NOTHING is worse than the fact you have to re-enter stages over and over again just to grab all the stars that are located throughout.  To me this is unquestionably lazy game design.  How can it be anything else?  Who in their right mind would actually *want* to keep going back to the same exact stage ad nauseam?  Super Mario World was guilty of this too granted but not NEARLY to this exaggerated extent.  A terrible idea that gives a false impression a game has replay value but it's exactly the opposite- once you go through the same stage a bunch of times and finally accomplish everything there is to offer, you won't want to repeat these same objectives ever again.  So... you probably won't want to play Super Mario 64 ever again.  Even worse- when you often have to search for 100 coins to obtain a star.  This can take up to 20 minutes and bore you the entire time.  Being forced to collect 100 coins is a lazy way of assuring gamers don't leave any stone unturned because you basically have to thoroughly search every nook and cranny of a stage to even *find* 100 of them.  I also dislike how many of the classic enemies aren't included here such as the hammer brothers, buzzy beetles, bloopers, and cheep cheeps.  Even the koopa troopa is nowhere to be seen (well, other than that one race in the beginning).  You can ride a koopa shell like a skateboard but that doesn't count as an enemy appearance.  He's not a true enemy here.  Why is that?  Why not include all the familiar and well-loved enemies that have become a trademark to the Mario series?  They ruin the pirahna plants by the way.  Why is he sleeping?  Granted he comes alive when you get near, but it's a really weird concept.  At least Nintendo got the boos and haunted house right- a surprising and exciting maze-like high point of the game.  It's a lot of fun sorting through each room of the haunted house stages.  *That's* how you design a memorable stage.  Obviously if you weren't busy running around through several vast and average-designed empty fields of grass, there could have EASILY been room for the inclusion of more enemies.  Hey I'm all for open world exploration, but you have to actually fill in those areas with exciting, creative items that are both fun and rewarding to collect for the player, and enemies that present threatening encounters and a rush of excitement.  Simply throwing Mario into a big 3D world because it's his first grand 3D adventure truthfully isn't going to get the job done I'm afraid.  More needs to be done.  Constantly having to rearrange the camera so you can see where you're actually going is a nuisance.  Nobody likes dealing with a camera while jumping around trying to play a video game, but granted, several games back in the mid to late 90's were guilty of the same camera problems since developers were still getting their feet wet so to speak, and figuring out the best way to help players accurately and conveniently see what's ahead.  Still, you'll lose more than a few lives due to bad camera angles in Super Mario 64.  I guarantee it.  One thing I *do* like about this game is how fast Mario runs.  It's a fast-moving game, which helps going from point A to point B more convenient. Also some of the wall jumps and triple jumps are fun to execute.  Reminds me of Super Metroid in that respect.  Yoshi is teased in this game (I won't spoil how) but he's not actually playable which doesn't make sense.  Why make an appearance if he's not going to be playable?  The music is either extremely good (the brilliant peaceful moodiness of the water theme and the intimidating and exciting heavy metal-like Bowser fights) or downright horrendous (everything else, which consists of annoying nursery rhyme children's themes inappropriate and painfully skull-smashing for the rest of us).  I can't STAND the theme songs that play in Whomp's Fortress and Rainbow Ride- two unforgivable themes that make me want to smash my brains in whenever I play Super Mario Galaxy 2 where they return in all their overbearingly annoying glory.  Rainbow Ride in particular reminds me of a county hayride where kids ride around on tractors (not to mention the stage itself is extremely tedious and overlong).  The snowy mountain stage with the Italian accordion music is sickening and out of place.  Just mute the volume on your TV to make life easier for yourself.  The boss fights are incredibly simplistic- grab Bowser's tail, spin him around and toss him, or pick up/stomp other bosses.  Basic, boring stuff.  A few stages that are actually fun include Lethal Lava Land where the platforms convincingly feel like an upgrade into the 3D world from the original Super Mario Bros. castle levels (not to mention better/more interesting use of platform jumping compared to the rest of the levels in SM64), Shifting Sand Land since it's packed with obstacles and enemies (and reasonably challenging overall), and Tall Tall Mountain's tricky climb to the top (involving a vine climbing portion).  In fact, to be fair, Tall Tall Mountain is one of the best levels ever in a 3D Mario game.  It's *that* good.  Bowser's castle levels are pretty solid as well, mostly due to the fast-paced nature of them.  Several things feel tacky- the 1-ups and coins are small, dark, ugly looking, and clumsily made due to less than spectacular graphics and game design, and overall Super Mario 64 is just a really lackluster and highly overrated game.  If not for influence, this game would have been forgotten and the superior Super Mario Galaxy series would have prevailed even more dominantly than they already do.  Oh and don't even mention the cake-eating storyline.  It's atrocious.  The fact they brought it back for the Galaxy series makes me want to vomit.	-1
Let me just say that i think mario 64 is a okay game as far as gameplay and graphics goes but, every level get's harder and harder it's so hard it would take you months to beat it and by the time you do you would be white as a sheet from staying inside all the time and 50% of your muscles would atrophy. also the ending really sucks it ends by princess toadstool saying let's make a cake for mario then it's over so don't waste your time with this game.	-1
Before I start, let me explain that I'm writing this review from the standpoint of an occasonal video gamer, namely, me. This review probably would not hold true for hardcore/professional video gamers.  I have played all of the classic Mario Bros games, and loved them all, except for this one. For one reason, and one one reason only. For the casual gamer, controlling Mario in a precise manner is an exercise in futility. If you only play your games a couple of hours a week like me, if you are not a "pro," the human language cannot describe just how much this game will frustrate you. I mean it, the control is HORRIBLE.  For those of you over the age of 21, try to imagine this: You're very very drunk, and trying to walk down an ice covered slope. That would be EASIER than controlling Mario in this game, in places where it matters the most, precise maneuvering in tight spots. You can't use the control pad at all, just the joystick.  With all of the brilliant minds working for Nintendo, I would think that they could have developed a better way to control the character through the use of the control pad.  Another thing. If you are prone to car-sickness or other types of motion induced illness, you can't play this game for more than 30 minutes at a time. Believe me, I'm not stretching the truth. I served 10 years in the USAF, and did alot of flying during those years, so I'm not exactly the "weak stomach" type.  Would I recommend buying this game? By all means, yes, if you are a hardcore player. The graphics are pretty cool and have a definite charm. For all you pros out there, I would agree with a 4 or 5 star rating for this game.  For the occasional gamer like me, I would recommend renting it before buying it. Your experience may or may not be as bad as mine..........	-1
I love Sim. games very much but I did not like this Sim. game.  After I would have my little city all set up I would need to watch it like a hawk leaving me with almost no time to expand and improve on my little city.  I have been told to give this game another try but I just can not find a reason to go back and try this game again.	-1
I started my first succesful city (w/o a starter city) and it was great! Then, after about two hours of gameplay, MY 855,500 pop. city had a problem with people. It must have, because in less than 20 minuets, My city was reduced to about 250,000 pop. Get this IT WAS FOR NO APPARENT REASON. My popularity was high, all of the ordenances I could have had were activated, all buildings had water and power, I had full funding to schools, firestations, police, ect., police and fire coverage were excelant, taxes were only at 3 for everything (Ind., Com., and Res.), and everything else you could think of, I had it. It was the perfect city and my whole population (who still liked by the way) left the city. If you have a good reason for it , I'd say it was a glitch in the game. Don't get me wrong, it is a fun game when there is a reason to the sudden drops, but I don't think you can have a real good city that lasts for more than four or five hours and there is no good city, they'll all die out eventually. The only option you have is LOSS. I am hoping that SC 4000 will be MUCH better.	-1
I'll admit right now that I hate all of the Simcities that came out, with the exception of the Super Nintendo version of the first Simcity.  I'm more of an action person, not a sit-back-and-watch-my-city-grow person.  Sure,  Simcity 3000 is good for a while with it's catchy graphics and innovative  approach to buidling a city, but a few hours later, you'll either want to  fall asleep or put your fist through the monitor, depending upon whether  the income for your city is positive or negative for each game year.  I  turned out to be one of the latter people.  No matter how hard I tried, I  could never get the income to come out positive.  So, I did what any  distraught and stuck person would do...go online for cheat codes!  An hour  later, I was bored.  If you're a thinker, by all means try Simcity 3000  out.  But, if you're a person that thinks actions speak louder than words,  try Dungeon Keeper 2, a game like Simcity 3000, but not as complex (and  more active!).	-1
game came on time and works. This game is pretty bad in my opinion I would stick to the 2d whipping action if your looking for fun. You choose from 2 pretty lame characters, camera angles are no good and the gameplay it's self is not great. Get this game to add to your collection but other then that this game is a waste of energy.	-1
Konami took a bold step into 3-D with this Castlevania installment for the 64.  Unfortunately, it didn't live up to expectations, which part of it is because it wasn't the same people (believe it or not) that did Symphony of the Night (PSX).  Read on to see why it's a below average game: THE GOOD Finally, Castlevania in 3-D!  Despite many shortcomings, the game does have some eerie music and a dark atmosphere, which are characteristic of a Castlevania game (at least the newer releases).  You can select between two characters (Carrie and Reinhart) that change the storyline somewhat. THE BAD I was never a fan of the 64 controller and this is the one game where it hurt most.  The controls and gameplay were difficult at best, and normally I have a decent tolerance level for controls; Here's where I absolutely loathed it.  Getting your character to go where you want is quite a challenge for this game.  Also, the storyline, aside from the two characters' different (yet similar) paths, is really hollow at its core and doesn't add anything new to the Castlevania legacy. OVERALL Not recommended.  I advise renting the game only.  ONLY BUY IT IF YOU ARE A DIE-HARD N64 FAN.  Otherwise, I strongly recommend skipping it.  I'm a big Castlevania fan and I feel that this game does not do the series justice.  I noticed some people in their reviews that they liked this game over Bloodlines (Genesis); Why?!  Bloodlines had far better gameplay and replay value than this!  Perhaps it's because 90% of gamers today prefer graphics over gameplay, when it's GAMEPLAY that creates the game.	-1
Overall, it's a pretty good game. 1 star taken off because it does not feature the original soundtrack, and because of this many levels are silent or have different music. another star taken off because of load times, the graphics, lag (come on, no amount of enemies should make a game like this lag), and the censoring of some levels. Also, no 2-player Co-op, only online which is stupid. If you simply MUST have it on PSX then you'll enjoy it, if not then just buy the PC version.	-1
This is a futuristic dirt bike game, where rather than riding dirt bikes, you ride a jet-powered motorcycle. The game starts out being fun racing along exotic 3D courses like a jungle island, an earthquake rattled Los Angeles that has fallen into the sea, a cold mountain passageway and so on. When the player advances past the first few races the game stops being fun and starts getting unnecessarily and frustratingly difficult, because rather than having track borders (like walls) where the racer cannot go past a certain point, the courses further in the game take away those walls so you literally fall off the track. It is also unclear where the finish line is, sometimes you must do a lap around a circular track, and other times you must do a U turn then go back through the track. Then reappear on the track, far behind the other racers. The game is full of jumps, ridiculously high jumps, and while you are in the air you can do flips and tricks. Not any advanced tricks like from Tony Hawk. There are several racers, however the racers are so uneven that you can pick a certain racer and win constantly.	-1
I wanted to get another doom game because I have a friend who won't give it back so I ordered another 1 and it does not play	-1
The game is okay, well... it is bad. Too arcade for my taste, I owned it when I was 8 years old and it was not even fun for me at that age. The wrestlers move to quickly, the moves are stupid and the game itself is dull after 5 matches.	-1
Without a doubt one of the worst games I've ever played. There is no creativity or excitement, nothing that makes you want to play more. You fight the same, boring enemies over and over in large numbers. All they do is bum rush you or occasionally throw a snowball. The AI in this game is a complete joke. Music is horribly forgettable, overall sound is okay. Graphics are bland and level designs look like they all were developed and programmed in a weekend. Each main character has a bit of in-game dialogue, and it quickly becomes repetitive and stale. AND DO NOT GET ME STARTED ON HOW ANNOYING THE TURKEY SOUNDS ARE.  Once you peel away the South Park appeal, there is very little left to stand on its own. I endured playing this for maybe 20 minutes before shutting it off out of extreme boredom. I can see why nobody ever talks about this game. Let's leave it that way.	-1
This Game Isn't Very Exciting. I Don't Like This Game. It's Boring .What You Do In This Game Is Try To Go Through Boring Levels That Don't Look Very Detailed. I Warn You. You Won't Like This Game. I Warn You. Don't Pick This Up. This Game Is Really Old  And Just Such A Bad Game .	-1
Making South Park into a first person shooter isn't a horrible idea, it's just horribly executed.  I imagine Acclaim bid on the South Park contract so quickly, they didn't bother to come up with any good gaming ideas it could go with.  I would also be hard pressed to do so.  ...	-1
I only gave this game 2 stars because if you're die-hard South Park fan, it's possible that you might enjoy this game... but I like South Park, and I HATED it. The controls are IMPOSSIBLE to use (you have to use the C buttons most of the time), the gameplay is repetitive and boring (all you do is walk around throwing snowballs at turkeys), and the multiplayer part is boring too. One pro is that the guns are pretty original & the South Park kids say some funny things, but the novelty wears off after a while. I bought this game when it first came out, for ..., and I sold it for $5 at a stoop sale... I just wanted to get rid of it, it's really that bad. If you really have to get it, at least rent it first.	-1
This game was very poorly made...it's really boring, because all you do is walk around and throw stuff at things. All the enemies are exactly the same, there's never any health, and 100 health points aren't enough, because the health goes down too fast. The sight of range is ridiculous because half the screen is nothing but fog, and it all just draws in as you walk ahead, making it hard to see enemies. I do like seeing the familiar South Park characters in 3D, the game is very funny, and the weapons are hilarious! But still, I wouldn't buy it. Rent at most.	-1
Who in their right mind thought using up on the D-pad for accelerate was a good idea? Little things like this absolutely take all the fun out of the game. The vehicles move around like they're on a tightrope trying not to lose control and cornering and braking are deplorable and is a complete mess. Graphics hardly mean anything to me, but man does this game look harsh, probably the worst for the PS1, even for its time. This game hasn't aged well at all. It has almost put me off on trying the sequels, but I hear they get better. I tried, I really did, but it's way too short and the controller quirks along with the vehicle mechanics make this game almost a chore to play today.	-1
Ordered Twisted Metal #1, which is what the artwork and title suggests, developed by SingleTrack.  Instead, received Twisted Metal 3 which was developed by 989 Studios and is of inferior quality.  Although I am happy to have received anything at all, it was not the correct item.	-1
First of all, the graphics suck. The characters suck. Everything sucks in this one. My brother paid ten dollars for this game. I wouldn't of paid a penny. Rent it if you dare. Terrible game.	-1
this game is very boring there are around 30 wrestlers but only ten of them are real wrestlers you can only punce kick and do the signiture move  its not worth it at all	-1
I don't get why so many people rate this a high game. There's nothing special about it at all. I got this game awhile back and thought it was pretty lame so the game went into retirement, until I decided to pull it out for the first time in many many years and play it and my thoughts remain the same.  For WCW's first video game made during the Monday Night Wars, this was pretty terrible. For starters, this is more of an arcade type of video game then a game you'd expect. The game came out in 1997, yet looks and feels like it was made in 1990, transferred to Playstation discs and called a video game.  WCW vs The World was developed and published by Japanese companies, Asmik Ace Entertainment and The Man Breeze, which would probably explain why there are only 13 WCW wrestlers in the game, while the rest of the roster is fictional Japanese wrestlers. That's right folks. Only 13 WCW wrestlers, while the rest are made-up Japanese wrestlers that have never even remotely been heard of. It's kind of a waste of a game if you're not going to include all of the WCW roster and have a bunch of created wrestlers take up space.  The only arenas you can play in are house show like arenas. There's a WCW house show like arena and the rest are Japanese arenas. To add on to the Japanese theme in this game, there's cheesy music that loops throughout the matches that sounds like it would've been acceptable in a 1980s Japanese action movie. There are 7 different modes you can play in this game that are: League Challenge, Best of Seven, Exhibition Match, Elimination Match, Tournament, League Match, and Double Title Match.  It goes without saying that the move-sets in this game are also very limited. Each wrestler only has about 6 to 7 different moves for you to use until you begin getting bored. Ultimately, once you've played one match, you've played them all. Overall, this game is just horrible. It gets boring within the first 10 minutes before you want to cut it off. A similar WCW game, made and published by the same company would come out later that year; WCW vs NWO: World Tour for the Nintendo 64. It was slightly better than vs The World, but that's not saying much.  Basically if you want to play a better WCW game than vs The World for Playstation, buy Thunder, Nitro, Mayhem, or Backstage Assault. Nitro and Backstage Assault weren't all that good but any following WCW game is 1000x more fun to play than this abomination that is WCW vs The World	-1
I get it, it was one of the first games from PS1 but sincerely, this game is horrible. Looking back on it, the gameplay is stale, the graphics look okay, the action and moves are lame. Miracle is that this game didn't get bashed as it could have been.	-1
TM 4 is better, seeing as you can access all bosses and play as one of them	-1
Cannot get it to work on my son's PS3.	-1
The Good: Decent story, tons of gore, great graphics and audio, new features are neat  The Bad: Abysmal combat, terrible control, extremely slow pace, laughable voice acting  I tried so hard to love RE1 and look beyond its major flaws. Flaws such as the abysmal combat system. You can't aim at anything! The tank controls don't help either so you always end up dying CONSTANTLY, and with a lack of health and ammo you'll toss your PS1/PS2/PS3/PSP out the window. The other flaw is the level design. Everything is so confusing and it's so easy to get lost. The map doesn't help one bit because all it does is highlight the hallway that you are in red and you have to decipher what doors go where.  Another thing that doesn't help is the game's pace...it's sooooooo slow! When you open a door or walk up stairs the animations talk forever to finish, menu are slow, text is not skippable. Another flaw is the laughable and hideous voice acting. They actors sound like they're fresh out of remedial drama, while the live action cut scenes are just as bad. The only good part about RE is the story, enemies, and the amount of gore there is. While DC offers vibration, uncensorship, and a few game play tweaks it's not worth it. RE4 was my first RE and going back to this is just awful. If you haven't played RE1 you're not missing much at all.	-1
What you see in photo is dust, totally disappointed when opened the case and see the disk unclean in that way	-1
Disc was scratched and won't play properly on my son's PS3.	-1
Compare this to super mario, crash bandicoot and dark souls, this game looks too easy and boring. The bosses are a joke. A laughing stock next to crash, the levels prove to be a bigger challenge with enemies and hidden gems. The graphics and music are terrible too. Id say forget the first three and star with: enter the dragonfly and legend series	-1
It was a good game. Played it at someone's house and when I got a PS I had to get it. How times change.	-1
On hog ride. People has misplaced faces and they look like they took drugs. This game sucked. :) Sonic is better!!!	-1
I don't think this game is good it is I beat the game before and it was ruined for me the levels were empty feeling it was a crappy game I like about this game is the animals and the graphics. The Gnasty Gnorc boss fight was more like a chase instead of destruction I think this is a touch of old flights and bad name levels who could name a boss called Blowhard? I give this an above average 2 stars out of 5	-1
If you like orange bandicoots and video games, then get Crash Bandicoot, the stuff of dreams and legends. "I am N.Gin you FOOL! Face my destructive robots!" That is my fave quote. If you hop on the 'shrooms right before the end o' the 2nd snow bear level and go to the central one, you shall find none other but a secret tele-port. You will go to an unknown warp room that makes no sense. Congrats.	-1
Ok, here are the reasons this game is BAD!.   1. The graphics aren't very good and plus most of the levels look alike.   2. It's frustrating, and there are millions of ways to die in one level.   3. You'll wish you never had this game.   4. Most of it doesn't make any sense and it's un-imaginative.   There.  Are those good enough reasons NOT to get this game? Don't get it.	-1
Wasn't the very first Crash Bandicoot game supposed to become one of the all-time greatest Playstation games?  That's what Sony thought would happen back in the day.  After all, they promoted the game to death.  Well look at that... didn't happen!  And with good reason.  The game is horrible.  I can't believe ANYONE would prefer this junk over Sonic the Hedgehog or, especially, the Mario Bros. series.  You have to give Sony a LOT of credit for all the attention they put into Crash Bandicoot in an attempt to put the game on the same extraordinary level as Mario and Sonic, but gamers never really caught on to Crash the same way.  When you think about it, the Playstation already HAD a huge selection of games to choose from around the time Crash was released, therefore Sony didn't even NEED a mascot.  People were buying Playstation games like crazy anyway!  Crash Bandicoot never even had to exist.  You'd think for a debut game (a BIG debut, considering all the advertisements on TV commercials) Sony would have made the game a *little* easier for younger or inexperienced gamers to play.  Instead, Sony started off the Crash series with impossible bonus levels (impossible to complete AND find- I didn't even KNOW the game had bonus levels until I looked it up in the instruction booklet!)  Even if you ignore the bonus levels, the challenge overall is pretty high anyway thanks to all the difficult stages (such as the one where you're crossing a bridge way up in the sky and continue falling through the wooden cracks- a NIGHTMARE of a level!)  All the lives you earned up to this point in the game will go away.  A mascot debut game shouldn't have the difficulty THIS high because the idea is for players of ALL ages to enjoy the game.  Children will not like the nonstop frustration.  I think the biggest reason Crash Bandicoot isn't remembered today the same way Mario and Sonic's debut games are is because Crash is basically just a blend of Mario and Sonic, but featured in a 3D world.  Think about it.  Crash collects berries throughout the game (Mario collects coins, Sonic collects rings).  Crash has a spin attack (Mario and Sonic already had spin attacks YEARS before Crash's existence).  Sony just didn't have enough creative ideas to come up with something entirely different, and that's why most gamers tend to ignore Crash Bandicoot.  When you already have the best (Mario and Sonic) you don't need imitations.  Crash Bandicoot may have improved later on (not enough of an improvement to earn its mascot reputation, however) but the series certainly did NOT start with a bang.  I will always remember the very first Crash Bandicoot game as being this uninteresting, frustrating experience.  Heck, just the fact that only 62 reviewers have submitted reviews for the game right here on amazon goes to show Crash Bandicoot's first adventure was meant to be gone and forgotten.  Add to the fact that right now in the year 2006 NO ONE is talking about ANY Crash Bandicoot game anymore.  This means you can ignore Crash Bandicoot entirely, and not really miss out on anything.	-1
Augh! I found the first few levels of Crash 1 harder than the 3rd world levels Crash 2 and 3. It also uses a system of having to pass one level to get to the next. This becomes frustrating because I found myself having to repeat the same level over and over again because I either died or... hell, I don't know. I just had to repeat the level because it wouldn't let me continue. Also, there is no giant screen where you can save. You have to find the bonus platform, and make it all the way through the bonus part to save. Happen to fall through the cracks on the bonus? Sorry! You're just going to have to hope you don't die or else you'll have to repeat EVERYTHING. OVER. AGAIN. A little kid is going to get frustrated and give up on this game if you get it for him. Be nice to your children. Buy them Crash 2. Or 3. Or games from the Spyro series, that would work too. If you really really want to play all the games in the Crash series just rent it.. even though it's dirt cheap to buy.. (haha) Put the money towards something BETTER.	-1
this game is pretty bad first off all you can do is run strait the only good thing about is its pretty long the other bad thing is its to hard and it gets boring i wouldnt buy this game if you want a crash bandicoot game get either 2,3,4.	-1
I got this game  a week ago.  When I first saw this game I thought I was going to like it.  When I popped the c.d in the playstation It was so darn frustrating to control croc.  I only went to the dessert world.  When I was in the ice world I kept losing cuz u go a long way just to get a key to save a freakin gobbo.  Croc for game boy color is much better than the one for playstation.  If u r looking for a really good cute, funny, fun, interesting game get Gex: Enter the gecko.  What I am tring to tell u is that DON'T GET THIS GAME EVER.	-1
Naughty Dog and Sony released Crash Bandicoot, which rivaled the likes of Mario and Sonic. In the end, many gamers liked Crash's non-stop action, but others simply just skipped it. Even though it was very promising, Crash's gameplay did not really offer anything new, which featured elements you can find in a 16-bit platformer.  You play as Crash, whose girlfriend is kidnapped by Dr. Neo Cortex. You basically just run through the levels from start to finish and fight bosses after each world. Even though the action is intense throughout, the gameplay becomes really tedious. Crash Bandicoot did nothing new for adventure games and it isn't really 3D since you're restricted to one path. All you do is make your way through levels, dodging obstacles, avoiding enemies, and collect items and nothing more. The difficulty level is not exactly high either, and the challenge is severely lacking.  Crash's graphics are quite impressive for a PlayStation game, including well-textured environments and colorful characters. Effects like running water and mist and fog are great eye-candy. The visuals are the game's only saving grace. Controlling the bandicoot can be a hassle since it doesn't use analog. You're forced to deal with sensitivity of the crosspad and at times will result in unwanted deaths.  Aside from good graphics, you're left with nothing but an average platformer equivalent to that of a 16-bit Sonic game in a polygonal world. While it may be 3D, Crash plays out too much like an old side-scrolling game of the past. I don't know why would anyone want to play this game because Crash Bandicoot pales in comparison to other breakthrough adventure games at the time, like Sega's NiGHTS and Nintendo's Mario 64.	-1
I really, really wanted to like this game, I loved the cover, and I loved the characters, and the personality of the protagonist, but the controls are not very good at all. When you push the analog stick back, the character just turns around and moves all over the place, and jumping on platforms is painful to say the least. I would have liked this game if the controls were not so finicky, but it did extremely poorly in that department. If the controls were bearable, I would have actually enjoyed the game.	-1
Everytimes we loaded the game it would play for maybe 5 mins and then would keep freezing and not play and my gaming system is not messed up I cant return the game I threw away the bag I wish companies would test their damn games before selling them disapointed.	-1
Croc: Legend of the Gobbos for the PlayStation should be a very fun game but some key things make it anything but.  Plot: The evil Baron Dante invades the peace loving Gobbo Island the crocodile name Croc tries to save the day by stopping the evil Baron Dante. 8/10  The plot is a high point in this game as a lot of games have bad stories  Sound: This game has a high quality soundtrack and great sound effects. 9/10  Gameplay: to control croc is the bad point, the game bad controls make this game bad enough to skip. 3/10  Overall: This game is OK, but could have been A LOT better. with its cute and cuddly characters to the beautiful islands This game could have been one of the best and well know PlayStation games, BUT, it is only half that. Oh Nostalgia. You betray me again. 6.6 but for GameSpot's score system 6.5/10	-1
Unless you still have a PS 1 and like it, the game sucks. Bought it for my Son(5) and playing it on a PS2. It's very anoying to have only the option to use U/D/L/R to moove in the game. No joistick(L3) use at all. It may be a very nice Game but the controller use make it suck. Comon, we are in 2011. It may be my bad do not know more about PS1 use, still, if I had read a review about that I wouldnt had bought the game. My Son played TY2 all the way trought with some help of me. We are not big gamers but like jump n' run games. So, please be aware of the controller use limit. The game will en up in the corner. Very sad, shipping and the item it self where very good. Hope the TY1 is better(is in the Mail). LOL, yes, lots of old games but my son is 5, so let him scratch or kill the game on accitent, same as the PS2, it's not a big Deal. But for now it helps him to learn to handle games and take care of stuff. And the games are cheap, since some PPL always think they have to have the Newest. Thanks to those, like this we have fun for less. Sincerely, -M.	-1
There's a lot of hype surrounding the Resident Evil series of games. They're on most systems, there are books, and even a movie. The story is a good one, but I found the game to not be so great. Graphics are alright, the sound is bad though. And game play is horrible. Trying to move around is difficult and can be confusing, especially when you're under attack and things are chaotic. The characters move unlike most games. You don't go in the direction of the D-pad, rather you turn with right and left direction and move with a button. It was poorly designed. But since the Playstation 2 is out, and better games as well as more Resident Evil, there's no reason to pick up this game anymore. The 2-disc set here is one adventure with a male character and another with a female. The game is involved, just not as much fun as it shoud be	-1
I think it's too late to give a review on this game, but here goes. This is the most perverted game ever made. When you think about it, it's pretty disgusting. "Aim for the open spot!", "I'll do you fast, Peppy old pal.", "Fox, get this guy off me!" "I've got a present for ya!" EEEEEEEEEUUU! Should kids be playing these games? Anyway, the gameplay is fun...for 15 minutes. Then it's bothersome, annoying, and dull. Your team mates have the worst A.I. ever, and they don't get power-ups. The game is horribly easy and WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYY too short. Like, 30 minutes short. Also, the voice acting sucks. I hope Starfox Adventures will be good. This game shouldn't have started the whole Starfox thing. If so, it needed work.	-1
If you are new to Mario party games, check out number 2 or 3. This is fun to begin with but when you keep playing the same mini-games it gets a little boring. We rented this and and liked the concept but didn't enjoy it much but when Mario Party 2 came out and it stated it had more mini-games we bought that one and we really enjoyed it. We can't wait to get the 3rd one. No matter what game you go with expect to play for atleast an hour.	-1
This game is horrible. First, I bought this video "game" because I thought it was fun. Well in wasn't. 1st, the graphics are poor. 2nd the computer's difficulty level is so hard. If you play with one, two, or three people, you always lose. The computer is WAY more expirenced than a human will ever be, and it just degrades from the fun factor. So ignore the reviews that say it is so great. They are overexxagerating. My 8-year-old brother got bored with it in 3 hours.	-1
Although there are video games out there that can wow you, and then there are the duds. Not all racing games seem to be the best behind the wheel. In the case of a video game coming based from an arcade version, it really seems to be alright, but looks are always decieving. In the case of Nintendo 64, there are very few racing games that really can make it behind the wheel. This isn't really one of them. The 1996 Crus'n U.S.A. game for Nintendo 64, seems to be a real miss behind the real wheel. The graphics are very strong, but you are limited down to a certain number of cars to choose from, which is seven, not like the more than dozen that there are in the arcade game. Although the courses seem to be within detail, there are so many flaws, including th frame rate and the style of the game, especially within the tunnels of place like Washington D.C. Nevertheless, the game seem to be a little down and out, but at the time it came out for Nintendo 64, it was one of only two video racing games for the Nintendo 64. It is kind of dissapointing that they couldn't try to make some better video games with racing at the time, but there are so many better choices to the Nintendo 64. If you're really into the racing feel of the Nintendo 64, I suggest you either get Mario Kart 64, Rush 2, or the sequel to Crus'n U.S.A. : Crus'n World.	-1
The game looks fine, but it doesn't work.	-1
Who created this game and why? I get the concept and it's a really good one. Then why did I give it one star? This game is created for people who find Call of Duty and Halo so easy they get bored and refuse to play them. The mini-games must be beaten absolutely flawlessly or you don't get any points whatsoever. Sometimes you even lose points for not absolutely mastering the mini-game. If you're 99% perfect, sorry no points. The biggest flaw in this game is that it has to be four players. If you don't have four players then the computer will take over the rest. Be warned, the computer always wins every single mini game. There's a choice for computer skill...easy, normal, or hard...huh? What is hard skill? Does that mean the game is hard for the computer player or the computer player is hard for you to beat? No explanation whatsoever. But, it does not matter, Ive tried all three settings multiple times and it makes no difference in the computer's amazing flawless skill at mastering the game. The point of the game is to get 20 coins, by absolutely mastering the mini-games as flawlessly as inhumanly possible, then randomly landing on the space where Toad is selling stars for 20 coins. Watch out, there's also a space where, if they have 50 coins, other players can steal your star. They should call this game Star Stealers. The only real trick to the game is to be the one who lands on the star stealing spot the most times...and thus steal everyone else's stars. There's no friendly competition here...it's all about bing underhanded. If you don't have 50 coins to steal a star you can, for zero coins, steal coins from other players. this game always leads to everyone ganging up on the player who is doing the best. There's no skill involved to winning the game over all because it's all about who's lucky enough to land on the star stealing spot the most times. One turn your in first place and the next your in fourth, but when you're in fourth you're stuck. Whoever happens to have the most stars when the game ends wins the game no matter how poorly you played the game. Oh, and don't forget they the shortest version of the game takes 45 minutes minimum. The longest version takes 3+ hours. Ridiculous and frustrating to no end. Its a game that takes a minimal of an hour to lose. No thank you! You should try Chef's Luv Shack, it's based on the same concept but you can actually win the mini-games once in a while.	-1
This game doesn't work,I bought it used...it was packaged very well though...We have a very upset son here....I am letting you know so that you can test the games before you send them to other people...	-1
At first I didn't like this game, then I got into it. It's like an electic boardgame. The one thing I hate is playing against the consol. Always play with four real people.	-1
...in more ways than one.  Besides the overall poor quality of the game, there was that camera!  Honestly, whoever designed that thing needs to be smacked with a wet fish. I played levels 1 through 10, and then had to stop just before the end of the game because I was nauseated and had an eyestrain headache.  I am not exaggerating. The camera has a tendency to swirl around when you need it to stay still, and to sit still when you need it to move.  The grainy, pixelated graphics and complete lack of distinguishing features in the levels make it not only very easy to get lost, but also very hard on the eyes.  When you need to jump across platforms or walk AROUND something, that's when things really get bad.  Flik leaves almost no shadow on the ground when he jumps, so your jumps will usually be blind leaps of faith.  The other problem is his feet.  He dangles his feet so low when he jumps, that 9 times out of 10 you will miss a platform because his feet won't plant on it.  And, when he does land, he won't stop running, which will send him promptly stepping right off the other end of the thing and forcing you to do the jump all over again. The other problem is the camera angles when walking around something.  When you walk around to the other side of a large object, for some idiotic reason, the camera does not follow you.  As a result, you are sitting there with your entire screen filled in by this object while you can't see Flik on the other side.  Now, as if that situation is not bad enough, picture yourself having to do a platform jump while your view of Flik is completely blocked by a large rock on the screen, or being hit by an enemy that you can't see because the camera won't move.  Instead of turning with you, you must stop for about 5 seconds after turning to allow the camera to "catch up."  At the same time, the camera has a tendency to turn even while you're just running straight ahead in a single direction, which results in you being completely reversed.  It's completely disorienting, and with the bland, nearly identical levels, you can find yourself lost and irritated very frequently. It's all fun and games, until you've developed a tension headache trying to look at the bad graphics and camera angles, and flung your controller across the room because you just don't feel like attempting that same jump for the 89th time.  Please, stay away from this one.  Don't become an accomplice to anymore game companies trying to cash in on a movie franchise.	-1
Well, what do we have here folks?  A bad movie tie in game?  Well, what else is new?  A Bugs life for the Playstation is a almost universally hated game.  I really didint know what to expect when I first fired it up to try it out.  Did I like it?  Not a whole lot.  You start the game where you must get to your anthill.  You start walking around, getting used to playing, listining to Flick talking, following Dot, and killing evil bugs.  In a few minutes however, you start to realize something.  Flick will not be quiet.  He keeps going on and on and on and on and on and on and on with his annoying comments.  You finish the level and go on to the next level and keep up this pattern untill the end of the game.    Up untill then, if you haven't tried to get all the little goodies, you will have had a fun time.  But when you play again to try and get all the secrets, the trouble really begins.  For instance, to unlock a movie clip, you must collect all the letters of your name, collect 50 grain kernals, and kill all the bad bugs.  Sounds simple right?  Dont be an idiot.  getting all the grain pices is fairley hard but manigable.  Getting your name is really tough.  In one area you will see the letter F for F-L-I-C-K  To get it, you have to get a tall stalk.  To get the tall stalk, you must collect green tokens scattered throughout the level to power up the stalk power.  After collecting all the tokens, some of which are guarded by really tough bad bugs and others that are placed where you have to use another bug power to get it, you can finially reach the letter...once you get a seed.  Which is located a mile away from the letter.  You have to get the seed and take it to the letter, all the while getting attacked by bad bugs and listining to Flicks annoying commentary.  Once you get the stalk, put it in place and break it open, climb the stalk and get the letter.  Wasent that fun kids!  And you have to do that for EVERY SINGLE LETTER!!!! And don't forget that you have to kill all the bad bugs.  To do that you have to get the tokens for berry power, which are located throughout the level.  However some of them are located out of reach, and you can only reach them by getting a tall plant to help you out.  To do that, you must collect green tokens and get seeds to help you out and yada yada yada yada blah blah blah.    Get the idea of how frustrating this game can be?  And along with all that, Flick does not shut up, he keeps saying something every 10 seconds.  Along with all these problems, you have to deal with bad graphics, a annoying camera and some really HARD token collecting levels later on in the game (Such as the tree level)  A bugs life does have a few nice points.  Some of the levels are neat, such as the boss battles.  The final battle with Hopper at the end of the game is very cool.  The music is by far the best part of the game, almost all of the tunes are very memorable and addictive.  But beyond that, the things that try to enable replay value almost destroy the game.  Rent before you buy.  Did I mention that Flick never shuts up?  The good: Some neat levels cool boss battles excelent music the final level  The bad: none  and the Ugly: Horrible graphics, abysmal gameplay, Token collecting is impossibly hard, annoying levels, Frustrating ennimies and FLICK DOES NOT SHUT UP!!!	-1
This game had the potential to be great, but the controls were very difficult to maneuver with, as your thumbs will become very sore after trying to move your character with the D-pad for however long you play the game. If you can find yourself a specialized D-Pad for fighting games, or one that can override the Dualshock analog limitations, than you just may be good to go, but you can easily take a lot of damage, and you can't save anywhere like you would be able to if you played any of the Doom games, or Quake. If you want something that will scare the jeepers out of you, then go ahead and play this, but if you want a comfortable game with horror elements, I think you are better off playing Doom 3, Silent Hill, the original Quake or Resident Evil 1-3. These are my two cents.	-1
The product arrived in its original case with game booklet. The case was cracked and the CD had minor scratches on it. The gameplay controls are very confusing and difficult. It takes some getting used to. The image was very dark, not sure if it was my TV but no other games have ever had this problem. The in-game options did not have and actual brightness setting to help me with this. The sound during gameplay will randomly crackle and or stop all together. Overall i was not happy with the game itself. I had no problems with the provider or the arrival of the product.	-1
I bought this game back in December. I played it for about 2 solid hours. I come to realize that this is it. All the same levels are like this. So boring and so not like the movies, and the movement and the weapons in this game are terrible. Not to mention the animation of the Aliens, they look like they are break dancing or having an upright seizure, moving back and forth like a tiger pacing in a cage. The alien creatures are so predictable in this game, and not the least bit scary. The parasites things that crawl on the ceiling, walls, and floor is perfectly done, but I am going to have to say that even the DOOM games bring better action and better background and goals and weapon options compared to this Alien game. The PC game, ALIEN VS PREDATOR is by far way better than this, and is true to the plot and movie action.  Its too bad I spend 12 dollars on this game, I am going to re-sell it right away and let some other sucker buy it.	-1
I remember playing this game back around 1996. I was nearly 12 years old when I first played this game and I thought, at the time, this was a really cool game. I really like the Alien movies (mainly the first and second one) and I was fairly excited to play any game based on my favorite movie.  Now, as a grown up (or maybe still a child at heart, lol), I came across this game again. Remembering all my childhood experiences with this game, I was fairly excited to relive it. Right after playing it for about 5 minutes, I started laughing at myself. I honestly don't know what I saw in this game. The game is so horribly crafted that it's really a surprise that they released this game at all. The graphics are ok (given the time it was released), and the weapons are kinda cool. However, that's all that's good about this game.  If you are buying this game to relive some childhood memories, I recommend not buying it because you're going to ruin some good memories. Just keep it as memories, don't relive it because you might see it differently.	-1
This game is so stupid like one of the revier's said all you do is find stuff and haveto find the exit door. And the last three levels are impossible to beat because they all look the same and you keep finding the same door you went through before. This game is like doom, you know the one where you just see the weapon. Dont' get me wrong the graphics were cool but it just sucked and the only way to beat it is if you cheat.	-1
KEEP AWAY UNLESS YOU ARE A FAN OF THE ALIEN SERIES!!!  This game is old, and it shows.  There is no Dual Shock capabilities, and pretty much everything is sprite animation except the walls and doors.  It really looks like it could be a cell phone game.  The story is: there is no story.  You are pointlessly taken on an adventure through the areas of the first three movies in the series (the TRILOGY at the time, obviously) and pit against tons of enemies including human foes as well as the Alien creatures and their varients.  This game isn't very creative, or well designed, but it is classic.  In the end, and as a fan of the Alien series, I must say DO NOT play this game.  It will only alter your perception of the series.	-1
I love puzzles... I mean, I LOVE PUZZLES.  But I don't love this.  Not only is this game boring, the graphics aren't too great either (even for PS one... my other games look better than this).  I think I'm better off playing puzzle games online for free...	-1
Okay I'm not totally lowbrow, I can get puzzles (I got near the end of this game called Lighthouse). I couldn't get this at all when I played it, not even a bit. You roam around this island getting fragmented information, and at least on the computer the puzzle hit-detection seemed weak, so trying to access the puzzles themselves even with a guide was a frustrating endeavor. The puzzles themselves were bad enough, but the fact that solving some of them didn't seem to change anything discernible (at least in the early stages of the game) meant I ultimately gave up in frustration.  Not to mention it wasn't even fun.  Instead of this, I'd recommend Okami or any other hybrid puzzle-rpg.  If you can't figure out the puzzle with the tools possessed, you can at least take out your frustrations on a hapless creature in battle.	-1
This is an early military simulation type game, and pretty much obsolete, basically a mediocre pastiche of other stuff being done at the time. The graphics are supposed to be photo realistic but they aren't, the ideal in these types of games is that it should look like a helmet cam worn by a soldier in real life. Everything looks very matter of fact... This isn't a beautiful game to behold. The psn version that I have glitches and freezes up often, I don't know if that was a problem in the original or not but it probably was. The Gabe Logan 3D model is the worst that I've seen in a ps1 game, he has a Sasquatch body with a Lego character face, and stands and walks like Sasha Mitchell. That has nothing to do with the limitations of the system but instead it's a limitation of the artistic ability of the people working on the game. Controls are pretty close to as bad as it gets, very hard to steer your character, mostly worthless auto-lock targeting. There is some creativity to the level design, some okay variety, but there was better stuff being made back then. I stopped playing a level or two after the helicopter boss, because the enemies start wearing super flak jackets that take more than one clip, it turns into a head hunting game where you have to go into manual targeting mode and are left a sitting duck unable to move from the sucky controls.	-1
WAY too many positive reviews for such a crappy game.  That's what I think.  Syphon Filter is atrocious.  I received this game as a Christmas present (gee, what a crappy gift) back in the late 90's.  I thought to myself "well, all the N64 players have Goldeneye, I can compete with them when I receive Syphon Filter for my Playstation!"  How wrong I was.  It's not that the actual game is bad.  I mean, walking around shooting people is fun, and it's also fun to avoid being seen and make it to the end of the level without having to fire your weapon once (and having to remain VERY quiet while doing so).  The problem is that the difficulty is incredibly high and the storyline is about as interesting as watching the paint your baby brother smeared all over your television set dry.  Without a certain special code it's REALLY hard to get *anywhere*.  The storyline is similar to one you'd see in the TV show Jag.  It's just not interesting to me.  Walking around shooting people is fun, but that's all the game has going for it.  Now imagine if that special code didn't exist where you can kill people in just one or two shots.  The difficulty would be out of this world.  I also hate the game for the bad memories connected to it.  The Christmas I got the game, I had a few bad personal things happen.  But looking back, Syphon Filter really isn't any good. It's not surprising to me that the game is going for only a couple pennies right now used, and only a couple dollars to buy brand new.  It's not even worth THAT much!	-1
It's a shame that the Sega Saturn didn't succeed in North America the way that it did in Japan because they received the Arcade perfect version of this game for the Saturn and to this date there still is not an Arcade perfect version of this game for any home console. You could probably find someone selling a Japanese Sega Saturn on eBay or something, but that's a lot of trouble and who wants to buy an entire foreign system just to play just one great game (and maybe X-Men vs. Street Fighter too!)?  As far as the PlayStation version goes, you are forced to select only one fighter and an assisting teammate due to the PlayStations lack of RAM and VRAM (the Japanese Sega Saturn version requires a packed-in 4 MB RAM Cartridge which allows the game to play exactly like the Arcade version with minimal load times). However there is a trick if you are playing a 2 player game! If both players select the same characters, then you are able to play the game the way it was meant to be played: 2 vs. 2 tag-team! This game plays almost exactly like the previous years X-Men vs. Street Fighter on PlayStation with some new features and different characters. If you liked the way the PlayStation port of Marvel Super Heroes played then you will like this even better since it is more of the same with more character variety and more colorful graphics. Aside from the cutbacks in gameplay style and missing frames of animation (another downside to the PlayStations lack of RAM!), this game is enjoyable enough if you aren't obsessed with the Arcade verion too much. I would still go for the Japanese Sega Saturn version since it is Arcade perfect or wait (and hope) for Capcom to release a Marvel Anthology or another Capcom Arcade Classics compilation with X-Men: Children of The Atom, Marvel Super Heroes, X-Men vs. Street Fighter, this game, Marvel vs. Capcom and Marvel vs. Capcom 2. C'mon Capcom!!!!!!	-1

I have used many third party expansion packs and they all have failed. They have caused my console to crash and have experienced other issues. I now am using the Nintendo brand expansion pack and have never had problems since.	-1
I have used a lot of third party expansion packs for the Nintendo 64 and they all have been problematic causing crashes and other issues. The only one that works without a problem is the Nintendo brand Expansion Pak.	-1
I did not get anything from this product personally and I haven't enjoyed this one at all.	-1
This product is unreliable third-party hardware. I suggest you buy the official Nintendo Expansion Pak that will NOT ruin your N64 like the one on this page is said to do. If you value the life of your console and games, use the official Pak and not the generic hardware advertised on this page. Most people won't notice by looking at the picture, but the official Nintendo Pak has a circle pattern in the red top portion unlike the parallel slits in this image. If you aren't familiar with the official Pak, it is very easy to see the image and think it's the official thing. Make sure you either purchase one on Ebay where you can see the pictures of the actual item you're purchasing. Or read the Amazon Seller's item description very carefully before buying to make sure they explicitly claim you are buying the official Nintendo brand Pak.  I post this only because this page is misleading, making you think you are purchasing the official Nintendo Expansion Pak, which you are not.	-1
Products offered by many marketplace sellers are not original Nintendo Brand. Often they are unlicensed third party knock-off expansion packs. Ive personally had these damage a system and ruin games. Look for sellers offering the real thing by Nintendo. Ive warned you. You can save a few bucks and take your chances. Deviation from the actual product isn't even allowed on Amazon. Their very listings are a violation to begin with. Their feedback speaks for itself.	-1
I HATE THIS GAME IT SUCKED HARD TO CONTROL! THE THIRD GAME IS IMPOSSIBLE AND STUPID THE SECCOND GAME IS HARD TO CONTROL AND OVERALL ITS JUST AWFULL!	-1
It's a game.  But the acting is no worse than the movie so I give it one  extra star because you can do stuff, not just sit there and watch the  lousey acting. "Qui gon, I have a bad feeling about dis"  Well,  it's kinda fun, I guess. You get to whack things with yer light-saber which  sounds much like the movie and the other sound effects/background ambience  are excellent in my opinion.  Music even better.  Gameplay OK.  Graphics  are not the best for now but very good for 1999.  You want a good Episode I  game, try Racer.	-1
A 60FPS original Xbox game locked to 30FPS, with missing 480P support. As opposed to every other version, the US and JP PS2 port has support for switching the voice track between ENG or JPN. Choosing JPN helps massively with the cringeworthy ENG voices, but this hardly makes it a better game. It begins easy, then ends up slippery and borderline unfair in no time. You're essentially playing the same line of stages in the same order, with different missions per character. Also, the camera system has been completely screwed over by the porters. Honestly, this and Unleashed are great examples of 3D games in the series that are worse than '06. At least the framerate is stable...	-1
The reason I am rating this game 2 stars is because this game is ok not what I expected this game to be thought it was gonna be fun	-1
I was hoping this was a racing game, but it's an adventure game, so I am not very happy with it at this time.	-1
Boy, this game was a real disappointment. I truly expected better for this game, since it was based on a truly cool, badass movie. The main reason why it wasn't so good is because of its difficulty... this game was incredibly difficult! Even with the Player's Guide it was very difficult to beat! The last time I played it was probably 2 to 3 years ago though, and back then I wasn't as skilled as I am now at video game playing... maybe I'll give it a second chance. Still, its chances of not being sold or something are not really good. After all the reviews that I read, I thought that when I tried my buddy's game "Star Wars Episode I: Jedi Power Battles" on my step-brother's Dreamcast that it would [stink]completely... but in fact it was the exact opposite. All the reviews I read kept saying how "Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace" was way better than"Star Wars Episode I: Jedi Power Battles"... boy were those reviews experiencing strong cases of irony. "Jedi Power Battles" was a lot more fun than "The Phantom Menace", and it was at a good level of difficulty. Too bad I didn't beat it though, my step-brother doesn't have a Memory Card for his Dreamcast. If you're a HUGE fan of "Star Wars", then don't get this game... you'll end up destroying the game after you see how many pointless missions you have to go through and how many impossibly difficult leaders you have to face: 1) Jabba the Hut's champion fighter, 2) a huge and hairy beast, 3) a thief who stole a part from Anakin's podracer, 4) a Coruscant mercenary, 5) and ofcourse the incredibly powerful Darth Maul. Sure, it may SOUND easy, but wait till you hear this... you don't always play as Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi; in quite a few levels you are forced to play as Captain Panaka and even...gulp... Queen Amidala! Really, I'm not kidding.	-1
This game is horrible first of all the play is slow. This game gets confusing after a while the levals are just too chanelging! The graphics are weak and a poor excuse for a star wars game. The voice overs are soo weak! It takes way too long to load and get thourgh a leval. This doens't even follow the movie real well it goes out of the way and follows the smallest details. This is a must not buy and a huge letdown. Star Wars derserves a better game for thier first movie a almost 20 years and especially with all the new technology around. Don't buy this game!	-1
Cartridge was busted wouldnt play. Got my money back at least	-1
label on game was in bad shape	-1
I just have to say one thing first: There clearly are not enough buttons on the N64 controller to make a decent variety of moves. Instead, in this game, there are about nine moves, most of them useless because they do so little damage. This alone makes this game so incredibly boring after two hours that I have to wonder what the creators were thinking when they made this game. Even multiplayer mode loses its appeal pretty quickly, because of the limited amount of moves. There are also a few too many items, and it really makes it less fair that you can use a big baseball bat or a lightsaber or a beamgun to help you win. Also, considering that the gameplay wasn't good enough, the fighting environment takes a new approach at trying to add lots of detail and affecting play, but most of the battle grounds are far too plain for what it is trying to attempt. But I will say that the game has incredible graphics, each character and scene developed beautifully. I also like that in practice mode, you can change the speed of the characters movement so it seems like slow motion. You can make the characters go at normal speed, or one-fourth of it, making for a great amount of Matrix-like suspense. The two challenge rounds are also a challenge, maybe too great a challenge, especially with characters like Yoshi, who don't get a jumping boost, but an egg to throw. The bottom line is, this game is simply a rental, because that is about the amount of time it will take you to get sick of this game. If there were more buttons on the N64 controller, and the game had more play modes, this game could have been pulled off very nicely, but for now, it's just a short rental.	-1
I've been a Duke Nukem fan for a long time. I loved Time to Kill and enjoyed Land of the Babes. Total Meltdown is the most frustrating  FPS I have ever played. The speed is so fast it is hard to move. Looking up and down is a chore. You use L1 and L2 to look up and down. Jumping puzzles are annoying and swimming is almost impossible. Crouching is hard and the graphics are terrible. Sound is bad as well. The only funny part about this Duke Nukem game is the rulebook(it is funny). The only semi-detailed part of this game is Dukes weapons and hand animations. Even the cutscenes are bad. Please try to avoid this game and save some cash.	-1
Duke Nukem is a pretty cool series.  I use to own some of the Nukem Games...I happen to buy this game along time ago at a game store called GameMax..They had it for 4 bucks...It was pretty sweet.  The graphics were terrible but Hey it was on the Play station.  The game play was kinda slow but still good.  I don't know if this is and edited copy of the game...I can tell you is that in this version I got for PS1 you do see women take there braws off when you pay em' cash..But they have stars...Literaly covering there nips..And it also has a type of color...The one that matches there bra.. The games violence is over the top.  But still it's a winner...I happen to like the N64 versio more then this even though there isn't Brief nudity like The ps1 version But in the N64 version there is more violence...The bodies explode when you shoot them again after there dead.  You can't do that in the PS1 version but that doesn't really matter. Duke Nukem Total Meltdown is recomended for a mature audience since this game does have over the top pig exploding violence plus you go to an Adults Only Book store and there are half naked strippers with stars on them. I had fun with this game.  It kinda pissed me off cause you didn't get to do all the stuff you can do in the PC version But I still liked it.  Over all it's a mediocer version. I do not recomend this version at at all!  Get the PC version!  Or the N64...I donno I just liked that version. It's a great Duke Nukem Game... Later...	-1
Honestly, there's nothing good about this game.  The graphics are NOT at all what the playstation console has the ability for.  The graphics are more like Sega Genesis or Super Nintendo or even the atari rather than the Playstation.  If you like games with good graphics, do not get this game.   The gameplay isn't that great, also.  The N64 version is much better, because the gameplay is more up to date and realistic, and plus the graphics are what the graphics SHOULD be like on the new and modern consoles.   I swear, play a demo or atleast rent the game, (I rented it and it was the worst money I ever spent) and check out the graphics.  Plus, in order to know the story of this game, you have to read the direction book.  I can't remember it word by word, but it went something like this: "Duke was blasted out his ship and was about to be greeted by earth, when he realizes that a swarm of aliens has crowded the city of L.A." Okay, so the story sounds good...but why wasn't there a sequence within the game SHOWING us the story?  And plus, all the bad guys that you shoot look like cardboard.   I think that whatever company or designers created this game obviously didn't have much money at the time, so they decided to make a mediocre game.  This was bad.  Believe me.   If you want a game with good gameplay, excellent graphics, wonderful and atmospheric feelings to it, get some game on the playstation like a final fantasy.   If you want a game with awful graphics, bad gameplay, no storyline sequences, and a Sega Genesis feel, then get this game.   This game is not worth any money at all.	-1

Yes, people, this game sucks big time. This game came with the original Nintendo system back in late 1980s. I had a hard time trying to beat this game because the control was down right horrible. Most of the time you'll jump off edges by accident. And who ... would pay ... to relive the nightmare of this game? Apparent, 82 people who reviewed this game and my friend did.	-1
I bought this I think there is something going on with it I am giving it 1 star not very good when I play the pikachu yellow version game I keep on hearing static and fuzzy noises not a very good hand held device this is not a very good hand held device don't waste your money if I were you I would keep my money I made a mistake of buying this I would not recommened this system to anyone	-1
The gameboy color was good but i really like the 1989 gameboy the grey one that takes 4 batteries	-1
I don't see all the hype in this portable gaming device. The games graphics are so terrible (So is Game Boy Advance). The only good Nintendo graphics is the brand new Nintendo DS which has Nintendo 64 graphics which isn't too shabby. But I really hate the Pocket and Color because it's a waste of money. Why would you get something in black and white with terrible graphics and then get one with only some colors (It's not that good) and plus the addition of bad graphics...now that's what I call a bad deal.	-1
Defective product---... Microsoft made these sticks back in the olden days when computers had game ports. They stopped making these and then brought them back into production. But by that time the computers no longer came with game ports so they supplied this stick with a UBS adapter (that is unique to this product- no standard UBS adapter will work). The seller did not include this adapter in the box and claimed that I was lying when I flied a complaint with Amazon..... In the end he sent me a UBS adapter that was made to fix some of these problems with these older devices but that did not work. So I returned the product.. He  told me to send it back to him ( when a product Is defective the merchant is required to pay return shipping but he did not want to do that) and he would pay for the shipping when he got it back. He did not do that and then told Amazon that the adaptor was in the box.... well yes, the third party adapter was in the box, the one that he sent me in an attempt to solve the problem.	-1
Could never get it to work on any of my games.	-1
I paid extra because i thought it was by Nintendo as advertised. It's generic. What a bunch of bull.	-1
The quality was listed as "Good"  It was on the poor side.  Analog feels broken, and a feels buttons are sticky.  But it did work 2/5	-1
It looked good, but the joy stick was broken.  I had to pay to get it fixed and it still won't be as good as it should be.	-1
The worst game EVER created! I wouldn't take this game even if someone offered ME money to take it.	-1
What a POS this game was and still is today!! All you do is just fly through rings over and over and over and over and over again,until you wanna pull your f'ing hair out!! The controls are hard and complicated,there is no story,and the graphics look like sh..!! I hate this game with a burning passion and every single Ringman 64 cartridge that exists in the world,needs to be destroyed,so future generations of gamers are spared the agony of this giant lump of butt-waste!!	-1
This is one of the worst games of all time.  I remember playing this as a kid and just kept sucking at it.  When I was a kid, I didn't understand a game could be bad and simply thought I was doing something wrong and kept playing until I finally accepted this game is awful.  The control in this game is really bad, especially during the ring stages.  You'll just fly all over the place.  The first instinct for such terrible control is to move slowly, but you have a time limit, so you don't have time to move slowly.  When I got to a point where I could fight, it was like a maze and had no idea where to go.  The ONLY reason anyone should buy this game is for game collecting only, and even then, they should save this when they are scraping the bottom of the barrel.	-1
This game does not, in fact, star Superman. It stars his genetically engineered clone created by Lexcorp known as Stuporman. Stuporman staggers like a drunken person, relies on power-ups for super powers, pulls punches so enemies beat him, likes random time limits (including ones that lead to an instant game over), can pass through solid objects like they aren't even there, and can die from things that cannot hurt the real man of steel in a million years, like ordinary bullets and explosions. He was created for the sole purpose of ruining Superman's reputation by making him look pathetic and weak. All part of Lex Luthor's evil plan! If you love Superman, don't buy this game, or you'll be buying into a lie!	-1
Fly threw rings and pick up cars...this game is an insult and should be shoved up the developers anus.	-1
Superman 64, after playing the game and reading the remarks made about this game - I question the existence of Titus why it was made! Alright, on with the Review: Graphics: Eye-bleeding! Don't look at them! Controls: Don't start with me - they are slower than Molasses to make Supe perform his punches! Even the Multiplayer controls are near-unfinished! Sound and Music: Ugh, don't question me -uninspiring; The Superman theme is nonexistent! Sound is low-budget, voice/acting is from the series but I'm definitely not in love with either them or this game! Plot: Lex Luthor has trapped Lois Lane, Jimmy Olsen and Prof. Hamilton in a virtual world with Kryptonite fog in it and Supe has to go in and rescue them while putting down the Super-Villains Luthor purposely put there. Fun Factor: This is not fun! For one, neither I nor my brother can beat the first level.  Supe both flying and running moves slow - if you try to fly: You'll have only ten-percent control over it! Not to mention the objectives you do are only for monkeys, you've got a timer for most of your objectives, this game is repetitive above all else, you have a health meter, a meter for all of your special abilities minus flying and you're gonna have to really try to get over your anger and impatience to beat this game! And so: This is one of the worst games I've played, it literally ruined the Superman experience, pick up Spider-Man for the PSX, N64 or Dreamcast and enjoy the greatness it has to offer! -J. Garten	-1
This game was soooo bad, I took it immediately back to the game store where I got it from. I got it since I am a Superhero fan, but trust me, even if you are a diehard fan of Superman, resist the urge to purchase this game or trade for it or even accept it for free!!!!! This is one of those noway games that should be thrown in the microwave and have the molecules in it to be melted for good.  When i first turned the game on, the people in the first level looked like an oil painting. And it is nearly impossible to fly through those rings!!! Miss one ring and words show up that say,"Lex wins" and you hear a really bad reproduction of baldy's laugh. I put two stars for this being a fun game because it is so much fun to laugh at!!! I wonder why DC let Titus make this horrific game!!!! 'sob'	-1
Nintendo power voted it the worst game ever  Gamestop and spot hate it  I was unfortunate enough to stumble upon this game at my local video store. I thought "superman, I'll have to try that". I have never seen a game more deserving of the following: THIS IS THE WORST GAME EVER! IT DESERVES TO BE BURNED!!! IT IS A DISGRACE TO INTELLIGENT BEINGS EVERYWHERE! MAKIND SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF ITS POOR ABILITY TO CREATE GAMES! IT IS UTTERLY POINTLESS! IT MAKES SOUTH PARK LOOK LIKE SHAKESPEARE! IT MAKES ALIEN HOMINID SEEM EASY AND SOPHISTICATED!  Somewhere far, far away, Superman weeps.	-1
I recieved this game for one of my birthday's many years ago. At first I was excited...but when I played it...oh boy. The Graphics were horrible, too rough and generic. To make matters worse, they looked like cheap cartoon drawings.  The missions were dull. Your first mission is to fly though magical rings. The Story is even worse, you have to save random civilians using various powers. The levels keep jumping, so your never in the same place.  The multiplayer was kinda fun, but it gets dull fast. Basicly, it shifts to fps and you shoot other people for points. other than that, this is probably the worst game I have ever played. Don't buy this game...rent it at most..or borrow it.	-1
In "Kill Bill: Vol. 2", David Carradine described Superman as follows, "Not a very good comic; not particularly well-drawn."  Well, I suppose if Caine from Kung Fu is talking about this character, then the game must be cool too, right?  It's been almost 10 years since Titus released the most unorthodox game to ever grace our solar system.  It must be good, since we're still talking about all these years later.  Seriously, there's a lot to like about SUPERMAN 64.  You won't need any sort of defect warranty, because the second you flip the POWER switch, it works every time.  It's refreshing to buy an electronic device, knowing that it's electrical circuits will never fail you.  Equally cool is that Superman flies in this game...I like it when he flies.  Every time I pop in this cartridge, I'm even more eager to watch  the Christopher Reeve movies...all 4 of them.  The plot is revealed to the gamer with great restraint.  You see, there are bizarre, murky images that even David Lynch or Stanley Kubrick wouldn't be able to visualize.  For example, Lois Lane and Jimmy Olsen are confined to, um...a blurry contraption that kidnaps them; or does it imprison them?  I personally couldn't tell if it was really Jimmy and Lois, because it's very hard for the gamer to completely understand the cutscenes.  But isn't it neat to figure it out for yourself?  You see, because the graphics are so confusing and blurry, you get to keep playing again to unearth the game's secrets.  And don't worry about completing SUPERMAN 64 in a short period of time, either.  It's a tough game, and there are few games that equal its challenge.  What's most remarkable is how the game also addresses Superman's emotional state.  I'm sure Kal-El struggles to use his powers properly; it's not easy for a near-invincible alien to do the right thing 24/7.  Titus has tackled this concept very faithfully.  You see, when Superman flies, he won't always do what the N64 Controller tells him to do.  A free-spirited main character...brilliant!  Lastly, Superman's powers are present here.  He has his eye-lasers and wind/freeze breath.  That's always neat, huh?  But what's even more most fascinating is that The Man of Steel --- according to this game --- has the ability to manipulate the physical dimensions in which he exists.  He sometimes will be flying casually through the sky, and then have a sudden urge to fly through the buildings of Metropolis.  How cool is that?  On the other side of this spectrum, there are moments where Superman will get stuck in a wall or a drainage ditch......you know, I still haven't figured out how to beat those sections of the game.  I wonder, is there a higher power known only to Superman?  I ask, because Titus refuses to give us easy answers to this puzzling N64 entry.  The most gifted scientists, researchers, cryptologists, artists, and gamers will not be able to solve this enigma.  SUPERMAN 64 is one of the most unforgettable and original experiences in all of gaming!  *****THIS REVIEW WAS MEANT TO BE SARCASTIC AND SATIRICAL.  I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU BUY THIS GAME!*****	-1
I could go on and on, but look, it is really very simple. It's hard to believe Titus could have screwed up this game so badly. They should be ashamed of themselves for releasing it. So to all, always PRONTO pay attention to mister number one best sheriff student's idiotic post (i love you sophisticated people who drop the f bomb and think you are cool...White Trash that sums you up :) have a nice day And don't forget, you hafta agree with me at all times, click on the YES button under my review, obey me, everything that has to do with good things of me	-1
I didn't even play this game and I don't own an N64, but because there are so many bad reviews I will just give this game another bad review so people won't buy it since it's supposed to be the WORST GAME EVER.	-1
What, you thought they were for the game? Get real... The arcade game was more fun... and all you did was walk/fly right and punch!! I can't go lower than one with the ratings, so I decided to use it for something worth while. The actual score I give Superman 64 on a scale of 1 to 5 is -12. See if you can find anyone who disagrees...  Ehh, changed my mind... I'll show the game's score... wouldn't want anyone to think I actually liked this thing...  (You know what, I get tired of people thinking I actually LIKE this thing, so I change the star rating to give it the score it deserves...)	-1
When I heard Nintendo was coming out with superman I got all excited, then they delayed the release date, which usually means the game is going under even more improvements.  When I bought Superman I sped all the way home, turned off my phone and sat in my chair.  To my suprise, this game is not worth the plastic it's made of.  I don't even have one good thing to say about it.  I was extremely disappointed.  Superman used to be cool.	-1
It is no fault of the shipper but, MYST "WILL NOT work with Windows 7" so now I have a game that I cannot play. I am not sure if that is posted anywhere through out the purchasing process. But that is not what matters as I was the one who should have paid better attention. My own angst and irony have required me to post a 2 star rating.	-1
This game continues to haunt my memories as an irritation because of it's length and puzzles, which usually amounted to no more than treading back and forth across the island of Myst.  While the environments were increadibly beautiful, they fail to make up for the miserable gameplay, which has you go to one place at least 5 times to solve five different puzzles.  The story is intruiging, yet the game's ending fails to please the player, since, you'll discover shortly after completing it, it could be completed in a matter of minutes.  A good game for 10 to 20 dollars, but you shouldn't spend more than that on this weekend game.	-1
I can see why this game was so hyped in 1993.  CD-ROMs were cutting edge and the "slideshow" graphics are fairly good and so is the sound.  However, the story isn't as interesting as the ambiance would have you think and the movement is absolutely, irritatingly choppy. I don't believe anyone has ever finished this game without some help.  There is too much slow clicking around and backtracking to keep the attention of even the dullest person. I don't like having to resort to hints in order to play a game because it's released before the necessary technology is truely ready. REALmyst?...I no longer care. Riven and Myst3?...even more clue-less and annoying, I'm sure.	-1
What what game I'm describing.  It's old, it's puzzling, and it's a blockbuster game.  It's, you guessed it, Myst.  And that is probably the easiest puzzle you'll get concerning Myst, too.  Since it is a popular game  that was released a quite a long time ago, you've probably heard of it by  now.  I'll just say this one thing:  If you're deaf or impatient, AVOID.  There is a puzzle that involves matching piano tones...heck, even if you're  NOT deaf, it's still quite a puzzler!  But don't fret...you can beat this  game in FIVE MINUTES if you know how, and it can be found in the many game  walk-throughs of the Internet.  After all, with the difficulty of THESE  puzzles, rest assured, you'll be looking for one!	-1
I really wanted to like Hexen 64. It's like a fantasy version of doom, and the storyline and atmosphere are damn good. You can play as a weak but magically powerful mage, a strong but magically weak fighter, or a balanced cleric. But this game has waaayyy too many problems. I didnt' even experience the jumping bug in the editorial review either. The first couple levels, i was hooked. It reminded me of warcraft II: trying to save your homeland from impending doom by ringing the bell and such was awesome. And the fact that the enemies teleport in only adds to the gameplay, as you never know whether you've cleared an area or not. The items are cool, and the mazelike and puzzle aspects woulld've been where it really shined, had they been done right.  unfortunately, not the case. Firstly, the horrible graphics reminded me of jurassic park on snes, as the entirely identical backgrounds provided with not-so-great maps caused me to get lost over and over again, thus killing the mood. Also, in the 4th level or so and on, you hit a switch, and it could open something up on a random spot in ANOTHER LEVEL. This caused me to give up, as i have no interest in searching a level over and over for some obscure doorway or whatever. Also, when i cheated to find the later levels wikthout said searching, i found the end-game bosses to be clones of the you!!! this is just lame imo, they couldn't even be bothered to make up cool end-game bosses? Also, jumping sucks ass in this game, so save often.	-1
Once again we have an example of an Amazon vendor claiming one thing and delivering something else. This CD-ROM did not even come in a protective plastic jacket. I suppose little Tommy's parents wouldn't give him the money to purchase one so he could completely fool the Amazon Dupe customer that he paid good money for a legal copy.	-1
Others have commented on the richness of the sound score, the sumptuousness of the graphics, and the immersion the puzzles provide for you.  All true.  But I find people's devotion to Riven and its predecessor  a bit overblown. There are design faults here that should be pointed  out.  The 'slide-show' effect when moving probably does allow sufficient  computer memory for photo-realism while standing still, but it compromises  the realism that the producers were otherwise attempting.  Besides that,  it's simply annoying.  Some have said that it adds a certain elegance to  movement throughout the game, but I don't like seeing my surroundings  'melt' away as I move through them. Nor do I like sterile, empty  environments.  Oh sure, it all adds to the 'creepy' vibe the producers were  hoping for, but a universe which is largely uninhabited is mighty boring  after a few hours.  I wanted wayyyyy more interaction with people than I  got here. I also wanted to understand why I was doing what I was doing.  Oh I could solve the puzzles, given gobs of time and guesswork, but at the  end I found the plot rather too spare for the amount of work invested.  If  I'm going to spend weeks solving puzzles, I better understand more at the  end of the story than at the beginning.  I'm not altogether sure that  happens here.  The universe here, for all of its graphical excellence,  left me hungry for more.  Clearly, this is an entertainment crafted by  fine artists rather than fine writers.  If you're happy with that  orientation, you'll be overjoyed with the final product.  But if, like me,  you want a game to surround you with an active, vibrant plot revealed by  characters of substance, Riven isn't much of an adventure.	-1
did not work with windows 7	-1
not worth 10 cents, graphics are very poor for nintendo 64 The game is very tedious finding pass cards in every level to open doors gets old very quick. The aliens also don't put up a fight just there to die. Co op would be a nice feature but it is the same maps and bots running in circles is boring. After level 2 there seams to be missing the yellow card looked every where and my friend and i could not find it. A much better version of this is availible on the ps1 . definately don't waste any money on this game, it down right sucks	-1
I paid extra because it said it had a booklet no book ;/	-1
As I expected, this game has good reviews, but does FF7 deserve that praise? No.  It was my birthday, and I wanted a new console and a cool game to go with it. I remembered getting a Genesis with Sonic 1, and having a SNES felt wrong until I got Super Mario World.  I got my mom to get me a PS1 and FF7. All the kids were raging about it. And it was in 3D! Wow, just imagine FF6, but in 3D. Oh man.  Thus began my unfortunate exploration of the JRPG. (I hadn't played FF6 at this point, but I played Chrono Trigger.) The backgrounds looked nice. The music was "epic" and the sound was trash. A lot of the sound was trash. It sounds worse than a SNES game. And what's the deal with the Popeye-looking characters? But something was compelling about the game. I wanted to know what happened next.  The only reason I played games as a kid was to see what happened next. I only wanted a new weapon in Mega Man because it was cooler than the M-Buster. It was a fetish. Mastering a challenge to achieve fun was foreign to me.  The video game industry is an industry--it exists to make money. If a publisher puts out a game that makes money but isn't strictly a videogame, they WILL do it. What was Square's motivation when they developed this game? Tell a story? Let players express themselves through cunning materia strategies and complex boss fights and complex dungeons? Something else? I don't know.  Let's look at what we've got. The game lets you start easy by pitting you against 2 weak enemies. One sword strike will kill them, or you can throw lightning. I think they even give you some inventory items. You can safely see how the combat works. You get to name Cloud and Barrett anything you want. This makes the game personal, but I don't know anyone who did that. It's irrelevant because the bastard is still going to have his existential crisis and behave in ways that you might not choose.  Eventually, you have a boss fight that, thanks to mistranslation, tells you to ATTACK WHILE it's tail is UP. If you do this, the boss will hit a party member, causing you to do the battle the opposite of how they intended. You might even game over. After that, more dialog, and you get to make a choice with Aeris: "You'd better get out of here" or "Nothing...hey, listen...". This affects a cutscene WAY, WAY down the line from here. I never made the connection until recently.  The materia system lets you customize your spells. If you want a mage, you load him with spells, his HP decreases, and his MP increases. It's a good idea to change his "row", making him stand further away from the enemy, thus killing your melee damage, but protecting you from melee damage. The game doesn't handhold; it lets you figure out the finer points of the materia system. I liked how FF6 let your characters permanently learn spells, but FF7 are tied to materia. It's not a bad system, but considering the game is 60 hours long, you might master it before then and get bored.  For years, I've gone back and forth with myself about whether FF7 is good. I've concluded it's partly responsible for making games too casual. Despite that it's an RPG you don't get to make meaningful choices. You get to make very few choices about what Cloud does outside combat, and most of them don't really matter. If we're going to try elevating videogames, it would behoove JRPG fans to demand more choices so they can truly role-play their own "anime hero". I'd recommend giving players choices in story that let them end up a pathetic failure or butt of the joke in their own story. Fail states are important.  Of course that would take a master stroke in storytelling, something videogames aren't known for. Videogames are not literature. For every decent videogame story, there are 10 books as satisfying as eating a meal. Game stories are intentional experiences that happen a specific way. If they don't happen that way, then the designer has to account for that, or face an endless web of possibilities. Games are dumb at telling stories. Even games that give you plenty of dialog options are bogus because the end result is the same. At the end of FF7, there is only one outcome. This is a role-FORCING game.  I'm fine with games having cutscenes per se. If this game was combat, anime, combat, anime, combat anime without any illusions of choice, I'd be perfectly happy with that.  I should've got an N64.	-1
Oh, here they come! Can you hear it? The wimpy cries of the thousands and thousands of fanboys and fangirls of this failure of an RPG! I can certainly hear them, because I've been listening to them for the past few years. I will admit, I was excited to play this game at first, seeing as I never played it before Christmas of 2008...but honestly, I wish I had never played it at all. Why? Well, stick around, sit back, shut up and read.  STORY: 2/10 Atrocious. Simply atrocious. You start the game as an ex-SOLDIER named Cloud (default name, seeing as you have the option to name your main character), who is currently an employed gun for a resistance group called AVALANCHE. Why these groups and names have big, capital letters for seemingly no reason is beyond me, seeing as they don't stand for anything. Along the way, you'll meet and greet a number of people who have nothing to do with what you'll be doing in the current area you're in, get pissed off with the inability to comprehend even the slightest bit of dialogue spitting from the mouths of these characters, and finally come to the climax of the game, facing yet ANOTHER completely overrated villain in a battle that will last about thirty minutes...but not because it's hard. It's not. I have so many problems with this game's story...okay, I have a lot of problems with this game PERIOD. You get a total of 9 characters in your party, and guess what? Seven of them have absolutely NOTHING to do with the main storyline whatsoever! The only reason they exist is for party-filling, seeing as they completely blew away any resemblance of a cast and crew of characters that actually mean something to...well, ANYTHING. Two of them you don't even technically have to get in your party to begin with! You can literally beat the entire game--all 13-17 hours of it--with the drooling retards you pick up along the way. The game is so stale and boring in terms of taking your hand and walking you through the story, and everywhere you turn, you can see something you can bitch about for hours. Party members included.  GAMEPLAY: 1/10 Same thing as every other Final Fantasy game released before its time. There's seriously nothing revolutionary about this game. It's the same boring, lazy turn-based system you're used to, except they actually find ways to make it even less enjoyable. The movement of the battles themselves feels and looks glitched, and every time you use an attack, skill, or spell, you'll be sitting there waiting for them to finish with your thumb up your ass. Oh, and if you plan on summoning a powerful magic creature from the Summon materia...well, I certainly hope you stocked up on food, drinks, and toilet paper; you'll be sitting there staring at the atrociously-long summon animations for the next hour and a half before you can even make your next move.  PRESENTATION: 0/10 What are you talking about? This game is CLEARLY not even finished. Do you know how many glitches, bugs, and excruciating errors I found while playing this game? Hundreds. The sickest part? I didn't go out of my way to find them. They came to me. The character models look ridiculous, nobody has anything interesting to say no matter where you are in the game, the battles are boring and unworthy to the franchise's name, and you'll be lucky if you can even make it to the end without exploiting a glitch or two. Or ten. Not only that, but the game is WAY too easy. I literally played through the entire game--story and all--in less than 20 hours. In that time, I never once died or even lost a member of my party (if you're not counting Aeris, seeing as she dies in a cutscene). And hey, if you're having trouble with something, just exploit one of the hundreds of glitches in this game to allow yourself the ability to walk through walls, gain infinite money and items, level your entire party up to 99 in a single fight, deal millions of damage to an enemy with a single hit, or even reset every single in-game switch so you can replay absolutely everything in the game over again with all the stats, items, and equipment you already have. But seriously, who the hell would play through THIS monstrosity anything more than once? This unfinished, broken piece of cow dung is not worth the time.  SOUNDTRACK: 0/10 What soundtrack? It's just a bunch of clicks, screeches, and otherwise infuriating sounds. It's not music. It's a collaboration of anger-inducing noises that will have your TV muted in less than thirty seconds, or your money back! GUARANTEED!  OVERALL RATING: 1/10 This game is even lucky I can give it the rating I did. It's especially lucky that Amazon.com's ability to rate its products only comes in five stars. If it was a standard 1-10 rating, I'd hack my computer to give it less than .5/10, seeing as I can't stand this absolute travesty of a video game. It's a downright abomination to the world, and a big slap to the face of anybody who was seriously into Final Fantasy, like myself. I'm glad I didn't play this game until years after it came out. If I had played it back then, I probably would have been just like all of the other sniveling fanboys and girls and considered it the greatest game of all time. You can't rate a game based on how well it sold, and you can't rate a game depending on the graphics. Why? Because both of those factors are meaningless when it comes to a true review. I strongly recommend that anybody who is interested in buying this game should steer WAY clear of it; it is not worth even the effort to post a picture of it here on Amazon. It's not worth a penny out of your pocket.	-1
For years now,gamers have said that this is one of the greatest games ever made. I just don't understand why they think that is. Even for it's time,it was pretty dull and boring in my opinion. I remember dropping 50 bucks on this game when it first came out back in 1997,and being very dissapointed with it. The main problems I have with this game are the graphics(except the cinematics),the gameplay and some other elements. One of the main things that I hated about FF7 is,there is absolutley NO speech in this game at all. You have to read everything that the characters are saying. It gets very iratating VERY fast. All you do is read,read,read...and read some more. The combat system is way beyond confusing. It's all about they hit you,then you hit them,then they hit you with a strong attack and almost or completly kill you. The only good thing I can say about this game,is the cineamatics are beautiful. They are very nice to watch,but the characters and surrounding areas are very blocky looking...Overall,I give FF7 a two.	-1
I'd like to preface my review by saying I had heard A LOT about this game. The main character, Cloud, is pretty famous and pops up in a variety of games (like Kingdom Hearts) so I was really interested in trying it out. That, coupled with the high reviews on gaming sites like IGN, which quotes that FFVII is "The RPG by which all others are to be measured, FFVII is a cinematic wonder" had me thrilled to try this out. For some perspective, IGN quotes my favorite game of all time, Zelda Ocarina of Time, as "IGN64 reviews the biggest game of the decade. Does Zelda 64 live up to the hype?" I never owned a PS until the PS2 & PS3, so I was stoked to see this title come out on the PS network for $9.99.  Now that you know a little bit about what I was expecting from this game, I'll provide a little bit about my gaming style/history before I go into the game review. I'm a huge RPG fan, and I like a variety of games in that style (turn-based, timer, real time strategy, action). I've played a few FF games (III, X, Tactics, Tactics II), and I liked them all, except for X, which I found to be a little too easy, albeit very pretty. I also really enjoy the Dragon Quest games. I've been into video games since I was 5, and apart for a work-induced stint of abstinence in college, I still enjoy video games when time permits.  As soon as I started playing this game I kept telling myself, it must get better. It's just a slow start, surely the story picks up? I pushed on for a few hours, going through Clouds background story and getting an idea of the main story arch before I finally gave it up as a bad job. I'm glad I only spent $9.99 to try this game out, and not $100+.  Graphics: I'm not sure what IGN is talking about, but these graphic are terrible. Yes, I know the game is from 1997, but Zelda OCT came out in 1998 and it's graphics have held up to the test of time much better. Although the PS and N64 (pre-graphics expansion) are supposed to be comparable, a PS example of an older game with much better graphics is Chrono Cross (1999 PS). The majority of the background for FFVII is a muddy brown that looks sort of like mulch. Also, since it was being released on the PS network, Sony and Square Enix could have taken the time to revamp the graphics (like Nintendo did for OCT on the Game Cube) instead of releasing a game whose graphics are so bad I get a bit of a headache on the newer TVs. Maybe it would look better on an old TV? Who knows. The cut scenes have slightly better graphics, which are almost comparable to Zelda OCT's in game graphics.  Story: I wasn't really impressed by it, although it it's an interesting concept. I've done my best to be vague in this section so that potential buyers won't have the story spoiled for them.  GOOD/Unique: When you boil it down, you are basically fighting as an eco-terrorist, and that's an interesting concept.  BAD: The character integration into the story is very poor. When you look at all the character's background stories, it doesn't make sense that they are all working together. If the game spent more time with them discussing WHY they have their common goal of being ECO-terrorists it would fit better. Aside from the fact that they are all eco-terrorists who live in the same beat down community, they really have nothing in common.  I did not like the characters I had been introduced to, before I quite playing. Cloud is incredibly angsty and self-centered in the beginning, and I found all the social scenes centered on him to be unpleasant. His friendship with Tifa doesn't make much sense to me either. Tifa is a sweet person, and portrayed as kind-hearted, yet she seems to be obsessed with Cloud who is nothing like her emotionally. Barret, um, can we say racist? Barret, the only black person in the game, consistently beats his chest like a gorilla. Yes, let's make the black person look and act like a gorilla.  Gameplay:  Mediocre.  This is the most important part for some people, although I tend to find the story to be nearly as important. For me, if the story is bad, it would take phenomenal game play to keep me engaged in the game. The game play here was average, it has a pretty typical timer set-up, nothing to write home about. I'm not sure if this game invented timer play, if so Kudos to Square Enix. The timer play did make the beginning more interesting in that you were literally thrown into the game with no instructions, so it took a little while to get a hang of the game play. Once I figured out the game play though (~1hr of game time, most of which is scenes) I quickly grew tired of this game.  Summary: This game has average game play, terrible story, horrific graphics even for a late 90's game, and pretty pathetic characters. I played for 3-4 hours and then gave up on it. My free time is limited, and I don't waste time on games that aren't fun because "they might get better." Maybe FFVII really picks up in hour 4. All I know is that I was very disappointed in the game, and I'm quite incredulous about the higher reviews here on Amazon and on other gaming sites.  UPDATE: Barrett - when Cloud is introduced to headquarters, Barrett beats on his chest like a gorilla which I found to be a poor choice for the only black character in the game to be doing. However, his overall portrayal may not be that racist, as I only played for 4 hours and many claim he is treated better in the later game.  Despite the comments and emails I've gotten about this review, I still leave it as 1-star. Without the nostalgia goggles I didn't enjoy the story, the graphics, the gameplay, or the characters.	-1
When I first bought my PS2, I got FF10, FF9, and FF7.  That was back in 2002.  FF10 & FF9 I liked. Good stories & loveable characters.  But FF7 was a drag.  Then I saw all the positive reviews ("best game ever"), so I decided to give FF7 a second playing in 2004, to impress me.  But I still did not like it.  IMHO the major flaw is that FF7 has too many "dry" sections where you fight-fight-fight and almost nothing happens storywise (example - climbing the 100-floor building of your enemy -or- the dumb section where you waste an hour finding a dress).  In some sections, literally hours pass by with no story... it feels like a step backwards to the near-nonexistent stories of the original nintendo.  .  Also the Battle Engine - totally unbalanced.  A good RPG will provide balance between physical & magical attacks, so they are near-equal.  A good RPG will make each character unique with specific skills & weaknesses (like real people-some are fighters; others are healers). Not so FF7:  - it's all magic... physical attacks are worthless (about 1/4 the damage)  - and the characters are completely interchangeable. You can equip Fire3 to your man & Heal3 to your girl.  And then the next battle, completely flip it around, so the man is the healer & the girl is the killer.  And then flip it again!  No individuality. Each character is identical.  Plus *instant learning* and instant forgetting... not realistic at all.  .  Also, the story, while good, is poorly executed.  It basically boils down to a meteor poisoning the planet's "health" - very simple concept - but the writer dances around & adds un-necessary complication.  He takes 2+2 = 4 and turns it into 1-5+4-6+2-1+7-2 = 4.  That's why so many gamers go, "Huh? What just happened?"  It was a good story, but a lousy script.  Overall, FF7 is one of the weakest games in the FF series (inferior to the other PS1 game-FF9, super nintendo games FF4, FF5, FF6, even inferior to FF10.	-1
All right, listen up all you so-called video game "experts" and "critics!" Let me give you the lowdown on Final Fantasy VII. For the past year, I have stood by Final Fantasy VII saying that it is the best RPG ever created. I was wrong. It WAS the best RPG ever created in 1997. When FF VII first came out on the PSX it was said to be the best game ever put on the PSX. They were right. When it was released in '97 the graphics in the game blew away the graphics of previous games and later games. The storyline itself was gripping and although it had it's dull moments, it culminated in a spectacular finish. Now I think the reason that most of you think this game sucks is because it has been 7 years, 7 YEARS!! since this game hit the shelves and every year we see new games and flashier graphics. And you DARE compare this game to a PS2 GAME!!!! It's just not fair. The capabilities of the PSX could never, in a million years, rival that of the PS2's capabilities. It's just not gonna happen. Other than that this game is tolerable considering today's standards. But they will never be able to compete with FF VII's soundtrack, it is beyond competition. OUT!	-1
Are you joking. This is by far the WORST final fantasy in my opinion. Man, are you guys even trying anymore?  I looked at final fantasy x-2 and rented it and gosh, you cant even make a good game out of that. Man..bad graphics, horrible gameplay, sucky battle system, hard to understand, VERY difficult to get into it, too confusing, dumbxxx characters like cloud, hes the worst.(except sephiroth), sometimes too long of cutscenes, boring cutscenes, you can barely see their eyes & mouth, etc. etc. etc. etc. times a million. I hate this game.	-1
I bought NBA Showtime with the purchase of my Dreamcast hoping for some real basketball. I was sure disappointed. After playing it twice I put it away for good. The game is stupid. NBA Showtime has the worst gameplay ever. The computer can jump 50 feet in the air to make a block then swish a full-court shot. The graphics are terrible. The players' muscles' are bigger than their heads and they look very unrealistic. This game blows! It's just like NFL QB Club except for basketball, an NBA 2KX wannabe! Do not buy this game.  Midway sure know's how to [mess] games up!	-1
After buying my Dreamcast used with alot of games, I just noticed that this is the last game I tried out, and the first game that I put away. The gameplay is the shallowest ever. I didn't play (or look at) this  game since I tried it for the first time. The graphics are extremely bad. The players look very unrealistic. The colors in this game are very bad and dark. the entire game looks like an N64 game. That's about all I have to say about this NBA 2K1 WANNABE GAME!!! I hope that this review was helpful to you.	-1
Soul Calibur is a classic example of all icing and no cake! The game looks great and sounds great, but its too easy. The game that is supposed to be the game for "die hard fighting fans" is basically a walk in the park. The game is a button masher! I played the game and found that "turtling up" and waiting for the right time to attack or throw is all that it takes to succeed and it even works on the higher dificulty settings. My major gripe about the game is the dark and demonic story lines. No God fearing person should touch this "demon sword wielding" game (I began to discover the different plots after I played it). I'm not trying to sound like a fanatic but come on why all the demon intense plots in a generally evil game. What sick minds came up with this anyway? If the game had a better plot (one that involved some thought) then it would be a classic, but as it stands...no.	-1
If you want a game that you can master in 5 mins with any character then POWER STONE IS IT. I beat the game as I got it once I discovered "the formula"... I'll list the pros and cons to give you a fair rundown Pros 1) Characters are unique and fun with personality, i.e. personal story, ending etc (missing from PS2) 2) Backrounds are the BOSS and fully interactive 3) The moves and effects are radical (King Capcom shines here) 4) Fast action 5) Cool Japanese voices Cons 1) One dimensional fighting sucks as a 3D fighting game!! 2) Weapons make no sense once you know the formula! They just slow you down and make you a prime target for the formula!! Overall Overall this is a DISAPPOINTING attempt at a fighting game. The concept is good but the fighting engine is flawed. Powerstone 2 got it right and is a blast, read my review!	-1
THIS IS ABSOLUTLY THE WORST WWE GAME EVER CREATED. THANK GOD FOR THQ. IF THQ CAME IN ALL THE WWE GAMES WOULD HAVE SUCKED REALLY BAD. DON'T RENT THIS GAME, DON'T BUY THIS GAME, DON'T EVEN ASK FOR IT. THE GAMEPLAY SUCKS, THE VOICE OVERS SUCK, CREATE A CHARACTER SUCKS. EVERYTHING FOR THIS GAME SUCKS. DON'T BUY IT.	-1
WWF Attitude, although a good game don't get me twisted, was not worth it on the Playstation because of the incredible loading time. ... Seriously, if you picked Owen Hart, Gangrel, Road Dogg or even Kane or the Undertaker, you had to wait atleast 2 sometimes exceeds of 3-4 minutes just to get a match started. And if you picked a hardcore or cage match, sometimes, you had to wait even longer. The trade off was truly not worth it for me because of that reason. Granted yes what you got on the Playstation version rather than the N64 version was better. PSone had more sounds, more create a wrestler options in the voice and music and some clothes. Because of PSone's memory capability, the game could have more and that was a definite plus over the 64. I will admit that once you got the match started on the PSone version, the game itself was faster than N64's version but still, anyone could appreciate not having to wait 5 Minutes to play a simple game. The controls can be a little challenging at first but once you get it, you're golden and you don't have to worry about a thing. For the game itself I will give a 4 star because it is still a fun game to play with your friends but because of the awful loading and wait time I give WWF Attitude a zero. ...	-1
The Resident Evil series has been on a steady decline since the first game came out in the mid-90's.  It seems that they make these games harder and harder than they should be and Code Veronica is no exception.  It's not the simplistic puzzles that make the game difficult, rather, it's the lack of ammo and healing items that make what what should be easy battles far more difficult than they should be. Why do some zombies take more bullets than others?  Why do zombies respawn in some areas?  What's up with all the backtracking in this game?  You're still forced to use the stupid typewriter ribbons to SAVE?  These are some of the questions you'll ask yourself when you play the Code Veronica.  Has the series evolved?  If you get past the improved graphics, the answer is NO.  The control is just as sloppy as it was in RE1, albeit with a quick turnaround feature and a new two-handed gun mode (you burn through bullets faster this way).  A great deal of prior planning and trial and error is required, which may have been good back when the series was young, but it has simply gotten to be tedious today. Even the soundtrack is pretty forgettable!  The game has a rather cartoonish look to it...could have looked more realistic but then again, the Dreamcast isn't exactly a graphics powerhouse.  My suggestion...don't buy it.  Granted, I've owned this game for quite some time and those who are new to DC may have heard great things about CV, but trust me, this is a BORING game!  Get Shenmue instead as that game simply plays better and has a better story!	-1
If you like the original Resident Evil you will probably like this one for the most part. However, I liked the original Resident Evil, but found: Code Veronica extremely annoying. The annoying part has nothing to do with the game itself. The puzzles are a bit bothersome at times, but nothing to complain about. The graphics aren't bad and the story line works pretty well. The BIG problem I have with the game is the play control. The editorial comment says "less than perfect controls", well that is an understatement. You have to hold down the right trigger to use your weapons, this makes firing while running and firing while retreating overly complex. Moreover, you have to go into the menu screen every time you want to pick up or use an item. There just had to be a better way. Most of the time I would say that the play control only diminishes the fun of the game, but doesn't ruin it. However, in this instance it does. The control sucks the fun out of the game just as the zombies do the blood out of your neck, while you are fumbling around with the controller. The game isn't very difficult, but the play control makes the game more work then it is worth.	-1
Very dirty	-1
Terrible, horrible, very bad. May be the worst game I ever played! I despise it and it's just no fun at all.	-1
Being a South Park fan, I was looking forward to this title.  However, it is SO repetitive and annoying...the turkey level alone goes on FOREVER.  Friends of mine have had the same reaction.  It's a first-person shooter (or should we say first-person snowballer) that just has you running around the town of South Park throwing snowballs at turkeys.  Yeah, I know, according to the packaging, that the game evolves into some sort of space/zombie creature thing, and you're supposed to save the town, but I never got that far due to the overlong turkey-shooting level...when I saw the average 4-star rating, I knew I had to respond.  Perhaps younger people will like this due to the character tie-in, but this 34-year-old was bored and disappointed in this title.	-1
People, i wrote this review to warn whatever of you out there want to buy this game. This will make even the most die hard game fans throw their playstations out the window. The games has most of the characters(whoopie...)which are represented with sub bar graphics and pitifull level desighn amoungst other things.the games boring. I rented it and it literally got old after 5 minutes of gameplay. If there is one redemable factor about this game its that you can laugh at how utterly stupid it is. Avoid this nerf dung at all costs.	-1
I simply find the game ordinary and boring. I really love the TV-show and was very much looking forward to the game. Man I was  dissapointed! There is nothing new in the game. It is simply an ordinary  shoot 'em up including the characters from South Park. Admitted: There  are a few funny features in the game, the cow-shooting gun, Mr. Hanky the  christmas Poo but even these things gets quite boring after a very short  while. My advise is: Enjoy the TV-show and use your playstation for  something else.	-1
Plodding first-person shooter with tons of fog to conceal thegraphic weaknesses.  One-player missions are tedious.  Only redeemingfeature is to play the two-player game with other "South Park" fans, and then only if you've gotten the codes to unlock favorite characters. Even with friends, you'll tire of it in a day.	-1
This was one of the first games i remember playing on the Playstation. So i wanted to replay it and i was very frustrated. I never finished the game back then and it was a big pain finishing it this time around. a lot of backtracking and poor inventory setup. I still think its one of the few titles for the playstation that you should give a try. I ordered it used and it came on time and i had no problem with the CD during gameplay.	-1
Picture showed console and hookups, all I got was the console	-1
Power comes on but A/V does not work. Be careful from where you purchase. I read "Tested and works great!" But it doesn't. I ordered a NEW A/V cable for Dreamcast and HOPEFULLY, it works. Turns out it didn't work so it IS the A/V Port. Requested a refund, it was approved, sent system back but DID NOT get a refund. I WILL file a claim.	-1
Game play is either to fast or slow. Controls suck. Accuracy can only rarely be obtained.  Despite this you get bumped up to the next level reguardless.  The graphics deffinetly leave something to be desired, like better ones.  Don't waste your money!	-1
Finally tested with a new game and the system doesn't work! It just powers on and says insert game disc. It will play all my cds just not game discs? I don't recommend this seller as he said it was a working system and clearly had not tested it fully.	-1
Resident evil 2, may i say, is one of the best games of all time.  So was re1, re0, and re code veronica.  But not resident evil 3.  First of all, whats with the difficulty mode?!!  U either put it on easy and it starts u with enough ammo to finish the rest of the game with, or u put it on hard and it makes it so u barely have enough.  But the worst part is the tyrant.  It chases u so u barely have a chance to explore.  It literally follows u through doors and into new areas constantly!  He's hard to kill and always comes back.  Plus he can kill u in one or two hits and is fast.  It takes away from the fun of the game.  Forget this game and try resident evil 2 or one of the others..... you will thank me later.	-1
What the Resi series of games does, it does well - OTT Hollywood-style scares and genetically-mutated things that go Bump In The Night. RE 3 is no different, providing more of the same for fans who love it. It also boasts one or two gameplay improvements, but somehow can't quite get back to the glory days of the first 2 games in the series. The plot follows the heroine from the first game, Jill, 24 hours before and after the devastating outbreak of the T-Virus in RE 2. A novel concept, and one which Capcom surely intended to exploit fully. The inclusion of the Nemesis character, a Frankenstein-like monster who relentlessly pursues you from start to finish, is also a nice twist, adding much-neede dtension to the game whenever he makes an appearance. The menus and controls are also tweaked, most notably the inclusion of the 'Turn' and 'Dodge' features, which, if learned properly, add hugely to the gameplay. Graphically RE 3 is as good as RE 2. It's as detailed, and lush as before. The intro is strangely disappointing, being lo-res and choppily animated - the PlayStation 1's power is being overused. The sound is good, though, and the gameplay is the best possible version of an imperfect control system. The problems with RE 3 lie mainly in the game's production. It's nigh-on impossible to keep track of yourself for the first thirty minutes or so, and the map for this portion of the game is difficult to spot. The baddies are souped-up versions from the previous games and are actually too difficult to kill initially. You waste precious ammo and health packs before you realise that you can take multiple paths. Also, Nemesis, though an excellent inclusion, is again too intense for the early stages of the game, and more often than not you'll find yourself cursing Capcom while waiting for your game to reload after he's dispatched you. Again. As the game continues, you realise that the baddies have an unfair advantage over you, and you will end up running past the majority of them. The satisfaction of knowing a Zombie is cornered just isn't there anymore. You also miss out on some beautiful backdrops and vitally important clues becuase you're too busy avoiding some ridiculously over-populated area. A vast, sprawling game that does yield some rewards for die-hard fans, RE 3 is not a good way to introduce yourself to the series because of its unforgiving difficulty. The storyline may also confuse newcomers. If you're a fan who doesn't mind being confused and frustrated, then check it out. If not, wait for something better, like Code: Veronica, or anything in the Silent Hill series.	-1
Although I most confess that I did enjoy this game at first (At first, meaning from beginning to end), I was happy with big areas to explore, and really enjoyed the Nemesis (although it was no more different that that bald stalking guy of the inverted RE2) hunting you down, I most say this game is a fraud in what concerns story line structure, which on its own right, is the main mover of any story-based game.   I'm going to simulate here the general structure RE3 (and RE2 and RE, although this is acceptable in the original game) follows: "So, how did these creatures end up here? let's search the whole place while we try to get out of here. Look out! (Lots of guns, blood and guts follow) Wow Jill, that was close! Hey, he was supposed to be our friend! He turns out to be a traitor! Hey look, a secret lab within the main place, (House, Police Station, City or any other place of your fancy) let's check it out! Oh no, this is the truth behind the monsters! We most stop Umbrella. Darn! This place is about to explode, let us get out of here! Look out, a big mean monster! (More guns, blood and guts follow) Yeah! We did it! Our heroes escape a few seconds before the whole place blows up. Fin" Wow, we have a new Resident Evil game here!   My point here is: This game features the same story line structure of the past two games, only this time we get to play before and after RE2. That dirty trick was Capcom's strategy to make the game's storyline a little bit different and engrossing.   I can't comment on Code Veronica, for I haven't played it yet, but I think I will do so when it gets out for the PS2, but for what I can see, the RE series is going down the drainage. I will consider Resident Evil 4 depending on many aspects. I might be playing this game (along with RE2) again when I get me a PS2, but surely, I won't touch it again in the near future.   There is more to horror gaming than just guns, blood, guts and linear story line.	-1
Back in 1996, Capcom introduced  both Japanese and Americans gamers a brand-new world of videogaming. Despite the rather awkward name of "Resident Evil", which is just plain out laughable, the title has become a household name. This movie-like, horror series can be written down as a new genre of gaming, horror. Yeah, very few games caused gamers to devastatingly sob (Aeries' funeral in Final Fantasy VII), some games built mystery or suspense (Gray Fox's desperate attack and impressive dialogue in Metal Gear Solid), but Resident Evil led the player to leap in fright or frantically jitter. Capcom inserted blood-thirsty zombies as the adversary, and the player's fear as the biggest opposition. In a sense, it is a movie.  Useless to say, Resident Evil was among the titanic series that landed on the Sony PlayStation. The original game presented an amazing surface. However it suffered from terrible voice acting and a somewhat dull story. Capcom extremely went hard at work for their sequel. Powerful hype erupted when Resident Evil 2 was announced. Anxious gamers couldn't wait to get their grubby paws on a copy. Resident Evil 2 altered the gaming industry. Other home console companies decided to cash in while the genre was sizzling hot. Konami cashed in with Silent Hill. Survival/Adventure games went mainstream.  After RE2 respectfully lived, a third installment was introduced, this time hype was scarce. It came out too quickly and sources claimed the interface was going to be identical as the other two. Fearing the worst, the third installment seemed to be a horrible move for Capcom.  And is.  From the experience of the two Resident Evil games, the player may expect the "scare moments." While playing on a big screen t.v., with surround sound, the volume almost reverberating the room, and a sudden pack of grunting zombies crashing out a window, I felt no fear. Amateurs to the Resident Evil series may have a chill ride their spine, but original fans will expect each scare attempt. Though few changes have been added, RE3 fails to take a leap over the original Resident Evil 2. In other words just imagine playing Resident Evil 2 but with more rooms and more puzzle solving.  RE2 is the strongest and most remembered in the series. When catching a glimpse of RE3, excitement was absent. RE3 seems it brought the entire series in shame. The story must take a new direction! Like taking a role of an umbrella agent, or the T-Virus spreading somewhere else than Racoon City. Nemesis, a ferocious, mean, bazooka- equipped devil who hunts the player, proves to be a pathetic antagonist and challenge.  The minigames granted after beating the game bring little life at the game's abrupt end. The slogan, "if the Suspense doesn't kill you, then something else will," lives truly in the second game.	-1
Sega finally got it right with the Dreamcast despite the Nintendo knock off controllers.  This was Sega's last effort in the console wars but we all know how that turned out.  By Sega, makes so good games on Nintendo.	-1
Finally, Sega releases a video game system that rises above mediocrity!  Sega is famous for all kinds of failed (and embarrassing) video game consoles they brought to the world, but this time they actually "kind of" got it right with the Dreamcast.  Unfortunately, Sega made a gigantic mistake that almost immediately brought down any chance of the Dreamcast becoming a success.  They chose to release the Dreamcast in late 1999.  Gaming fans vividly remember what happened to the Sega Saturn just a couple years before, and people weren't going to be fooled again.  This was now or never for Sega.  If the Dreamcast failed, Sega would be gone from the hardware market forever.  The release date for the Dreamcast was getting closer and closer.  It was in September of 1999.  People were still very happy with their Playstation One because 1999 was one of Sony's highlights for spectacular and revolutionary gaming.  That wasn't the only thing going on.  Sony fans were also anticipating the release of the Playstation 2, which was guaranteed to become the dominant console thanks to the relentless power and popularity the Playstation One was responsible for.  It was during this time Sony was far and away the most powerful company in the video game business.  Sega saw trouble ahead but continued to move forward with the expected Dreamcast release date.  Nintendo was also very much alive and in the big picture with the Gamecube.  Nintendo was content on making sure their fans would NOT be disappointed with the Gamecube the way they were with the N64.  Nintendo fans are loyal.  *Nothing* can knock out Nintendo.  Nintendo recognized their mistake with the N64 and knew they could make it right again.  They knew they could give the Playstation 2 a run for its money (and looking back, Nintendo did just that).  And so, the release date for the Dreamcast arrived.  With Nintendo and Sony on top of their game, what would happen?  What would happen to Sega?  The Dreamcast would hit the market and... nothing.  No sound.  No noise.  So little was said about the Dreamcast on the release date that it was like Sega had died right then and there.  An eerie silence for a company that gave the world Sonic the Hedgehog.  The Dreamcast failed because there were already more than enough successful gaming consoles on the market in 1999, and people didn't want the Dreamcast to interfere with the superior, soon-to-be-released Sony and Nintendo gaming systems.  Sega also failed because of their long, frustrating history of ripping people off with unsatisfactory video game systems (such as the Sega CD and Sega Saturn).  Sega would fool people into thinking they had something extraordinary in the works... only to end up not supporting it.  They had trouble supporting the video game consoles they created and would often leave people with failed attempts and false hopes.  Sega would always fall asleep on the job.  This would happen time and time again, with Sega hoping the brain-dead masses would buy their average, incomplete gaming consoles.  It's like the people who worked for Sega would always say "let's start something and not finish it".  When Sega failed YET AGAIN with the Saturn, people finally couldn't TAKE anymore.  Anyone who was still a Sega fan by that point pretty much lost all hope.  Sega was now the enemy and they had to go.  A gaming console needs a giant selection of games, and unfortunately Sega only understood that ONE TIME in their lackluster history (with the Genesis).  Every other console they released only had a few classics to choose from among a bunch of average games.  In the case of the Dreamcast, Sega tried to support it but it was too late.  Sony had defeated them.  Sony had defeated BOTH the Saturn and the Dreamcast with the overpowering success of the Playstation One.  Hard to believe but it's true: the Playstation One knocked out BOTH the Saturn and the Dreamcast  off the market, making both of those consoles nothing more than a disappointing memory for Sega fans.  In 1999, Sega knew they wouldn't be able to compete with the Playstation 2, so they finally did the right thing in early 2001 by announcing that they would never again make another video game console.  Sega was DONE.  They admitted defeat.  That, my friends, made milions and millions of people very happy.  No more junk on the market.  That announcement was the best thing that could have happened, and if you happened to glance outside that day you would have noticed the sun smiling down on everyone.  That meant no more arrogant Sega promotion.  I used to hate the way Sega would always promote their games by putting down Nintendo and Sony.  Now I can laugh at it.  Sega really thought they could trick people into buying their crappy games by constantly making fun of Nintendo and Sony.  Didn't work.  Nintendo and Sony fans are too smart and considerate for that immature nonsense.  I bet everyone responsible for the Playstation's creation were laughing in piles of money over the "fly, play thing, fly" commercial that Sega created in an attempt to make Sony look second-rate.  Ha!  That ugly, gray-colored box destroyed both the Saturn and the Dreamcast, and I hope Sega fans never forget it.  It's almost 2007 and people are STILL talking about the Gamecube and Playstation 2.  Why?  Because they are successful video game consoles.  People will look back and REMEMBER them as successful consoles.  No one remembers that the Dreamcast tried to compete with them at one point.  People forgot the Dreamcast even EXISTED when the year 2002 came around.  Sega's video game consoles immediately became dated and forgettable once companies stopped making games for them.  If Sega had put less energy into putting down the competition and more energy into offering their customers *complete* and enjoyable gaming consoles, maybe they'd still be around today.  As it stands, they deserved to watch Nintendo and Sony destroy them.  Nintendo and Sony didn't have to stoop to dirty tactics to win over fans and the world is now a better place.  With the release of Nintendo's new revolutionary Wii system coming to America this November, along with the Playstation 3, we don't have to laugh at Sega's silly attempt to compete only to end up being the laughing stock of the world.  Goodbye Sega.	-1
I don't mind if the graphics aren't completely state of the art, but this was ridiculous.  Not only were the graphics terrible, but the rendering engine they used was pathetically slow and the effects were horrible.  I  ran this game on a P3-733Mhz with a DDR GeFORCE256 video card and could not  enjoy the game at any decent resolution because of the huge frame hits you  would receive depending upon where in the track you were.  Terrible.  Even  at high resolutions the cars and tracks looked pixellated and cartoonish.  I-76, which is many years older than this game has graphics which kill NS4.  I am unbelievably dissapointed.	-1
I bought the dreamcast with high hopes. Mostly because of Street fighter and sonic games. The only good games are Sonic Adventure 2 and Dead or Alive 2. Sega has made systems that all have failed. Like the recent Saturn. For the first couple of days its good. Cons: Very Loud Not may places to rent games Not many games Not many demo disks Pros: Good Graphics Easy Controls Easy to hook up Easy to hall around Overall the dreamcast stinks. If your looking for a system with fair graphics,lots of games,good games,easy control i'd buy the playstation.	-1
i thought this would be a good console, i was very very dissapointed!  it has very few good games, and the graphics aren't all that i expected from it,i sold my DC and now i am waiting for the x box.	-1
Doesn't work at all. Freezes. Pissed off.	-1
I bought mine a year ago and i am very pleased with the system. It's graphics are great and it is a lot of fun to play. But the chances are that it will now be a dying system. With Sega getting out of the hardware side means that the customer base will not grow. While more and more PSX2 get into peoples homes the same cannot be said for the DC.  There maybe 70+ games still coming to the DC but as time goes on that number will deacrease. A company is not going to bother with so small a market and that is what the Dc will become.  Over the last few months I have seen DC games disappearing from the local stores as they decided to drop the line. The local video stores around me have dropped Dc. Tonight I found one stores entire DC gear including the systems they rented out up for sale. The DC section had been replaced with PSX2 games.  Sega will also be releasing games for the PSX2 and that alone should be saying alot for what Sega has in mind.  Sega has admited defeat and will leave those that supported it high and dry. The current price is very very good. But it is consol taking it's last breaths.  Was the PSX2 heaps better. I don't think so. Not from what I saw. I enjoy my DC immensly and played it for many many hours. But it's day is gone. The future is the PSX2. A shame really both for Sega and for those who bought into what they thought was a excellent alternative to the big dollar console's.  Because of this I personally will not buy Sega gear in the future.	-1
Let's sum up what is great about Dreamcast:  Sensational graphics (equal to PS2), great sound, good controller design and an excellent, although not outstanding, software line up. Now, what is so bad about the Dreamcast that I would rate it so low ------ Sega Corporation!!! If you haven't heard the announcement yet, Sega will not longer be making the Dreamcast console.  This means that the chances of many more great new titles being developed is low.  I am basing this statement from my experience with the Sega Saturn.  Once the Saturn production was stopped, only a handful of additional titles were released and very few stores stocked them. When I saw that Dreamcast was based on DirectX (the same programming API as Windows for the PC) I was very excited, because I was sure that there would be a flood of titles for the Dreamcast.  There are many more titles for Dreamcast but the flood of PC cross overs never materialized and the few that did come (Urban Chaos, Rainbow Six) were bad. Now Sega has given up on their console and wants to make software for other companies.  I believe that Sega owes it's gamers a little more loyalty than it has shown and I hope that the gaming community reacts by not purchasing Sega software for any platform.  My investment in a PS/1 was good for 5 years.  My Dreamcast lasted six months.  Goodbye Sega purchases forever.	-1
You know, sitting behind a computer screen, I'm glad no one can see the look of disappointment that appeared on my very face the minute I began playing Tekken 3. I am incredibly disappointed that after reading so many positive reviews claiming Tekken 3 to not only be a significant improvement over the previous two Tekken games, but also tagged "the ultimate tournament fighter" that the actual game would turn out to be *so* underwhelming.  Tekken 3 really surprised me. But don't take that as a compliment. I went into Tekken 3 with hardly any experience with fighting games whatsoever. I took a break for 10 years with tournament fighters after all those lousy 2D Mortal Kombat games brought me to tears. Back then I figured "okay, either I don't like fighting games or maybe I just don't like the Mortal Kombat series". This was when Mortal Kombat 2 and 3 were popular on the Super NES and Genesis.  A lot can change with a human being in 10 years. We grow older, we decide we want to learn about life and wonder where we came from, and we develop an apprecation for the things we have and the people who are in our lives. To put it simply, we're thankful to be alive and feel good. But in some situations, things can remain EXACTLY the same. All those extreme feelings of hatred returned to me immediately after only 5 minutes with Tekken 3. It was the exact same feeling of hopelessness I encountered with the Mortal Kombat series.  I really have no idea what went wrong. No, not with the game, I mean, what went wrong with ME. Seeing as how I love watching people fight and kick butt on TV shows and movies, I figured it was only natural that the fighting style in the world of video games would appeal to me. Appeal to me a LOT. That was my assumption. But apparently it STILL hasn't happened. Tekken 3 was supposed to help me wash away all the bad memories of playing old Mortal Kombat games and give me a fresh start and hopefully help me develop an appreciation for the ever-popular genre of games known as "tournament fighters". Nope. It's really disappointing to me to find out that Tekken 3 is just as bad as the rest of the fighters I've played, and basically the same thing but with improved graphics, for that matter. All fighting games feel the same to me. It doesn't even matter if they are 2D or 3D fighters.  Tekken 3, despite all the positive reviews, does NOT appeal to me whatsoever. The fighting is really clunky, and it seems each fighter delivers very basic and boring moves to each other. It's not interesting or inspiring at ALL to me. It's boring to watch, and even more boring to play. Why is it so much fun when they fight this way in movies but *not* interesting when it's time to do the same thing in a video game? I have no idea. If you want to pull off the really impressive looking moves in Tekken 3, you have to press a bunch of buttons on the controller in a really complicated way in order to complete a move that COULD have been made *much* easier with a very simple and quick sequence of buttons. Strong emphasis on the word "simple". Many moves actually require you to press the Circle button, and then jump over to the Square button. How is someone supposed to easily master this? Going from Circle to Square is NOT easy.  You see, for each of the ten characters in the game, they have major power moves that are very important to master because these are the moves that are supposed to cause the most damage to an opponent. However, many of these moves are incredibly difficult and sophisticated to pull off, and this is a *really* bad thing because the company responsible for this game apparently doesn't understand the importance of making a fighting game easy to master for everyone, of all ages. That way, young and old people alike can appreciate the Tekken style.  It really bothers me how ALL of the developers who release fighting games assume the player is automatically completely aware how to play the game. They assume this *every single time* they release a fighting game. Developers assume everyone who plays these kind of games will be able to understand them instantly. We're supposed to be gifted players when it comes to understanding how to successfully pull off any number of lengthy and devestating combos to our opponents. We're supposed to have enough time to press really awkward button combinations on the Playstation controller during a fast-paced and intense fighting match. Not just combos either- regular moves too. We're supposed to have enough patience to continue trying the same fight over and over as we die a million times and the frustration factor increases significantly, and we realize just how IMPOSSIBLE these kind of games are.  Well, I have news for every developer out there: many of us have a really difficult time with games like this. Not everyone who plays fighting games should automatically be expected to be a skilled player. Not all of us hang out at local arcades wasting tons of quarters as we try and perfect our skills. Some of us are, you know, average "normal" gamers who just like to have fun. The developers of tournament fighters NEVER could understand this, and years later, they still can't understand what it's like to have fun. We shouldn't have to be a genius to play a fighting game. Not all of us can press the EXACT moves at the EXACT moment and win fights. Maybe one day a tournament fighter will be invented for a gaming console that will be specifically designed to be playable for people who struggle with them. Maybe one day...  Other things I don't like about Tekken 3. Despite having excellent graphics, the music is a bunch of horrible, repetitive techno sounds that hardly make me feel compelled to continue playing the game. Oh, and by the way, even though the graphics are really a notch above the rest, there's absolutely no reason to jump with joy when looking at them. Since the fighting is just as basic and uninspiring as that of, oh I don't know, Killer Instinct (another terrible game) you quickly stop caring about how the game looks. In fact, I'd say the fighting engine is EXACTLY like that old Super Nintendo game Killer Instinct. Extremely uninteresting. When someone throws a punch, it's so boring to watch that you just don't care about it. That's what Tekken 3 is all about. Having a fighting engine that's so boring you don't even care if you win or lose.  I'm disappointed. That's the only thing I can say at the moment. Maybe one day an easy tournament fighter will hit the market where the main purpose of the game is to have the computer opponents move along at a reasonable pace for all the normal people out there who constantly struggle with fighting games. A game that will give people the much needed time and patience to put a move on their opponent. A game where you aren't expected to hurry up just to deliver a simple move. Somehow, despite hundreds of tournament fighters that will eventually hit stores, I doubt this will ever happen. I will never buy another tournament fighter again. Ever.	-1
To be quite honest, I found this to be the most tedious role-playing game I've ever played. The narrative sequences are ridiculously long, the graphics are mediocre, and the mechanics of controlling other characters in combat is poorly designed. I read a lot of good reviews of this game before I bought it, and I was terribly disappointed.	-1
Gundam: Rise From The Ashes: Side Story 0079  is NOT Sonic Adventure	-1
Sonic Adventure is a game that tries to do way too much. There are six characters and only one (sonic) is decent. Most of the game is boring and the rest is usually to broken to be any fun.  The Sonic level's, which should have been the entire game, are plagued with a broken camera (it was on crack, sometimes it would focus inside a wall) and bugs. The boss battles are way to easy, and when you started to pick up speed I felt like the game was playing itself (I tried to fail on the whale level and it was impossible). Plus the sonic story is super short. I didn't really like the other game stories.  In the Tails levels you just replay the same levels as sonic but you can fly. The camera and bugs are even worse here. The E-102 Gamma levels are a super generic shoot-em up game. In Knuckles level's you search for gems in a map and is very tiresome. In Amy's level you pretty much just walk around and hit enemies with a hammer, it gets old very fast. I save the worst for last Big the cat. His levels are just a fishing mini-game. There's nothing special at all, just a boring fishing game, way to go sonic team.  Most of Sonic adventure you play boring sub characters, and when you do get to play as sonic, it's too short and plagued with too bug to be any fun. This is by far the most overpraised Dreamcast game out there.	-1
I really love platform games. I guess it is because I love to explore and make my way through those cool-looking worlds. And I have to tell you, Sonic Adventure's worlds look great. This was the very first 128 bit game I had played and boy, was I excited. The game really disappointed and annoyed me however. After playing through the game a bit, you will start to realize that after the fun action stages, you will begin a squence of boring and annoying cut-scenes (that you can't skip) that will drive you mad. Most of them involve sonic and Robotnik threatening each other, or just characters talking. Also, the characters will pause between almost every sentence. It takes forever for them to finish what they are saying, and you won't really care most of the time. Boring. If you make it through the cut-scenes, then you wander through the adventure stages, looking for the next action stage. Mainly by going to a red hint sphere that will say something like "Have you searched the entire adventure stage yet?" When you find another action stage, things will get a bit better, but only for a while. Some of the cool things you can do are snowboard, speed through a futuristic highway. Cool. But, then it is back to boredom and the annoying voices (especially tails.) If you are a real platfor fan, skip this one and get Rayman 2. It may not be super-fast, but it sure isn't boring. And it has better worlds and graphics.	-1
A fun shoot 'm up, no less, and regrettably, no more. Fans of the board game, the series, or even the role- playing game will be in for a bit of a dissapointment.  The game  has few options besides "click and shoot".  Still, I spent a fun few hrs playing it (and a lotta dlrs buying it). I hope we'll get a better, more extensive version soon.	-1
Silent Hill in space and just about as annoying. I understand the tension that the developers were trying to create and they succeed but this is ridiculous.  Constantly low on ammo with weapons so defective the manufacturers would be promptly put out of business all the while being attacked by hordes of wrench wielding, regenerating zombies.  You aint gotta chance and thank heavens for cheats or I wouldn't be bothered.  If you could get it for under 10 bucks go for it and kill some time.  But I sure wouldn't spend the money that is being demanded on Amazon.	-1
Piece. Of. Junk.	-1
i don't know if i have the wrong codes to install but i cant get it to work but probably works ok and im just not getting it right.	-1
Costing as much as fifty dollars new at the time, I nevertheless was suckered into buying two of these back in 1999 or so when I played my N64 a lot.  The thing is insanely sensitive and easy to break.  The first stupid thing it does is in its use, you put the Gameshark into the slot, then stick the game up on top of it.  As with many cartridge game systems, it seems you need to wiggle it about, and position it just right just for it to work.  I remember spending several minutes during the last leg of my first Gameshark's life trying to adjust the game on top to be slightly lop-sided, because it simply would not work if I just pushed the cartridge down all the way, like it's supposed to.  Of all the functions it has, half of them don't even work.  The function of basically making up new cheat codes based on gameplay regularly froze up games, and at worst, caused catastrophic damage to the Gameshark.  I remember one instance I tried to create a new cheat code, and ended up filling up my entire Gameshark's memory with useless information.  Almost none of the pre-set games and codes worked, names were screwed up with random characters and letters, and largely I had to just guess which code would do what for which game.  The fifteen minute instructional VHS that came with the Gameshark was a hilarious joke---both VHS's had the little plastic tab on the bottom STILL INTACT!  If you still remember how VHS's work, this means ANYONE CAN RECORD OVER THE VHS IF THE PLASTIC TAB IS STILL INTACT!  I could literally have recorded gay porn over the VHS, packaged it with the Gameshark, sent it back for a refund, and they likely would have sent the VHS in a new package to be sold to someone else!  Whatever benefits the Gameshark gives are simply not worth it in the long run.  It doesn't ruin your game permanently, but it ruins itself just fine.  There was never any justified reason for the way my two Gamesharks just simply broke down and stopped working.	-1
Read ALL of the reviews for this product. Every bad thing that has been said about it is true. Very unreliable, poorly built product. I've had mine only 4 months, it froze up on me last week, and hasn't worked since. A few other people mentioned that customer service with this company is non-existant. Well, that's true also. I'm really angry and disappointed with both this product, and the company. I mean C'mon, these things are expensive! I'll never buy anything from Interact again.	-1
You get some cheats with some games.  BIG deal.  This is nothing compared with how bad it is.  This erased files in three of my games including Zelda.  This also erased some of my friends games.  Please do not buy this!!!	-1
This controller has to be one of the worst out on the market.  It has a horrible design, is made of cheap plastic, and to make matters worse, it's  also highly priced.  Don't even think about using it for games like Marvel  Vs. Capcom, because even casual play will break this controller.  If you're  serious about games, find an import controller made by another company.  Don't even bother with the other Dreamcast controllers out in America, they  are all just as bad, if not worse.	-1
The Dark Forces may be the best first-person action video game, but it gets Marred by MOS.  It was too easy to kill myself in MOS simply by force jumping.  I died a hundred times because there was something overhead when  I jumped.  Once I died because I jumped straight up, but took damage from  the fall.  Another time I was on this ledge and couldn't get back up--every  time I jumped, I would bounce off the wall and die.  When I went to several  web sites to get help on how to get off that ledge, the best that I could  find was 'it is tricky' to get off the ledge.  After dying several hundred  times I got bored and quit.  I've never gone back.	-1
I can't play this because the system requirements are older than my system.  I did not notice the requirements until I had bought it and tried to play it.  I wish there was a Game of Life on CD that was compatible with Windows 7.	-1
I was very disappointed in this PC game.  It was boring.  Everything about the game was chance.  You have little control over what happens.  Game time is short and it is very likely you did not win anyway. It was a waste of my time.  If you really think you need this game - buy it used or at least a new one cheap.	-1
this was really highly reccomended by several but was a major dissapointment=after playing world war 11 fighters I guess I got spoiled=the sound and special effects just were not there.flight control not bad=I have more than enough system requirements to handle any game out there=as I said, a really ho hum game!	-1
Overly complex game.  Start to finish there is nothing exciting included in this game.  Whatever side you play starts with a great disadvantage and it just goes downhill from there.  Not just a challenge, each order is  monotonous and the game becomes disinteresting within an hour.  Don't waste  you time or money.	-1
I hate this game so much. I was warned that the game is difficult to learn. I read the whole 170 page manual before installing it.  I read the 40 page tutorial a second time before playing.  After four hours of trying  to get the game to work I gave up.  I have an engineering degree from MIT  ('93), so I'm not stupid. The interface was the worst I have ever seen  for any non-Unix software.  Nothing makes sense and C3PO stands there and  insults you the whole time without giving any help. As it turns out, I  had bad luck the first time I went through the tutorial.  I had started the  game in a situation in which I could do nothing.  Except that I didn't know  that since I had never played before. Imagine a game of chess with a  twist.  Instead of all 16 pieces, you flip a coin to see if you get any  particular piece--heads you get the piece, tails you don't.  Sound  interesting?  Now imagine that you don't get your king.  Now what?  That's  what the game is like.  Actually, it's worse.  Imagine that you are told  what the pieces do in a book 170 pages long, but that you can't really see  them do anything.  You can't even see the board.  You have to provide 100  detailed instructions about how to move each piece and the instructions  don't make any sense.  For instance, I had a mineral mine that could go  through space, but I couldn't make spaceships. You don't know why you  lost. LucasArts should never have associated with this garbage.  I  thought that I would never buy another LucasArts game again without playing  it first.  But then I bought Rebel Alliance.  Now I know I'll never buy  another LucasArts game without playing it first. I tried to give the game  away, but my friend gave it back after one day.  He said it was the worst  game ever. It took him 40 minutes to figure out how to quit (he goes to  Harvard). I tried another friend, but he gave it back (Ph. D. Penn State  Industrial Engineering). I tried another friend (Psych major) who gave it  to somebody else who finally threw it away, but kept the action figure.  I  guess that last guy never played the game because after being insulted for  four hours, I don't know how anybody can like C3PO ever again. I hate  this game so much.  I regret ever getting it.  In fact, I couldn't play  other LucasArts games that I love for 3 months until I got over the  loathing toward that company. I wish I could give it negative stars. I have  yet to meet somebody (flesh and blood) who likes the game.  My only wish  now is that I had burned the game slowly and watched the CD melt.  This  game is a case study in horrible design and horrible interface.  I wish I  could say that I learned something positive from the experience, so, well,  nevermind.	-1
On the face of things, "X-Wing Alliance" has the makings of an extraordinary entry into the Star Wars franchise.  The characters are engaging, with enough backstory given in the accompanying written material  to start a small movie.  Conveniently, there *is* actually a small movie  which opens the game off with a real narrative bang.  It makes one wish  that Lucas himself had taken a page from the game producers when he was  making _The Phantom Menace_. Unfortunately, after this high point, the  game soon degenerates into endless missions which advance the  plot--painfully slowly.  Oh, there are cool points along the way.  The cut  scenes are interesting, and the sound environment throughout the missions  is superb.  But the in-play graphics engine is fairly ordinary by  LucasArts' own standards.  The missions themselves are endless variations  on the same themes.  And the game's conclusion is less than satisfactory. But there's another side to the game--multiplayer action--and for this  the game deserves some praise.  As a vehicle for capturing the gaming  possibilities of the Net, "X-wing" is worth the purchase price.  There's a large, loyal player base for the whole "X-wing" series,  so you'll never be alone on the Net. Still, there are better options to  get what you want out of a Star Wars game.  "Rogue Squadron" is  an infinitely better single-player space game.  And the upcoming  "Force Commander" promises to be something of a new standard in  multiplayer action.  By comparison, "X-wing Alliance" merely  feels like a solid update to an aging series.	-1
Apparently the way to win this game is to completely disobey your mission objectives.  For instance in the last mission I played (before uninstalling it and throwing it away) I was supposed to pick up a container, protect my  mothership by fending off the attacking tie fighters and fly to a  checkpoint to meet the rebellion.  So I picked up the container and started  killing off tie fighters.  I got them all.  I was killing them as fast as  they were replaced.  Then I got slammed with a dozen missles from all sides  and lost the mission.  I never got notification to go to the next  checkpoint.  The game has a help function after you lose a mission that  gives tips on how to win the mission the next time.  The tip?  Don't  protect the mothership.  The checkpoint won't appear until the mothership  is destroyed.  Besides, if you attack the tie-fighters, then your container  will get destroyed and you won't be able to finish the mission.  That might  be okay, except that the game doesn't tell you that you can't complete the  mission.  Once I just sat there for 10 minutes waiting for something to  happen.  That was boring. After four hours of finding out that I was  supposed to ignore mission objectives and do very little I uninstalled the  game and threw it away.  My only regret is that now I wonder what would  have happened if I had destroyed the mothership myself. This was a definite  waste of money and time.  After my experience with Rebellion, I am now  certain that I will never buy another LucasArts game without playing it  first.	-1
With a form-factor nearly identical to the original PlayStation  controllers (but minus the analog sticks of the "Dual Shock"  controller), this controller's obvious benefit is to owners of  "Connectix Virtual Game Station", the PlayStaiton-on-Macintosh  emulator.  It's also handy for arcade-y titles and MacMAME, the emulator of  classic arcade video games. The one place Gravis makes a change is very  much for the worse -- the four separate directional buttons are replaced by  a single pivoting directional-pad.  As too often happens with designs like  this, the D-pad pushes two switches at once, and ALWAYS comes through as a  diagonal (eg, right + up, when you thought you were just pushing right).  The frequent inability to enter a true right, left, up, or down is annoying  in some games, particularly in navigating the menus of an RPG, and deadly  in others (PSX "Asteroids" is unplayable when rotating your ship  sometimes inadvertantly puts you into hyperspace, since that's what  "up" does). Also of note is the fact that this controller works  only with games written to use Apple's "InputSprockets".  That's  true of most late 90's / early 2000's games, but not of some earlier titles  ("Descent", which used to be bundled with Mac Performas, comes to  mind), and it's not clear if Sprockets will be supported in the upcoming  Mac OS X. That said, driver installation is easy and has been hassle-free  on my two iMacs and my iBook.  USB plug-and-play almost always works  without a snap, though I've found it's better to plug it in once the Finder  is up instead of during the boot cycle. If you play lots of Mac games  (and by the way... HOW?!), this is better than relying on mouse/keyboard  alone, but the D-pad problems are a major aggrivation.	-1
This game was bought and rather farfetched. I hoped it would work and It doesn't play story mode at all. So I'm stuck in training mode and can only play the first training session. A shame.	-1
This will get the job done on most games, however if you want to play games like Street Fighter or any other game that requires directional based special moves, you can forget it. Software on the site allows you to program special move buttons. The buttons are terrible.  They 'mush' down.  They are not springy as they should be.	-1
This thing is very comfortable, for the week or so that it works!  Like some of the other reviewers, and other people I know that own these, the Z button is a BIG problem.  After the week or so that I said it will work, the Z button caves in, and there is no real way to get it out.  I tried taking it apart. and it didn't really help.  The rest of the controller, however, was better than the original.  But many games can't be played (at least to their fullest) without the Z button!  It might be more comfortable and accessible, but it's still a horrible product!  What a joke.  InterAct should be ashamed.  FOR GOD SAKES, BUY THE REAL CONTROLLER!!!	-1
I'm slow to give a 1-star rating, but this certainly takes it.  First, the grip is hard.  The grip it thin and small extends vertically from the controller.  The Z-Button on all three of the ones I got broke within a month after moderate use.  The controller gets greasy SO easily.  Never, ever get this, no matter how desperate you are to save money.	-1
This is just like an arcade game you play at a bowling alley or something.  For those who like those kinds of games then maybe the game would work for you.  But I found this game extremely boring and no fun	-1
Save your money and get Roller Coaster Tycoon (1, 2, or 3). Sim Theme Park's graphics look like total s***.	-1
This is the Worst Game i ever bought the first time i bought it there was a problem with it and then the 2nd time its was still broken and had a problem with it don't waste ur money on it its so not worth it i still have the game but i've never been able to use it since its so messed up	-1
Sure it was fun for the first hour then it died. I could never get the kids to stop vandalism. Riding the rollercoasters weren't fun at all. You want a theme park game get Rollercoaster tycoon. Rollercoaster tycoon not Rollercoaster tycoon 2, but I won't get into that. Where can I get a refund....?	-1
I guess you could say that this game was pretty much a dissappointment. I probably would have liked it more if I hadn't already bought Rollercoaster Tycoon (even though I'm not really a fan of that game, it's a LOT better than Sim Theme Park). I felt ripped off when I found out that there were only four theme parks to choose from, which made this a very short lasting game. Another major problem is - you can even build your own rides! Talk about cheap. Overall I give Sim Theme Park 2 stars, I gave the extra star because I probably would have liked it more if I got it before I got Rollercoaster Tycoon. Actually, this game is pretty good for all ages, it's just leaning a little more towards the younger kids, about I guess 6-12. If you want a game for older gamers, try Rollercoaster Tycoon. (I suggest that you just ditch the thought of buying a game about building amusement parks and get a game like The Sims or somehting).	-1
I thought this game looked like it would be great-- but it turned out that it was boring, irritating, not to mention that it has bugs- my computer is almost brand new, and this game would crash every five minutes. A few months later I bought Roller Coaster Tycoon, and I became addicted to it- I LOVE it!  If you are interested in this game, I recommend that you buy Rollercoaster Tycoon instead, it's a lot more fun, and it doesn't have bugs- don't waste your money on Sim ThemePark!	-1
Sim ThemePark was not what I saw coming. Right when I got it, I popped it into the CD-Rom on the computer. I was so excited! But then, the downside comes along. The installation takes forever. I had to try again to make it work. Then, it takes forever just to get into the game. And when I finally got into the game, the colors were all screwed up. Okay, so I messed with some hardware on the computer, but even after my mom fixed it, they still wouldn't work right!! And whenever I go into the game, it gets stuck right after I click "quit". So I have to restart the computer completely. Since the day I first got this, this game has not seen the CD-Rom. At all. I am looking into Roller Coaster Tycoon, and am hoping that it will work much better than this. Thank you for reading my review!	-1
Ok, I'm a HUGE fan of Sim-stuff ... I can't get over how clever they are, how real they play out, how absolutely consuming they can be. This product is not one of them. It's awkward, it's punchy, and buggy. It  restricts your creativity in a way that I've yet to experience in any other  Sim game. You are limited to two island scenarios to begin, and they are in  themes like Dinosaur, and Space Ship ... and they are VERY tiny -- not much  to work with.  Creative-wise, you are stuck with rides that are typical to  that particular theme -- IE: your park attendees bounce up and down on a  dinosaur's stomache as one of the rides. *shudder* I think the game is  ideal for children 10 and under. It's fun and quirky enough to entertain  them, but it's not what you'd typically expect, as an avid adult player,  from a Sim game. Try Roller Coaster Tycoon if you're an adult fan of  simulated amusement park game software (but even that gets a bit dull after  a while -- it's easy to win and repetitive). Or try The Sims, it's quite  entertaining, and very well put together.	-1
I LOVED Theme Park and Theme Hospital, RCT is the best Sim game around so I had high hopes that Theme Park World (as its called in the UK) would go one step further. Basically this is a kiddies game. Its NOTHING like  Theme Park and your very limited to what you can do. There are fun rides  and the best part is walking round the park and going on your rides but you  don't have the same amount of control as in RCT. Its nice to look at  (although I didn't like the 3D style) and you need a good spec machine  otherwise expect jerkovision (or if you build too many rides). Theres only  4 parks/scenarios!  unlike RCT where there are loads plus an add on pack).  My nephew liked taking pictures of the park and emailing them but it has  taken a whole new view point into Sim games. This isn't a true Sim game  -  I think we need a bit of going back to basics here and seeing what makes a  Sim game. Just look at Theme Hospital and RCT. It also loses marks for  having the only online help assistant who is more annoying then the  MS-Office Paperclip one! (Luckily you can turn him off!) I stopped  playing it after a week. So will true Sim Fans. Bring on another RCT add on  pack!	-1
Well there's a lot of ways this game could have been fun, IF only they had tried to put more into it, ok it says on the front box that you can chose from 4 different types of parks, In reality all the parks are the same,  just different animation, they all have a feris wheel, flying bird thing,  ect... The little talking advisor cannonball in the corner is insanely  inoying, and yet they make it so that you HAVE to have him to play the  game, other wise you'll not be able to get to problems in time. I mean are  programers IDIOTS?  Do they think that a little cannonball making bad  jokes and talking in the most annoying voice you have ever heard is what we  really want to have as an advisor? And why do they animate the kids and  everything in the cut sceens so unrealistic and stupid looking? In almost  every game programers feel that they need to make humans look as stupid as  possible, why? Its not funny, it demotes the animators intelegence. Anyways  the only thing thats really good about it is that you can ride your own  roller coasters, and you can turn the little cannonball guy off!  Although it will be harder to manage without him.	-1
In the exact sense of the word, the game cheated me. The suspense built up by the time you finish the third level culminates in one of the most shocking and innovative pieces of plot I have seen to date. What's the  problem? The remainder of the plot is a piteous attempt to bring the  innovation and tie it onto the "and all was well" ending. The  graphics are amazing, although there is way too much green, and you spent  less time in original-looking levels than in the "normal" ones.  Nevertheless, from the beginning, they look quite surreal and amazingly  life-like. More than that - they are aesthetic. The main character is  pretty much non-existent, snce he has no lines, and his only role in the  game is to capture monsters. The battle engine offers far too few choices,  since upgrading your character's equipment is nonsense (he rarely enters  actual combat), and you can't equip your monsters. Therefore, the game's  central and only concept is to go through level after level, capturing and  merging monsters. There's nothing more to the game. Oh, yes, there are  several original parts (you earn money by selling the captured monsters),  but they are too few.	-1
As usual Interact accessories dissapoint. This Tremor Pak jumps too hard for what is taking place on screen and absolutely sucks. The slightest action on screen and it wants to jump out of you hand....not good at all. Instead of adding realism to a game it proves to ba an annoyance! AVOID AT ALL COST. Get the official Sega Jump pak instead	-1
This thing does nothing but shake the heck out of your arms when you play. It is at times comical. It makes your controller rattle, you hear shaking noises, and feel like you are having some sort of seizure. This tremor pack thing will die off in my opinion. It will go the way of Robbie the Robot for the NES. Remember him? Neither does anybody else... It is an interesting idea, but it doesn't really enhance the games. Just because the controller shakes in your hands doesn't mean you feel like part of the game. In fact, with all the shaking, it might even disrupt your game play. You are much better off getting a visual VMU to put in the front slot, at least that enhances your gaming experience. I have this tremor pack and after playing with it for a few hours I took it out and haven't used it since. Don't waste your money on it. That is the best advice I can give.	-1
Won't run on newer computers. Need to be remade for windows 8.	-1
I'm not very happy with this because it wouldn't not load onto my computer and I tried everything I could to try to get it to load no such luck. I got to the point where I just gave up and put it on a shelf and that's where it is but every time i walk past it I get so upset that i spent money on a game that won't load on my computer. What a waste of money	-1
Even when this game first came out, it was fairly mediocre.  Let's move on, shall we?  There are many, many games that topple Half Life and Counter Strike released since 1998. Contrary to what the Amazon editorial had to say about this game, Half Life is not the bloodiest (Soldier of Fortune), is not the smartest (No One Lives Forever), and is not the scariest (System Shock 2 or Clive Barker's Undying). Half Life is a hypefest.	-1
Hey, maybe I'm doing something wrong but, I haven't been able to get this game to do much of anything... the graphics are poor for this day and age and the controls were even worse... I didn't play very long though, so it's not fair to say it truly [stinks]... Maybe I'll try it again and see if I missed something...	-1
The game is honestly one of the best games ever, However it has huge performance issues on modern computers rendering the game virtually unplayable. If you are a stubborn die hard fan like me you will play it this way anyway. Nobody plays online anymore, who can blame them with the problems operating the game, so do yourself a favor and just play starcraft 2 or something else.	-1
I ordered the wrong one.  I downloaded and went to play it, I got as far as single player and when I clicked on it, it wouldn't start so that's the reason I couldn't play it.  Gave it to a friend.	-1
I would probably have had more fun if I hadn't used Age of Empire II before this one. Age of Empire II/Conqueror has so many more functionalities. Not having these functionalities requires much more manual 'handling'. For instance, in AOE II, double-clicking on a unit will select all units of that type present on the screen. It wouldn't work with this version, very annoying. I played 15 hours, just to give it a fair chance, then I gave up. The disk will be forgotten in a drawer, too bad.	-1
I recieved this older game quickly. But I was still playing the new Tomb Raider on PS3 and did not install it on y PC for a couple of weeks. I could not get this agme to work properly on my new computer. It loaded fine and background music worked but the graphics were .. hmm .. stone age looking. No matter how I tried to reconfigure my graphic card it would not adjust to be playable graphics. I deleted it from my computer. I gave it to my son to try and load on his slightly older system, but he hasn't tried to play yet because he is playing his new games. I will update and post what he says about his experience with it.	-1
The game will not load on my Mac. The box says its supposed to. This was a very big disappointment. I was trying to get out of the shooter games.	-1
I loved the first two Gabriel Knight games ("Sins of the Father" and "The Beast Within"). They were creepy, well-researched, and had great atmosphere. Well, "Blood of the Sacred, Blood of the Damned" had great potential -- Rennes-le-Chateau and vampires! Neat! But poor gameplay really squandered that potential. To give you an example of what I mean, one of the puzzles involves getting a vehicle so Gabriel can get from one place to another. A perfectly good motor scooter (I think; it's been a while) is available. But noooooo ... Gabriel refuses to ride something so wussy. He has to have a big motorcycle. So that's the puzzle -- getting the selfish jerk a motorcycle to ride. Let me get this straight. He's a detective trying to solve a case, but he's going to waste time finding a cooler ride? That was the point where I threw the game out the window, so I can't comment on how it ends, unfortunately. The voice acting was pretty lame; I don't know who told Tim Curry he could do a New Orleans accent, but he can't. Now that [the price has dropped], it's worth trying if you're really into Gabriel Knight. Otherwise, there are much better adventure games out there that are also dirt cheap. Try one of them.	-1
If a game doesn't hook me within the first half-hour then I'm just not going to see it through to the end. Homeworld just seemed like Age of Empires: In Space to me and the slow, confusing gameplay really got on my nerves. I know that this game has an Army of fans who will denounce my comments, but I simply could not get into it.  Usually, I like space games and I was hoping that this would have a Star Trek-ish feel to it. I also quite the Wing Commander games and since it only cost me 99p then I thought I might as well give it a go. Call me shallow, but it didn't give me instant satisfaction and uninstalled it after only 45 minutes.	-1
Outlaws is a first person shooter set in the wild west. The story line is you play the hero and have to rescue your daughter from the villan. Built on a dated engine with wonky physics, Dated graphics and a 2.5D design. Very dull gameplay with no atmosphere and a box of rocks AI. Gameplay is nothing but shoot the baddies, Find key, Open door, Shoot more baddies, Find another Key ect ect. Outlaws is very dissapointing.	-1
looks like re-made software and the joystick won't work properly. Sucks.	-1
This is a bad product, no function withs the LOGITEC EXTREME 3D PRO, I  do not have money tu burn.	-1
{YAWN} Very boring disapointing game. Terrible gameplay, graphics, bla bla bla. The cinematics run at an extremely slow frame rate. At least the music is kinda good. I don't recommend this for any god damn gamer. =[...	-1
This is a joke of a game. Let's see, a campaign can be finished in an hour. The AI makes you conclude that enemy fighter pilots have a deep vindictive nature (is mine the only plane in the sky?). All in all, this game is like a new level of computer chess--boring as hell, and yet somehow intelligently scripted [SCRIPTED]!	-1
Starcraft is one of the most annoying games ive ever played. Sure, terran  marines give u a little laugh now and then but the controls are  frustrating. You have to right click(why not the usual left-click?) to  select units and you cant deselect them. Building times are extremely long-  and so are the units. Gameplay on my PC is overall boring and slow( on a  Pentium II 400, voodoo3, 96mb RAM). I have only got up to the third terran  mission then finally gave up. And whats up by only controlling 12 units at  a time? The Command Conquer series lets you control all units you have on  screen. Starcraft's ingame graphics aren't that good, FMV qualty is terrible  and Battle.net gives you a pain in the a** because of its slow server and  few options. Westwood online gives the player more options and is also  faster. All in all, i say the command and conquer series is better - go  play tiberian sun or red alert or any other C&C game - SC isn't worth  your time or money.	-1
The expansion was outsourced to Sierra Online and the quality from Diablo I was not maintained. The expansion does not really add anything: monsters seem out of touch, music, ending are nothing compared to the original. Skip this and go straight from Diablo to Diablo II which is another pure marvel.	-1
On paper Hellfire seems like a great idea. Take a really good game, add a couple additional levels, quests, items and monsters, put in a couple of new classes, and bam: instant winner.  Sadly that doesn't pan out in practice. Part of it is that the Hellfire design feels largely uninspired and lacks the cohesiveness, balance and ingenuity that went into original Diablo. In fact there are only two really good features in Hellfire. The first is the "Jog" toggle that allows your character to run in Tristram. Too bad it doesn't function in the dungeons. The second is the "Search" spell that helps you locate items on the ground. Unfortunately it's a spell, so you have to spend mana on it. Blizzard rolled up both these features in Diablo II in much improved form. As it stands they end up not benefiting Diablo very much.  The rest of the additions are just mediocre or worse. The new character class is fun, but kinda unbalanced, and doesn't really add a lot of depth. Lots of stuff feels tacked on and has an inconsistent art style that doesn't match Diablo's polish. There aren't really a lot of new quests. One (of the two) new area is downright annoying. Some of the best features can only be enabled by editing a special file outside the game.  The worst part of Hellfire is that playing it means making a tradeoff. It is not a seamless expansion to Diablo - it's almost like a separate game. Your Diablo characters aren't portable between Hellfire and the original game, so you have to roll new ones. And while Diablo went on to gain five more patches after Hellfire's release - Sierra only patched their game once... so Hellfire players have to contend with bugs long-fixed in Diablo. In addition to those bugs, Hellfire brings a set of its own, which never got resolved. Hellfire players can't (without hacking the game) play multiplayer. This expansion is not playable on Battle.net. The music in new areas is lacking, and because it isn't read from the CD, the game glitches whenever an item is picked up. The drop system is bugged out the wazoo, to where finding some of the new unique items is actually impossible.  I would really recommend this one only to die-hard Diablo fans. Those without it are not missing out on anything. Sierra tried to pull it off but they just couldn't match that Blizzard standard set by the original game, and the new features aren't worth fighting the bugs and irritants brought on by this expansion.	-1
This is a very dissapointing system. Slow loading, Bad graphics, and terrible games. But it has a good controller.	-1
This controller is an okay replacement for the original SNES controllers, but not as good. The reason why this controller is not as good as the original SNES controllers is because the buttons are not as sensitive to button presses unlike the original which have very sensitive buttons; the buttons after using them for several months or a little bit more start to sink down more inside the controller because the springs are not as strong as the ones in the original controllers are. In addition, they are made cheaper than the original controllers and are not as durable, so they will not last as long. My recommendation is to not buy these controllers and get refurbished original Super Nintendo controllers on (...) or the exact replica version because they use the same exact materials to make those controllers as Nintendo does for their controllers. The only difference is the exact replica's do not have the Nintendo logo on it. I got two refurbished original Super Nintendo controllers from that website and they work excellently and they will last for many years. And another thing about the New Port controllers, the first time you use them, the D-Pad buttons are rather stiff and eventually lossen up after using them for a while and become easier to use. A last warning about the controller, the down function on the D-Pad does not work very good, unlike on the original Super Nintendo cotrollers, the down function on the D-Pad works excellently.	-1
Start and Select buttons got embedded into the controller, so I ended up taking it apart in order to get them out and alter the holes so that the buttons wouldn't get stuck. The wires were poorly soldered on, so they ended up coming off of the board almost instantly.	-1
couldn't use wasted my money they're made only for the Computer	-1
Do yourself a favor. Don't waste you money on these cheap SNES controller knockoffs You're far better off spending a few extra dollars buying the real thing Bought it new and the buttons stopped working after only a couple of days Thanks a lot, TOMEE : (	-1
It functions, so its got that going for itself. It feels very cheap though. Very cheap and hollow. And very light. Noting like a real SNES controller. But I suppose, if you don't care about any of that stuff, it did work. I wouldn't recommend it, though.	-1
I've played this game between 10-20 times and when it kept going it was really fun. "Chaos" was usually the one I played but "Life" was pretty cool too. The battles were pretty good but the AI wasn't all that great. The different characters and units were pretty cool though.  The graphics are so so. They're not terrible but they're not exactly beautiful either.  Unfortunately it crashes after a few minutes or hours so I haven't got to the end of the game ever. I've tried it on two different computers, one being way more poweful than the other one and it just won't play completely on either one. If it'd quit that, it'd be great.	-1
I know what you're thinking... I need another controller. The generic can't be that bad, I might not like it, but I'll be able to play.  No, you will not. You wll hate every minute of this.  As others have said, the buttons are actually ok, but the d-pad will drive you insane. Rage quit-inducing. Don't bother, go out to your local retro store and pick up an actual, old SNES controller. The price will be well worth it. I've pretty much thrown this in the garbage, but I can't seem to bring myself to it for some reason, but it deserves it.	-1
Awful! A real disapointment. This game is confusing and boring much like civilization 2. The game cover made it sound much more exciting than it really was. I bought it a while ago from Rinho and it was bran new then. I was sooo dissapointed. It takes forever to play, the battles are cheesy and a waste of time. If you are considering buying this game, I reccomend you try it before you buy it. Belive me it's not even worth $5. I've always been dissapointed with Sid Meier's games. So I think I'll stop trying them. If your considering this game, try Imperium Galactica 2. It's awsome. No comparison. I hope you found this reveiw helpful.	-1
Sid Meier is a true artist in the realm of software, but with each new addition to the Civilization family the games become more oriented toward conflict and less fun to play. In AC the Believers will appear on your  borders within the first 50 turns and you will never really be at peace  again. Forget about the fun of managing a nation: this is a non-stop  Darwinian struggle to keep your head above water. (Some players might like  this, but I find it tedious.) There's no point in trying to negotiate with  other factions because they'll just turn right around and violate your  territory or declare war. Then after you have spent decades trying to build  up your industry, when your output reaches a certain level the planet  itself will being to attack you with an inexhaustible supply of mindworms.  *Every* game of AC is a race to achieve the victory conditions before the  planet itself defeats you, and there's not much sense of satisfaction in  that. Add to this the fact that the game runs unbearably slowly. You will  spend more time watching units go plod-plod-plod across the screen than you  will playing. I really wanted to like this game, but after a while its  defeatist atmosphere and tedious play just got too wearisome. Let's hope  that in his next game Side remembers that growing an empire is more fun and  challenging than beating one.	-1
This game is very difficult to control and it is extremely boring. It may have been a great game six years ago, but by today's standards this one is a definite loser. Save your money.	-1
Why didn't I just read the packaging and put it down. No, I had to go and buy it. I played Civ II once, Alpha Centauri two or three times, and now Call to Power... well, I didn't make it through the tutorial. One word...  ZZZZZZZZZZZ!	-1
Well, I must say that I was really disappointed by this game! I got my hands on it as soon as it became avayable. Having played for interminable hours with the original Civilization game I had great expectations from  this title. In the end it really turned out to be one of the worst sequels  ever! The MAYOR SHORTFALLS ARE: 1- Game speed. By the time you reach the  space age you will not have been able to explore much of the world, and  will not have been able to build an army from a particular historical age.  Since the speed is so fast, by the time you have an army of, let's say  musketeers, you have already discovered planes and the nuclear bomb. THIS  IS VERY FRUSTRATING!  2- Units: Fewer than its predecessors and less  realistic. 3- The space age: It is only confusing and doesn't really help  to make the game interesting. 4- Unconventional units: You have now lawyers  and eco-warriors that work something like the spies in the original game.  In the end they end up beying only annoying and totally confusing! It would  have been better to add a more sound political and economic sistem to the  game and add a few varibles afterwards (i.e.: political movements and  private enterprise). 5- Customization: It is now impossible to customize  the game, like create new units as it was possible in CIV 2. I hate that!  6- Maps: Lacks a map of earth!  It used to be the only map I played on in  CIV 2! IMPROVEMENTS 1- Graphics: Way better than the predecessors. Too  bad that the other features in the game didn't get quite to the same level!  2- Soundtrack: Improved somehow. 3- Combat: A tactical display now allows  you to actually play battles. Nice idea to start with, but it is somehow  badly put to work and has some incredible bugs (like archers that shoot  down stealth bombers! ). My suggestion?  Wayt for a sequel or buy CIV 2!	-1
This game calls its civilizations "races" and has slavery as a prominet part of the game, but there is the abolition eventually. It does not feel like a successor to Civilization II. The wonders of the world are  all new, as is the technology tree. The interface is new, and you cannot  use a keyboard to move units. I did not care much for its supposedly  improved graphics over Civilization II, I did not see that much  improvement, and by now the graphics are not cutting edge anyway. There  are too many new units and cumbersome rules associated with them. The  cursed televangelist keeps popping up out of nowhere, converting cities and  eating into your empire's resources. The lawyer hides just as you are about  to move a military unit to kill him. Building cities in space and under  water may sound like a lot of fun and a novelty compared to the two  original Civilizations. But playing at lower levels, this won't be  interesting, becuase you will learn how to crush your opponents before  acquiring the technology for underwater and space construction; at higher  levels, the game becomes too difficult and too cluttered with units and  characters to persevere with marine and space existence. The only real  improvement over Civilization II is that governments are more stable during  war. In Civ II, if you wanted to wage a serious war, you had to install  monarchy or fundamentalism, or your government would collapse. Bottom line:  maybe it's because I am older, but I did not enjoy this game as much as  Civilization II. What comes out of "Call to Power" screams for  help to bring more original and well-crafted games to the market.	-1
This game can be described in a few simple words, boring, repeaditive,  bad, pointless.	-1
I would rent this game. It takes no skills what so ever to beat it. Maybe it just came naturally to me, or maybe I'm just to critical but this game is not worth buying. In my opinion this game would only appeal the the 8-11 age range and even then would they only play it once or twice.	-1
I was a big fan of Parappa the Rapper and I was seriously disappointed with this sequel. It's bad enough that you can beat it in 30 minutes, but what's worse is that you wouldn't want to! The music is just bad and that is inexcusable for a music game. Where are all the catchy tunes? I can't remember one line from this game, whereas I have all of Parappa the Rapper's songs memorized. It's missing those great lyrics found in Parappa like my favorite: "Sunny in my life, she's like a dice, I can't tell which way to turn 'till I spice!" Skip UmJammer and get Parappa.	-1
Ok so i get the idea that you are a glove rolling on a ball. Hmmmm. Ok well here goes. If you liked this game, you are an IDIOT! HELLO GUYS YOU ARE A GLOVE! WHAT THE HECK IVE NEVER HEARD OF SUCH AN IDIOTIC CHARACTER! A GLOVE! FOR GOODNESS SAKES, IVE HEARD THAT ORIGINALITY IS GOOD, BUT THIS? ok i will stop yelling. But jeeze guys cant you see that only some kind of fool would actually enjoy playing as a glove that can balance on a ball? Well I can. So I'm out, enough said.	-1
i saw the TV comercial for this game and it looked pretty cool but when i got it for christmas it got very boring i mean all u do is try to get to the other end of the level with ur ball and collect cards so there isn't much to this game i wouldn't reccomend this game 2 many people	-1
I have played few games that were as funny as this one. Why? Take a bunch of game developers who hated the average controls of survival horror games, get a bunch of inept writers to scribble down a derivative plot with a nice hook and horrible dialogue, music composers who aspire to be better than John Williams, game designers who played WAY too many Super Mario games and anyone in marketing or professional game reviewing to pass the game off as a Survival Horror game and you've got a painfully hilarious game on your hands. This game doesn't do Sega any justice and don't believe the lie that this was their first Survival Horror game, they made their first two years before this on the Saturn and that game, Deep Fear, was art compared to this. I felt absolutely lied to when I played this game thinking I was in for the scare of my life when I found myself rolling on the ground after witnessing some of the silliest character models, inconsistent soundtrack, awkward dialogue, non-existent atmosphere, incomprehensible plot and obnoxious controls I've ever played on a DreamCast game. Your characters run so slow you'd think they had weights tied to their ankles, but their steps look so played out it's almost like they're waddling away from danger! You'll kill monsters who, despite being four legged monstrosities, will literally sprinkle you with gold coins! The overly dramatic music will play on and loop over and over again when nothing is happening! You want a farce? You've got nothing but farce in Blue Stinger.	-1
Well, it won't work at all. I put it in my console, and nothing. I looked it over carefully to make sure I didn't buy some...knock off, but it even has etched trademarks, ext. It doesn't recognize the disk at all. So I went to the Activision site to see if I could find some help on this game. And this is what they said... Problem Does not load and play. Solution Activision has identified a manufacturing problem with regards to its Dreamcast title Blue Stinger. The manufacturing issue involves only a limited percentage of the total product available in stores, but will result in start-up failure on certain Dreamcast systems. If you experience this problem, we encourage you to call 1-888-402-8951 and The Blue Stinger Hotline will send you a new disc free of charge. You will be asked to return the faulty copy of Blue Stinger directly to the fulfillment house. A prepaid, self-addressed mailer will be provided for their convenience. Activision is dedicated to promptly delivering replacement discs to affected consumers. We would like to extend an apology to you for the inconvenience, but are confident that once this problem is corrected, you will have an outstanding gaming experience with Blue Stinger and the Dreamcast hardware. So, I just wanted to post this for anyone else that has this problem, or will have this problem in the future. So far I have only got their answering machine. Let's see if they are still supporting this title and call me back:o) Craig UPDATE:  Talked to someone from Activision.  He was kinda floored that there were still faulty copies out there:o)  Guess it's been awhile since it was out.  Anyway, they replaced it as promised.  But, the games really [stinks]!!!  Don't bother.  It's been a while since I even had my Dreamcast hooked up, so I don't remember what it was that I didn't like about the game.  But, I do remember that I knew this was a really bad game in about ten minutes of playing it.  Wasn't even worth my time getting it replaced.	-1

You get what you pay for.. what can I say this game really wasn't what I expected.. graphic old, and getting around in the game is clumsy at best... can't recommend...	-1
do not like this game it's not the typ of game i like to play. it's morew for a child, im 64 and enjoy games like airborn,pacific assult, and world at war, it's not what i thought.	-1
I have most of the major flight sims and now I have this and have only worked with it a bit but I find it a little too overcomplicated, it's taxing even for someone who is a flight simmer and is already flight tested and combat tested. The graphics are good but first there was the necessity to download a patch which at 25mb is the largest game patch I've ever seen, the list of fixes is enough to make you question why they released it in that form anyway. Although the amount of interactivity is less with the bombers in Janes Attack Squadron so is the level of overhead. If you are really a B17 nut though and you want total realistic immersion in that plane then you'll like the sim.	-1
Well I received this title over the weekend, and still have not been able to get it off the  ground. This is what I am having problems with and have encountered getting technical  support (a nightmare!!). Game Problems: 1. Going to 'instant action' from the main game menu, I am presented with a CTD (Crash To Desktop), which means the game crashes, and your back at your desktop. 2. In The game, you need to review crew status, mission briefings ,etc. well so far I can not view these, do to they don't appear while in the game. Applied the latest patch (v1.06) to correct allot of the bugs and CTD, and still have the above problems. Now the Nightmare!: * Web Sites mentioned, do not work - Either receive a blank page, 404 Not Found, or Virtual Directory: Access denied error. * Phone Support - They have changed their number already from the one in the manual. Called the new number, and was thrown into a loop from a dysfunctional automated phone system. And then finally was told I was in a 60 minute call waiting queue. * E-Mail support - Received an auto response saying their e-mail address is no longer valid. I was then pointed to a new web site which pointed me back to the original Hasbro Interactive Dysfunctional web site. So I am preparing to send this piece of junk back for a refund. This is the LAST Hasbro/Micrprose software that I buy.	-1
Loser! The cars in this game don't leave behind any dust, they bite the dust! It's no wonder that Activision didn't dare tie this game directly into Interstate '76. There is just no comparison to the classic game. I would love to compare this game but since Activision isn't doing that I won't either. Let's go down the list of Graphics, Control, Game Play, Sound/Music, and Fun Factor. That will give or take one star for each category. Graphics: Where does one start on the graphics? As far as the level of detail and the amount of destruction available, it is indeed a very good game. Games of this nature tend to over simplified with little or no detail in the buildings and surrounding terrain. Activision programmers spent a lot of time on the details in the game, I wish they spent the same amount of time on the game's engine. The game engine plays like a first generation game. There is such an incredible amount of popping, crazing, stretching, and disappearing polygons, any good programmer should have never allowed this kind of thing to even leave his development PC. For those out of the loop I'll define the problems. Popping- Terrain popping up out of no where. Programmers usually solve this with careful use of fog. Yes folks, that is the true use of fog. However fog in this game is under utilized. Almost like it was thrown in at the last minute. Crazing/Stretching- This tends to be very similar. Various walls or architecture seems to twist or stretch into bizarre angles. If you have the game drive the car directly up against a vertical wall and you'll see it. The level with the lighthouse is a prime example. Disappearing polygons- This is a serious no no in games. Drive to the edge of any arena until the car "bounces" if you can get the proper slope of land (about a 45 degree angle.) and the camera swings low enough, parts of the ground will disappear and be replaced by a livid blue (or red depending on the generation of PSX console or some other factor). Control: Unfortunately, this game can't decide on Arcadian controls or Real World controls, so it attempts to do a half and half deal. The car's accelerates and steers like it's running through molasses, unless of course it floats, then it feels like it's skimming around on ice. In fact, control's so bad that I tend to get and use the hovercraft mode or the boat mode more often than not. The only major saving grace is that the controls are 100% configurable. I myself don't like the default uses for the buttons. Especially for my style of play which involves using my thumb to press two or three buttons at the same time. (Old School Mario Style if you will.) Gameplay: Game play is frustrating at best. (Why is the "Arcade" mode listed before "Quest" mode?) The various modes of the game should be fun, but really, are more of a frustrating exercise in patience. Past experience tells me that arcade mode is a great way to "practice" the details of the game. In this case, it actually is set up that way. Hints and tips are handed to you before each battle. Cars can be limited in number and difficulty. And goals are clearly defined. However, actually doing all of this takes a bit of work. The number of "configuration" screens one must churn through is heart breaking. Whatever happened to a "simple" game session? And the enemies seem to be overly ruthless. Whereas quest mode seems to be the easiest of the modes, having blasted through 4 of the drivers in the first few hours of playing. I really didn't have much patience to even try the survival mode. Sound/Music: I try not to review music or sound in games but in this case it will be the only whole star for this game. The music is indeed sweet to listen to. The tunes are strangely familiar, but I can't place my finger on it. It also appears that there is one song for each of the characters to play. The book lists 15 characters and I believe there are 15 songs. It's quite fun to try and match the songs to the characters. The music would have been a blast if they used real world 70's music but alas, the licensing would be too much. The only annoying sound effect is those stinkin' UFO's. Kind of makes me want to turn the CD into a UFO. Fun Factor: Fun Factor can't get much lower. The only fun things here is the quest mode and two player mode. It's always nice to play ANY game with two players, especially one that lets us rag on it like it's Elevator Action (Waaay back in the NES days.) The quest mode is nice for those late night no-brainer sessions where your brain is too fried to think about anything else. Sorry if this review is just as jumbled as the game itself. Watching the game world twist and spin in sickening ways scrambled my poor brain. The results? Half a star for graphics but bad engine. No stars for the controls. No stars for game play. One star for music and sound. And half a star for the fun factor. That's all. Hope Activision's third attempt isn't a . . . dump.	-1
This expansion pack (EP) was a complete wast of my time, and money.  It adds a couple new magical weapons and armor, some new spells and a couple new areas to explore.  There is no plot to the the EP, just some NPC saying  "Oh I lost my son in Durlags Tower. . . ." and stuff like that.  The only thing that made this EP worth two stars is that they cleaned up a  lot of the rough edges from Baldurs Gate, and increased Experience points  to a point where your fighter and like one other class can go up a level.  By the way, it is just one more disk that you have to flip through if you  decide to replay Baldurs Gate.  In conclusion don't buy this EP, it isn't  worth it, unless any new EP's come out that require it.	-1
This game sucks ass. period. The new vehicles are ok sometimes, but all are slow and horrible to control. The new powerups are retarded , such as skis to go over water but at an even slower pace by 5 times. The old vehicles, and kooky characters are all gone, as is the storyline and anything else fun from the original. Oh, by the way, this was also made by a different company, which is the reason for all this horribleness. So , in summation, stick to the first on e til they come out with a 3rd one on a new system.	-1
This sequel to Vigilante 8 has taken a backseat to the first and gone way downhill, crashing into burning flames and leaving nothing but a huge wreck. And instead of rating it high and then commenting on how much I want to play this game, or complain about it not being delivered, I'm actually reviewing the game from having actually played it!!!  The graphics may be slightly better then the 1st version, but the game-play has come down badly. Tho it is fun for a few seconds to have your vehicle slide down ski-slops, or get picked up by crane magnets and ski-lifts, or have your car blown off the road by jet engines, the vehicles response is horrible compared to the first. You have less control this time, the car won't do the 360's properly, and in lighter cars, you spend more time upside down trying to flip back over, because of opponents rockets, then anything else.  The levels seem much smaller too. Someone said there is 50 levels, what are you on about? There is not 50 levels.... it would have been nice to be able to unlock some of the levels of the last one, but instead you have to play the new ones, which have more potholes, things to crash and fall into then anything fun to do.  Even if no one wanted to add some of the original stages, they should have at least added some of the original vehicles. Nothing has come back, every car is new. Some are interesting, like the moon-buggy's, motorbikes, bug-bug, and a range of other vehicles, but there's no way to enjoy testing them because you cant control any of them. The speed of the cars is boringly slow! There is a code to make them faster, but that only results in worse control of the vehicles. The worst control is when trying to control your vehicles upgrade... You find things on the track that transform your vehicle into some other modified craft. Most of them change into a "Back To The Future II" style Sky-way-Flier. It looks cool at first, but you have no control over it. Also the spaceship from the original is no where to be seen.  There is some new weaponry, like a flame thrower, but opponents seem to now drive shielded vehicles and it now takes 100 times longer to destroy someone. Also, the rockets and pink projectile things are about all that's found in most levels, there is a few new things like specials being easy to find but what happened to the mini-gun? It seems to have almost completely disappeared and it's annoying looking for weapons inside buildings when you cant control a vehicle to get in there quick enough.  Even with codes, this game was still no fun. You need the invincibility code, but some of the codes like Monster Truck Wheels sounds like fun, but it's nothing to brag about, you just keep slipping around with no control as usual.  Overall, stick with Vigilante 8. Don't bother with this sequel. It's a downgrade from the 1st. On one player anyway, I haven't tried the multiplayer, but take my advice if you intend to play one player. It's not worth it. It's all graphics and no fun.	-1
This game is nothing more than a sick joke.  Really the story absolutely sucks (what motivates one through twenty hours of gameplay?), the humor tries to be funny but comes across as stale, the environment is tedious and boring, the difficulty is Schizophrenic i.e. hikes constantly especially when you fight against the Enclave.  It's like the game itself is a parody of the original Fallout.  If you want a masterpiece of a game, buy the original Fallout instead of this junk.	-1
I bought this game for my 7 year old son, expecting it to be a good one.  The graphics are average (better graphics can be found with Spyro, year of the dragon), and the levels are very frustrating, I found myself throwing the controller away several times trying to help my son get through the levels, even though I consider myself a good gamer.  I finally recommended my son to play Spyro the dragon instead to avoid anymore frustrations.  I won't recommend anyone to get this game.	-1
I tried using the game on the PS1 and PS2, and neither worked. This game is a lightscribe disc, and looks to be mass produced by someone.	-1
horrible graphics, mindless games, hnow the heck did u give it 5 stars???	-1
Maybe it is because I have a Mac version but I was really really enjoying this game when my band of characters stopped going up in experience levels.  I contacted the company but was told that that is just the way the game is.  Yes, I do like a challenge but I play computer games to relax too and without an advancement in level I don't see how to win this game.  I was very very disappointed.	-1
WTF is this crap, this is metroid not castlevainia......this sucks.  PS stop making castlevainia into gay manga garbage it takes all the thrills and scary aspects out of it by making everyone look like a woman with multi colored hair.	-1
When I received this game I opened it up and right away started installing it, but wait in all the excitement i didn't notice it being in the cardboard CD holder and because it was the installation wouldnt work why? Cause the CD was scratched beyond repair. Good job Interplay. I will right another reveiw when I receive my new package telling you if the game is as bad as Interplay's packing job.	-1
It doesn't make any sense.  How can this game be considered a classic?  It has WAY too many flaws for people to continue naming it "best game of all-time" or "best Castlevania game you'll ever play". I don't think so.  If you want a "real" Castlevania game, go play Castlevania 64 for the N64.  That's how a Castlevania game should be done.  Not like Symphony Of The Night, which is basically a complete disaster with its many inexplicable problems. Don't believe me?  You will soon enough.  First and foremost, Konami must think all Castlevania fans are forgetful and dumb.  You see, the game begins with you playing as Richter, and you're back in the final stage of the previous Castlevania game fighting Dracula.  This is ridiculous.  I don't want to play THAT game, I want to play Symphony Of The Night.  You don't have to redo the final fight with Wart in the beginning of Super Mario Bros. 3.  So you shouldn't have to start off Symphony Of The Night by going back and fighting the final boss in the previous game.  What the hell is wrong with Konami?  This whole Richter/Dracula thing should have been removed. After that's over, the REAL game begins, but unfortunately that's not true.  It doesn't begin yet.  Immediately a screen is shown of Alucard running to the castle (which you unfortunately have no control over).  Once he's inside and the gate closes, you can now play as him, but wait a minute.  There's no music playing in the background.  A game can't really start if there's no music, because the absence of music makes a game feel empty and unexciting. Luckily, my worst fear didn't come true (that Konami forgot to put music in the game) and you just have to move forward a few steps and battle a few more foes before the music kicks in.  It's about time!  You had me worried there! But then more problems arise.  In the same little area where the music kicks in, you encounter these zombies that come out of the ground and walk towards you, and many times you never see these zombies coming until it's too late and you take a hit.  Pesky little things like this are just one of many reasons this game is almost completely unbearable. Eventually you meet up with a young lady named Maria.  She's extremely attractive, and knows just how to push the right flirting buttons.  And that's a big problem.  The way she seems to come on to Alucard and practically drool all over him is such a turn-on to the player that it's very difficult to move forward and continue on with the quest.  After a Maria encounter, you can't stop thinking about her beautiful pale face, those big beautiful eyes, that smooth relaxing voice, and so then what happens after that is, when you are in the middle of a serious battle, you almost always die because you can't stop thinking about Maria's beautiful face. Konami must not understand that mostly boys play video games.  I shouldn't have to say it, but I think it's obvious that the creators of Maria are disappointed in themselves for creating such a good-looking woman, because one look at Maria distracts boys everywhere.  They shouldn't have made her look so pretty.  Because of this, only the strongest male gamers will be able to complete this Castlevania adventure.  Had she been less attractive, guys would be able to better concentrate on the game. You're probably thinking by now "Alright, talk about the actual GAME!"  Okay, I will, but you won't like what I have to say.  It's just really painful for me to pick out all the problems in this supposed classic.  Basically, it all boils down to one thing.  The fact that some weapons in this game are incredibly slow, weak and almost useless.  Yes, I'm talking about the Jewel Sword and the Sword Of Hador.  Konami never should have put these two weapons in the game.  But because they did, we have no choice but to put up with them, and I have no choice but to complain.  These two weapons really drag the game down. I could go on and on about the many problems you will see in this game.  Twice in the game you will have to fight a guy who looks exactly like you, which if you ask me, lacks creativity.  Konami wasted a good opportunity right there to come up with new and exciting bosses to fight, but no, they had to go with the old predictable mirror match. Many enemies have blood fiercely squirting out of their bodies when you attack them, forcing me and my children to look away from the TV screen.  Because me and my children understand that if we look at the screen and see this violence, we will throw up all over ourselves and even worse, we might even have trouble making it through the day without screaming in fear that the same brutal treatment might happen to us if we're not careful.  A little bit of blood is fine, but some of the blood in Symphony Of The Night is a bit too graphic and plentiful.  It's enough to terrorize you.  So the best thing to do would be to try and jump over these bloody enemies so you won't have to attack them, though in many places, avoiding enemies won't be easy. Finally, the biggest problem.  The second castle in the game is just the first castle turned upside down, so it's not really a new castle.  Now that's what I call clumsy.  Between the smutty actions of Maria and the blood all over the place, it feels like I'm watching a porno blood fest.  Not a pretty thought, is it?  So as you can see, many problems prevent this game from being a classic.  Don't even think about buying it.	-1
I enjoy RPG games. Really, I do. But for some reason, I couldn't get into this one as much as I thought I could. But I've looked at all the reviews  on this board, and most are raving about it. But what I'm also wondering is  if these very positive reviews are from mostly die-hard RPGers, and/or  Dungeon & Dragons fans. I personally do not play D&D, so I'm not  a die-hard. But I did enjoy Diablo, Everquest, Might and Magic 7, and Age  of Wonders, so I'm not against "dungeon-crawl"/fantasy type games  as you may think I am. I did like the "pause" option in Baldur's  Gate, so you can give commands to each of your party's members without  getting thrashed in the meantime, but I didn't care for the graphics. But  to some, that's minor and forgivable if you like the gameplay--I guess I  just didn't. I also prefer faster paced games with a more linear storyline.  But if you prefer a non-linear storyline, and sometimes feeling semi-lost  in a rather large world to explore, that's all the more reason for you to  get this game. I also get a tired of too much repitition. Every battle I  set my formation up, pause, issue relatively the same commands, and  execute. (In Everquest, I only went up to Level 12 and quit, thinking,  what's the point?) So the combat is repetitive, but in Baldur's defense, it  does have a storyline and an ending, unlike Everquest. But it is time  consuming. But if you can afford the time, and you like RPG's, then you'll  love this title, otherwise, spend your gaming money elsewhere.	-1
i don't know why others rate this so highly - the graphics are OK, i love the fact that you can play with friends (although in the end are different schedules ruined this) and i like importing my own pictures. But the  controls for this game are absolutely frustrating! Some minor gripes:  the manual doesn't have enough info, combat used to be a MAJOR pain until i  stumbled over the pause commands (and had to play with them to figure out  which ones to set), having the main character enter a store makes life  frustrating for other LAN players, the plot doesn't seem multiplayer  friendly (you lose all those NPCs which are important to the story - the  party is so small), the maps don't make a ton of sense, group movement can  be really annoying and my number one complaint: you can't use arrow keys to  move your character!  i know, it sounds minor, but the view screen is only  large enough to show a few tiles, so you have to scroll the screen, click a  destination point, by which time your guy has already walked there so you  scroll some more, repeat - it gets so that you never actually see your  character because you're so busy setting way points for him to walk. At a  minimum, if you have to play this carpal-tunnel torture of moving your  characters leg by leg, you should at least be able to make the screen  center on the character - the little guy just walks off the screen and you  don't know where he went. At a minimum, let me see more of the map at one  time - i have a 19" monitor and prefer looking at what's happening  rather than the large pretty pictures some artist drew. The plot's OK,  the D&D system is pretty sophisticated, there's some real polish in  places and we've needed a good RPG for a while (i LOVED Fallout, which had  lousy, but still vastly superior, map and movement controls), so i got the  game the very first day it was released (xmas eve), and my roommates and i  played it for 2 weeks, but eventually i got so sick of the control scheme  that i just erased the frustrating thing	-1
Is it possible for a game to be TOO realistic?  The graphics are excellent, and there's a lot of bass to everything.  Now, shall I go into the negative parts?  I'm against the claim that video games cause violence  in the populace, but this game nearly changed my opinion.  In Kingpin, it's  "f-this" and "f-that," and "Don't look at my  (expletive)."  Even casual talk has the F-word butting into the  conversation, and I was very disgusted with the conversations that my  character engaged in.  I returned the game soon after I installed it  because I thought the "gritty" subject matters detracted from the  "fun factor" of the game.  How can one have fun cussing and  killing other people that cuss back?  Sure, Quake and other games are  violent,  but not as wanton, gratuitous, and obscene as THIS game.  I admit  that I like some violence, but not even *I* would defend Kingpin from  accusations of youth violence.  Aside from that, bullets leave exit marks  on the opponents, but so does the crowbar, the levels are very confusing,  making you run in circles, and objectives are very vague.  Heed the rather  large warning labels on the box PLEASE.  This game is DEFINETELY NOT for  kids...and even some grown-ups!	-1
A lot of good reviews--two perfect 5 star reviews even. Amazon.com gets to choose which reviews are "featured", so that's not really much of a surprise. You should definitely read more reviews. The graphics are okay, but the design of the graphics in this game are considered to be very cartoonish by many. Bright oranges, glowing blues, and odd color assortments await you in this game. Do yourself a favor and search for the original Battlezone. That was a game I played so many years ago I can't even remember when, but I remember clearly the missions and the specific gameplay elements because it was so good. The story made more sense, the missions didn't tell you exactly what to do (you had to figure it out, which was the fun part), and the overhead map was accessible from the push of a button rather than getting out of your vehicle all of the time. To summarize what these reviews (on the first page) are all leaving out: - You'll have to get out of your vehicle constantly. Because the drivers of other vehicles just aren't smart enough to do the job themselves. You'll also have to do this to access the tactical map, the only way of ordering units around without actually driving there (by which time the units in question will have already been destroyed, too little, too late) - Missions aren't involving, and the story doesn't continue from the original game. In short, there's really not much of a story, as you'll find yourself doing strange things that you've been ordered to do for no apparent reason - Interface is cluttered, buttons rearrange themselves based on the order that you built things, and it's a nightmare finding the right keys to press during the heat of battle. In many games, the only deciding factor of whether you'll win or lose is if you find the right keys fast enough	-1
Ok, by reading the reviews of the people here, I can see someone has figured this game out.  I bought it not realizing it had missions where you had to do certian thing at certain times.  I thought this was going to more of a graphics rich version of Dune 2000 or Tiberian Sun...was I dissapointed. It takes forever just to get to play a mission.  The mission starts loading up and someone starts talking, I guess giving a little story to the mission you are about to play.  But, I can see that it's all loaded up within a few seconds, but the person just keeps talking.  I can't get it to skip past that so I can go ahead a play.  This is very frustrating.  In a nutshell, I stopped trying to figure it out and went on to buy another game to play.  Get something else, this sucks.	-1
$43...As I write my review the game is selling for $43.  I sold my copy 4 months ago on here for 9.99 and it wasn't the lowest price.  What the heck is going on here.  Clearly the folks paying the silly price have not seen the gameplay or read a correct unbiased review.  I purchased my copy on clearance (I was the original owner) for 1.99 back in the day and even then I thought I overpaid.  The storyline is vague, the characters are too similar and from what I could stand...the same scene appears to take place with different baddies over and over again.  And this game is $43??  The definition of insanity  ...	-1
This game could do alot better than it really did. It takes way to long to build something or to train something. But it has a good storyline where its humans against orcs. I do enjoy watching them battle it out and ending in a gory death. The land isn't detailed enough. What this game lacks is details.	-1
I love Sarge's Heroes, but Sarge's Heroes 2 is not my favorite. I ordered the first one in it's "original" box. What I got was Sarge's Heroes 2 in a custom aftermarket Sarge's Heroes 1 box. The first edition of this game is more valuable than the second and I paid for the first. I reported the problem and they asked me to ship it back to them, however the shipping and handling outweighs the weight of the game as a whole, so I suppose I just got the crappy end of the stick...	-1
This game stinks. Anyone who liked the intense and realistic qualities of the first Army Men game will be disappointed with this effort. The 2 player mode has been destroyed, the beautiful graphics and environments are gone, the fast and smooth control is gone, there are no more allies to assign for  attack or defense, the operation of hand grenades, bazookas and mortors is  inferior, in the one player mode the tank is not able to smash a wooden  fence. There is an annoying arrow at the feet of the character which points  you in the direction of the enemy thus taking the fun and suprise out of  setting ambushes, the global ban on land mines has reached this game as  players are not able to set mines. The sound effects have been emasculated,  no piercing death screams. No jeeps, no .50 caliber guns. This game must  have been designed for the N64 as it does not come close to living up to  the high standards of the 1st game (Army Men 3D)for the Playstation.  If you like combat reality games buy the  excellent Medal Of Honor, it is everything that this game is not.	-1
I rented this game from blockbuster and hated it. I played it for about three minutes then turned it off. The graphics are pukey, the controls are pukey, the sound is pukey, and everything around it is pukey. Don't rent it, don't buy it. Thank You.	-1
This popular title has a lot going for it - good graphics, excellent maneuvering and physics, and style to boot. However, the difficulty is much too high for even heardcore gamers. There seems to be something truly amiss with the makers of the game - despite the negative comments regarding gameplay, the game's sequel, Driver 2 (PSX) is actually harder than the original. In order to make the game playable, you either have to apply a patch released by Infrogrames or play in cheat mode. Then it will become only _barely_ playable. Unless you can find a cheap copy, avoid.	-1
I got this game for ten bucks on the bargain pile. It blows it is a boring extremely hard game. I liked the movie option, graphics and real car phisics. The story was okay not great. The controls were horrible. The missions are extremely unforgiving and hard boring. The first mission took us 3 weeks to fufill. Also your stuck in the car driving around. The missions are so hard by the time you know how to beat them its just memerizing a boring path. It's not even challenging fun. It is more like boring impossible!! Also you can't see in front of you. I'm still on the first city. On the good side you can go to a option you have called take a ride which allows you to go out and wreck havac in the city and have cops chase and then turn the car chases into movies. Also there are driving games like pursuit and Getaway, carnage, surviver and time trials ect. There fun for a while you can also turn them into movies. Also I think this has much improovement from the PS1 version by far. But still this game is horrible. The story mode is by far the most hard boring and unforgiving I've ever seen. If you want a fun wide variety driving game for the PC reserve GTA3.   Pros: Lot's of non story games   Good Graphics   Way better than PS1 version   There is movie editor   Real Car fisics   Some might like Story   Cons: Boringly Hard Story Mode   Bad Controls   Game is Uneccesasseraly hard   Can only stay in car   Huge lack of Mission Variety   Large Lack of Car Variety   Game gets incredably boring and hard   Missions very unforgiving   Probily takes at minimum 15 restarts to complete a average missions   Cops will start a dangerous car chase for speeding and don't stop when you stop to them   Cops to easily provoked   Cops go to dangerous lenghts to get you for a minor violation.   Unrealistic and Dangerous Cop AI   Can't run over Padestrians   So if you want a wide variety driving game where you can get out of a car and get in another and more mission variety reserve GTA3.	-1
This rumble pak is too big, uses up batteries rapidly, it's so heavy that you hardly ever feel the rumble, Nintendo should have built-in rumble in thre controllers this sucks.	-1
Don't get you hopes to high, this game with s horrible. Try paper Mario.	-1
this game is a monster sized pain in the butt.you cruise around far slower than everyone else.the weopons are never there when you need them.you get totaly screwed when you get hit by one however and of course the computer gets like barely fazed at all.then theres the whole booger,herpes,poop aspect.once again,nothing funny about that guys.can we grow up already?	-1
Did not work at all on genuine N64 with various controllers.	-1
I read lots of great reviews for this game that made me want to play it.  It will not play on my XP.  Talked to a lot of other gamers that tried to help but nothing worked.  Am holding onto it in case I can get a chance to play it on another computer.  I don't think it is XP compatible.	-1
I saw this game, rented it from the store, and brought it home. It took me an hour to beat the game 100%, and the graphics were awful. They were pointed all over, and looked worse than Lara Croft from Tomb Raider I. I would not reccomend buying this game enless you're a first time gamer or under 8 years old. Rent, don't buy if you're older.	-1
I was excited when i got this because i had trouble finding the right one. However when first plugged in it seemed to work fine. Then after only 2 min of game play it stopped working on ch3. Ch4 worked but it was fuzzy and no sound. I then called the company i purchased it from and they offered no help. Not happy about this product.	-1
What I expected was another Total Annihilation, but obviously I was at err, I don't know who made this game but if it was the original design team of TA then they were smoking somethin that made pretty colors dance across the screen. Ok, bottom line, TA kingdoms is by far the worst possible  stradegy game ever! It is SO slow on my P2 450mhz computer( after I got  about 50 units or so) it was ridiculas! I mean it was like watching your  units walk through glue because the game slows down so bad, it took my  little army of 30 units 15 minutes to reach the enemy base! Also 3D  acceleration for this game is non-existent! In the original TA the computer  cheated, but it wasn't to an extream sence, here they made it ten-fold!  Whenever you aren't looking over the enemy's base, they make units in 3  seconds or less, they can make thousands of units with only one lodestone  in place! its ridiculously IMPOSSIBLE in skirmish(when you are just getting  your defences finished they will have those plus a 30+ army coming to  attack your base) and just plain weird in campaign mode. Do not buy this  game, buy the original TA, its WAY better, trust me. Avoid Kingdoms like it  is a urine cup used to serve apple juice!	-1
I love the story and this is what started the series, but I hate the game itself in terms of gameplay. The controls are a bit unresponsive, the combat is a joke and the prima strategy guide is an outright marketing scam. I just had to tell the truth of what I think about this. The gameplay is so bad for me that it just ruins the entire thing for me. I'd rather just watch someone play it with no commentary.	-1
When I got this game I played it for about 2 days and decided it sucks. Then after a couple of weeks I played it again because some friends said it was cool. I thought I should give it another chance and I played it with friends, but the game just doesn't appeal to me. It's quake 1/2/3 for me! (even though 3 was a bit disappointing). I don't get how everyone just seems to like UT. This is the game that got me back to playing games that actually have a story.	-1
I don't know what everyone else sees in this game and why they consider it so addicting and cool, it, like Quake 3 is just mindless shooting only leaving you angry. Everyone in the UT community rocket jumps, a cheap way of getting a quick kill, and very annoying at the same time. This game is plagued with rocket jumping! There are alot of things I hate about this game, too many to list here anyway.	-1
This game is fun to play, but the graphics are terrible.  The terrain is green, with some very sparsely placed trees and signs.  It is fun to beat down other racers with pipe, chain, hammer, etc... but the bikes are nearly impossible to control at full speed.  The expansion pack for the N64 is the biggest waste of money i've ever spent.  It does NOTHING to help the graphics or sound quality.  multi-player saves it from the graveyard.	-1
It's sad. I always liked the Might and Magic (MM) series. It was fairly simple but the built-in journaling and mapping tools made it less of a pain than other RPGs. Unfortunately MM seems to be frozen in time and this version doesn't appear to have any changes from previous one. There is a new storyline, or more precisely, a new variation of a Might and Magic storyline but graphics, sound, monsters, spells, skills and interface at all the same. I couldn't get the game run with DirectX under Windows 2000, software mode only, although the game is listed as NT-compatible. Keyboard shortcuts would stop working and occasional clipping problems got me stuck and forced a reload to get out. The sound is what really drove me crazy. The character voices can be cut off but not the NPCs. I'll have 'Have a pleasant evening!" ringing in my head for years. For die-hard Might and Magic fanboys only.	-1
not for me	-1
I got this on sale and decided to have a look based on its low price and 5 star rating.  What a joke! It's like Starcraft with bad graphics, zilch instructions and awful controls.  There are better games out there that are free!	-1
Im writing this review about amazon.com on this game I purchased because either Amazon.com or the Seller has issues. What is pictured is the BLACK labeled for sale and under sellers or Amazon.com have no idea about these things maybe. They also have the greatest hit. So this pretty much is lieing to US the consumer about the product we are trying or about to purchase. Everyone just watch out because if you want the BLACK label game and you may receive the GREATEST HITS version of the game.	-1
"I am only left asking, "how long until Daikaitaina 2? "" - Ha-Ha-Ha-Ha-Ha-Ha-Ha! I really tried to like this game. I felt like screaming "Turn the lights on!" during the first level. What a murky morass. I installed this game twice and I still can't stand it. What angers alot of gamers is this: We wonder what games didn't get made because "Daikajokea" sucked up so much cash?	-1
It's technically competent, and indeed 'competent' is a good word. It's  just very, very uninspiring, and after a seemingly endless and tortuous  wait (the release was held back for three years, during which time many of  the creators left the company), it's a disappointment. Not a huge one, as  people were beginning to suspect that it might not be very good. Whilst  'Half-Life' had the advantage of suddenly appearing from nowhere,  Daikatana's gestation was extremely public, despite the 'it'll be ready  when it's ready' attitude. What's it like, though? Dull. That's what.  Whilst by no means as lacklustre as 'Blood 2', it's infected with an air of  carelessness. The graphics and sound are functional, the gameplay is no  more advanced or entertaining than 'Quake 2', the character AI and voice  acting are both simplistic and irritating (your sidekicks are infuriatingly  stupid, and their death instantly loses you the game) and, crucially, both  'Half-Life' and 'Soldier of Fortune' are much, much better, and cheaper.	-1
I rue the day this title came out for Playstation. It was considered so original, it influenced many, many stealth-type games that followed it. Too many.  Where do I start with the things I hate about this game?  1. It's way too difficult. You get awfully sick of hearing "Snaaaaaaaaaaaaaake!" every 10 seconds. There should have been a way to ratchet down the difficulty even further for 'tards like me. "Easy" mode really isn't.  Sheesh.  I wonder what "Hard" mode was like.  2. Way too many cutscenes! I've never seen anything like it. There's one cut scene that goes on for like 30 minutes. This has got to be the talkiest video game I've ever played.  And these dialogues are all so silly, and you're pretty much forced to watch them or you won't be able to understand what's going on. In fact, I would say that most of your time in this game will be spent watching cutscenes. It's not so much a video game as a movie in which you are occasionally allowed to press buttons.  3.  I hate video games that won't let you pause at certain moments, as this won't.  I wouldn't advise playing this if you have a wife or mother who's gonna occasionally ask you to help her in the kitchen:  you'll find yourself saying, "Yeah, I'll help you after this scene finishes . . . in about half an hour!  Not allowed to pause it for some reason!"  4.  Even more excusably, there's not way to pause the cutscenes.  You can't even pause the codec dialogues!  5.  There are many scenes in which the game disables your weapons and accessories for no logical reason other than that if it didn't, the scene would be too easy.  6.  There are far too many boss monsters.  It's like every other encounter is a boss monster.  The first part of the game (say, up until the first encounter with Revolver Ocelot) is pretty great, but that's not representative of the game:  after that it's basically an unending series of boss monsters.  7.  Frustratingly, you have to fight several boss monsters twice because they never seem to die.  Having to "kill" the same boss monster over and over again makes you feel like you're going in circles.  8.  The principals having these deep discussions about delicate emotional issues while an enemy is shooting at them or while a timer is ticking down. Was this written by a 14-year-old?  9.  The system for flattening oneself against a wall is not ready for prime time:  most of the time you find yourself flattened against the wall and you didn't mean to do this.  This will get you killed several times as you are thus basically standing still, allowing your enemies to shoot you.  It should have been running up to a wall in combination with pressing L1 or something.  10.  The way your guy stands there uselessly for about two seconds after choking somebody.  11.  The way you can easily bypass critical lifesaving devices, such as the thermal goggles.  12.  The way the game takes all these cheap shots at you:  you can't look ahead because your radar is "jammed" and then you get shot by a security camera.  Or blown up by a mine.  13.  The way you are prevented, after having killed a boss, from going back into the battle area and collecting the stuff you didn't collect during the battle.  Is it there or not?  So why can't I get it now?  14.  The absurd anti-nuclear message at the game's finale.	-1
I am going to make this short but true.  First off this game is HARD or at least what I played. this game is no Shoot them all like Quake 2 or anything.  I found this game Repugent.  I don't even want to try it again.  I don't care if you have 1000 weapons, if you can't beat the first stage  with Ease, then forget about the rest.  The Graphics in this game are  Dated back to the DOOM age.  This 5 year opus did not pan out like I  wanted.  I really thought John Romero actually had some skill but it seems  not.  The game might have good points but the save system (save only if you  have a crystal?) is an abomination.  This is a horrible idea which is seen  way too much in Console System games, but never should have made it to the  PC.  I admit Ion Storm Made has made a killer game (Deus Ex) but this one  is just a pile of turds.  Bargin Bin Box.  I also just want to close with  this.  We can now see the real genius behind Doom, and Doom 2, was John  Carmack, not John Romero.  Sorry about being rude and mean, but this game  is really horrible, and I just want to be honest.	-1
Dont ever, ever buy this game! I knew it was going to be bad. So far this game beat the record for the shortest stay in my hard drive, even beating Trespasser by 2 days. A game that took 4 years to develop, well, you know  something's not right. Lets start with the graphics. Really very dated  OpenGL graphics. If this game came out 2 years ago, it would've been  awesome. Interface: No In-Game save. Only way to say your progress is by  picking up Save Gems. No Gems, no save. Control: Ok, so it's like any other  first person shooter which is why I gave this game it's one and only star.  AI: very very bad. Talk about having your AI teammates to back you up.  You'll be saving them most of the time instead of them helping you. Also,  there is a tendency that your artifical teammates to hit you by mistake.  Story: just watch the old TV series "Time Tunnel". Overall: spend  your money on another game.	-1
After all the years and all the hype I expected that this game would have *something* to recommend it.  Sure, I realized it wasn't going to be the GAME TO END ALL GAMES.  I always make sure to discount 25% for hype.  But,  my gods, what a poor showing this is! There is next to no innovation.  The graphics look like they were salvaged from Quake, the puzzles are of  the annoying "find the panel that opens the door way the hell over  there and backtrack, etc" style.  The sense of immersion is zero.  The  sounds are poorly choosen.  The enemies are, for the most part, utterly  uninspired.  The load times between segments (which uses the Half-Life  formula) are ridiculously long.  It's also utterly unstable and prone to  crashing at any given moment. Well, you get the point.  If this were just  another generic first person shooter that was being sold from $20 on the  discount rack, maybe I wouldn't feel so annoyed.  As it was, I went back  and exchanged it for "Soldier of Fortune" which, well also not  ground breaking, is solidly entertaining and, at least, mildly  innovative. Please, folks, don't get sucked in by the hype.  Save your  money for something better.  In the meanwhile, I'll be hoping that Ion  Storms next big product, Deus Ex, does a better job of living up to its  reputation.	-1
OK, this game was meant to be out 2 and a half years ago but what ever way you look at it, even if it had came out when it did it would still have struggled to be competitive back then. What the creators have tried to  do is take a new approach by putting 4 games together in one through the  different ages played by the lead character. All of them are as bad as one  another. It plays like doom did and the AI is possibly the worst ever, in  an age when AI is as good as Theif and SS2. I think Pong had more  intelligent coding then Daikatana. Unlike games where you injure someone  and he runs to find his mate. Shoot a baddy in Daikatana and his mate will  stand lifelifeless next to him watching the world go by. I was hugehly  dissopointed as I thought this would be a rival to Half Life and would  easily be the best first person shooter of the year (to which Soldier Of  Fortune holds the crown so far for me). This game rivals Doom but I think  you'll find Doom is 10 times better!  Still, it gets a star for the 4 ages  idea and em... a star for the logo and nice box! I cant wait til Duke  Nukem Forever, if its as bad as this I'll cry!	-1
Updated review- March 20, 2007  I was completely wrong about Metal Gear Solid.  I've really grown to change my mind about the negative thoughts I once had and NOW I think Metal Gear Solid deserves 5 stars (4.5 to be exact).  I especially grew to appreciate the main purpose of the game which is, as many have already mentioned, being encouraged to AVOID the guards that appear on your radar.  The idea of the game is to find ways to avoid enemies- not just go in and attempt to either shoot or break their necks.  No wonder I originally gave the game a low rating.  I went in expecting to kill everything that walked in my way!  The gameplay is a radically different approach from anything I've ever experienced before.  I originally said Metal Gear Solid was one of those games I respect more than I enjoy. I said this because so much thought and energy went into the storyline and voice acting, that I felt the game deserved to be respected, and Konami deserved credit for making it.  However, playing the game today for the first time in months, I don't know what happened. When I hit the triangle button to put myself in first-person mode, and looked across the hallway to see if a guard happened to be standing there (or walking towards me) I got caught up in the excitement and the quiet atmosphere of trying to find a way around him. It was addicting. I finally figured out how to break their necks and that was a lot of fun, too. The boss fights are actually the very best thing about Metal Gear Solid.  Every single one of them is fun, not to mention they all require you to figure out the best way to defeat them using your rather large selection of guns and figuring out which gun is the correct one. I love fighting that ninja without using weapons and hearing him speak between the action segments.  Hearing enemies talk while you're fighting them makes you want to kick their butts even MORE!  I also love when everything is nice and quiet, and then you accidentally walk right by a guard.  When this happens, a loud sound effect comes in that gives off a feeling of "Oops, my bad!" because now the guard is chasing you around.  You now have to run for your life.  I didn't realize last year that this is actually a lot of fun. This IS a really good game. I'm sorry for saying it was average last year. Sometimes I need to actually PLAY a game before speaking my mind.  Metal Gear Solid is the revolutionary Playstation game that showed the world a new, life-like way to play video games in the late 90's.  The influence this game had on the future of video gaming is simply astounding.  Metal Gear Solid showed how you can take stealth fighting and wrap a gigantic, memorable story around it.  While I'm not a big fan of lengthy twists and turns in video game storylines, I will give Konami a lot of respect for putting an *incredible* amount of time and effort into the game, and in the process, having the Metal Gear Solid series continue to do well on the Playstation 2, and soon, Playstation 3.  I especially like the quiet atmosphere while you try finding ways to walk around guards.  It comes off like you're watching a movie instead of playing a video game, or, to put it another way, you're "playing" a movie.  Not many people can create an atmosphere quite like this.  Good job Konami.  Sometimes the guards aren't as intelligent as you'd like them to be (you can actually walk into an elevator and they will walk right by, without noticing you) and apparently none of them can see you if you're standing only a couple feet away, but you know, these problems are actually pretty nice because it allows gamers to finish Metal Gear Solid without any major difficulty problems.  I can only imagine how hard the game would be if guards were extremely observant all the time.  I still have a problem with the overall darkness of the game, though.  More often than not, an important health or ammo pack is located in a hidden dark area, like near a corner, behind a crate or somewhere you can't see.  It's really not a big deal, though.  Just remind yourself to always check every dark area you come across.  If you're still having trouble finding items, just press the triangle button to put yourself in first-person mode, and hit the left or right buttons on the directional pad to scan around.  This works really well.  In fact, the whole first-person camera angle was a great idea from Konami.  Even though 20 minutes of cutscenes and conversations isn't really my thing, at least you are given the option to skip through them if you want (by pressing any one of the four main buttons, plus the Start button).  I hate when game companies FORCE you to watch them.  I don't think the storyline is bad in any shape or form.  It's actually decent.  You see, my whole life I've had a belief that a video game should be more about actually "playing a game" and less time should be devoted to storyline segments (I'll make an exception for RPGs).  The storyline in Metal Gear Solid is so big and lengthy that if you were to sit there and listen to the whole thing you would be sitting there for HOURS.  Honestly, Metal Gear Solid focuses more on storyline than actual gameplay.  With changing times and technology, people began to prefer the realistic aspects of video gaming.  Metal Gear Solid will go down as one of the originators.  I DO have one complaint- there doesn't seem to be an option for you to lock-on to your target, so YOU are forced to find and face the target.  For example, if a guard is located south/east of you, you have to actually use the directional pad to face south/east and THEN you can shoot him.  You have to face him directly or he'll continue shooting at you until you're dead.  This can be a pain because turning correctly is a bit of a challenge.  This could have been fixed with one simple "lock-on nearest target" feature.  Sure, you have guns that can zoom in on a target, but to use THESE guns you have to get into a special position (which changes the angle of the camera).  By the time you get into that position the guard will have already killed you because it takes a few seconds to get into that position, and believe me, you don't have a SECOND to waste once a guard spots you.  I want a gun that features a QUICK lock-on target (such as a gun with high amounts of firepower and frequently-available ammo packs).  That way it won't feel hopeless when a million guards are after me.  Besides a bit of overall darkness, a lengthy storyline and sometimes unfair situations regarding aiming and shooting, I have no other problems with the game.  These are really minor problems and it's easy for me to look past them.  A game that I SHOULD have given more attention to before attempting to give a final verdict.  Metal Gear Solid is a classic game.  It just took me a while to see that.	-1
Come now, who here really thinks they put some time into designing this  game?  The game's story is as horrible as it is clich and is being voice  acted by people that sound too much like a student film class working on a  mid-term project. Combat consistis of clicking your mouse button in timed  bursts or uning an asinine keybord interface to swing your weapon in three  different strengths.  Whee. Magic spell creation is novel, but quickly  become tedious and dangerous in the middle of combat when you're trying  like a madman (or madwoman) to heal yourself, but can't get the runes  lined-up in time. And even the graphics, which are nice, are loaded with  bugs.  In most cases, whenever an enemy would drop an item, the background  would spring 'holes' of black space around it and cause nemerous graphic  flaws until it would finally crash without explination.  Furthermore, some  enemies would become 'stuck' in some void on your screen preventing you  from being able to attack it! Overall, a terrible clone attempt at Diablo  that should make Eidos ashamed...and let's not even bring up Dikatana,  okay?	-1
Long have I had the PC version of Darkstone, and last month I purchased the playstation version, it was HORRIBLE!! it wasn't worth the 10 dollars, instead i returned it to the store and reinstalled the PC version and played it that way. there's no 2-character usage in the playstation version, and the graphics are way worse, my PC is a 96' PC and it plays much better on it. I extremly highly reccomend the PC version, but the playstation version stinks.	-1
This game is terrible, I've seen it for PS, and own it for PC, and I can't stand it!  The graphics are terrible, the gameplay is too similar to Diablo 2, without the fun stuff like the Horodric Cube, or the range of items. Save your money, buy DII and Lord of Destruction... you'll feel better that you didn't waste your money.	-1
I'm a huge fan of the TR series, and I like the movies  as well. TR1 and TR2 were the best in terms of story, pacing and action. The CG sequences were cooler too.  I hate to say it, but I'm disappointed in this game. TOO SLOW! The levels go on forever, and there's nothing to keep your interest. Ocassionally you will have a ninja jump out at you, or some scorpians, but that's not enough to keep you interested. The other problems is the levels require too much backtracking and are too complicated. I got stuck numerously and ending up getting a code off the internet to skip levels.  The beginning of the game shows promise with young Lara, and there is a very cool level where Lara has to manuver a jeep in the desert and over cliffs and whatnot. I don't know what I can recommend instead of this one, but I would say rent it or get it for cheap like $5 or less used or new. She tomb raids for too long with little payoff.	-1
I, like most who have played this game, am a huge fan of the Tomb Raider series.  I especially enjoy the puzzle solving of the first game and the action/adventure element and increased pace of the second one.  This series starts off promisingly enough.  Outside of a mandatory (groan) training level, the game eases you into the tried-and-true Tomb Raider gameplay we all have grown to love.  The environments are large and exciting, the puzzles clever.  Exploration is fun and rewarding, and progress is logical.  For the first 6 or 7 hours.  The challenge level really picks up after the VERY neat train level, and in fact starts to become downright maddening.  Do we really have to backtrack for 3 hours just to find 7 scattered items required to make it through to the next level?  Things get flat-out obnoxious at the Chambers Of Tulun and the Trenches.  This area goes something like this: rope swing to hit a switch that unlocks an invincible guy in a room.  Go to the Citadel Gate level to obtain a nitrous oxide canister.  Return to the Chambers and go to the Trenches.  Obtain the nitrous oxide feeder.  Return to the Chambers of Tulun to obtain the roof key.  Go back to the Trenches to get to the Street Bazaar.  Get the car jack and mine detonator so you can get back to the Trenches.  And so on and so on and so on.  Is this mad jumble of item dispersion that is being passed for level design really necessary?  I really enjoy the high challenge level of the Tomb Raider series, but this is ridiculous.  If I didn't have a strategy guide with me, I wouldn't have made it to the Citadel (which is where I am right now).  This game is loads of fun for about 20 or 25 levels; afterwards, it becomes a chore to play.  The graphics and presentation have not been improved drastically since the first Tomb Raider, and the legendary level design has regressed considerably.  Many spots feel cheap, rather than challenging.  Control, while still functional, still isn't perfect, and it causes every jump to be deliberate and nerve-wracking.  If you miss and survive, then you have to make another series of jumps, which can take another 10 minutes just to get back to where you originally were.  I could go on and on, but this game is just too much.  Get this only if you're a die-hard TR fan; but be prepared to fork out some extra cash for a strategy guide.	-1
I remember when I played the demo for this game. It was brilliant - you could stealth around, you had to be startegic and the atmosphere 10 times as tense as any other game ever. You had to loot a mansion and you could pick up some jewels for yourself as well. You had to AVOID making a comotion. The use of sound and light (or lack of them) was excellent as well. It was one of the best levels of any game I had ever played. I got my hands on the full version and rushed through the first level, eagar to see what theivery lay ahead. When I started playing the second level I found myself making my way through a haunted mine where I had to avoid zombies, kill spiders and eventually free someone from a prison. The whole thieving aspect had been taken away, and not only had degenerated into a standard cliched fantasy hack n slash affair, it was a BAD hack n slash affair. The next 2 or 3 levels were the same. Yes, you had to be stealthy, but not in the same context. I never played on - I had no motivation to. This could have been one of the best games ever, but in attempting to appeal to the mainstream (lets face it, the thievery aspect wouldn't have sold well on consoles) they messed it up, and they didn't even do the "it's-been-done-before" bit well. At least if it was done well it could have offered some short-term enjoyment (albeit forgetable) so that I wouldn't have completely wasted my money, but as it is it was a missed oportunity. Doesn't even deserve the tag "Thief" most of the time.	-1
This game is more fun than having a bag of hammers dropped on your head, but not by much. A game where you rely on stealth and not your trigger finger is a good idea but I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING. I knew that I was in trouble on the very first mission. It went like this:  Me: "Where am I? Is this a wall or a door? I'll just open it-" Guard: "Hey!" Me: "Oops!" Guard kills me. The End. Wow. That was fun. Hoo-boy!	-1
As for a star rating I can't really say for sure because THIS GAME WILL NOT WORK ON PS2 OR PS3 and since my PS1 crapped out in my I can't play the game but I hear that the game is very underrated. I hope to be able to play it somehow sometime soon but I figured I should let people know this game only works on PS1	-1
I have little patience when it comes to games like this.  Makes me wish I hadn't bought it and I am still trying to get rid of it.  Before buying take mine I will mail it to you before I hurl it through the wall.  EGM  said this was a good game and usually they are right.  Well they blew it  this time.  Don't get me wrong it might be fun.  Good concept, interesting  story,  Terribly frustrating gameplay and absolutely ridiculous boss  fights.  I never knew the playstation load time to be this irritating until  I died 50 times in a row.  O' YE OF LITTLE PATIENCE AVOID THIS ONE!	-1
I don't want to diss anyone who likes this game, but I can't really see much good in this game.  The graphics are not really anything speical.  It seems almost impossible to see the enemy and you find your self being shot and you can't see the enemy until you've had a major loss of life.  The control is rather overly complicated and isn't exactly user freindly.  The sound is okay, but it seems to make you a little tence.  The game is near impossible even on easy difficultys.  I have owned the game for quite a long time and still haven't beaten the first level by myself.  The missons seem a bit vague and you think "okay... what the heck do I do now?" too often.  When I play this, I can't help but get frustrated and it always feels like the game's fault.....  Even if you are in to army stuff, you might want to rent this first.  If this is your kind of thing, I recomend Medal of Honor: Underground or Syphon Filter.	-1
This game is way too hard!  I enjoy a challenge, but this is ridiculous!  I grew frustrated on the easy setting and anything above that is more  infuriating than fun.  What is fun is playing with two players, but even  that doesn't make it any easier.  I would say if you can get this game for  under ten bucks and only want about five or six hours of gameplay out of it  it is worth it.	-1
Straight up, this is a sub-standard 3-D environment game, lacking originality and fun, looking to catch the little kids with its high cute factor. If you want an action game, this isn't the place to look. This game is my worst PlayStation game EVER!	-1
I am totally at a loss for this game.  On one hand it has so many original idea's in terms of both plot and gameplay (And has the closest thing to a sim dating game we'll probably ever see), but the way you actually play it leaves me at a loss for words.  It's not that the battle system makes no sense, or is bad even, it's the leveling up that confuses me.  You don't get stronger when you level up.  Your defense gets weaker when you level up.  You get more health but you seem to loose more health at the same token too.  I'm am at a loss that the creaters of this game could make so many good idea's and make them so poor because they can't figure out commen sense when it comes to leveling up. If you want an RPG that's original get this...just don't exspect to get anywhere with it.	-1
Well I bought this mainly cause I always liked the soundtrack from it and I thought it was cool that U could just slap it right into a cd player and listen to it. Like tomb raider 1, Loaded, etc Well with the greatest hits version, that's not possible. Not only is that not possible but it has a totally different soundtrack on it. I used PSXMC to listen to it. so never really liked the game because of the 2d style gameplay, definitely don't like it now since they change the soundtrack and stuff on it. Greatest Hits disk SUXS!! it did come with all the manuals, case, etc.	-1
Never before in my gaming experience have I been turned off from a game in the first minute of game play.  The biggest pro in this game is the fact that you can fart and burp and that, my friends, is a sad, sad thing indeed.  The programmers could have saved the gaming community the misery and not released this albatross at all. Heck, I probably would have paid them the 5 bucks I bought it for not to put it on the market and it would have been a win-win for everyone.  I love GTA. It's a great game, but why does the '88 NES Super Mario Bros. have superior graphics to a PS1 game from 1999. It defies rational explanation and this game defies all rationality itself.  I am ashamed to call this a GTA game or even a product from Rockstar.	-1
I had this game a while ago. I loved it almost as much as I loved the SNES version. I liked being able to play a girl, and to get a cat, and I also liked that this was back when you could decently play the game and turn a good in-game profit WITHOUT the optional help of the sprites (all other HM recently, I've noticed you NEED them...I'd rather do the farming myself than pay a stupid lil sprite to do it)...but I was sorely disappointed that the marriage system is completely missing from this game.  And thats not the worst of it...  This is a 'real time' game, and after a while, either it decides you're not playing enough, or the time system just breaks...either way, unless you play it almost nonstop, it will start killing your plants and your livestock will mysteriously hate you.  Its good fun while it lasts...but it doesn't last long enough to even win it.	-1
Given that I have upset many people with my controversial view of this (cough) classic I decided to give it a second chance. Let's see let's put it through the test. Graphics: 1 out of 5 (it fits on the Gameboy Color, that's pathetic for a PSX) Sound: 1 out of 5 (fairly decent sound effects, bad music) Controls: 1 out of 5 (these are the worst controls ever) Fun Factor: 1 out of 5 (I still returned it the next day) So there you have it.  This is a very bad game and I would rather have my tounge frozen to a pole with rabid poodles knawing at my ankles than play this again.  Word of advice, buy a PS2 and get Grand Theft Auto 3, you will not regret that financial investment.	-1
This game looks like it was made in 5 minutes. It has horrible graphics, and barley any improvments from the first Grand Theft Auto. If you like this type of free-for-all shootem up, pick up the amazing GTA 3, (my all-time favorite) for the PS2.	-1
In Rainbow Six, you assemble a highly skilled team of anti terrorist commandos, plan out your assault and then control one or more of the team as you commence your invasion. The critical item to note here is that the majority of the game is spent choosing your team, equiping them properly and then planning out the raid.  This is not Syphon Filter where you jump into a room of bad guys and blaze away.  You can be killed in a single shot.  Once the action begins, you can play any one of the raid team that is engaging the enemy, otherwise the sophisticated computer AI will guide them according to your plans. I agree with the reviews that suggest that you rent this game first.  It is very detailed and realistic.  If you don't want to spend hours analyzing and preparing the missions, then you wont't appreciate the game's considerable depth. I find that the detail level does not lend itself well to the standard dreamcast controller.  There are too many things to do and the interface layout is awkward without a keyboard and mouse.  I also found that the action part of the game (moving the aiming cursor) was overly sensitive and very frustrating to use. The other reason that this game does not rate highly for me was the poor, boxey graphics and the medicore sound.  They just do not take advantage of the Dreamcast capabilities.  On the otherhand, the game does have a lot of replay value and very sophisticated AI.	-1
I thought the Clock Tower games looked interesting, but I was sorely disappointed.  The controls (point-and-click) are out-of-date and sometimes do not make sense, the voice acting is AWFUL, the movements are SLOW, the  graphics are mediocre, the storyline (as much as I could handle) was  corny...  There are many endings to the game, but who can sit through  it? VERDICT:  Don't even rent this one, unless you are a HUGE (and  curious) fan of the first game.	-1
Okay is this a April fools joke this game is terrible mortal kombat in 3D what were they thinking this game is bad really bad mk4 in 3D that just puts the other ones to shame. so midway check your mk games before bringing them out because this game just sucks don't even buy it i don't recommend it to any mk fan the controls are terrible so i could go on but theres so much wrong with this game that's why i gave it 1 stars	-1
For those of you who don't know, you play the game as one of three towering monsters, a werewolf, giant lizard or giant ape and the point is to destroy cities across the world. Sure the original arcade game is a classic, with lots of punching and smashing to offer, however this game "world tour" does not have much to offer in terms of fun. Its fun for about the first five or ten minutes, beating, smashing, punching and kicking, then the reality sets in that this is a tedious game. There are over 100 cities and each city is not just a screen, it's a side scrolling level! It wouldn't be so bad if the enemies were not horrendous! Its not just ten enemies on a screen at once, its about thirty to fifty at some points, shooting, bombing, flame throwing, flying and stomping you. The entire game despite being 100 cities can be defeated in a single day but does have a save feature with the memory packs. There is a nice plus though, lots of moves to learn and master, lots of detail, each city looks unique and features landmarks of that city and it is very educational for children to learn geographical locations. Don't pay more than ten bucks for this game though.	-1
I don't know how people are rating this game so highly.  I am a huge MK fan, but this game defines why I try to forget that MK3 and UMK3 came into existence.  This is an absolutely horribly programmed one player game.  The computer controlled players anticipate and counter every single move you do even on very easy!  You have to pick Motaro just to make it to the end, and then who had the brilliant idea of giving Shao Kahn a throw-there goes the one way you could beat him with most players.  Avalance software must have spent one day configuring the AI for this stinker.  Then, to make matters worse, the Playstation D-pad controls like a tuna boat in a boat race.  Good luck not breaking your controller as you watch your character get decimated and wonder why the move you tapped in did not work, over and over again.  Then after I finally beat the game with Scorpion, the machine crashed twice so who knows if he has an ending or not. The only reason I gave it two stars, is that with two people you do get an almost arcade perfect MK experience, but you still deal with the absolutely ridiculous characters of MK3 and UMK3 and all its palette swaps.  My advice is to turn off aggressor mode as well as all of those cheap auto combos and pretend you are playing MKII with some extra backgrounds.	-1
This game was quite... what's a nice word for it... bad. I don't completely remember, but I think this game was given to me for a birthday present or something, so I do feel bad for whoever it was who gave it to me... what a waste of good money. Sure, at times it could be addicting, but it's way too repetitive and too long. I think I'll sell it the first chance I get. I don't care what kind of games you like, don't get this one at all.	-1
Is this series still around? Why? This game gets old REAL fast and is a waste a time. I honestly cannot think of one positive thing to say about this game. The music is...nevermind. Well, the graphics are...forget I said anything. Thanks a lot, Midway.	-1
Too scratched to play and too expensive	-1
This game is fun until it freezes, one, two, three, four, five times in a single day of playing. I think the vendor sold this copy because it was defective. Not my first time experiencing this issue years ago it was the same thing. But with games going down in quality who can blame me for taking a chance.	-1
This game is not the version I remember. It feels very clunky and the load times are hardly tolerable. Try another version for your MK3 fix.	-1
I found this game very boring and stupid. It does have the best classic games ever made on it. but i didn't find them that enjoyable, but centapide was fun the best on there. All in all it was okay i wouldn't buy it.	-1
I first bought this game in a Hastings book store a long time ago and I've been a Mk fan for quit some time, so I went ahead and bought it thinking "This is great! I've got MK trilogy that has all of my favorite characters in it. And Midway makes really great games.(LOL) And I managed to find it in a five dollar bin. This is truly a lucky day for me." Until I played it....  Then as time went on, I kept it in my basement, and then one day I decided to bring it out because I hadn't played it in a while and I forgotten all of the moves. So I went to the options menu and put it on a pansy level so I can get the feel for it again. Then I remembered why I put it the basement. What I should have done was bury it in the back yard, never to see the light of day again. As soon as the first round said "FIGHT" I might as well thrown in the towel. The game was gracious enough thou to just stand there for two seconds and let me get one shot in even thou I was 99.9% dead anyway, I mean, what the F is the point?!  I don't even think the skill level even works. The only way to make it up the ladder without facing brutalities and stage fatalities is if you were to play as Kintaro, (he's your best bet.) If you play as Motaro you will get your a** handed to you literally! (Pun intended).  The A.I. actually puts any character to uppercut him and send him flying almost out of view of the screen! But if you were to uppercut the A.I. Motaro, he only staggers, can't have him flying into the air, oh no, that would require fairness in the game.  MK has been known for the copy and paste routine on characters, and MK Trilogy is the crowning achievement of it. The male and female ninjas, and if a guy has a bike helmet and armor pads that they bought down over at Wal-Mart and calling them cyborg ninjas, you know this is a cheap a** game. What the hell was this game made off of, a 50$ budget? I guess Wal-Mart was selling helmets and bike armor pads on a half off sale.  If the Matrix was to take a glitchy $***, I'm sure that it would look something like this. For every time it loads a match, I can actually hear my PS one groaning like it was trying to pass a cinder block. If that PS could talk it'd say, "Oh lord... please... help me!" :(...  I can see now why it was in five dollar bin, but I remember that there was a trash bin next to it, and if I knew then before I bought it, I would have said; "Hey, this is in the wrong bin."  Its hard to take this gory game seriously if that douche bag Dan Fordan's big fat head keeps popping out saying "Toasty." I wouldn't be a damn bit surprised if I saw Charley Sheen pop-out of the corner and say; "Already got your money dude."  And when it says on the back of the game. "Seven humiliating stage fatalities that sends your opponent plummeting to there embarrassing death." That's you, your the opponent. The A.I. will make sure of that.  As for brutalities, who the hell takes the time to flush there life away to memorize twelve different moves just to do one lousy move so a guy explodes? Wow. I never seen five skulls and twenty femur bones pop out of a guy a before. Apparently Ed or any of the designers of this pile of $*#& game, doesn't know a damn thing about the human anatomy. Its bad enough that you have to remember all the fatalities and trademark moves, now this?  To sum it up. The game play was awful. The A.I. is cheap. Glitchy as hell. They copy and paste the characters as they always do. The option menu is useless. The video resolution looks like it was filmed through a potato. The audio is awful. And the story sucked.  Forget water-boarding. Forget Guantanamo bay. That would be considered a health spa compared to this game. S*#$, force a terrorist to play this game for 8 hours strait, and he'll tell you on how to cure any form of cancer.  I can't believe how these retailers on here are pricing this POS at $99.99. Hell, there's some retailers on here that are ranging this torture device, at $150.00. Yeah, good luck with that guys. You let me know how well that works out for ya. Any poor bastard that was unfortunate enough that played this atrocious, inhumane, intolerable game, with a brain stem knows, this game couldn't be given away.  This game is ranked right next to the Jumanji board game, both should be thrown into the sacred ark, welded shut, put into a create, and shipped to a warehouse somewhere, and there it will be "dealt with TOP... MEN." Because this game will melt your face off while you're screaming in agony.  Looking back on my teenager days where I was young, dumb, full of ***,  and didn't know any better, I was easily manipulated into crap like this. So of course I would defend games that I didn't know anything about. Of course I would deny that I've been taken advantage of.  And now we see the same types of teens that are doing this all over again. They'll read this review and say, "Oh how dare you talk that way about MK! Even thou I didn't grow up with it... bla, bla, bla." I doubt that any one of them ever played this game on a PS 1. They'd argue that they'd played it of off their iphone or somethin', and say it's the same thing. NO! By then, the bugs have been fixed and it's NOT THE SAME. YOU'RE PLAYING IT FROM A PHONE! It has to be from a P...S...1! Hell to them they'd considered it a retro game. They can't judge a game accurately that wasn't in their childhood. All they can do is look at it from a future point of view. As for us 80's babies, we grew up with this crap. It's only right that we judge it from OUR timeline, no one else's.  And it's hard even to this day, to let go of something that, even thou I've been scammed by marketing-ploys by some cheap broken product, I grew up with them. But ultimately, you have to say to yourself, that I've been had and it's time to let go.  I would not recommend this game to anyone, unless you enjoy yelling at your TV screen all night, then look no further. But if you care about your sanity, and want to keep it intact. Then stay the hell away from this thing!  You'll find no entertainment from it. And that's where it fails, it fails at what the main purpose of this game was made for, ENTERTAINMENT!  All it will do, is poison and scar your mind for life. You'll never be the same again. You'll feel cheated, lied to, manipulated, used, frustrated, raped and robbed. That's what you'll be left with. Enjoy.	-1
Mortal Kombat Trilogy was a popular game back in the early days of the Playstation's existence. Even before the Playstation Mortal Kombat was known as a groundbreaking game for its graphic violence on the Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis. It was the first of its kind, or one of the first. Looking back at the old 2D fighter games, despite the heavy amount of blood and all the creative fatalities, Mortal Kombat STINKS, plain and simple. The game tries to look dangerous and back in the day it really WAS a threat. Parents were terrified that their children might experience all the blood and gore.  We're talking nearly 14 years since the original Mortal Kombats release, and now we can look at the Mortal Kombat series for what it really is: a cheesy-looking and crappy series of uninteresting tournament fighting. That's what the entire series is (until the game turned 3D, then I don't know WHAT to think). Just the way the two fighters attack each other is SO boring. Even the best fighters like Sub-Zero and Noob Saibot are a total bore.  Midway thought they really had something going when they created Mortal Kombat Trilogy. It featured nearly EVERYBODY from the previous Mortal Kombat games. How can it be bad? Well, besides the reasons I mention above, the Playstation version is murdered with INCREDIBLE amounts of loading times. People can say the Playstation was a bad system when it came to loading all they want, but the fact remains Mortal Kombat Trilogy is quite possibly the most annoying game when it comes to waiting to play the freaking thing. Sometimes you have to wait almost a minute before the game *finally* loads the fight screen. And the fighting is so bad (because the entire Mortal Kombat series up until this point is severely dated and horrible) that the loading times are actually the part I look forward to the most.  I'll give the game one extra point for featuring all the fighters in one nifty little package. Besides that. BAD game.	-1
Cause thats what your gonning to be doing alot in the entire game. Move this block, move that block. Put this block over there & make sure its fits in place with the correct image matching the wall And flip & stack them too. Now pull this lever & go to the next room over & do more block puzzles. Fun right? Such a load crap  Everything is very cryptic Nothing is explained  Lame powers  Poor boss fights  Easy to get lost  You have to shift inbtween worlds to advance But somehow this also changes the areas shape too?  How does that work? It doesnt. Hes shifting from life & dead Not to another Dimension  Your life bar also changes shape & size too for w/e reason  Your walking makes this god aweful sound  Humans you meet don't speak a lick of english & also make a annoying fake gibberish.  Lame ending boss	-1
Used instead of new. Disappointed.	-1
I played this game years ago, but I never got to where I am right now! I'm at the part where you should float on top of the pipes to get to Zephon's Lair, and one thing is that there is almost no way to get past that part; if you're lucky, you will make it the first time, if not, you will be trying over 500 times, nothing!  This game can also be frustrating as in difficulty, you can get lost very easily! I just do not recommend this game, unless you love to deal with bugs! Avoid at all costs!	-1
Looking for rise off of naked blue men with green capes reminding you of your hero to save you. Well this game is for you. I first got introduced by one of my friends I mean an acquaintance. His favorite games soon showed me that he really wasn't all that bright. He said (In a gay womenly voice) "Hey try this game out." So I said hey what the hell. As I took it home I hid it away so no one would see it. So I popped it into my Playstation and even it rejected it. So after a couple of trys it finally ran. So the title screen appeared...I never knew this was an alien/vampire porno flick. The idea of impailing naked green "Slaughs" as their called in the game isn't my idea of a thrill. After killing them their balls shoot out numbing the mind into thinking why the main character would have to eat them to gain energy. Wow now I know im scared. Then the mysteriousnes of tredding through the two mystical worlds (one retarted...another more retarted) is as amazing as tredding through a piece of sh*t. Answer me this: If a vampire/gay alien, has his mouth ripped off how can he eat balls or talk? Its amazing!! "Feed on the balls of your enemies" "Explore the vast pieces of crap and an extra bonus its a ball buffet!!" The main character is not only a gay alien but is supposedly a vampire. His arch enemy is another vampire but is about...I don't know a billion times better then him (Just a rough estimate). The most amazing complex part of the gameplay is his amazing three hit combo. WOW THREE HITS!! Then press x to dodge/lunge and triangle to impale. Oh the complexity. My mind strains over this sh*t. Well if you like to get off to blue alien like men...Go for but I suggest you don't waist your money.	-1
Oh wow....I remember playing this colossal flaming pile of turd. A friend of mine rented this game from Blockbuster for a couple of days. And I wished we both could have taken back the time we wasted.  They had great ideas for this game: You take Sub Zero from the Mortal Kombat series, use this opportunity to tell people more about his back story and his battle against monks, set it in cool locales and incorporate MK inspired game play and controls in an action adventure, side scroller with light RPG influences. What could possibly go wrong??? How about....EVERYTHING in this game.  First off, Sub Zero walks and controls like a robot. Second, this game uses every button on the controller (you even have a separate button to hit when you want him to face the direction to walk!) Third, you unlock his special moves as you progress through the game and while many use the same directional pad + button combinations in Mortal Kombat, they are 100 times harder to pull off. The bosses are petty damn hard so expect to die a lot. The graphics and sound do their job in setting the mood for the game, while the music is standard MK and kung fu inspired theatrical sounding. The PS1 version features full motion cut-scenes between the stages you fight in while the N64 gets the standard static artwork.  I give it two stars for the cool music and graphics for its time. But that alone will not make a great game. You may be tempted to pick this up if you love Mortal Kombat and the price is right. DON"T DO IT!! This is an example of how Midway had great ideas for this game but executed these great ideas very poorly.	-1
I admit I did put hours into this game being the hugh Mortal Kombat fan that I am. Gosh I'm sure happy this embarrassing MK game didn't ruin Subzero's career. It is a side scroller in which you are faced with many evil monks (oh, and they're all twins for some reason)..Subzero has many power-ups that prove useless. The mega-sized bosses are boring to fight (oh, and they never die for some reason). Due to the fact that the game supplies no level maps (how generic) a strategy guide would be a must, that is if you cared to bother with the game in the first place. Two good things did come about from this MK disaster.. Quan Chi & Shinnok. For Mortal Kombat that is a must see "MK4" or the new "MK Deadly Alliance". Leave this one in the past where it never should have spawned. 2 1/2 stars is as high as I could go. I'm generous.	-1
Don't buy this game. I've been playing it recently, and although the graphics and gameplay aren't bad, everything else is, especially the cameras. When you're playing, the automatic camera angles are horrible, and I find myself often readjusting them manualy. It becomes almost impossible to fight more than two other men at the same time without dying, because you need to see them to shoot them, and therefore have to readjust the cameras; two shots later and I'm dead. Quite frustrating. Also, the game only has 4 guns, a pistol with unlimited ammo, and shotgun with little ammo, a automatic but not very powerful rifle with limited ammo, and a rocket launcher, with only four rockets. There is also C4 explosives. This does not make for very fun gameplay. If I were you, I would put your money towards another first person shooter, such as GoldenEye 007 or something newer.	-1
Mortal Kombat Mythologies sucked just as much as the other MK Adventure games. Those being of course,Special Forces and Shaolin Monks. The storyline in this game is set years and years before the first MK Tournament took place. I guess you could call it a pre-quel. The gameplay is absolutley terrible. The controls are very unresponsive and there are WAY too many cheap hits that you take in this game. MKM mixes both repetive digitized graphic gameplay and awful acting in FMV sequences. As many have said,this game is extremly difficult. Hell,I had a VERY hard time beating it,with cheat codes...and with it being on very easy. All this mostly due to all the cheap hits that you get hit with by different enemies. There is also puzzle solving as well. Most of which will have you pulling out your hair. Overall,This game is crap and you shouldn't waste one dollar on it. Avoid this and the other two MK adventure titles as well.	-1
I thought the game was dull. It wasn't even scary! The storyline was weak and really didn't have a point to it. The playing screen was also small but the graphics were good. It needs more excitement and adventure. Overall, I was disapointed.	-1
I really can't believe that this game has received four stars from Amazon reviewers. I had high expectations of this game because of the many positive reviews and the cheap price. The expectations where totally deflated when I realized how small the actually screen display was while playing the game. I've never had to deal with such an annoying small display ever in my PC gaming experience. Along with the poor dialogue and story, the opening was even worse. Every time you restart the game after quitting, you are taken to the beginning screen, when you should be taken to the load/save option. I admit this is a small detail to dislike, but none the less, it is unacceptable for an adventure game. Some puzzles were very difficult to solve. I had to replay the 1940's scene many times just to get my idiotic character to say one particular line just so I could move the radio dial to enter a room, which would enable me to finally finish the scenario in one minute. The somewhat creepy sounds and music, and the fact that it deals with the paranormal are the only reasons why I rate this game with two stars...	-1
This controler stinks.  The joystick is messed up and turned at a slight angle (so you have to go slightly up and right to go straight up), the rubber grips fall off in the first week, and worst of all, it's confusing.  I tried programing the buttons (because it's "fully programable") and believe it or not it works!  sure you can't train whole sets of commands (like moves in fighting games) in, only replot the buttons but it works.  The only problem comes in when you accidently press the clear button with a light in it and all of the sudden, none of the buttons perform the X action.  Then, this controller will probably be unplugged and sent to the attic just like mine.  Enjoy!:(	-1
For starters this is an ok game....nothing more.  The controls and gameplay suck hard compared to Quake and DOOM, the storyline sucks hard compared to Quake or DOOM and the multiplayer sucks hard compared to Quake or DOOM.  So go play Quake or DOOM :)	-1
I used to love playing Quake 2. I played it for hours on end. When I heard about it's impending release in 1997, I was stoked and could hardly wait for it to come out. And what did I do when it did? I played it AT LEAST 3 to 4 days a week from 1997 to early 2002. And guess what? I became freakin sick of it! I do not want to play this game ever again for the rest of my existence on this earth!! (Well, at least for 10 years or so) My point is, after you log hours and hours of gameplay, it starts to get old. FAST. Quake 2 may be a legendary game but I warn you don't overindulge. Play Max Payne, Deus Ex or Unreal Tournament 2003 instead.	-1
Midway, in an-all out effort to publish as many fighting games as humanly possible has given the world Mortal Kombat Gold, an "update" to  the mildly popular MK4 seen in arcades everywhere a couple of years  ago. To warrant this title's port to the DC, Midway included some  "new" characters.  Cyrax, Mileena, Kitana, Baraka and Kung Lao  are all standing by to be beheaded at your leisure.  I'll admit, it was fun  to play as my old favorite Baraka, but I found his return to be a bit  lackluster. None of the fatalities you'll see from the new guys are  original, all are merely 3D updates of MK2 and MK3.  I found Cyrax's  "blowing up the world" move terribly lame, as will you.  And  suprisingly, Baraka's victims don't bleed when he impales them.  Otherwise,  you'll find all of the characters present in the home games from last year,  including the console-only Goro.  Also, savvy players can unlock Noob  Saibot and Sektor, via secret codes (don't tell). Let's get one thing  straight.  Graphic-wise, this game mirrors the arcade perfectly.  That's  one smooth box of chips Sega's got.  The character models are back to the  3,000-polygon count (up from the PS and N64's dozen or so polygons per  fighter) and the colors are bright and vibrant, with no pixelization.  However, there's a few oddball things that stand out.  For example, for all  of its 22nd-century power, the Dreamcast can't deliver shadows that don't  look like bouncing boxes strung together?  I don't think so, Midway.  Plus,  you'll see several of the same animations again and again and  again. Gameplay also mirrors the previous home releases.  Jump, combo,  special move, jump, combo fatality.  The AI isn't particularly bright,  especially on the stages where rocks and other debris litter the ground. Sound-wise, the game is adequate.  The new characters use recycled  sounds from old MK games, as do the new stages (also taken from old  games.) All in all, if you haven't played MK4, and you have a Dreamcast,  you may enjoy this title.  The action is swift and pretty, and there's lots  of fun blood and mutilations (parents beware.) Otherwise, this title is old  news that could have benefitted from a little more development time.	-1
I can see how some folks would enjoy a pure arcade version with no reality whatsoever involved.  Myself, I think I'd like something more realistic. First downs are 30 yards, there are no penalties, there's no kickoff, and there is no realism involved as far as athletic ability of the players.  For example, if you complete a pass from Young to Rice (remember, this is 2000!), and Rice has the open field, two defenders are actually able to catch up to Rice and tackle him.  This is flat out ridiculous, even for an arcade game.  Ditto Terrell Owens and Tim Brown, and I was able to stop other wideouts with linebackers just by squeezing the turbo button. The emphasis is obviously on bone-crushing tackles, but after an hour of play, the only really enjoyable aspect of this is the ability to cheap-shot the offensive players long after the ball is whistled dead.  The field-goal kicking system is particularly vexing, as it was apparently designed by a chimp with ADD, and requires eight espresso-mochacchinos in order to maintain the twitch focus required to accurately split the uprights. Overall, I see this as a fun arcade game for younger kids not up to simulation-level gameplay, and guys/gals who just want to have fun beating each other's players up.  Me, if I want to beat up some guy, I'll play Soul Calibur.	-1
I tried to play the game but after getting to the second disc got completely bored with the game.  Un-equipping all the GF's and any magic every time there is a change in parties is bit annoying.  Guess they tried to make something different.  I just like a traditional rpg where everyone has their own individual magic and skills like the previous FF games and some other rpgs.  But anyway, there were glitches in the game and I got stuck in areas and had to play over certain places.  And on the second disc could not get off the ship.  Just gave up and will give the game away.  Going back to play a Tales rpg.	-1
this game should marketed as a MULTIPLAYER ONLY!!! The graphics are gorgeous, however there is nowhere to explore and nothing to find. I only have a 56k modem - absolutely not fast enough.  One has to have a super fast cable modem to play this "deathmatch" game online	-1
Absolutely the worst game in the excellent Quakes. This certainly bombed the whole trilogy with its gameplay. What I hate about this game is the nonstop mindless shooting where you don't have to think. Getting killed in this game also causes alot of anger because everyone just jumps around you and constantly fires! This game is just like UT, bad. Utterly bad! I have constantly tried to like it, but failed at every attempt. Avoid at all costs!	-1
I really like the game but the person I bought it from doesn't test the games and now I have a game that I can't even start because the first disc doesn't read, please do not buy from this person because I paid good money for a paper weight!	-1
Why did you do this id? No wait. . . I understand why, but it's still no excuse to create a game like this. Multiplayer only? OK, OK, I need to settle down here. First of all I need to explain my situation. I have Internet access but not the kind to play this game, I have a lowly 56k modem with a (insert appropriate insult here) connection. This type of connection is definitely not the best connection, even for games that have low data transfer like Diablo or Ultima. However, in my apartment complex we created our own Ethernet LAN with the main hub in my own apartment, perfectly ideal for this type of game. Does this mean that I play this game? Yes, sort of. Does that mean that I like it? I wish I could. I've rewritten this paragraph four times already. There is no way to express my dislike for this game. Simply put, players will get separated into two groups. Those with the skills to pummel anyone who comes into the arena, and those who get pummeled. Unfortunately, the "Pummelers" are few and far between. Most of the "pummeled" will be amateurs, they'll buy the game, play through a few deaths and erase the game from their hard drive. My LAN mysteriously "empties" out when I offer up a game of Q3. id blew it with this one. Poorly thought out, this game serves only the elite few with the grit, skill, determination, and fast connection to play this game. Lets hope that id gets a brainstorm and comes up with an actual story line for the next game instead of taking the easy way out like they did with this one. Remember, I'm not saying the multiplayer is bad. The multiplayer is awesome! It's the lack of the single player that makes this game blow. In fact, it's the lack of everything else that makes me want to lose my lunch.	-1
Although a lot of people liked this game I hated it. For one thing this game was WAAAAYYYYYY too easy (I beat this game in three days playing only  1 hour a day! The first game had me playing for mounths! )! You're supposed  to find this fairy to give you all your powers back, and yet you start the  game with all your powers! Plus I don't care how good the graphics are,  Rayman does NOT look good in 3D and does not belong in 3D! So get the first  game, I don't recomend this game to ANYONE!	-1
i got this game and didn't really play it my brother mostly did and he said is was an awesome game until you get to near the end of the second disc and it freezes at a boss  the only down fall is that you my regret buying the used one  its a good game if it worked properly	-1
This was always bound to be a great title, the Quake name is like a way of printing money! but this time I am just not buying it! I don't have a very high spec PC and Quake 3 just runs like a dog! (it's a AMD K6-2 350 with  128Mb of RAM and an ATI Rage Magnum with 32Mb) my message to people out  there with this spec of PC or below, don't bother with Q3, there is a very  good alternative "Unreal Tournement" it's a brilliant title that  runs sweet on my machine in 800x600 in 32 BIT colours (colors!). In summery  Q3 Great title, but you will need an ass kicking spec.	-1
I'm a huge Final Fantasy guy, but for me, 8 is just very close to trash.  I tried to play it right when it came out but I couldn't stand it right from the get go so I quit early.  I tried to play it again a few years ago and the same exact thing happened.  Finally a little while ago, I forced myself through it. No exaggeration.  So I started the game for the third time thinking, hey maybe it just takes time to catch on.  But no, I never really became addicted to the gameplay as I usually do in FF games.  The only way to get stronger is to find monsters with different spells and steal their spells for your attributes, which is fine and all, but it got extremely annoying having to do that until you reach 100 and for each character! It doesn't sound necessary but trust that's the only way to get stronger because as your level goes up, so do monster levels, so yes there's no point in even leveling up. Really stupid in my opinion, but it's a different type of thing that I think some people actually did like.  Not me. Every other FF was great as they were because they did not deviate the gameplay to this extent.  For every thing else, the story was a definite plunge from 7.  FF7 blew everyone away and when this cam out, the characters were ok, but the story was pretty lame, but not too, too terrible and the music was forgettable.  The environments were about matched with that of 7, but less enjoyable. So overall, this is not a great game.  I feel like this game is extremely overrated, getting so much positive feed back, but for what? My expectations were much higher after being so impressed by 7.  Maybe the bar was just set too high.  Maybe Square needed a break.  Then again, there are obviously people who love this style of gameplay, which gives them a much more different gaming experience.  Don't get me wrong, it's not the worst game ever, but it's just not the same Final Fantasy experience everyone loves.  So bottom line, if you're new to final fantasy and haven't played this yet, I would say consider a different FF game.  But give it a chance if you're not that picky with RPGs.  Just don't expect much.	-1
If you want yet another dogfight game, here it is.  If you want a game where you feel as though you are commanding a starship, as depicted in the Star Trek movies, you had better pass.  Cut scenes?  Wow, impressive, and  with David Warner no less!  Graphics? NONE BETTER!  Neat way to blow stuff  up?  Oh, yea!  A great game for those under 30 with cat like reflexes.  No  cunning needed here.  However, you had better be more practised in an  immelman turn than the corbomite bluff if you want to suceed at this game,  and that precisly is the opposite of what is advertised.	-1
Although a lot of people liked this game I hated it. For one thing this game was WAAAAYYYYYY too easy (I beat this game in three days playing only  1 hour a day! The first game had me playing for mounths! )! You're supposed  to find this fairy to give you all your powers back, and yet you start the  game with all your powers! Plus I don't care how good the graphics are,  Rayman does NOT look good in 3D and does not belong in 3D! So get the first  game, I don't recomend this game to ANYONE!  And you know what's worse?  This Nintendo 64 vertion looks WORSE and plays WORSE than the Dreamcast  vertion!  Now that's sad (Even though I never liked N64).	-1
Didn't get the game	-1
Good gravy.  What was Squaresoft thinking when they made this one?!  It's terrible in almost every aspect.  First of all, the battle system involves having to siphon off magic spells from the enemies and grafting them into your abilities.  This means that if you use them, your skills actually decrease.  Not only that, but because the maximum level your characters can reach is 100 instead of 99, you're actually susceptible to the nervewracking "Level 5 Death" spell.  Secondly, the cast is shallow and characterless.  The main character is grumpy and unsociable, and this reviewer could not relate to him as a player should be able to.  Also, none of the other cast are very memorable, like the characters of the other Final Fantasy games.  Lastly, the story is about as intriguing and deep as a pile of... well, you get the idea.  The story begins all right, but then lapses into a nauseating, mismatched soap opera between the main character and his rival's ex.  Not only that, but the main character's attitude prevents the gamer from learning what the "villain" is really after; they never give you a deep enough look at her.  So, really, if you're a Final Fantasy fan, skip this one.  You didn't miss anything.	-1
The way the light/magnifier is mounted on the gameboy places the lens too far away and thus you have to be looking straight at the gameboy, it can't be tilted left or right. Also the lights do brighten the screen but again, unless your looking straight on the lights will leave "hot spots" on your screen. "Hot spots" is when light reflects off the screen and makes it difficult to see. This product eats batteries and makes gaming harder. Not a good purchase.	-1
I hadn't played an FF game for a long time, so I picked up FFX, hoping that all the good pub this game got would be true.  Alas, it was not.  FFX was a wretched game, no doubt.  Disgusted after spending 40 hours, I went back into the series, having heard that the earlier games were better.  My best buy had FFVIII on sale for like $15, so I bought it, figuring it couldn't be worse than X.  I was wrong.  Where to begin?  I'll start with the music, which is really repetitive.  It's really not even that good.  Next, the storyline, which is SO bizzare.  So Edea is the enemy.  No, she's being possessed by some other person.  Who you've never heard mentioned.  Not once, until the 3rd disc.  WTF?  The draw/junction system is horrendous as well.  Why can't I use the MP system?  But my biggest complaint with this game is the GFs.  At least by FFX they were smart enough to have the option to eliminate the intro scene.  NO such option here.  And I looked HARD.  Each one requires a year and a day to summon, so you just sit and watch Leviathan materialize, create a slide, and drop water down it.  How impressive.  If each character is summoning a GF, you could get up, drive 3 hours away to pick up some shoes on the side of the road, come back home, make dinner, eat, go to the bathroom, and sit back down and Pandemona would still be firing its attack.  And you can't avoid this, because your characters are so weak physically, that you must use them at least twice a battle.  In the event you find enough items to improve your weapon, this amount decreases, but you still use nothing but GFs during boss fights.  You don't even use real magic!  Why?  because using magic takes away defense points from your junction system!  You may use heal and status magics, but blacks are out of the question.  Besides, they're weaker than the GFs!  Even when triple cast, a triple cast blizzaga is weaker than Shiva!  Who thought of this?  I'm about 1/3 way through the 3rd disc, and I really don't even want to finish it.  When I found out the same people who designed this game designed X, it came to me as no surprise.  So many bad things about this game were evident in X, it was eerie.  Shame on square for allowing the makers of this game to make X.	-1
If you fell in love with Final Fantasy VII, like I did, and are so hungry for more that you are considering this game, I beg of you, don't do it. It is nothing like the aforementioned masterpiece. The story was slow to get going, which I was sympathetic to, since it was like that in FF VII too, but after hours it was still lame. For one thing, you have a "military ranking", and it goes down when you explore the towns! I mean come on, the whole point of an RPG is exploring! But that is not the worst part. The magic system has been redone, and it's HORRIBLE. Instead of the product-of-genius Materia system in FF VII, they have the "draw system". You have to collect magic spells, and use them, like petty items! This is, by far, the worst idea ever.   And then there were the characters. After falling under the spell of Cloud, Aeris, Sephiroth and all the rest, I felt like hiding under my blankets and sobbing after meeting Squall, Rinoa and the other lame characters. Their dialogue is lifeless and cheesy, and I didn't feel attached to them at all.  Although it's a small complaint, I must mention the graphics. The cutscenes are amazing and far better than FF VII's, but everything else is awful. The blocky, toon-like models of FF VII have been tossed out, replaced by characters that try to shove in the detail of real humans in tiny little models. The result? Stiffly animated, bland graphics.  Overall, do not buy this game. Buy Tales of Symphonia, Chrono Cross...anything. Please, do not waste your money. These are the parting words of a weeping gamer. Thank you.	-1
as you might have heard, this game was downright terrible. the only thing that kept me going was the story. in my personal opinion, the story is very exceptional and the many months of work they put into it paid off. before starting, i would like to comment that i was very excited to get this game after the two-in-a-row masterpieces final fantasy 6 and 7, and for the fact that it was created by squaresoft, but i was extremely disappointed after about one hour of gameplay. now onto the review... STORY: 9/10 as you have most likely heard, people say that this storyline is based on the theme of love, when in many people's opinion (my own included), this game is anything BUT love. the only thing close to love that happens is **SPOILER**rinoa and squall kiss at the ending**END SPOILER** which really isn't all that loveable in my opinion. similar to final fantasy VII, the setting is in the future (irritating downside, as insanely advanced technology is not that fantasy-like), but this is a mediocre downside of the game The story goes pretty much like this: an evil sorceress is on the verge of enslavement of the world and a resistance to defeat this woman called Garden trains military soldiers called SeeDs to battle against her and her troops. pretty lame sounding, as seed and garden are really actually one of those ideas that a first grader could come up with in about 5 minutes, but the story actually picks up at about disk three (yes it is pretty slow). SOUND AND MUSIC 6.5/10 the sound is really quite good in this game. squall's sword slashes when hitting a target, quistis's whip cracks when snapping at a target, and Zell's mighty fists make smacking noises when hitting a target. such as final fantasy VII, the music in here is not that well conceived and memorable such as the earlier final fantasys. the boss music is sort of catchy (once again such as final fantasy VII), but the rest of the music is rather annoying. GAMEPLAY 2/10 the single thing that totally MAULS this game is the gameplay. the battling is terribly tedious, and the magic system is completely raped of its glory. instead of learning magic abilities, now you waste time "drawing" magic from enemies. another terrible mistake squaresoft made while making this game. a new addition to the gameplay is the Guardian Forces (GF) which are pretty much summons just in a stupid term. these guardian forces are pretty much the only thing that will keep you alive in this game, as you need them to enhance health, strength, and so on, which i will get to in a moment. the guardian forces are the main attack force, and with these forces there is barely any need for the "attack" command (other than Zell's Duel limit break). The animations for guardian forces are well animated, but EXTREMELY long and tedious. Limit breaks are the only other useful thing in this game, but unfortunately, they can only be accessed when you are in life-threatening situation, completely aboliting the well-conceived limit break bar. MENUS AND PUT-TOGETHERS 1/10 this is terribly time-consuming and irritating. the menu is where i spent most of my time on this game. gladly, squaresoft got rid of the horrid materia system and added on the god-how-could-this-get-any-worse junction system. this system takes about a half of an hour just to understand, and then you spend even more precious hours of your life drawing magic upgrading it so a boss cannot kill you in just one blow. for example, you have to spend about an hour drawing 100 lifes from an enemy just so you can raise your health a couple thousand points. then after this boring proccess you must draw 100 Tornados in order to raise your attack power (I am almost completely CERTAIN this process is required to defeat the final boss) The second complete worst part of this game is the following: THERE IS NO LONGER AN EQUIP OPTION! what happened to equipping weapons and armor? there is a way to upgrade your weapon, but that consumes serious time and involves ridiculous side-quests that are extremely boring. don't even bother going through the stress of completing these quests a ridiculous thing they did in this game is that the characters level up with you, so you can finish the game at level 8 or so (as leveling up is not necessary and bosses give you NO experience points{I completed it at level 7 or 8}) GRAPHICS 9.5/10 The best part of the game, the graphics. The FMV scenes are superior to every other graphics i have EVER seen in my entire life-span (yes including ps2 graphics), and even during gameplay the graphics are superior (during gameplay they are worse than ps2 graphics i might add), and the only flaw in them is the pixelations, as the characters look a bit fuzzy. but that problem is solved in FFIX. You remember the disgustingly distorted characters in FFVII? well, thank god, they are replaced with actual human-like figures that look like HUMANS at last. no more stubby oversized arms and legs with huge heads that remind me of cartoons. there is only one thing i love about this game, and it is the ending. as i said before, the story is VERY good and is the only reason that i gave it 2 stars instead of 1. the ending is EXTREMELY good (not as good as FFVI's though) and made me feel good. REPLAY VALUE: 0/10 as many other people have done, as soon as i finished wasting my time playing this game and finally destroyed the final boss i took out the disk from my playstation, placed it in its case, placed in on a shelf behind my other cds, and it has not been touched ever since. this game was terrible, and i wish i had my 30 hours of gameplay back. i say instead of even thinking of buying this game, look for final fantasy anthology and final fantasy 6 instead.	-1
Let's just get one thing out of the way, the battle system in this game is bad. Very bad. There are much too many random battles, a lot of the time you're "drawing" magic from enemies (a HORRIBLE idea on square's part, it makes no sense and is extremely tedious) both to use and EQUIP it to your characters. Since the power of your equipped magic is based in the number you have, and all of your enemies have an unlimited number of the magics they're able to carry, you spend a LOT (a WHOLE lot, HOURS) of time just hitting that draw button and selecting which magic to get from them. Yeah, not fun, at all. Both the equipment and magic systems are bad. The new focus on summoned monsters as equippable characters which level up and gain skills to boost your character, such as strength upgrades or upgrades to themselves which boost their damage or HP, is really not fun at all, since there's zero strategy involved. You just level up and decide which skill they'll learn after enough battles. I easily blew through the first half of this game, killing bosses in a ludicrously low number of hits. I couldn't stand the second half, it was just more of the same, and the story line became very, very stupid. A select few will actually like this sappy love story mixed with something about a summoner going to destroy the world and some other junk that I just didn't care about. The love story was actually the best part, and the rest felt like a filler. There really isn't anything to praise about this game that separates it from previous Final Fantasy games. A sub-par RPG.	-1
I'm a huge Final Fantasy fan, but this ain't no FF VII	-1
Final Fantasy 7 and 9 are wonderful examples of how an essentially linear game can be manipulated and changed into something epic and enthralling, thanks to excellent characterisation and plot. Final Fantasy 8 (and, oddly enough, FF 10) are wonderful examples of how to bore people silly while forcing them to sit through some nice-looking battles. For those gamers who, like me, need to like a character in order to fully appreciate the game's plot, let me say this: Squall is a moody, horrible, angst-ridden Phallocrat. His supporting cast are forgettable, with the exceptions of the consummately annoying Zell Dincht and the ridiculously feeble Rinoa Heartilly. The characters in FF 8 have none of the appeal of Cloud et al from FF 7, or Zidane and the lovable half-breeds from FF 9. For gamers who don't consider this to be so important, FF 8 still manages to nicely ruin the Final Fantasy reputation by being one of the most boring and unrewarding games in the series. Battles are innumerable and completely random, and fall into 2 categories: extremely easy and unfairly difficult. Case in point; you face Seifer's two main flunkies early on in the game, by which stage your levels are too high to build up quickly on the feeble monsters available in the college & the surrounding areas, and too low to beat these henchmen without massive amounts of luck. The result? You end up running about doing frustrating battle with low-level wildebeests for hours, and the game becomes very, very boring. The graphics are shamefully poorly-thought out. The pre-rendered backdrops for some of the major levels (Balamb Garden, Edea's House) are bland, and have none of the charm of the cityscapes of FF 7 or the magical countryside vistas of FF 9. The character models are far too complex, and look pixellated and rough at almost all angles. Polygon pop-up didn't die out with the Sega Saturn; it's alive and well and working for Squaresoft. The pre-renders, however, are amazing, approaching the quality of early PS 2 titles in their scale and realism. The sound is run-of-the-mill poor PlayStation fare, but the music is decent enough. Better, too, is the Magic system, where, instead of spending hours confusing yourself with Materia, you now Junction Elementals and spells. Sadly, the game relies less on Magic and more on difficult Limit Break techniques and expensive items, so this really isn't a huge plus until late in the game. All in all, FF 8 is a VERY disappointing game, lacking the freedom of exploration of FF 7 and 9. It's a game on wheels, which isn't a bad thing in itself, but when the plot and characters are so forgettable, it becomes a major problem. Steer clear.	-1
Before buying this game, I strongly recommend downloading the demo off their website first.  As a fan of many of the "God Games" out there, I found this one very unintuitive.  In short, all of the people are  stupid and the game itself does some very dumb things. For instance,  there are points in the demo where the farmworkers just sit there and drown  as the Nile River rises.  The question isn't "what's causing this  person to just sit there"... the question is "why is this even  occurring?" That's just one example, there are many, many, more.  Another example?  Ok, I got to a point in the game where half of the  population would just leave.  Then, six months later, they'd all return  again just to repeat the same process again and again year after year.  Does this make any sense? I found all the micromanagement to be very  tiring.  The object of the game isn't to build an empire, it's to figure  out all the stupid little workarounds it takes to make these people do what  they should be doing without any thought. This is just the demo, folks!  I strongly suggest you see for yourself before you drop your cash on the  real deal. Derek	-1
The Game is sow Boring the story is not good at all final 7 is so much beter get that ...	-1
Well, I wish I could play some of these levels! Sometimes, that's made impossible because they're so dark. I wish it would save my game, too, but it never has. There are patches available for bigger mistakes on their site. I would give anything not to watch those grating cutscenes again and again. The voices are all quite annoying and stilted, though you get the sense the Eidos guys thought the old man at the beginning might have been - he gets tiresome immediately (my child this, my child that, this is how you jump -WAIT!- this is how you jump). Lara is still a bimbo character and it's insulting to both genders, a cynical view of the audience (I wish she would stop breathing heavily!). The controls are difficult. The puzzle elements are still worthwhile, though they are a poor man's Zelda. The 16 year-old Lara was unnecessary, when she gets her backpack we're supposed to care. The likelyhood of her and the old man being in these Cambodian ruins in the daytime and running through it like a preschool adventure playset is small. They seem to toss old TR elements like climbing vines and throwing levers in all the wrong places, these elements are repeated, and there seems to be little real joy in all of it, like they toss the elements out until the game ends. The level designs are unlogical, they detract from the realism that the games used to have and added so much to it. That's why you are bothered when you die from a giant spinning spike wheel that magically floats, not because it's hard, but because you just don't believe things like that are there, it's as though the game breaks it's own rules. I feel like the levels could all have gone a lot further if they just did some heavy internet research on the areas available to play (Egypt has stars and spikes?). Overall, I feel this game was well worth my [money], but the series needs to improve or it will surely die. Undoubtedly, the first Two TR games were the best, they need to return to that, these new games feel like a...commercial spectacle. What I enjoy most about the series is the realism that there can sometimes be, and the puzzles, but mostly the scenery and locales, the action is just the backdrop to me. Buy the first 2 games before thinking about getting this.	-1
Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation is the fourth Lara Croft adventure game based entirely in Egypt. A very long and challenging game built on a nice engine with great graphics, Neat animations and neat sound effects. Good storyline and great gameplay with infinite saves. Awesome lighting effects and a creepy atmosphere. Great puzzles but a lot of annoying false paths. Very challenging gameplay but can be too challenging at times because no difficuly option. Good level design with a helpfull training level, But the hub level layout is very confusing and easy to get lost. A Lot of fun doing all the jumping but the controls are as usual very badly done, Auto aim is not perfect and the manual aiming is impossible. Enemy AI is super dumb. Tomb Raider Last Revelation well deserves 4 stars but i will give it only 2 because it does not have good key controls and a difficulty option.	-1
I got this game last year and I have only just completed it. In a technical sense, this is indeed better than the other TR games. But I do feel that it is a victim of it's own realisticness. It starts off brilliant and great to play. Especialy the moving train effect. But once you get to the 'City of the Dead' things go downhill. I mean it gets so dark that even with the monitor on full brightness and the house lights out, you still have to lightflares to see whats what. There are also not enough flares to get around with either. Sure this would be the situation in real life, but in real life you have the advantage of 3D vision to guide you. Not in a game.  Not only that, but the levels get boring towards the end aswell. It seems stupid that game programmers would spend out on high-tech graphics and creative innovations and then blanket them with an over abundance of darkness.  Apart from that though. The sound is brilliant. The movies realy fit in well. Lara looks better and (if you can see them) the graphics are great too.	-1
It sure does. Old, boring, hard to play and hard to control. This game is more fun than a sharp stick to the eye but not by much. And the price when it first came out! Sheesh! I'm betting that the only reason some people buy this is Lara's chest and that doesn't justify purchasing this accident of a game.	-1
Pharaoh is a city building game (like SimCity), but set in Egypt, during the pre-dynastic period.  You start by building a settlement, addressing basic needs and continue onward.  Unlike SimCity, there are various goals to hit such as population goals. As the game progresses, it gets harder. Unfortunately, I found myself building and managing the population, but having to check the deities almost constantly.  Unless you hold regular festivals, constantly build shrines, the gods will grow angry and exact revenge on your civilization.  I found it to be more tedious than fun.	-1
Final Fantasy is, and has been for a long time, Squaresoft's flagship product. All the FF products, while not having direct connections to each other, carry similar "themes" -- similarities of gameplay, world design, and so on that make them clearly Final Fantasy rather than something else. With all the time and effort (not to mention money) expended on them, one would (I think justifiably) expect that the series would generally improve as time went on. Unfortunately, this is not the case. Final Fantasy VII was a reasonably good FF game, but it was also the first Playstation FF game, and had some advantages which were, at the time, unique to it. It was incumbent upon FFVIII to give us something more -- something cooler and better. It failed. The overall STORY isn't that bad -- the plot is decent and some of the characters interesting. However, our main character is just not generally likeable; Squall has less interesting personality than Cloud Strife of FFVII, and that's a pretty damning indictment since Cloud didn't develop much personality until some way through the game. More importantly, gameplay is if anything more of a railroading exercise than FFVII -- which, given that VII used the metaphor of a railroad from the beginning, is a sad state of affairs. By now, Square should have recognized that flexibility of play and so on is a GOOD thing in CRPGs. Chrono Trigger remains popular enough to garner commentary even today, due in great part to its multi-ending design. Why the FF series still relies on the idea that you have no real choices and get dragged from fight to fight boggles the mind; Kewl Komputer Animation doesn't make up for the fact that they haven't added any new game techniques since the Nintendo days. Oh, they have some cute little side games -- card collecting and so on -- but the story itself isn't even captivating enough. Some of the battles can go on long enough to be boring in themselves. Oh, the animation cutscenes are pretty, and some of the music very nice -- and the past timeline sequence is, sadly, more interesting than the main one. A disappointing effort from the people who have, in past times, produced some of the most innovative and interesting games.	-1
If not for Final Fantasy IX switching gears, the franchise may have died from this title. FFVII was a pure marvel and still is, but VIII lacked any good storyline and the characters weren't the least bit interesting. It's a solid piece if you want to have the entire series, let's say, pull it out once in a while to hack at it. It's hard to stay interested most of the time, although it does have some cool CG cut-scenes to do it justice, mostly, it's dull repetition and sits as a rushed follow up to FFVII and it shows. Fans, thank God for IX saving the day, X bringing in the next-generation, and XI, XII coming up. So long from the dullsville FFVIII calls Balaamb. I hope the cadets have retired...	-1
Was not the product pictured. Poor packaging.	-1
this is the worst final fantasy game gameplay wise without a doubt.  not only is the learning curve hours, but after that, you have to spend hours getting magic from the enemies to use and equip.  This game graphic wise looks like it has been in work for a lifetime, and the FMV looks like PS2 or DC.  the gameplay looks like it was made in a lifetime too, and that is a BAD thing.	-1
Good product sturdy and works very well...	-1
Good gravy... This is the absolute worst game that I have ever played in my entire life. Not that the game was even that bad, but... It never lived up to its own hype. I have played all of the Final Fantasy games... Since I beat the very first game, I have been a loyal follower and a ruthless critic. I cherished IV, and I absolutely LOVE VI, which is indeed the very best one in the entire series in terms of story and music. And Final Fantasy VII blew my mind... The Final Fantasy... In a whole different perspective, with three dimensions on the battlefield. When FFVIII came out, I already had a copy reserved... I held the glowing package in my hands, looked at the back of the cover and drooled over the beautiful graphics, and in my head I could imagine the enchanting score that my ears would soon be treated to. But as my best friend and I put the disk in and beheld Final Fantasy VIII... There was a voice screaming in my head... My mind kept saying something to me over and over again as I walked through Balamb Garden... And then my friend said that very thought: "Jay, this game sucks." Yes, it does. This game is a disgrace to the series. A storyline that is so slow, so pointless that you actually look forward to the battle sequences? There was no Final Fantasy VIII Theme! The battle theme and the boss theme pale in comparison to the vicious relentless music of the FFVII Score. There was not one piece of music that ever persuaded me to continue the journey. The disgustingly weak plot was made tolerable only by the CG movies. The character development was never there. Never did we ever find out why Seifer was such a jerk. ...Or WHY the GFs (Ha, ha) erased the memories of the characters. The lead character, Squall, answered every single question with the word "whatever." Compare that to the strong-willed, heartbroken Cloud from FFVII, and it becomes obvious. Allow me to say one more thing: Final Fantasy VI gripped me. I captivated me with a spell that bound me. I played, played, and played that silly game, with it's cute 16 bit graphics, as if I were possessed. The same goes for VII. I wanted to know what was going to happen next at that moment. I got as far as the mission to Timber in FFVIII, and never gave it a second glance. Only a year later, after exams were done in college, with no car or friends around... Did I pull Final Fantasy VIII out again to give it a second chance. How sad. The only time I ever cried over a video game was when Aeris died in Cloud's arms... But when I first played Final Fantasy VIII, I know that I wanted to just bawl.	-1
This looked like a promising game and I really enjoyed it ... when I could progress through it.  It was crashy/buggy on win2k.  I was halfway thru the werewolf town episode and hit a bug that no patch fixed unless I restarted the episode, which I was too[upset]to do. Also, the way to progress is not really that intuitive.  I found myself running around an empty castle a lot trying to figure out wth I'm supposed to do next.  By far the worst aspect of this game was the camera angles.  As you run down a hall, you hit a map trigger that changes your point of view; unfortunately you have no idea what view you will get.  Sometimes you will be looking ahead from behind/above your character, other times you will look at your character's face from ahead/left.  It is weird and extremely unpleasant as you can switch angles during fights accidentally and get your [rear-end]kicked. The good stuff: The graphics are cool, not the most impressive nowadays (2003-05-06) but still neat.  Although they aren't technically superior anymore (they once were) I still like the way the game looks because the designers made the graphics so creepy.  The art on the walls, the dark woods, crypts, you go through all sorts of cool settings. The music is creepy too, and really helps set the mood.  This is actually a scary game to play. The main character is pretty cool.  He's the nameless Clint-Eastwood type with the gravelly voice. All in all this game had awesome potential but was poorly executed.  Much of this could have been avoided by having 1. more predictable and sane camera angles, and 2. a strategy guide.  A lot of times I was stuck for hours and I missed some hidden place or something.  With a quick cheat I would have had a lot more fun without feeling too guilty. I hope they come out with a Nocturne 2 that addresses these issues, I would really like to see it.	-1
Stunning graphics coupled with very clumsy controls make this game a feast for the eyes but a major bust when it comes to engrossing game play.  In a  world dominated by such near master works as Lucas Arts' Indiana Jones and  the Infernal Machine, different is not necessarily better and the third  person perspective Nocturne offers is as creepy as the games beautifully  dark images and spine tingling story line.  I suppose the object was to  give Nocturne a cinematic edge offered by some of Hollywood's best  horror/thrillers, but cutting from place to place using numerous movie  angels as our gruff but hardly lovable anti-hero "Stranger" runs through  each scene (ground level, over-head, etc) trying to mow down swooping and  snarling creatures of the night, simply doesn't work here and would likely  earn any film student a solid D for effort!  With one additional option,  first person perspective (or even second person), this might have been a  great game, without it, Nocturne swiftly becomes little more than a tedious  test of your 20/20 vision and manual dexterity.  Bottom line, if you can  get it cheap (one major home electronics store recently had it on sale for  $9.99), or can borrow it from a friend, check it out for it's amazing  cutting edge eye candy.  But just like any fine work of art hanging in  some posh museum, you'll pause to consider Nocturne's brilliant textures,  along with it's use of light and shadow but eventually you'll move on to  something much more stimulating and rewarding, like an amusement park.	-1
Before I bought this game, I downloaded the demo off theinternet and was completely freaked out.  I rushed out and purchasedthe game and was completely freaked out by the money I wasted.  Do you love impossible control options, very high system requirements and load times that have you kicking your computer?  Then you will love Nocturne! This game had all the perfect elements to become a great game, but it fell short on delivery.  However, if you love the Resident Evil genre, then this game is for you, but I warned you.  END	-1
When people play a Final Fantasy game they expect several things to come out of the finished game!  For one thing a great story, great charicters, cool battle system, drama, comedy, and greatness, cool graphics, and overall a great game!  That said and done Final Fantasy VIII is the worst example of how to make a great RPG!  When a great RPG company like Squaresoft, who been making the best RPG's for years now, comes in and makes a game, people expect it to be great!!!  Esspecally if it's a Final Fantasy game!  Well let me tell you that Final Fantasy VIII is anyting BUT a great RPG!!!  In fact this game is so pooryly thought out I am at a loss of words!  I'm sure you've already herd complaints about the complicated battle system, cumcumber (And glitched) plot, and lack of charicter developement!  So I'll spare you the details for once!  Lets just say Final Fantasy VIII not only gives the Final Fantasy series a bad name, but it also gives RPG's as a whole a bad name!  Thank you.  Have a nice day!	-1
This is one of 530 reviews so if you read this I consider myself lucky.  Alright lets get to it.  First off, it was a nice idea.  Finally a game that focused on loving and caring, without being sexual, and helping your fellow man.  However I think that this is all they focused on in production.  The game, and this is sad for a Final Fantasy, is bad.  I'm sorry but it reeks.  SquareSoft is running out of orginal ideas and it is showing.  Although, the ideas were innovative.  Enemies that level up with your characters.  Never will your characters be gods over an enemy.  Unless it's a boss.  For some odd reason boss levels are limited.  So a player can beef up their characters all they want and then beat the messout of the boss without worry.  The Guardian Forces, while still a nice idea, were poorly planned.  A GF is like a Pokemon (in a sick sadistic way).  It gains levels with your character and through it your character can gain abilities.  Problem is GFs can quickly make their 'host' gods very quickly.  At level 15 my main character's strength was through the roof because not only did he have Ifirt equipped but all his strength increases too.  He could cut down enemies in one blow!  While that's nice it takes away from the difficulty of the game.  The battle system is a nightmare too.  If I have to push buttons to get more damage done, then why don't you just program the game to register the extra damage.  Granted this only applies to Squall but it gets very annoying to have to mash buttons to get a character's strength up.  I hated it in Super Mario RPG and I hate it in this game.  The GF spells have to be pumped up if you want it to do any serious damage.  What happened to watching the nice animations and appreciating the work of the artists who designed them.  The story line is my next pet peeve.  The strength of an RPG comes from the story not the gameplay.  The story in this game is shoddy.  Picture a writer with the exact opposite abilities of John Grisham or Micheal Crichton.  It is that bad.  Not only do you have to mash buttons in the battles but you have to mash buttons to get past the annoying long dialouge exchanges (that seem to be written by a pre-schooler with help from their friends).  It is worse than Parasite Eve 2's story.  At least they tried.  I'm done with my tirade now.  You want the truth, this game is not worth [price], it isn't even worth the rental.  Go to a friend who owns this poor excuse for a game and play it there or borrow it.  For those who saw the Charlie's Angels movie.  This is the game the two (since when is it two player) kids are playing when Barrymore pays them a visit.	-1
Could have been a lot better. to put it simply, to perhaps the biggest final fantasy fan ever,me, i was totally diappointed by this game. i hate the whole modern/futuristic look that this game has. even ff7 had this to a point. i want this to be like fantasy..castles, swords, mages, kings, knights, wizards. i hate that there is no armor or accessories, plus i hate that there are no magic points, and magic is not earned. the experience points thing stinks. leveling up/money mean nothin in this game.  my favorite part of RPG is building up wrecking machine armies.  ergo my sabin, celes, edgar, and terra army from ff3/6.  in this game the enemies level up with you so theres no point in leveling yourself up.  this game is soooo dumbed down.  the villain or lack thereof is horrible.  BRING BACK KEFKA!  the gf's take like 20 years to finish making battles so annoying, instead of fun like in ff6 and chrono cross.  the storyline is terrible and the characters are too real looking.  plus every character is essentially the same, each character does not have unique abilities except for the limit breaks. maybe if square had released this game under a different title not final fantasy 8 i woulnt have been disappointed. this remains the only ff game ever that i haven't finished, i stopped playing on disc 3. if u want a good RPG to play, get FF9 which goes back to hardcore fantasy and the original ways that made final fantasy so great. also i recommend ff3/6 which is undoubtable the best FF game ever, and arguably the best game ever. i also recommened chrono trigger and chrono cross which are totally awesome games.  don't waste your time or money with final fantasy 8.	-1
What a poor excuse for a Final Fantasy game, this game should have never came to america. Sure, the graphics are great but the characters make me sick and the plot seems like it came right from a Baby Sitter's Club Book. The main character Squall is suffereing from teenaged agnst, please. Oh, and the magic system (the draw and juctioning system- great idea... ahahahahahahaha. If you want a GOOD Final Fantasy get 7, 9,and 2, or 3 ( 4 and 6 for those people who think that they know Japanese.) Just stay as far away from this game as you possibly can!!!!	-1
ok, I admit if I known how bad this game was I still would have bought the game, but I wish I would had waited until the game went down to $19.99 before I wasted almost $50.00 for it. I hope Square makes FF9 better before they waste millions of dollars on another crap  shoot. Now for my reasons for the 1 star. 1. It was a rip off of FF7. if you want to get FF8  but haven't played FF7 get FF7. 2. Why no voice acting!  I sooooooo recomend it!  C'mon Square at least on the CG movies(pease let FF9 have voice acting)! 3. The characters in the game not just the playable  ones but all of them seem to have no life to them, its just boring how the characters are so dull, I just cant  explain it. 4. Rushed, rushed, rushed, and, rushed. C'mon  Square where is this quality gaming I remember from your other stuff like Chrono Trigger and old classics like that. 5. I don't have anough time to tell you the rest but there  is alot of other stuff.	-1
Final Fantasy 8 is the worst of the entire final fantasy series. As far as game play goes it holds up poorly. Getting new items equip is not a part  of the system even though you can get items to upgrade your weapons nothing  gets done about armor. Levels were pointless your increase was only a  slight one. The monsters did profit a lot from the levels you gained though  and you would easily be at level 99 halfway threw the game. The game  doesn't have many characters and the characters within don't have as much  personality is they did in FF7. The only mini-game within it is a poorly  done card game that gets boring fast. The GF system seems nice at first but  quickly you find out that spending an hour getting the max amount of  something is an easy way to over become powered and takes a lot of time.  The only real control over your characters power level is how much patience  you have for getting more spells into your GFs. As far as plot goes this  game also hold up poorly to other games. It may start off fine but to avoid  revealing too much I'm just going to say by the second CD its going in a  bad direction and it doesn't turn around. Characters never get as  interesting as they were in FF7 and when you're on the third CD. (I think)  You well hit the one plot stop that leaves only the strong of heart to  actually bother finishing this sorry excuse for an RPG. The graphics are  only strong point this game has. They are absolutely beautiful. Defiantly  the best ever for when it was made. You may end up summoning GFs you don't  want to summon just to see the pictures they show when summoned. And  finally as far as length of time it can stay interesting it's a long game  but its only interesting for about 4 hours into the game. If you need it  it's length is one you well need a long time to beat. Overall this game  is not worth buying unless you really like pretty pictures.	-1
This game would have been a MASTERPIECE, had it have not been for the stupidity of blizzard. This game WOULD be extremely fun, but there is one flaw, and this one flaw ruins how much I enjoyed the game: The damn saving option. This really pissed me off. After a hard 3 hours straight of battling, you find out you have to run off to work, so you save and quit the game. After a hard 8 hours of work, you look forward to playin the pretty fun game of Diablo 2 once again. you pop the Cd in the drive, start up the game....WHAT THE HELL?? I JUST BEAT ALL THESE ENEMIES! yes that is right. After you save and quit, the enemies return. sure, its a good way to earn experience, but i think it goes a little too far when you have to defeat about 200 enemies and spend about an hour JUST to get back to where you left off on your last play. At first it's not that bad, mainly because the enemies are not that hard, and there are not many of them. but once i got to the third act, i got so frustrated i just quit the game and didn't play it for a month. This gets so frustrating and time-consuming it is unreal. I loved the first Diablo, and right after i beat it i went out and bough diablo 2 with an expansion pack RIGHT AWAY, expecting this FANTASTIC game, and all i got was a 3 hour excitement from the first 2 acts. Now, i am going to auction it off of ebay as quick as possible, as the sight of the box i have reminds me of the mistake i made of spending a total of 40 dollars on such crap	-1
First things first.  This game IS fun, and it got two stars for that only. Diablo 2 was fun for a while.  Not a long while like Neverwinter Nights, but a little while.  I didn't make it too far into the game because I lost track of the plot, and the game itself was far too repetitive.  Every battle seemed to be the same, and it was all too easy.  The battel system was just point and click, and there was no strategy to it at all.  I know, this is just supposed to be a hack and slash, but it fails even at that. The graphics are moderately good, they are not bad but not real good either.  The sound is good, probably one of the best parts of the game. If you want a hack and slash to be addicted to for less than a week, this is the way to go.  You'll be back.  If you want a hack and slash to play for a while, may I reccomend any of the Icewind Dale's.  If you want a hack and slash with a real good plot, try Neverwinter Nights. I do reccomend this game, but don't go wasting your money on it right now, wait until it is in the bargain bin, so's you don't get mad when you end up geting the game and becoming sick of it in three days.	-1
Let's get one thing clear: Diablo II is nowhere near as good as Diablo 1. There are more reasons for this than I can remember, but I'll try to list as many of them as possible. First off, there's no way to save your progress through the game. All that you can do is save your character. When you reload the game, all of the bad guys are back. This gets EXTREMELY aggravating. Second, there's just too much stuff! Remember in Diablo 1, where there were a dozen kinds of swords and like a hundred different kinds of armor, not counting the two billion magical prefixes and suffixes and all of the Unique items? Well, that's ten times as bad in D2. There's twice as many different categories of items (belts? what the...?), and there are twice as many items in each category. It doesn't stop there, either: it is now possible for nonmagic items to have prefixes as well, and many of those prefixes mean the same freaking thing! A belt can be "poorly made," "low quality," "slightly lower quality," "chipped," "cracked," "rusty," "damaged," "even more damaged," blah blah blah blah blah umpteen et cetera, and it contributes absolutely JACK FREAKING SQUAT to gameplay! Diablo 1 had 2 different potion strengths: Partial and Full, and that was all you needed, but D2 saw fit to create five different potion strengths. You get the idea. Third, the outdoor areas are WAAY too freaking big. Even with Automap turned on, it's impossible to tell whether or not you've explored an outdoor area fully. Fourth, the new spellcasting system just doesn't make the slightest bit of sense. A Barbarian at a given level will have just as many magical abilities, AND be just as good at casting them, as a Sorceress on the same level! And how are these magical abilities acquired? Does your character learn spells by reading spellbooks, like in Diablo 1? No, they learn spells by killing things. Yup, you just go out and kill monsters, and you suddenly know how to cast fireballs. WHAT THE HECK KIND OF SENSE DOES THAT MAKE?!? Fifth, character classes have no maximum stats. This SEVERELY WEAKENS the distinctions between the character classes, and for those hackers out there, it makes it impossible to have a "maxed-out" character. Sixth, there's too much stuff! I know I've mentioned this before, but it's just wrong that you could pick up every item in the whole game and still only see a tenth of all the different combinations of non-magical items. Seventh, there's no more Apocalypse spell. Apocalypse was a cool spell that should not have been removed. D2 does have a few good ideas, though. Gems are very cool, but the fact that they come in five or six different quality levels, plus the fact that items can have widely varying numbers of sockets for them, only worsens the "too much stuff" problem. The Horadric Cube is an awesome idea, because it allows you to do really fun things. You put random things into it, and if you're lucky, they'll combine into something new! You can take 3 gems of a given type and quality, and the Cube will compress them into one gem of the next highest quality. Combine 2 packs of crossbow bolts to get one pack of arrows, or 2 packs of arrows for one pack of bolts. No one but Blizzard knows all of the possibilities. I also love the addition of "set" items, or in other words, unique items that power each other up as you find more from each set. Unfortunately, it is, for all practical purposes, impossible to find all of the items in any one set, leading to hours upon hours of frustrated searching. Let's see, I mentioned Gems, the Horadric Cube, set items... were there any other positive additions to D2? I can't remember any more... Diablo 2 can be fun and playable in its own way, but compared to Diablo 1, it's just horrible. There were too many bad ideas, and too many good ideas that were badly implemented. Don't play this game unless you've gotten bored with Diablo 1.	-1
wow. i bought this game hoping that blizzard had stopped going half way on their games( which is clearly evident in games like, starcraft, warcraft, diablo)well i bought this game, and it was stupid. this is what i affectionately call a "clicker" game. you know, i left click on you,i hit you, i right clic on you, i do a magic thing. boring. they try to make it interesting with the whole unique character thing, but the fact that it'll always be the same thing, every time you play it, doesn't really give you much re-play value. also a killer is the mandatory quests,you must complete every quest in order to move on in the already dull plot. if you really want a real RPG, buy Baldur's Gate, it's cheaper, and you get to completely make your character, and there's a totally non-linear plot. do waht you want, or don't, but be prepared to suffer the consequences. Baldur's Gate puts YOU the gamer in control, while diablo 2, you are just kinda along for the ride. diablo 2 is deffinitely a game for those simple-minded gamers, who don't really like the whole variable plot thing,the ones that don't like having a choice where to go or what to do when they want to, the ones who just want to click their way to victory. this game gets one star, which is many , many more than it deserves	-1
...I finally broke out of the hyptnotization that the game had gotten me into, and now I realize this game for what it is...I didn't like the game...battle.net is a JOKE. Yeah, you heard me. B.net gets about as FAR AWAY from 'quality' as you can GET. Yeah, I just love getting disconnected every 5 minutes and racing straight into the Black Wall of Death, and not seeing my messages appear for 5 minutes, and not being able to pick up items! For another, this game gets extremely tedious after your first month. It's fun, and then, after you've beaten the game 60 times, you realize it for what it is- clicking. Over and over. Then clicking some more. OH GOD THE CLICKING NEVER STOPS. EVEN IN MY HEAD. AAAARRGHHH ITS DRIVING ME INSANE. Really, though, I can almost guarantee that for 60% of you, in 6 months, you will no longer be playing. Either that or you will have gone insane by the CONSTANT CLICKING ...This is not an RPG, not by a long shot. About the only thing it has in common with an RPG is choosing classes and experience points. For one thing, it has none of the complexity that many loved RPGs have. Some of us LIKE flipping through inch-thick manuals, thinking 'OMGZ THIS IS SO COOL'. Plus, I have not seen a SINGLE person role-playing...Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. And this game is an enjoyable, wonderful game...for the first 3-5 months. Then the varnish all soaks off and you see the paint falling off the wood. I would suggest buying this used, or waiting until it's somewhat lower priced...because you probably won't be playing it for a long time in the long run. ...	-1
If you like clicking banners and advertisements off your screen you will love this game, cause thats all it is, clicking annoying flying/popping graphics off your screen.	-1
It IS point and click!  Yeah, the greatest RPG of all time!  It certainly makes you gain weight faster than any other RPG.  All my friends have been fattened and dumbed by this marvel in brainwashing.  They are all now one with the chair that they sit in.  Greatest RPG?  Not even close.  Those who say it is are probably physically dependant upon it by now.  I observe people play with their eyes two inches from the monitor and their mouths slack with saliva dripping from the corners of their mouths.  The only thing that moves is the hand, making quick, convulsive movements.  I say that even if it does expand your brain (Ha, ha), the other negative effects far outweigh the good.	-1
The only diabolical thing about this game is how bad it is. Blizzard's strategy is this: make the game so much fun in the beginning that you sell lots o copies and than later it is no more fun. They make more money faster that way. But wasting money for this game which you will shelf after realizing there's nothing more to do is a bad idea. Hack, slash, pick up, hack slash, level up, pick up, hack, slash, player killer, hack, slash, kill, level up. That's how i can describe the game. Do yourself a favor, if you're a hack and slasher buy a hack and slasher that is actual FUN and doesn't try to be something it's not. RPG fans should really turn away from this. ...	-1
Point, click, point, click, point, click.  Need I say more?  Incase you missed that it was point, click, repeat.  THIS GAME SUCKS!  I doubt the expansion will be any better.  I guess if you are twelve and you get your rocks off by having super items and being able to kill anyone in the game then it's sorta fun, but where's the challenge?  It took me ten minutes to master this game!  I cannot say enough bad things about this waste of money.	-1
This game is Civ II meets D&D. Its horrible. One of my five LEAST favorite games.	-1
Besides having all the system requirements necessary and still not being able to run the game, my biggest problem with it is not being able to save  the game state. This completely ruins it for me--and probably for anyone  else interested in the single-player aspect. It is truly awful to have to  go back somewhere to get items that were perhaps left behind, only to have  to fight everything that you already killed once all over again. Sadly,  this ruins the game and storyline for me. I know other folks who aren't  bothered by this at all, however. For me, though, it's just a terrible way  to have released the game. I honestly think that they should've kept that  save feature in the game, even if it meant releasing the game later.	-1
When Diablo II came out I bought it immediately expecting it would be at least as fun as the first possibly more fun. I got bored of the game easily.  The thing I really didn't like was certain enemys that just run  away. You have to chase them for what seems like an eternity till you  finally catch them and slaughter them, and if you decide to just let them  run away they'll continuously come back to haunt you. Then to make things  worse the game doesn't save what you've killed so if you decide your done  playing for the day the next time you play all the runners will be back.  These enemys are called flayers and when I first encountered them I got  bored of fighting them over and over and discontinued my gameply and moved  to a different game. Another thing I didn't like is running. Not that  running is bad, in fact I love the fact that you can move faster, the  problem with it is that the background (trees, grass, etc.) really bothered  my eyes with it scrolling past so quickly. That is not as big a deal as the  run-a-way enemys, however. If you like to chase endless hords of enemys  then the game is for you.  If not don't bother with it.	-1
The game has many flaws in it making it almost unplayable. The most notable is the Anti-copy feature on the CD's themselves making it impossible for some CD and DVD drives to read. At present Blizzard has no  plans to fix this feature. Also the graphics and lag time in both online  and single play are bad. In order to get the game to play you will need to  tinker with the drivers and system options to get it to work. Reminds me of  the old days of  DOS where a Boot Disk had to be created to change your  memory options. The box reports a minimum of 32Meg of memory, I would think  it is closer to 64Meg. If your character incounters a large amount of  monsters it will bog way down and the monsters will kill you before you get  a hit in. If you must absolutely have the game I would wait a month for the  problems to be fixed. There are already 2 patches in less then 2 weeks with  number 3 in the works.	-1
