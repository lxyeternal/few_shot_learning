These boys are rhyming their asses off. You really got to know what you doing to hang with these guys. The rap game is flooded with nursery rhymes today. Slaughter house brings light and hope to those who were about to give up on rap. They go hard.	1
Slaughterhouse releases their second album "Welcome To: Our House" on shady Records. Their first album was self titled (slaughterhouse)was released in 2009 and it received good reviews from fans and critics, even though they said it was recorded in a week. So everybody is wondering will their Shady debut be better than the first one, well lets see...  I'll give a quick track by track breakdown of the standard edition  1. "The Slaughter" (Intro)  2. "Our House" (featuring Eminem and Skylar Grey) Here we go, slaughterhouses first track to the mainstream world and Joe budden isn't on the track but Em is? Matter of fact Joe does have two lines.. the loud Skylar Grey hook was very annoying but the verses was dope.  3. "Coffin" (featuring Busta Rhymes)Bussa Bus does a good job on the high energy hook, and Slaughterhouse does what they do best and that spit fire! This one of the songs you can outwork to.  4. "Throw That" (featuring Eminem)This song sounds so awkward and forced, as this is for the strip clubs... The hook is atrocious as Em says "I'll throw this d*** on you girl" and "This whole building is probably filled with lil ding-a-lings".  5. "Hammer Dance" The first single produced by AraabMuzik, y'all should already know about this song. One of my fav songs on here.  6. "Get Up" No I.D. supplies a dope beat while Slaughterhouse tells you how they won't lose. They were trying to make a statement with this song and they did.  7. "My Life" (featuring Cee Lo Green) I'm not gonna lie I hated this song at first, it felt like leftover track from Ems recovery album..but after giving it a few more listens it definitely grew on me. This was the their crossover song that should of been as big as Bad Meets Evils "Lighters" song, but nonetheless lyrically they are still on point. Great song  8. "We Did It" (Skit)  9. "Flip a Bird" The title explains the track perfectly, basically the song is about drugs. If rap don't work they will sell drugs if they have to.  10. "Throw It Away" (featuring Swizz Beatz)The third single, I hated this track the first time I heard it but after seeing the video and giving it more listens I actually like it now.  11. "Rescue Me" (featuring Skylar Grey) Skylar shows up for a second time I like this better than the other song shes on, this track is dope and Alex Da Kid supplies a sick head nodding beat. One thing I noticed was Crooked I was rapping exactly like em, he even altered his voice to sound like him...that was kinda weird  12. "Frat House"  Royce & Crooked I have their own verse while Joe & Joell share the third as they use College refenrces which was cool. This is another on my fav tracks on here.  13. "Goodbye" Heartfelt track where they talk about family members they lost. Joe talks about his twins, Crooked talks about his Uncle and Joell talks about his Grandmother. This is a song to check for.  14. "Park It Sideways"  This track is produced by Kane Beatz, and its obviously aimed for the radio.... when the beat gets to the hook it sounds similar to Lil Waynes "Right Above It" beat. The crazy thing about this song is on the hook they say "we got this b**** bumpin like a bug bite" I wasn't really feeling this track  15. "Die" Joell is absent on this track, Joe Buddens definitely had the standout verse, but Royce & Crook are still spitting dope verses. This song is cool.  16. "Our Way" (Outro)Basically a celebrating track, to sum it all up they made it. This song was ok, nothing special  Overall the album solid but I still feel it didn't meet expectations... you have Slaughterhouse and Eminem, that's 5 lyrical giants right there and the songs they collaborated together on was underwhelming. The problem with this album is the pop singles and  hooks, which are really cheesy. I don't even care that they made radio songs cause some of my fav songs are mainstream, its just the fact that the "Pop" songs they made were not good. Other than a few songs, it seems like they had no creative control over this album whatsoever. The same thing happened to Yelawolf when he released "Radioactive". Hopefully the next album they release is more focused and less forced. I think the first album is better than this one, but you should atleast check the album out. The album isn't terrible by any means, but it isn't great either. I give it a 3.5 out of 5 its a solid album	1
These 4 mc's are killing this shh Nickel,Joel, Crooked & JBleezy are at the top finally! Shady aftermath will reign supreme 4ever!	1
So just bought this album today at the yellow tag store, nearly every track is hard. I few complants are; that the Throw it away track is on this album and also their 3rd single. That was it, please support one of the illist crew on a major label, hoping to hear them more on others people albums cause they will kill the track. I'm glad that they didn't get a DRE beat it probably would have delay the album even more, Em did a good job, and the free mixtape they release is also good, so with that said go and buy at stores or online, physical or digital, don't be cheap on the real. Since nealy every track was good my top 3 songs that should have been singles; Throw that, Frat House, and the 3rd either Goodbye or Rescue Me. Update after the second I'll change the second from Frat house to Flip a Bird.	1
this was the worse cd this artist could have made.i seriously regret purchasing this item. is there any body out there who wish to buy this cd?	-1
It's not his best work, but this was not intended to be his 'BEST" work..This is more of an emotional opening to his fans..KIND OF. But it was a free download last yr and then was made into what it is now bc of fans demanding it. So obviously we loved it just like we love The Dream. If you like him, you'll enjoy it.	1
MMG is back with their second album Self Made Vol 2, this time with a new member Omarion (formerly of B2k) . Self Made Vol 1 was a solid album which feauterd the singles "Tupac Back", "Im A Boss", "Play Your Part", "600 Benz" & "Pandemonium" . The album starts off with the 8 min track "Power Circle" feat Kendrick Lamar where everybody holds their own, then on "Black Magic" which is a Meek Mill song with Ross doing his typical repetitive hook that goes "POOF there go the car / POOF there go the crib POOF/ 100 million David Copperfield !" . The standouts on here are "This Thing Of Ours", Fountain Of Youth", "Power Circle", "MIA", & "Bury Me A G". The production is grat on here, I gotta give Ross his credit because he knows how to pick beats. I can see the die hard MMG fans loving this album but the average rap fan is gonna think this is decent at best. Wale is featured more than anybody on here, it would been good to hear more Stalley who only shows up on four songs. Its not terrible but its not classic either, this is summertime music. Alot of these songs are gonna dominate radio and tv like "I Be Puttin On" and "Actin Up" so you cant be mad at MMG for going the commercial route. Another thing is that the album sounds like it could be mixtape... That's just my opinion though.	1
I am a big fan of Omarion, & track 9, MIA, has been on repeat since getting the album, so I don't know about the rest of the songs from 9 on, but so far, I am enjoying the tracks, decent beats, but wow, that Omarion song, I just love it.  I give it 4 stars, as the tracks with Rick Ross really delivers, but that Omarion song, wow.  I hope we will get an album from him soon.  So far favorite song is MIA.  If you are a fan of volume 1, you pretty much know what to expect so I recommend the album.	1

I bought this only because amazon was selling it for $1.99.  I played it once in its entirety and now I forget I even have this album...Yup, its forgettable.	-1
It was 99 cents. What can I say? I bought it and I like about three or four songs on here. Let's Talk is probably my favorite, which is odd because I enjoy almost the entire Wale CD.	-1
Very solid, and diverse album. Stalley, Wale, and French Montana go hard. Better than what I expected. Omarion holds his own on this project too. Banging album.	1
You know I can't get into Wale. .  .I just can't, aside from him I guess Omarion found a paycheck. . .Rickie is always a cool dude to listen to but when you have so many ppl, it gets muddled under each one trying to be better than the other even though that may not be their intentions. So for me, this cataloged under "The Bullshit list"	-1
This album is for straight riders and ganstas, real street kats. If you are not that type u will not like the MMG crew! U can't relate to these type of g's! Bawse Ross is a great example of the kind of people we need more in the world. He knows how to treat people and get them together, and bring out their best. I like how they use Omarion it.. just feels right. G's up nuccas!	1
At thirty-six, Rick Ross is gaining popularity as oppose to his popularity waning.  His upcoming album is easily one of the years most anticipated.  Releasing another compilation from the Maybach Music Group is timely and just further adds to Ross and company's `cash flow.'  That said, 2012's&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/MMG-Presents-Self-Made-Vol-2-Deluxe-Version-Explicit/dp/B008AC49YI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">MMG Presents: Self Made, Vol. 2 (Deluxe Version) [Explicit</a>] is definitely no cash gimmick; there are more than enough solid cuts to make this compilation well organized.  The collective, comprised of Ross, Wale, Meek Mill, Gunplay, Omarion, and Stalley is quite talented where rhyming skill is concerned.  Add some brilliant production work from Lee Major, Beat Billionaire, Cardiak, and Rico Love among others, and Self Made 2 is quite strong.  While the opener "Power Circle" is a mix-tape worthy juggernaut, it is one of the year's best rap tracks, easily.  Featuring no less than six verses, the gospel-hip-hop produced number is epic. Ross gets things started off giving quite the speech:  "If Michael Jackson came alive right now, he'd ask you to smoke one for him, so in his honor." Ross then breaks into a short verse, followed by Gunplay, Stalley, Wale ("...Cash rule the world - at least it do with girls/at least it do with churches, seek the truth and true it hurts..."), Meek Mill ("I like to welcome you to the power circle/clique full of real n--- that'll probably murk you") and finally Kendrick Lamar ("...I know that section eight wanna discontinue my Moms/when they heard that Ohio State gave me 30 racks in July...") A mini-novel could be written of "Power Circle," a valedictory cut by all means.  "Black Magic," performed by Meek Mill featuring Rick Ross packs a punch with Yung Shun's malicious sounding production, not to mention the most clever hook of the affair: "Poof! There go the Car/Poof! There go the Crib!/Poof! A hundred mil, David Copperfield..." Meek Mill's rhymes on the verse are agile, but it's Rozay's impassioned hook that steals the show.  "This Thing of Ours," performed by Wale & Omarion featuring Rick Ross & Nas features a more optimistic sound than the definitively southern "Black Magic." While "This Thing of Ours" is slightly less edgy than the preceding cuts, it is solid and quite enjoyable.  Omarion's hook is a selling point for sure: "This thing of ours/it's so mafioso/you ain't never know though/never gon' know..."  "All Birds" may possess a silly hook, but it is as catchy as anything else.  Ross handles lead duties throughout, with French Montana handling the hook and the second verse.  The production helps to shape the cut, thanks to Beat Billionaire.  "Actin' Up" keeps up the consistency, with production shifting to Rico Love - always good for a lift to any album.  Wale & Meek Mill are assisted by French Montana on this solid, if explicit and repetitive cut. French Montana definitely manages some edgy lines.  "Fountains of Youth" finds Stalley in the lead spot, featuring Ross & Nipsey Hussle. Incorporating a brilliant sample of "Voices for Sadness Theme" (Franco Micalizzi), Cardiak's production is superb. Nipsey Hussle handles the hook capably: "...Stained glass window in the Benzo/lost in the instrumental/keys got me sentimental..." As for Stalley himself, his unique sounding voice and clever rhymes differentiate him from other rappers for sure.  "I Be Puttin' Off" finds Boi-1da behind the boards with Wale featuring Wiz Khalifa, French Montana, and Roscoe Dash.  Ever the relevant hook, Roscoe Dash even manages to reference Instagram - now that's `gangsta.' The cut isn't bad, though a bit long and less inspired than the best.  "The Zenith," performed by Wale & Stalley featuring Rick Ross is a `B', though does manage to yield different production work from other cuts (production is handled by Harry Fraud). "M.I.A.," performed by Omarion and Wale atones easily, delivering a solid R&B number; Wale raps on the closing verse.  "Bag of Money" is definitely solid, with Beat Billionaire's flashy production, and solid performances by Wale, Meek Mill, Rick Ross and T-Pain.  Ross handles the hook, assisted by T-Pain providing some sung reinforcement; the effects are positive.  Meek Mill even manages to quote Ross's epic hook as he raps - now that's loyalty.  "Let's Talk," led by Omarion featuring Rick Ross contains a sample of Notorious's B.I.G.'s "Big Papa." Solid through and through, Omarion delivers a capable vocal performance.  "Black on Black," led by Gunplay featuring Ace Hood & Bun B features superb production, but comes off as lazy and too long ultimately.  The closing cuts "Fluorescent Ink" (Stalley, Wale & Rick Ross) and "Bury Me A G" (Ross/T.I.) atone for any mishaps.  "Fluorescent Ink" yields some of Stalley's best while "Bury Me A G" finds Rick Ross on autopilot.  Overall,&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/MMG-Presents-Self-Made-Vol-2-Deluxe-Version-Explicit/dp/B008AC49YI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">MMG Presents: Self Made, Vol. 2 (Deluxe Version) [Explicit</a>] is a great representation of the Maybach Music imprint.  There is a lot of talent on the roster and certainly plenty of `money' to be made.  There a few missteps here, making this a solid compilation overall.	1
This song is not everyone's cup of tea.  I liked it.  The beat was engaging, and lyrics were not very dirty.	1
Love it!!!!	1
Very nice dancing beat song by Bruno Mars.	1
love this song	1
Love this up tempo song.	1
I don't understand why Bruno took a very nice song and used profanity in the first 10 seconds.	-1

This @#$#% Rocks.	1

Graet music	1
It reminds me of a New Edition throwback.  Love this song.	1

GREAT MUSIC	1
Great CD!!! You'll love it	1
Great product	1
Good song	1
exactly what you expect to hear from Bruno	1
I like it!	1
Love this song and its retro style. It's short, sweet and catchy with a fun vibe. Truth be told, I had this song on loop for what felt like two days after downloading it and whenever it comes on, I get totally into it. Kinda embarrassing but I'm sure you've seen worse performances from people listening to music through their earbuds.	1
Not only a great song to sing to but also a good song to work out too - really has the right motivation	1
The name of the song says it all. Bruno is a wonderful artist and uses his talent well. I believe the young man is going to be in the spotlight for a long time.	1
i will alway treasure the moment i bought this song from your website because it is awesome thank you so much amazon	1
Love the way"old school" meets " new school"...an awesome feel good song!! Great fir dancing or dedicating to that special Someone! BRUNO MARS has done it again!!	1
Another fun song for a party..or even when you're home alone and working on a sewing project. Up beat music is always my sewing or cooking partner. :)	1
I had a beautiful lady. She was my treasure. Things happened in the military and my life ended. Now this song brings me back. It's all good	1
This song is awesome it reminds me of my baby cousin who passed away. It is happy and makes you think of good times.	1
this song is catchy, I don't understand the explicit part except for the first few seconds where he swears which is dumb and unnecessary.	1
I like this song a lot, but I feel like it sounds like 50 million other songs. He He Ha Ha.	1
Loved the song and the funky old school feel!  Bruno Mars makes some really good pop music that doesn't sound too pop.	1
This is my summer jam, yo! nothing makes me want to boogie like listening to treasure  dance dance dance wheeee!!!!!!!!!!	1
Can't say how much I love this song! It just makes me happy listening to it! Wonderful and upbeat and has a different quality to it!	1
Great tune, clean, fresh, and fun.  I really enjoy Bruno's music.  I really like this song because it's upbeat and has a great feeling with it.	1
Bruno Mars is sincere everytime he sings rather it is fast or slow ballad.  I enjoy this song and the video when I first heard it and he is one of the best talented singers around today.	1
"Treasure" is the third single off of Bruno Mars' Unorthodox Jukebox.  It is a slick, 80's r&b flavored number that wouldn't sound out of place on any Prince album from that era.  Mr. Mars has shown himself to be a musical chameleon in the best possible sense.	1
Bruno Mars is very talented. He buts out this nostalgic 80's type single to get people dancing. Somehow I felt like he only did ballads not really something that is good work out music. The item downloaded with no problem	1
this sound is so classic . love it remindes me of the early 90s music .this song takes me back to my younger years not quite shure why	1
Love the song.  I haven't taken time to listen to the lyrics but I still love it.  The beat puts me in a good mood.	1
Im not a huge Bruno Mars fan, but after seeing him perform this song on The Voice I had to get it. Good thing they did, because I never wouldve heard it. Now its all mine! It makes me smile.	1
From the opening bars of this tune, I was thinking a lot of&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/C2C-s/dp/B00B2H097E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">C2C's</a>&nbsp;"<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Genius/dp/B00B7H300C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Genius</a>."  I'm hearing it in the rhythm guitar and most definitely in the chorus.  C2C's is a very catchy song that I'm surprised didn't catch on a little more, likely owing to the band's relative obscurity.  So, for a relative soundalike, this one is taking off.  Good on Bruno for that.  "Genius" has got this song beat on low-end thrum, though; this pop gem could use a little bit more oomph on the bass end.  This is my old-guy bias, but I'm also hearing distinct tones of&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Earth-Wind-and-Fire/dp/B00136NUG6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Earth, Wind and Fire</a>, all the way back to 1978 or so.  I'm getting that in the bass pops, the chord drops and the simple clapping backing the chorus.  This is not to say that this song sounds old or stale, but its roots are most definitely showing; it works for this song, and is a respectful nod to those who've come before.  This is a simple, easy, smooth and highly accessible song.  It's got an easy beat, not some relentless 120bpm club pounding, but a smooth rhythm perfect for dancing or singing along, and/or both.  My one and only complaint is that this song doesn't even make three minutes.  Sure, it's a pop song and commercial radio play is still a medium for dissemination and moneymaking, but this jam should go at least five minutes, with an extended keyboard solo.  Why end such a good thing so quickly?  Let's hope for some remixes sometime soon that will remedy this.	1
I love this song so much that I  purchased it without realizing the (Explicit) warning. Why in the world would anyone ruin such a pretty song with one dumb statement said before the song even starts. What is this world coming to? Now I have to go back and buy the (clean version). I guess I shouldn't say I have to buy it again, but, I love Mr. Mars and think he's very talented and fresh so....	-1
OMG so in love with this record! Every time I hear it in a store and just want to dance and it makes me so happy! Great job Bruno!	1
I LOVE ALL OF HIS MUSIC. I AM THANKFUL THAT THERE ARE THE CLEAN VERSION OF HIS SONGS ,THOUGH. BRUNO'S MUSIC MAKES ME WANT TO DANCE  AND THEN SOME ARE SOO ROMANTIC AND I BELIEVE SO REAL TO LIFE EVENTS.	1
This is a wonderful song and I have wanted to download it since I heard it.  I love this song!!!	1
Love Bruno Mars- Downloaded several of his songs from Amazon. Very versatile artist. will listen again and again. Love that you have such a variety of music available for download.	1
I'll be riding in the car mt hubby driving and I hear a song I will write down the chorus or a bunch of words and go home and search Amazon for the song. I usually know if it's Bruno but not the title.  Then I buy music. Next time I buy NOW CD they will all be on it!	1
Just because I saw him on SNL, I had to have this album.  Time for me to update my stock	1
BRUNO HAS A UNIQUE SOUND...WHEN HIS FIRST NOTE IS SUNG YOU KNOW ITS HIM....HE HAS A STYLE AND VOICE IS UNBELIEVABLE....	1
In my opinion he has the strongest Michael Jackson sounds while knowing it's Bruno Mars. The only one close or equal is Chris Brown. But Bruno has made it a point to have his music very different the MJ's. Sounds like him but the music's beat is not as hard.	1
I picked up Bruno Mars Treasure because I heard it on the radio and quickly realized that it didn't sound like anything else on the radio today. It has a really funky beat that reminds me of something straight out of the 1970s in a good way. Although I personally haven't done it, I can totally picture someone trying to moonwalk across their kitchen floor to this song. Its just one of those summer songs that makes the listener want to act crazy which is entirely what the summer is about.	1
The future of R&B, a Great Artist! This guy can sing, hope to see more from him! Love this music!	1
How can you not be happy listening to this song?! Totally upbeat and fun song to groove to while stuck in traffic; will make traffic not seem as bad	1
LOVE IT	1
great music	1
Love Bruno Mars. This song has a profound affect on me. Repeat and blasted to the highest my radio will play	1
Take me to BRUNO SING THE THE TUNES UNTIL YOUR TOES CRUL MAY HE ALWAYS POUND HIS CHEST CLEAN OR EXPLICIT BOO YA JUST SAYIN	1
Wow, that Mr. Mars is quite a vocalist...  full of passion and raw sexual energy. No wonder women like this dude so much. It's a good song though, but yes, it is yet another song about making love, and yes, he does say "f--- like gorillas" one time, if that bothers you in a bad way, but it's kind of drowned out by the music.	1
Song definately for adults, desire and lust for sure..Good song. The quality is good, easy to download to cloud player and to computer and ipod.	1
epically awesome song, definitely something to make love to your girl to. its got a great beat and in true bruno mars fashion has a real smooth edge to it	1
I love everything that Bruno does. He is amazing. He music resembles a lot of peoples lives and everyone can relate to it.	1
I really enjoyed listening to  this song, I would suggest listening to this song. I'm getting this artist  other songs also.	1
Bruno can hit them notes that make you wanna be able to sing...I love the line 'banging on my chest...bang, bang...gorilla! Love it!	1
The first time I heard this song I thought it was awesome.  I can say for the most part the MTV VMA went good except for the face it was mighty hard to hear them on the TV.  But that is besides the point.  I just love this new mix that Bruno Mars used with this CD.	1
Cant listen to this and not feel the raw sexual energy it creates.  Sometimes cant listen to the whole song without knowing I can get some sexual release very soon after hearing it.	1
Bruno Mars goes varies his musical styles among sensual, sensitive and party-time.  "Gorilla" belongs in a new category:  weird.  While Mars is trying to make a song about very passionate love-making, his choice of metaphor ('making love like gorillas') is pretty bad.  It's bizarre enough to make Jane Goodall shake her head.  The beat is ok, but the lyrics are too strange for me to recommend this song.	-1
It wasn't very good. All because of them trying to censor out MF. They did not do a very good job on that. The song is still good, though.	-1
I don't know anyone who can't relate to some aspect of this song. Considering their other songs it isn't that offensive but is a great break from the traditional songs.	1
Needed music for the office X-mas party. This was a great change up from the regular boring songs. I love this type off tunes!!!	1
I don't like sad movies or sad books, but you have a sad song and I will be all over it.  This is a song of a guy who regrets letting his girl go and sees in hindsight that he should have done more to keep her.  I have listened to it on repeat for days now and my husband wants to delete it.	1
AWESOME	1

I like the song, (men) should listen to the message	1
Good song	1
Classic. Sweeeeet song.	1
Love, love, love.  This was my first Bruno Mars download and I love it.	1
The song, "When I Was Your Man" by Bruno Mars is such a wonderful tune. It will be enjoyed by many!	1
I love this song so for sure it is good! It keeps me awake while I am driving and it makes me relax.	1
This song is so cool and I love the liricks in the song and I love Bruno Mars a lot as a pop sing and I think this song is the most coolest song on the planet.	1
I like this song.  I listen to it often.  Added to my Kindle with all of my other favorites.  Inexpensive downloads.	1
I love singing along to this song. My students do, too! It's very catchy and is done beautifully. Soulful too.	1
It is such a great song and he has such an amazing voice.  I actually love having it on my Kindle!	1
Another christmas purchase and the group ended up in Times Square at the holidays.  Glad I got familiar with his music to keep in the loop for a middle aged woman who still likes this century's music.	1
Love Bruno Mars, love listening to his music.  Great song, great artist.  I would recommend this song if you love his music.	1
I heard this one day last year and fell in love with the idea of the song.  i like that you can memorize all the words.	1
This is a song that reminds us not to take things for granted and to appreciate what we have. Take time to reflect. I would recommend this song to everyone. A beautifully written song. Bruno Mars sings it beautifully too.	1
He sings this song so beautifully you start to melt just listening to it...I love the new version and he is just one cool guy.	1
This product is as advertised. Satisfactorily made and serves the purpose for which it was designed. Would recommend it to others.	1
Now the only reason I like this song is because I do believe that at some point in every females life that there is ONE guy that we wish would say these words to us... the question is though.. is it the one you want to hear it from... ;)	1
I love the artist and the whole tone and mood of the song, a definite buy that will remain popular even when the song is considered to be vintage.	1
ignore the gal  she had no choice but to move on.  If regrets come way too late the gal will never return.	1
Bruno Mars at his best! This is beautiful baby making love song. hahahahaha Move over Keith Sweat, you have been replaced! LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!!!!	1
i love the song!! so sorry about not giving a long description about the song but I believe if you are going to purchase a song either you will know the song already or you will listen to it previously to purchasing it! but amazon requires a certain amount of words to describe the product in order for it to come off your "review purchases"	1
I didn't know it was Bruno Mars when I started looking for the song.  I love the soulfulness of the song.	1
i have enjoyed a number of his songs and this is just the newest one i have added to my growing  collection	1
I fan from Bruno Mars but this song is a beautiful song that I know everybody going to love greatly	1
Love amazon music compared to iTunes.  Easy to download and can put on several types of devices include ipods, ipads, iphones and other music players	1
Great song.  Prefer Amazon music over iTunes.  Easy to download, and install on apple and non-apple music players, iphones, ipad, etc...	1
Hope there are some men in your fan base that can listen to the message in this song...truer words were never spoken!  Bruno is a gifted song writer and the melody is very nice.  Great song.	1
so far this is the best song he has ever made, but got a lot of close seconds...., anxious to hear more put of him.	1
I enjoy listening to this song.. it gives me no problems and plays all the way through. Glad to have this app on my phone to download music.	1
Bruno Mars is a good singer. I really enjoy his music. I like this song, and enjoy listening to it	1
I love his voice. I heard this song once about a week ago and had to buy it because it was such a pretty song.  His songs remind me of Billy Joel's early works.	1
Good band, good song, wish all of amazon's mp3 downloads weren't so expensive. I can't believe they are making me type this many words to publish.  Lame.	1
This is the kind of thing every ex girlfriend fantasizes about. Having the guy realize he lost the best thing he ever had. Girls will like this song. If a guy dedicates it...points scored.	1
This is the best R&B song I've heard in years, Can't wait for his next album, this is worth buying, a very good artist!	1
It was easy to find once downloaded and it is already in my iPod touch. Thank you for the gift, unblock me!	1
I seem to buy allot of bruno's music and just the singles. Will have awhole cd soon! Love this music and so does my hubby!!!!	1
There is no mistaking that Bruno Mars voice, lyrics and style are all geared torwards being to consumate sensitive ladies' man.  Some of his songs, like "Nothing on You" and "The Way You Are", Mars hits the right notes in being the caring boyfriend, but still being confident and energetic.  "When I Was Your Man" is not nearly as successful.    In this song, Mars comes off like a whiny, whipped ex-boyfriend.  If you listen to, and read, the lyrics, it's about how he should have catered to every single wish and whim of girl he's singing to but, because he didn't, they are no longer together, and he is moping about it.  Being attentive and caring about your woman is incredibly important, but the degree to which Mars makes it seem like he needs to be in this song, he would be easily controlled and not very interesting to the girl after she got used to be fawned over.    Mars nails it most of the time.  This wasn't one of them.	-1
My grandson loves this song.  I actually downloaded it for him to hear over and over.  He really likes Bruno Mars, and the songs he sings! Good song!!  Rhonda	1
This is another hit for Bruno Mars he is an amazing artist. Really nice song he is always putting out nice hits	1
Awesome song! I haven't been able to get it out of my head since I first heard it. It is great.	1
what more can I say Bruno is a star and a voice of class of the past wonderful and the best	1
I only buy songs that I love or that my family love.  This is one of those songs.  My love of music crosses many genres and this song has a great sound to it.	1
Just what I was looking for. Tends to be more honest and grown up..not kid pop stuff. I like that.	1
play this song, the more I love it.  Bruno Mars is very talented and his song has a beautiful message.	1
I am not a Bruno Mars fan but I do love this song. First  heard it on the voice last season.	1
Great music- should have done it sooner. it gives you a little bit of everything.. I have to buy my sister one so that she will leave mines alone...Loving it!!!!	1
Bruno mars wow up and coming band.  They just keep getting better and better.  Like this song a lot.  Me and my children sing along with this song every time we hear it.	1
Great song. I love the lyrics and Bruno's voice is wonderful. The first time I heard this song I knew I would have to own it.	1
I enjoyed listening to this song, because it shows a man's side of a breakup, insteadof just the woman;s side. Good job, Bruno.	1
I really like this song and the message.  It has a great melody and good beat.  I love most of Bruno Mars music.  Yea, I'm in my 60's but I stay current with the music and love most styles from the 40's to current times.  But I draw the line at RAP and explicit lyrics.  I listen for melody, beat and message.  Almost all Genres but I had to buy this one!	1
This is the version I've been hearing on the radio. I love this long! Somehow, this version is 69 cents but the other one (which sounds exactly the same) is $1.29.	1
This is a good song.  It plays well on my phone and computer.  This is a good song. Bruno is a great singer.	1
I am a fan of this singer and was lucky to find this song as one of the discounted songs at one time	1
What can you say - it's Bruno Mars!  Love, love, love this song.  Every girl wants someone to feel this way about her, at some time in her life :)	1
I heard this song on the radio and I used my Shazam app right away to find out what it was. Such a great song to really get you thinking and listening to the lyrics! Great for times when you just need to relax!	1
Bruno Mars...LOVE HIM! There are no words to describe how much I love this little man and his big voice! LOL  It's amazing and the way he sings this song makes you rethink the way you treat the one you love. You can feel the pain in his voice.  I have been a fan of his since he hit the scene but this just took me over the edge.  This song is a man's broken, sincere and apologetic answer to Beyonce's "Single Ladies".  I can't stop listening!!	1
THE LYRICS ARE VERY TRUE TO LIFE , THE MUSIC MAKES YOU WANT TO DANCE.  I LOVE BRUNO AND HIS MUSIC.	1
I like this song just as I love his break out  Hit called Locked Out Of Heaven that I have too	1
Bruno Mars is one of my Son's favorites. I have listened to this song a lot and decided to get it for my own.	1
Easy to purchase and download, easy to open on my own computer and download to iTunes for my iPod! Love it!!!	1
Really touches your heart. I think it's a most beautiful song for those who just don't get how to Love another.	1
"When I Was Your Man" is the second single off of Bruno Mars' Unorthodox Jukebox album.  The song is a straight ballad with only piano accompaniment.  While Mr. Mars gives an impressive vocal performance, the song is not nearly as memorable as the album's first single "Locked Out Of Heaven".  The song probably should get a higher rating, but it doesn't catch my ear like "heaven" does.	-1
There are so many artists out there right now who have no real talent. When Bruno Mars sings, it sounds so raw and powerful. Love this song.	1
Song played in my computer and mp3 player with no problems. I can listen to it anytime I want. Thank you Amazon!	1
I know this song because we have all walk a mile in this shoes.  if you have not then you have not lived.	1
Love this song, It's what every woman wants to hear from a man she's no longer with! Love Bruno Mars	1
i think Bruno Mars is a rising star and he will be very successful. He can take any beat and make it smooth.	1
When it has came down to Bruno Mars, musically he is definitely getting a hot streak going with his music. He definitely has been having some really good songs out right now with his soulfulness doing well. That showed well with Locked Out Of Heaven late last year, and it is showing well with When I Was Your Man, the second single from his sophmore album Unorthodox Jukebox. The song really is a intimate and simple piano ballad from start to finish. It definitely fits well with his voice, and is definitely showing a growing strength in his voice that is definitely well with his natural talent. It is the kind of song that many artists aren't actually doing right now, something simple and intimate. I hope Bruno can keep making good songs like this one.  Song: B	1
I downloaded this song (When I was your man) very easily and love it. I love the ease of downloading.	1
This is a great song that helps me cool down after my workout.  It is kind of sad but still sweet.	1
Heard Bruno Mars perform this song on the Voice and had to have it on my playlist.  Even though I liked the emotion in the live performance more, this song has been a great addition to my favorites.	1
This is an excellent collection of classical music. I have many of the "Dedicated Reader" collections, and this one does not disappoint.	1
Not only do I listen to this while I read, but I also put this on while I wind down in bed for the night!  The arrangement is wonderful!  Couldn't have asked for a better selection of Classical music!  I look forward to purchasing the entire Classical Music for the Reader collection!	1
My Wife and I enjoy setting in the family room in the evening and enjoying a cup of coffee while listening the our collection of songs.	1
even though some of the selections are a repeats they are always good ...... this is a good choice for those who like music to think to.... because it is not too obtrusive....  Vic	1
I love listening to this kind of music!  It is just so soothing and relaxing to me and other family members.	1

Sounds authentically Irish.  I like the tones.  Relaxing and soothing to listen to.  I got it for my 8 mo. old and I enjoy listenin as well!	1

I love listening to this kind of music!  It is just so soothing and relaxing to me and other family members.	1
I enjoy this music sometimes when I need some down time. Enough of all the worries in the world. I enjoy listening to all kinds of music. Try it you might like it.	1
It was beautiful, wonderful guitar music.  So nice sounding.  I would buy this album if it wasn't free.  Terrific, fantastic.	1
I downloaded this album because I'm having my first baby. Upon listening to the samples, even though I am having a boy, I liked the music enough to get many of the songs off this album for listening to now & for in the future.	1
My children are a little old for lullabies, 10 and 12. I actually downloaded all these "Sleep Like a Princess" songs for myself because they are truly relaxing and beautiful and I love the cultural aspect of it!! I have terrible anxiety at times and these have helped so much!!	1
My young daughter is just loving it!  I would recommend it to anyone looking to get music for their children.	1
This music is so relaxing.  I love all this music by the lullaby tribe.  It will calm you down and put you to sleep.	1
I cannot comprehend why this album and all the tracks in it have to bear titles that are so girlish.  I almost ignored it when I first saw the album title, but then decided to give it a try anyways since it was FREE.  The tracks turn out to be absolutely relaxing and enjoyable, and have nothing to do with "princesses".  In fact, one of the tracks reminds me of the theme for tristram from the game diablo. I gave it 4 stars because of the stupid titles.  Edited: fixed some typos. But most importantly, changed the word "feminine" to "girlish" because the word feminine gave some people the wrong impression that I was complaining about the "political correctness", which was not my intention.	1
Very good product. I would recommend it.	1
Did not like this album.	-1
Great Music!	1
It helped my niece to go to sleep and that is the only thing that I wanted from it. So I think that this is great.	1
by loves the music at bedtime..	1
I "purchased" this as a free Kindle download. It is fantastic. Very calming and peaceful. I would pay for it.	1
I use this for a 2 year old who I babysit for on weekends. She uses a sound machine at home so it was hard for her to fall asleep in my busy house. The music is soothing and on some tracks there are nature sounds. She now just rolls over and goes to sleep during nap time.	1
I adore this album! I know it says "like a princess" but I downloaded this when i was pregnant with my son & for his first month home we played it every single night (on a playlist mixed with other calm music.) I still love it & put it on from time to time, we just need it less now as he sleeps better on his own than he did at first.	1
I didn't care for this sampler as it did not do the trick for assisting me to fall asleep. Maybe someone else might have better luck with it.	-1
It  helps me to sleep at night I have it with o music and I like that it is free	1
It literally makes my daughters naps at least an hour longer it makes them so relaxed. There's one or two songs on here that are just weird and I think I'm going to delete them, they're just not relaxing. But most of them are and I love this sampler!	1
Sleep, sleep, sleep with these superb songs.  Can't go wrong with these nicely recorded renditions.  The price of free sealed the deal.	1
I'm always looking for soothing music to play in the background of my classroom. This will work very nicely for me.	1
My little girl loves that she has a new nighttime CD for bed. Especially since it has princess music from all over the world. Beautiful music, I like it too.	1
I have the AmazonMP3 Premium Cloud app and this was easily found just by searching for FREE and it is very good!	1
hello,   this title is mis-labeled.  it is not just for taking naps like a princess, etc. although that is not particularly a bad thing.  the guitar songs are great for doing odds and ends in the garage and elsewhere.  but, if you sit down in your most comfortable chair ready to listen to some guitar music, you might fall asleep as the music is very soothing.  it is a great collection of guitar music and thank you for having it available online.  great product and simple delivery via amazon app.  yrmv	1
This mix of slow music is awesome for bed time or relaxing, it has a very diverse sound to it too that I like very much.	1
My daughter falls asleep to white noise or a playlist of sleep music I've been gathering.  Added this album and she still sleeps, so it's good.  Also, she loves the idea that it's "princess music."	1
I use for some quieting music in my classroom when they return from lunch. Not too lullaby-esque. They can still concentrate.	1
My granddaughter loved this music because it calmed and relaxed her. Kids have so much difficulty falling asleep but this music sampler worked like a charm.	1
The music on this sampler is both soothing and slightly exotic. Spanish guitars predominate, reminding me of Seville and the island of Majorca. I have not heard of the "Lullaby Tribe" but I am going to search them out. I'm not sure that this will be a "put you to sleep" album but it is definitely an album that will help you unwind.	1
Some tracks seem like the same as the last one. A lot of Cricket chirping in quite a few songs. Guitar strumming is a little too loud to be considered Lullaby material. I think this would keep a baby awake not help it go to sleep. Not soothing enough in my humble opinion to be considered a cd for kids. Maybe for older adults while there awake but not for trying to fall asleep.	-1
I got this mp3 originally because it was free, and I figured why not.  I was having difficulty sleeping so I turned the music on.  I was surprised that it relaxed me enough to fall asleep.	1
This instrumental is very relaxing.  I put it on right before I go to bed and it calms me down.  I would recommend this product to anyone that needs something to put your mind at ease.	1
My Wife and I enjoy setting in the family room in the evening and enjoying a cup of coffee while listening the our collection of songs.	1
This was just okay. Not the best. It really could have been better,like if the songs were full songs. they sounded nice though.	-1
I got this for naptime when I have my grandkids, and it really settles them down. Works great for me also after a busy day.	1
Honestly, this just sounded like something I could try. I love new age and ambient music. To be honest, I fall asleep with in 10-15 minutes, and I've yet to hear much more of it.	1
We took this with us on the road and it was nice to have in the hotel room (9 nights of road travel) over our christmas trip.  zNot for kids only - the title is misleading.	1
SLEEP LIKE A PRINCESS is a nice collection of mostly guitar and light piano renditions.  Amazon does offer quite a few albums that are great for reducing stress and promoting relaxation/ meditation, but this album just has a soft feel to it but nothing close to relaxing.  A better collection would be&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Relaxation-Meditation-Exclusive-Amazon-Sampler-Featuring-60-Minutes-of-Music-for-Relaxation-Meditation-Massage-Spa-Yoga/dp/B008E5YZ6S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Relaxation & Meditation (Exclusive Amazon Sampler Featuring 60 Minutes of Music for Relaxation, Meditation, Massage, Spa & Yoga)</a>  But, it's hard to find too much fault for a nice collection of 20 songs for $1.  So, I won't.	1
This is supposed to be the music royalty fell asleep to back when guitarists and lute players would play at their bedside.  The music definitely still works.  I like the extra touches and nature sounds.	1
This relaxing music has an array of cultural influences. It certainly dose help for sleep & relaxation. I'm not sure why it's in the children's music genre, this is effective for adults also. I can feel the change taking place when I listen to this 20 track set. Here is an hour and 8 min. of sleep & lullaby music which includes 10-minutes of restful Spanish guitar in approx the middle of the set. The music is very much like the Lifescapes series except with-out strongly distinct, rhythmic melodies.  Certain instruments lend to an old world sound ~ such as  ~ French Lute  ~ Scottish Lute ~ Flutes ~ Spanish guitar ~ Mexican guitar ~ Classical and Renaissance Guitar ~ and an Irish melody among others. Songs have added flavor with English field birds ~ and crickets that are so predominate ~ it sounds like a field full of crickets. The Classical guitar reminds me of  Mason Williams guitar in "Classical Gas" except soft and mellow.  For those that have trouble relaxing or sleeping this sampler is worth a try.	1
Nice to be able to play the free Amazon Music in the car using the Car Mp3 Player Fm Transmitter Modulator with USB Sd Slot	1
I use this music for background ambiance in my holistic healing practice.  It creates a very relaxing atmosphere so my clients feel rested.	1
Love this album. So sad this show was discontinued	1
If you liked the music from 'Tron: Legacy' you will like the music from 'Tron: Uprising'.  Joseph Trapanese orchestrated Daft Punk's music for 'Tron: Legacy' and was commissioned to compose the music for the TV series 'Tron: Uprising'.  Both scores are similar, having the same driving rhythm and treatment of music themes - it is obvious that the same hand wrote them (Daft Punk's role notwithstanding).  The first 16 tracks of the album are by Mr. Trapanese, and I thoroughly enjoyed them.  The last 4 tracks, however are 'remix' of earlier Trapanese tracks by other musicians and have a definite disco sound, which I do not care for.	1
I've enjoyed listening to this CD (and the MP3s on my iPod) in the car. Now, if Disney will release the entire season on Blu-Ray...	1
Quite frankly, I think Tron Uprising has the best music of any animated show to be found on television, even beating out my fondness for the quick quirky songs in Adventure Time, if anything, because of the consistency of the quality of the music throughout any given episode of Tron Uprising. The style of Daft Punk, the artists who did the music for the Tron Legacy movie, is honored but Trapanese definitely puts his own mark on his work. It was a treat to find this album and I'm strongly considering ordering a hard copy of this album just so I have it in my collection.	1
I like Tron: Uprising. Im into science fiction and this is one of the few shows that i've come accross that doesnt border on the supernatural. (As of yet#  I'm still going through the whole Cd but it sounds exactly like the show, this is going to be some great study music! I also look forward to catching up on Tron, i've seen both movies but ive been missing the shows ever since Dyson came #I only saw the last half of that first episode :( # I wish Disney XD had it come on a more regular TV  schedual. They do not make catching up easy!!! Oh well, Tron Lives!!  #Lets hope Paige, Beck, Cutler and Mara do too ;)	1

The sweet sound of tranquility is package in this set of 100 best classical rhythms. One can only sit back with a glass of wine and watch as your little ones fade away sleeping to the sounds that get the brain waves flowing in the right direction. Can help sharing my nieces story, since she was 3 years old or so she was given a CD player and one day she join the ballet academy of dance and music in her home town and I can only say that she got it in her mind that the way to listen to great music as you slept was to play classical music just as she did at the academy. Today she is 14 years old and is a gifted child. She out paces many in her class in math, science, history, and just about anything she puts her mind to. I credit the classics she listen to since she was 3 years old. She continues today to put her self to bed listening to such great classical hits. Hope every one gets there children started early in admiring and loving the classics.	1
Although this album is titled as "baby classics" it's a great album for anyone who enjoys quality classical music but a group of great orchestras.	1
I like to listen to music at night..... on low...... this one is perfect and must have been designed that way... great selection and renditions	1
Don't let the title mislead you. Here is a collection of beautiful musical passages focused on relaxing and meditative moods. Performances are good, balance is mostly good (a few exceptions).	1
I fell asleep while listening to these tracks, so therefore my review is not accurate and should not be trusted.	1
However, I usually do not rate because of the number of words on amazon.com as part of this requirement which is time consuming...this group is off the charts good!  Love you sooooooooo much.	1
The song will minister to you very well if you need reasurrance ,that anything in your life that's going wrong God will Fix it like he said he would.	1
Hard to find song. love to hear old songs that you can't find just anywhere. Will buy more and more	1
Great music to listen to and to get you in a mind to worship, Good music for a road trip or just going around the block.	1
Love this song.	1
great	1
great,	1
Simply amazing	1
Great music to listen to and to get you in a mind to worship, Good music for a road trip or just going around the block.	1
This song is song by two people interacting.  The voices blend in so beautifully.  You gotta add this one to your medial library, and free too., have mercy...	1
Soothing voice and lyrics, great for those rainy days of sitting in front of the fireplace, or just relaxing in the Lazy Boy chair reading a good book. Or just for quiet times alone. Great mix of instruments, violin and guitar. Sandra's voice is beautiful.	1
This is a sincere, lilting,  clear and harmonious version of an old classic. A calm, confident declaration of the sovereignty of God.	1
love	1
I like it! Thanks!	1
Excellent rendition of this classic hymn.	1
Loved the song	1

Once again another song I would reccommend people to purchase!	1
great song	1
Enjoyable !	1
Thanks	1
Really nice song...	1
Thumbs up!	1
Didn't like	-1
I recommend Amazon music. i have started buying most of my music here.	1
Like the song	1
A christian classic.	1
Another great song. Keep reaching out to the young in hopes they grab, on tight before it's to late. Times are pointing closer to the coming then ever before. Will you be ready? How I continue to pray for all even my worse enemies.	1
As a Christian, I'm always looking for music that exalts my Father. This is a good song for that purpose. Easy to follow lyrics and music make this a song that memorizes well.	1
If you like Christian music - this is one of the best songs! A really good singer and the song was free.	1
It is good to get good music and play it whenever you want to. Play games while you listen also.	1
Great Real good songs on it. Can listen to it anywhere. My kindle gift was so great. Am learning how to use it.	1
I liked the music and variety it offered.  Very good value for the price and easy to download onto my player.	1
I downloaded this for my nursing home residents to enjoy. They thought it was wonderful and it brought back memories. How nice you provide this music for free. Thank you!	1
This song has been playing an is still playing on Christian contemporary stations. A very stirring song about Christ and how much he loves us.	1
I REALLY LIKE THIS SONG BECAUSE THE TITLE IS SENTIMENTAL  TO ME. WHEN YOU LISTEN TO THE WORDS IT IS HEART RECHING.	1
A great buy for me. Thank you very much. Hope to do business with you again.	1
it's a hit	1
This song brings nostalgia... My home church choir down in Franklin, VA would sing this.  Just a great spiritually filled uplifting song!	1
This song ministers to me greatly to persevere through hard times and trying times that we must face and not give up on GOD.	1
THEY ARE THE BEST!	1
This is one of my go to album for night night. Listen to the samples and hear for yourself. Amazon has the most outrageously GREAT prices on some of their new age collections. It is more than worth the couple of dollars you'll spend!	1
i really love this kind of music. i turn it on at night when i can't sleep. works every time	1
I was looking for meditation music and got elevator music. Why anyone could call it "new age" I don't know.	-1
i do not want to waste any words to review this but it is very soothing to listen to, done	1
Although I don't think it is a naughty song, it is definitely one of Marvin's best. He always conveyed such emotion with his beautiful voice. Sexy, absolutely!	1
First....Put his album on and it's on..The music the Beat,the words,the voice,,,,I really love this album,so will you.it speaks of LOVE in ever way,you can't miss the genius here. I cant stop selectingthe repeat button.	1
I like the music but it's not the best music I have listened to so far. When you listen to this music, you may feel relaxed.	1
This instrumental is very relaxing.  I put it on right before I go to bed and it calms me down.  I would recommend this product to anyone that needs something to put your mind at ease.	1
My Wife and I enjoy setting in the family room in the evening and enjoying a cup of coffee while listening the our collection of songs.	1
This is a nice group to select from to create a favorite's disc.  Here's some beautiful music to own ~ how-ever ~ some of these tracks are quite spirited and energetic. Often the music has a feeling of power & strength ~ then mellows to a beautiful softness.	1
This collection was okay,not the best. It could have been better and I really wanted it to be better. just eh.	-1
I must confess, I'm not the biggest fan of New Age music.  However, I found this album to contain very relaxing music.  One could play this album as background music at a dinner party or even for relaxing after a stressful day at work.  Great value.	1
Free music and lots of it.  Good quality sound.  Recommend it for listening while on computer or just relaxing background music.	1
Honestly, this just sounded like something I could try. I love new age and ambient music. To be honest, I fall asleep with in 10-15 minutes, and I've yet to hear much more of it.	1
I'd call this a Smooth Jazz album before a New Age one; some of the cuts even sound more like excerpts from movie soundtracks, but it has enough esoteric and ethnic instruments and elements to have it qualify it as such.  It may also have to do with the fact that the majority of the artists appearing on it are Asian- obviously as vehicle to showcase their talents.  Not that it's a bad album- it's great!- just mis-labeled, in my opinion.  A few highlights from Disc 1: Moonday: playful and engaging live piece from Andreas Vollenweider.  A Poet in the Afternoon: feels a lot like an extended tone poem, but very enjoyable.  Heart: alto sax, strings and piano combine for a romantic interlude.  Silver Spring Rain: mostly a piano/cello combo until a melancholy yet effective female voice shows up.  Wonderful.  White Fantasy: slow, piano only piece; you'll really enjoy Watanabe's tinkling on the ivories.  Waterfall: another piano-oriented track accompanied by a few cameos of middle strings and some keyboards.  Disc 2: Korea Idea: pan flute, xylophone, drums... very immersive!  It's like taking a slow boat down the Han River.  Moon Healing: as sentimental and romantic a tune as you'll ever hear.  The tenor sax and strings were beautiful, simply beautiful.  Japanese Roots: the intro definitely invokes imagery of a showdown between two bushido facing each other in a forest of bamboo- and gets drawn out too long- but it soon settles into its own groove.  Reminds me of the work of Noel Pointer and George Howard.  Whether you're kicking back reading, exercising or just want a break from the world, this is a very relaxing, somber interlude that'll completely transport you to a quiet, soothing place.  And for free!	1
We took this with us on the road and it was nice to have in the hotel room (9 nights of road travel) over our christmas trip/  Very nice to rest after a long day of sightseeing.	1
This collection is comprised mostly of Eastern artists.  Jim Brickman and Andreas Vollenweider are the wild cards.  However, there's very little of an Eastern influence.  Most of the tracks are elementary-sounding, major-key piano pieces.  As background music, this is OK, but there's not much to hold your attention.	-1
this album consists of a collection of relaxing tracks, and some are from exotic foreign land.  I have been playing these tracks instead of the christmas songs these days and they are much much more soothing than the "jolly" christmas songs.	1
exactly like it is advertised. Very relaxing music. The price was also very good. i would definitely recommend this music to anyone who needs or likes relaxing music.	1
It is a mix of music that i would hear when getting a massage without the babbling brook.  Not bad, but if relaxing is boring then this does the trick.	1
This is my go to album for night night. Listen to the samples and hear for yourself. Amazon has the most outrageously GREAT prices on their classical collections. It is more than worth the couple of dollars you'll spend!	1
I'd say this was perhaps the most beautiful choices rather than the most relaxing.  Although it is relaxing I found the choices to go beyond that.  It had variety so that it didn't bore me and a bit of soul stirring beauty.  I hadn't really listened to it until today (got it at Christmas when it was free).  Too often free doesn't really inspire me so I hadn't felt an urge to listen to it.  I'm sorry I waited so long.  It will be in my rotation often.	1
How can I ever tell you how much I love this kind of music.  I may not be an expert on who wrote the song but love the instruments blending the most relaxing sounds much greater than this crazy hectic world's noise.	1
I felt relaxed when I listend to these music. The price for the collection is very low too. Thus, I like this purchase.	1
I thought this movie was way to long but Anne Hathaway was the best part of it, her acting was beautiful, a very difficult thing to do when your singing I think but she has officially sung my favorite rendition of I Dreamed a Dream.	1
I'm glad that this is the same version that was in the movie.  It is really powerful and not "shined up" for the soundtrack.  I highly recommend this version.	1
I wasn't a fan of the movie as it had too much singing in it but the song is great.  Anne Hathaway really shows the true pain of this song so I was happy to find it.	1
Cuts down on road rage when driving and good pre sleep music helps to relax.  Just do not sleep and drive.	1
This is just what I was hoping it to be. It is a very relaxing collection of music for me to listen to while I am doing my homework or just sitting back with a glass of wine.	1
There are some music that I connect to for a good slow down on a fast past world, I listen to this everyday or every other day to try and take the stress of my mental draining day.	1
i love free music on amazon, it is the best and only place i ever by my mp3, Appple Itunes??? huh screw em	1
IT is a most wonderful, gut wrenching song, it stabs your heart and fills you with emotions, nicely sung, love it	1
Every time I hear this song, I picture her face in the movie.  Shaved head, tears streaming and still singing her pain.  Excellence!	1
Anne Hathaway can sing and her acting was sensational as well.  But, this song stands on its own by itself.	1
This instrumental is very relaxing.  I put it on right before I go to bed and it calms me down.  I would recommend this product to anyone that needs something to put your mind at ease.	1
My Wife and I enjoy setting in the family room in the evening and enjoying a cup of coffee while listening the our collection of songs.	1
Here's some beautiful music to own ~ how-ever ~ this is defiantly not A Collection Of The Most Relaxing Classical Music In The Universe  Some of these tracks are quite spirited and energetic. Often the music has a feeling of power & strength ~ then mellows to a beautiful softness. This is a wonderful group to select from to create a favorite's disc.	1
Almost two months since I saw the movie on Christmas day and Anne Hathaway's version of this song still breaks my heart. It leaves you breathless and speechless and amazed that anyone you did not truly love could make you feel that way. Other versions are technically correct and even beautiful, but this rendition of this song is unrivaled.	1
I don't know about the universe, aliens on Alpha Centauri might not agree and what do I know about their taste, Star Trek doesn't say. But this is one of the most relaxing albums I've bought in a long time. I do yoga and meditation, and it's great in the background for relaxing into a stretch. My mom thinks I'm finally getting some culture, ha ha.	1
This is an amazing deal with 30 tracks of music.  My wife and I like "Canon" because it reminds us of good times when we were dating. The claim of this album just might be true:  "A collection of the most relaxing classical music in the universe."	1
I recommend that they delete the files for this collection. The music is not relaxing; it is boring. You could hear this in the doctor's office waiting room or the elevator.	-1
It has been very hard to hear good songs become standards, without being overdone. For Anne Hathaway, she really never knew she had it in her. It has been a decade since she broke out as a actress with The Princess Diaries with Julie Andrews. But for her role in Les Miserables, she had to really deliver in music. For her rendition of I Dreamed A Dream, she had to make her own, without being too much, especially with all the times we've heard it in the past few years because of Susan Boyle and her breakout into the spotlight. Surprisingly for Anne, she feels a bit calm and subdued into the song, and lets the song speak well from the simplicity of the voice well. This is a treat for anyone whom has never heard Anne Hathaway sing before, and for anyone that loves Les Miserables.  Song: B 1/2+	1
This is great music for my meditation practice.  I've been listening to chakra music for over a year and this is a good switch.	1
Honestly, this just sounded like something I could try. I love new age and ambient music. To be honest, I fall asleep with in 10-15 minutes, and I've yet to hear much more of it.	1
there are bits and pieces of some beautiful music here.  But I find it annoying that the album presents only a few minutes (perhaps one movement of a symphony) and then moves on to something that is often quite different.	-1
Very good quality music from various artists and composers. Very happy to add this to my collection and listen anytime	1
For a nice set of easy to listen to music, try this collection of the "Most Relaxing music in the Universe." Well chosen, well played and really worth the price. Try it, you'll like it. I did.	1
I just finished downloading (from the cloud) and there's a problem.  Four of the tracks will not play on Windows Media Player or on Winamp (on a Windows XP system). The bad tracks are:  (disc 1) track 04  (disc 1) track 08  (disc 2) track 10  (disc 2) track 13 If I try to open them in Windows Media Player, nothing happens; the name doesn't even appear in the playlist. If I try to open them in Winamp, then (disc 1) track 01 (Canon) plays instead!  I believe that the problem is caused by the file name/path being too long.  Windows won't even let you rename them in the normal way.  UPDATE: I've found a workaround to the file problem, which is listed at the end of this review.*  ALSO:  Several of the tracks are NOT relaxing, IMHO.  For example, disc 1 track 9 (Violin Sonata) has several passages that become quite loud and full of angst...  not relaxing to me.  Disc 2 track 4 (Ballade No. 1) has several sections that are quite loud and heavy-handed, and a section near the end that is quite agitated.  Disc 2 track 10 (Sonata for Two Pianos) begins quietly, but has several passages that become quite loud and aggressive.  Disc 2 track 16 (Minuet in G) has a few sections that are downright bombastic, with the piano hammering out the bass line in octaves while the orchestra plays fortissimo.  Indeed, classical music is not necessarily intended to be soporific.  But the selection on this pair of MP3 "discs" seems to be quite erratic.  To point out just one glaring example:  where is Brahms' Lullabye?  Buy this as a general sampler, if you like.  But do NOT expect to be relaxed and lulled to sleep when it's finished.  * FILE REPAIR SOLUTION  As I suspected, the problem is the excessive length of the file name and "path" (the entire route that the computer takes to get to the files).  Windows allows a maximum of 255 characters for the path + name.  By default, when you download these, Amazon will put them in this path: C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Documents\Amazon\Various Artists\A Collection of the Most Relaxing Classical Music in the Universe\ That's 135 characters right there, which leaves 120 characters for the track name.  Now let's consider the name of one of the non-functional files: (disc 2) 10 - Sonata for Two Pianos in F minor, Op. 34b_ II. Andante, _un poco adagio_ - Sonata for Two Pianos in F minor, Op. 34b_ II. Andante, _un poco adagio_.mp3 That's 165 characters.  So the total is 135 + 165 = 300 characters, well over the 255-character limit.  Windows just can't handle that!  As a workaround, after you have downloaded all the files, navigate to the folder as listed above.  Temporarily rename the folder something very short, like "XYZ" (without the quotation marks).  That's 65 characters shorter than the original file name.  Now the totals are under 255 characters, so Windows will let you rename the individual files.  Go through and chop out all the duplicate information.  In the example given above, you'll cut out 72 characters, leaving a total of 93 characters.  Do this for all the tracks.  Finally, if you want, you can go back and rename the folder to something reasonable, like "Relaxing Classical Music" which will give you a total length of 94 characters.  If you add the new file name (from the example above) which is 93 characters, you'll see that you end up with a total of 187 characters, well UNDER the 255 character limit.  Of course one wonders:  Why didn't Amazon think about this, and use a reasonable album name, and file names WITHOUT duplication, in the first place.  MY CONCLUSION:  Given that at least four of the tracks are NOT relaxing, and you'll have to spend at least 15 minutes screwing around to fix the file naming errors, IMHO this collection just isn't worth the trouble, even if it's free to begin with.  Of course if you're really hard up for music that is MAYBE relaxing... go for it.  Personally, I think Amazon could and should do a better job.  I know I would, if I worked for them.	-1
Even if you don't like classical music, you will like this.  Very soft, played on low volume in the background.	1
the tracks in this album will get you hooked on classical music. sure not all classical music is good, but this album is extremely well selected.  all tracks are soothing and beat these "jolly" christmas songs by lightyears,  get this and you won't regret at all.	1
V  good	1
This stands out as the quintessential psychedelic rock hit from the Summer of Love. And then it gets mellow at the end. Awesome.	1
I love the sound of female singer in the song.  Very earthy and soulful.  I imagined her being much older than she was, so it was a surprise when I looked her up on youtube.	1
song is amazing! i could listen to it over and over.  The movie is awesome too so go and see it!	1
Pat is amazing and I like this extended edition.  He really puts a rock n roll side to the blues that I really like.	1
PT is on fire !  his guitar work is as good as it gets and vocals are true to form on this album  PT--- ROCKS !!!	1
On this album Pat Travers is doing covers of blues compositions from the 1920s and 1930s. Some of these songs are standards in the blues genre, others are less well known.  Travers does some interesting covers of some of these classic blues numbers but on many of them he misses the nuances and subtleties in the originals. Instead Travers treats many of these classic songs as straight out rockers. Pat Travers is good at straight up rockers; he's been doing that style of music successfully and well for decades. I like Pat Travers doing straight out rockers but, to my way of thinking, these old blues classics need a more subtle treatment than that.  As an example, the song "Nobody Knows You When You're Down And Out" was covered by Eric Clapton back in the 1970s and by Peter Green on his 2001 release, Blues Don't Change. Both Clapton and Green understand the nuances of this music. Listen to Eric Clapton's version, listen to Peter Green's version, and then listen to Pat Travers doing this song as a rocker; you'll immediately hear the difference between Clapton and Green versus Travers.  These classic blues tracks are great material and deserve the attention of modern listeners and the ongoing interpretation/re-interpretation of modern musicians. Pat Travers does some interesting things with these great old songs but I don't think he truly understands the blues in the way that people like Eric Clapton, Peter Green and others of their calibre do.  Overall, a decent album. If you like Pat Travers, you'll like this album. But having heard covers of many of these blues classics done by musicians with a deeper understanding of the original material, I give this album 3 1/2 to 4 stars.	1
This is my first Pat Travers album since 1984's "Hot Shot", i kind of lost track of Pat in the 90's and 2000's.  This album is 48 minutes of great 1920's blues, done with 2012 rockin' blues class by Mr. Pat Travers.  My top picks are:  "Black Dog Blues", "Meat Shakin' Woman", "Nobody Knows You When You're Down And Out", "You Can't Get That Stuff No More", the chill  of "Dark Night Blues", the steamin' "Rock Island Blues" and the classic "Death Letter".  Pat puts it all out there, great blues guitar album!	1
Great.	1
Excellent song	1
YES, YES, YES! From the moment the guitar licks start the pace for your heart to race, A Night to Remember does not let go and it never lets up! No matter if you are alone or with others, you can't help but get up and move to the groove! With the beautiful Jody Watley, Jeffrey Daniel, and the soulful Howard Hewett leading the charge, A Night to Remember would become another hit in a long list of unforgettable grooves that firmly established this version of Shalamar as the undeniable best grouping of members ever. Now that Jody Watley is the legal registered trademark owner of Shalamar, this will hopefully signal the return of these members coming together once again. So go ahead, Pay & Press Play. ~K.I.S.S.S.S~	1
I love Shalamar and had forgotten about their music until I was downloading something else and they popped up! Awesome!	1
Cool tune with a nice beat.  Wanted to use it for a sports power point, but after listening to the lyrics closely, I thought some parents might mistake the intent of the video combined with the lyrics of this song.  Didn't want to offend anyone, so I didn't use the song. I still like the song though.	1
Heard that song on the new faction Sirius satellite radio and decided to pick it up	1
Great Down-Load Quality	1
Great song only wish they released the version with Bruce Springsteen Both versions are great and worth a download .	1
I'm not sure if they take themselves a bit too seriously at times, or are quite tongue-in-cheek (sort of like the Shanes; the rough-edged German Shanes, that is), but overall not bad. "Rose Tattoo" is, of course, the highlight.	1
Awesome album, thanks	1
This is a badass album from start to finish. I'd highly recommend you check this album out to see for yourself. You will not be disappointed. Buy it, listen to it, and enjoy it.	1
When a band places a big mirror in the concert hall and looks at themselves too long you get an album like this.  The boys are back...oh those impish Murphy lads...look at those dimples.  Dumb way to start an album.  (Would Rancid or the Clash snicker and cater to their audience like this?) and the book ending song about never leaving the stage?  This isn't what I bought into with this band pretty much from the beginning.  And a Xmas song inserted into this?  Please.  Lets just hope they get over themselves and get back to what made them every bit as good as the Clash and Rancid- bands that transcended punk and rock with brilliant songs and passionate music.  This album has them headed in the direction of Wilco.	-1
Easy listening - Intelligent lyrics - no profanity - can't put your finger on the genre, one minute its rap, then folk, then electronica, then reggae, then emo - its amazing like Tyler Joseph has a force inside of him that needs to come out to share a message - his lyrics are very well written and thoughtful with no swearing  / Josh Dun is an amazing drummer like the drummer from No doubt or The Used (First album) without the drums the whole mood would fall apart - I can't stop listening to this and have become enamored	1
Good Stuff	1
I have to say I didn't know too many Twenty One Pilots songs when my brother made me go with him to their concert in July 2016.  I was so blown away with them at that show that I got a hold of every album of theirs that I could.  I can honestly say that there isn't a single song on any of their albums that I don't absolutely love.  After that first concert we looked up their remaining tour dates and bought tickets to back to back shows that we just went to last weekend.  They were even more amazing than I remembered if that is even possible.  I truly do love every single song but some of my favorites from this album include:  Migraine Ode To Sleep House Of Gold Car Radio Guns for Hands Trees Truce	1
GREAT ALBUM	1
These guys are putting some creativity into modern music, which it desperately needs.	1
Brilliant	1
love it!	1
Awesome album! Great band.	1
I didn't really know much about twenty one pilots before buying this album, but between the great reviews and sale I was convinced.  Very glad I went for it, it's a great album and I really enjoyed it!  No idea how to properly categorize it for those reading this review, but I might venture hip-hop or rap?  I'm not a big fan of either of those genres in general, but whatever they're doing, it's really good.  Look up some of the tracks on youtube if you're curious to hear a sample.	1
Excellent product and service.	1
A lil' something for everyone! Rap, hip-hop, electronic, techno & reggae! A masterpiece! Deserves a six star rating! Thanx!	1
exellent	1
One of my favorite albums of all time! I honestly wish I could just get my hands on a physical copy of Regional at Best!	1
I wish these guys were around when I was a kid...I definitely would have gone to see them in concert..cause their music is  phenomenal. Twenty One Pilots are the real deal.	1
good gift	1
I realize I am a dissenting voice, but I just didn't like this CD as a whole.  Now, please understand I do not like rap very much at all, so that is a tremendous reason this didn't work for me.  I think the lyrics are interesting and there are definitely a couple of songs that I liked, but the music was just too electronic and the rapping just too annoying.	-1
Great album	1
It wrecks grate and locks grate	1
Great songs.	1
Great album!	1
Great song.  If I didn't like it I wouldn't have purchased it...	1
You can't get a better sound with so many styles of music	1
Great CD!	1
Excellent!!!	1
some songs gave me chills. very good album i highly recommend it to people. just very very very very good	1
Not a 5, but close.  I heard this group on an alternative station and picked the CD.  I was pleasantly surprised that the music was pretty consistent across the board, although there were a couple of misses.  I will leave it up to the listener to determine which is their favorite, since we all have different tastes.  I didn't come across any, what I would consider "filler" songs, some just were not as strong as others.  But I do recommend this CD.	1
Music. If you like it, it's good. If not, not so much. To me, this is OK. Not much more to say.	1
Playing a curious mix of rap, folk and pop, Twenty One Pilots are a band that are impossible to pigeonhole. The opening track on "Vessel" bounces back and forth between the rap and the pop in a seamless fashion that is particularly tasty.  "Ode To Sleep" sets the tone for the album as it's as eclectic a single as you'll hear from a new band.  I was lured to "Vessel" by the single "House of Gold," which sounds more like The Lumineers or Passengers than what comprises the bulk of the CD. Normally that would tick me off, as I'm not a fan of rapping, and had I listened to the samples of the rest of the songs first, I'd probably have skipped the disc. Glad I got tricked, though. The vocoder heavy "Migraine" and the more downbeat "Car Radio" sink in enough to compensate for any shortcomings. Twenty One Pilots duo Tyler Joseph and Josh Dun know how to couch their way around the laptop rockers and the screamo-emo and make "Vessel" a fun listen. If it weren't for the fact that the lead vocals sometimes turn to screams (you're no Roger Daltry, guys), I'd like this a whole lot more.	1
The only thing better than this CD is seeing them live.  Great entertainers.  I couldn't believe the energy level.  The singer did back flips off the upright piano.	1
Twenty One Pilots has made one great album from start to finish. A must buy. Take a listen to the album.	1
Album: 4 stars: Live set: 5 stars  Twenty One Pilots, the Columbus, OH-based duo consisting of Tyler Joseph and Josh Dun, released this, their debut album, in early 2013. I had listened to it before and it didn't really resonate all that much with me. Then I saw these guys in concert recently (more on that later), and I simply had to give this another listen.  "Vessel" starts off with several can't miss tracks, each of which could be a radio single, if commercial radio were still any good, which of course it isn't. The surging "Odd to Sleep" sounds like it could be Ben Folds from 15 years ago. "Holding On To You" sounds musically like it came straight from Phoenix, but then Twenty One Pilots adds some rapping. "Migraine" is an all-out rap song, but one that actually is fun to listen to. "House of Gold" is a lighter tune, with some folksy influences. If there is a theme developing, it is that Twenty One Pilots is the curious mix of piano/keyboard-driven pop with a healthy doses of rap. I am not a fan of rap, generally speaking, reasons why I probably didn't give this album a fair chance when I first listened to it. Upon reflection, I am more impressed by the melodies, and the smart pop hooks that appear throughout. In all, I am very happy I gave this album another spin.  As to that live set, I saw these guys last weekend at the Bunbury music festival here in Cincinnati, where they played a late afternoon set on the main stage, and they KILLED. Starting their set with "Ode to Sleep" (and playing most of the tracks rom "Vessel"), the duo played a 60 min. set with a level of energy and excitement that I hadn't seen in a long time, and was simply infectious for the crowd, which ate it up. In turn Jospeh and Dun fed off of the huge response from the crowd, and it became one of those very special live sets where it feels something big is happening. As mentioned, I didn't care much for the album before this, but I was so impressed (and entertained) by their set that I just had to give it another shot. From looking at the comments on the festival's facebook wall, it seems that TONS of people thought this was the best set of the entire festival. If you have a chance to see these guys live, DO NOT MISS THEM!	1
I love those disco drums and beautiful chord changes. nice singing too. Kind of makes me want to divorce my wife and find another girl to make this song justified!! Just kidding !!!LOL	1
Great Song	1
THIS MUSIC IS NICE. I MEAN WHAT MORE CAN I SAY. EVERYTHING IS JUST THERE WHEN IT COMES TO QUALITY & VIBE.	1
I have been a Huge Fan of Atlantic Star since they first arrived on the scene.  Too bad they don't appear to be together anymore.  One of my favorite songs is Curious from the Planetary  Invasion album, now CD.  This song so Rocks and is a great dancing song too.  I love to dance and at one time in my life I wanted to be a dancer but there was no chance where I grew up.  I got my satisfaction from American Bandstand, Utah Bandstand, and any other dancing shows I could find.  I learned all of the latest dance moves and when I wanted to try some new dance routine, Curious was my song of choice.  This song has a very snappy beat and great tempo, now that I am 64 I still put it on often and use it to do my exercise.  I just love music and the groups from back in the day are what I like, there is no foul language and you can understand the words too boot.  Check this one out and then sample some of their music on Amazon's MP3 page you will find one of your favorites I am sure.  Keep Dancing!	1
BEEN TRYING TO REPLACE THIS ALBUM FOR YEARS, ESPECIALLY THIS CUT! THANK YOU!  YHIS WAS  ONE OF THEIR GREATEST HITS....IM NO LONGER CURIOUS BECAUSE I FOUND WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR ....THANK YOU!!!!	1
The remix with LSG, Busta Rhymes and LL Cool J does it a good job and capturing the essence of this song with a new age, hip hop twist. Definitely a good one.	1
I watched the TV show "The Goldbergs" and this song was playing throughout the episode and got stuck in my head.  I haven't listened to "Men Without Hats" for a while and this song was always my favorite, it has a catchy beat and is fun to sing along with.	1
Love it	1
Has a fun beat. I forgot about this song until I heard it in the grocery store.	1
All time favorite forever	1
Satisfied	1
The best dance song of all time. At least for me.	1
Classic new wave.	1
Another crazy song that was a hit.	1
Omg  I love this seeing the video was  amazing when MTV was actually new and amazing now its  nothing and they do not  even play  videos  anymore its  just blah.	1
I already have the follow up to this, 'Pop Goes The World' ripped from the compilation 80s rock CD but I never had that breakout song that started it all [or two, for that matter]. And right until last night I have been hunting for this. Now I've got it and it sounds just as good as ever! Thanks so much!	1
I like this song and I have not heard this song in decades and I finally have on the mp3 player and I can listen to this song and it still sounds good today.	1
This is one of my mothers favorite songs. Because she played it all the time it has become my favorite.	1
Very nice.	1
When Shalamar first came on the scene I saw them on American Bandstand and I loved their style, harmonies and music as well.  When this group broke up Jodi Whatley and Howard Hewitt put out singles but their vibe had really changed.  I liked some of Jodi's music but once I sampled some of the songs I chose not to buy any of her single CD's.  However Howard Hewitt still had the vibe I liked, his voice is strong and his music selections fit his intense falsetto was fantastic.  I brought his first CD and his Gospel CD as well.  I have not heard anything new from him in quite awhile and that is too bad.  I don't like to dwell on the past but the music of my generation was danceable, clean and fun.  You would not be ashamed to play this music in front of your elder family members or your Mom and Dad.  How many songs can you really let your Family listen to now days without have the words bleeped out or the song played with constant jumpiness because they have to make sure your little ones don't hear all the cussing and disrespect to women these artists use these days.  Get this CD and put it on while you are studying, cleaning your house or just relaxing and I bet you won't be disappointed.  Happy Listening to you.	1
I have loved this song since I was a teen. Still love it after all these years, had to have it for my mobile devices.	1
Great song from very talented group.  Love to hear their songs over the years.  They never get old, always timeless.	1
I LOVE HOWARD HEWETT....ANOTHER MAN THAT CAN WOO YOU WTHOUT TOUCHING YOU...SMOOTH GOLD.  HE LOOKS GOOD, SOUNDS GOOD ...THE MAN IS JUST GOOD!!!!!	1
I do recommend this item simply because it's an original.  I've always loved this song. It has always deserved a top rating. Even when the song has been remade by other artists.	1
Just as freaky as the first time I ever heard it in junior high.  Still love it!  Funnily enough, it's also a very good song to use for rhythm if you're trying to teach yourself to juggle.	1
Hey! go park some place else, this is a fast moving song great old school. love it.	1
Great!	1
Hot hot hot as my daughter said- " This is backyard family reunion, bbq music"  I love this group and I love this song!	1
One of the best of the 80's.  If you like the song, here is a convenient and portable version of it. That's all I have to say about that.	1
I have been a fan of Dido ever since "Thank You" back in 2000. Her last album "Safe Trip Home" was good but its songs did not have lasting impact as they all seemed to be slow placed and moody. No suprise, as Dido was dealing with the death of her beloved father and the break up of a long-term relationship...  Now Dido is in a much better place, happily married with a child and the songs on "the Girl Who Got Away" are some of the best she has ever written & created. I've been listening to the extended 2 disc version for over two weeks now (it was released in England earlier this month) and can honestly say its as good as her debut "No Angel."  Here you find radio and club friendly tracks like "Let Us Move On", ""Blackbird", "The End of Night", and "Let's Runaway" among others whose chorus will stick in your memory long after the tracks are over. There is something for everyone and I expect both old and new fans will support this new release.  "No Freedom" is a good track but a poor choice as a first single as many music critics cited this as an example of how Dido is playing it safe and how all her songs sound the same. It could have been released on any of her previous two cds. Fear not, as this is perhaps one of her 'weakest' tracks on the album and is not a good indicator of what lies ahead..	1
I always want to love whatever Dido does, for she has an amazing voice that's extremely unique and expressive.  For the most part, this album certainly isn't something that I dislike, but the safeness of it all definitely turns it into a mediocre listening experience.  While the vocals are pleasant--though nothing past that--the music that backs her up sounds like someone playing around on one of those Casio keyboards that I had a couple of decades ago, on which I'd hit a button and get a drum line, then hit another button and I'd get a bass line. . . .  This album is, quite simply, safe.  Not once do I hear anyone here, vocalist or musician, challenging themselves to do something unique.  By the fourth song, my interest was completely gone, and there was nothing after that that brought my interest back.  I know that if I want to listen to Dido, I'm going to put on "Life for Rent," because songs like "Happy New Year" (which is among the least-inspired songs musically that I've ever heard), "Love to Blame," and "Day before We Went to War"--and virtually the entire album--sound heartless and soulless without significant music behind them to flesh out her vocals.  In an interview, Dido said that there were never any moments when making the songs here was difficult.  I believe that completely because it's very obvious that there was almost no challenge here.  Safe, boring musical tracks backing safe vocal tracks doesn't add up to a work of art here--they add up to a collection of songs that will sell quite a few copies and make quite a bit of money for an established artist, but if this was the work of a new artist, Dido wouldn't be gaining a following with this uninspired fare.	-1
jenny will love it-like she never left-just beautiful	1
Thanks	1
It has been 5 years since Dido Armstrong put out her 3rd studio album Safe Trip Home(2008). During that term, Dido took a rest from the public eye and constant touring; she took advantage of this sabbatical to get married and become a mother. Yes, she has been away for a while trying to search for some good inspiration. Now, in 2013, Dido returns with this album produced with her brother Rollo Armstrong, Brian Eno and Dido herself that put her back on the spotlight. Girl Who Got Away is probably her most mature album ever, which reflects her new role as a housewife and mother. However, the album follows the same formula as on No Angel, Life for Rent and Safe Trip Home, which makes me think that musically speaking, Dido got stuck somewhere in between 1999 and 2008. Lyrically speaking, she has matured very much, inspired by her recent marriage and birth of her daughter. The major strengths on this CD: No Freedom, Girl Who Got Away, Let Us Move On, Blackbird, End of The Night , Love To Blame, Go Dreaming. The slightly weak tracks: Sitting In The Roof of The World, Happy New Year and Loveless Heart. The CD is a Limited Edition that includes 7 extra tracks with the Alternate version of Let Us Move On, All I See and Everything To Lose as highlights. Overall, it is a good CD with a few weak moments. Dido is slightly back and we all hope to listen from her very often. She needs to make a much improved album. So, this CD is a nice return to her songwriting and composing duties.	1
Favorite album	1
Somehow I missed the release of this album. I have all of her other CDs, and after sampling this one, had to have it, too. Simple pop tunes with great feeling behind them. What more can you ask for? " "Let's Run Away" and "Happy New Year" are just some of the best tracks. A must for your collection.	1
When it comes to ethereal adult alternative music, the two staples have been Sarah McLachlan and Dido.  The latest entry from these two is Dido's Girl Who Got Away.  Some albums I can size up quickly while others take me a while to process.  This one falls into the latter category.  Of Dido's four albums, Girl Who Got Away leans the heaviest toward R&B.  This is most evident on "Let Us Move On" where Kendrick Lamar makes a guest appearance.  However, "Blackbird", "End Of Night", and um, let's say track #7, also have similar qualities.  The R&B slant was not across the board, however.  Some tracks have a sparser feel to them such as "Sitting On Top Of The World", "Happy New Year", and "Day Before We Went To War".  While the style may have some different nuances, there is a common feel to the songs.  Some, such as "No Freedom", "Let Us Move On", "Blackbird", "Happy New Year", and "Loveless Hearts" deal with love gone wrong or lost.  For example, "No Freedom" has the line "By the look in your eyes I can tell/You Don't think I'll be back for more." while "Blackbird" has "Why do I bring you love/When all you give me back is pain?".The overall album leaves me with a sense of melancholy, and it is one that I listen to when I want to unwind or when I am going to sleep.  Girl Who Got Away is another great album from Dido, and I highly recommend it to old and new fans alike.  Download this:  No Freedom	1
Most of the songs on this disc are lovely.  Very melodic, not too loud, nothing to harsh my mellow.  That's what I enjoy about Dido's music.  So I'm driving along enjoying it in my car, when I am suddenly jolted out of my state of relaxation with a rap break in the middle of "Let us Move On".  This is not performed by Dido, but by Kendrick Lamar, a hip hop artist.  Talk about an unexpected turn.  It makes no musical sense in my opinion.  I find it so jarring and out of place that I immediately switch to the next song every time I get to that section.  I may even burn a copy of this cd and omit that track.  Too bad, cause I actually liked the rest of the song.  What was she thinking????	1
Not her best work, but still good.  Less collaboration with other artists would be preferred.	1
British singer Dido arrived on the scene in 1999 with her debut "No Angel". Her album was produced by her brother/labelmate at Arista Records- Rollo of the electronic band Faithless. Though the album was well received by critics, it took a while before the first couple of singles caught on. Fast forward over a year later, when she received exposure by way of Eminem- who sampled her song "Thank You" in his seven minute opus about an obsessed fan "Stan". From there Arista released "Thank You" as a single, which brought the public's attention to the singer. Fast forward three years later, she worked with her brother again on her second album "Life For Rent". While the recording was successful in her native homeland, it was a minor success in the United States. Most of that had to do with the corporate structure behind the scenes at her label. Five years had passed by the time she released her next album- the Jon Brion produced "Safe Trip Home". She laid low for five more years and released her fourth album on her new label RCA Records "Girl Who Got Away".  Her new album marks a return to her electronica roots. After a ten year separation, she is reunited with her producer Rollo. Sonically, "Girl Who Got Away" picks up where "No Angel" left off. On the opening track "No Freedom", she muses over a pending breakup. She desires to live life to the fullest and takes chances on the title track "Girl Who Got Away". For the second time in her career, she works with a rapper- this time around it's California rapper Kendrick Lamar on the song about hitting a rocky patch in a relationship "Let Us Move On". On the song "Blackbird", she rides a rhythm that's probably the most uptempo song she's recorded. She deals with a nasty breakup on "End Of Night" and desires a place of solitude on the acoustic ballad "Sitting on The Roof Of The World". She expresses her thoughts on her feelings on "Go Dreaming" and closes the album with the ballad "Day Before We Went To War". While "Girl Who Got Away" is a welcomed return for Dido, one would get the feeling that she's playing it safe this time around. Despite the production being noticeably subdued, it's still a strong album from the underrated singer.	1
One reviewer noted that Dido does not drastically change or experiment much with her sound, but that each of her albums is a measured change in subtle increments. She tinkers and toys with her sound like renovating a room in a house. Each of her albums is slightly different from one another. So, "Girl Who Got Away" is not much of a musical, or even lyrical, departure for Dido, but what she does do within her house of music, she does well. While 2008's "Safe Trip Home" was a study in somberness with sparse musical arrangements driven by the loss of her father, "Girl Who Got Away" is more uptempo, electronic, and perhaps lyrically back to 2008's "Life For Rent".  The 11 tracks go down easily, but like all of her albums, "Girl Who Got Away" just misses being a classic album. "No Freedom", "Girl Who Got Away", "Let Us Move On", "Blackbird", "End Of Night" and "Sitting On The Roof Of The World" pack a solid first side punch. Things get a little uneven (as they often do for all Dido albums) toward the back half. I could argue that "Love To Blame", "Go Dreaming" and "Loveless Hearts" are the three weakest tracks here--and they are not poor songs, just potential album filler. "Happy New Year" and a possible 9/11 nod, "Day Before We Went To War" are the most interesting tracks on the back half.  There are six bonus tracks on the deluxe version. The alternate version of "Let Us Move On" is not as good, in my opinion, as the original album version. "All I See" is decent. The best bonus tracks are "Just Say Yes" and "Let's Runaway". The Armin Van Buuren remix of the "Sex & The City 2" soundtrack song "Everything To Lose" is passable, and finally, "Lost" is just okay.  As I listened to "Girl Who Got Away" multiple times this week, I felt it was a good, solid, sturdy album from Dido. I like it as much as "Life For Rent". Each album from Dido is pretty good, and I like her as an artist--she is still unique in her own way when held up against such contemporaries as Enya, Sarah McLachlan, Loreena McKennitt, Paula Cole, Annie Lennox, Goldfrapp, Enigma, Mike Oldfield, Sarah Brightman, Jane Siberry, Joni Mitchell, Fiona Apple, Tori Amos, Regina Spektor, Feist, Alanis Morissette, Jewel, Imogen Heap, etc. Dido has her own vocal style with her own musical style courtesy of contributions by her brother, Rollo (of Faithless).  So, four stars for "Girl Who Got Away". I suspect it will end up on my end of year best list. Here's how it compares to Dido's other albums:  1999 No Angel: Three Stars 2003 Life For Rent: Four Stars 2008 Safe Trip Home: Three and a Half Stars 2013 Girl Who Got Away: Four Stars	1
British pop singer Dido returns after a five-year hiatus with her fourth studio album,&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Girl-Who-Got-Away/dp/B00BWGL6BS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Girl Who Got Away</a>, released via RCA.  Girl Who Got Away follows up 2008s underperforming&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Safe-Trip-Home/dp/B001EO2UKO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Safe Trip Home</a>, which was deemed favorable by many critics. Girl Who Got Away is a solid album for the most part, though not one that will likely one that will revitalize her previous commercial success or buy her new legions of fans.  "Let Us Move On" smartly brings in burgeoning rap darling Kendrick Lamar, but the chances of large exposure of the track seems unlikely.  "No Freedom" seems concerned with the ambience, with Dido's vocals laden with reverb.  She sounds incredibly relaxed, which complements the folk-pop quality within the cut.  "No Freedom" is by no means an intense cut in itself, but the vocal arrangement and addition of instruments on the chorus add more body and intensity to the cut itself. "Girl Who Got Away" follows consistently, opening with cool, pulsating synths.  Dido's vocals are smooth (particularly her upper register), lacking the echoing reverb of the opener.  Simply on the chorus, Dido sings "If only for today / I wanna be / the girl who got away / the lover who really loved / the dancer who danced / to the last song..." The main rub with the title cut? Perhaps Dido comes off too relaxed and slightly lacking in personality.  "Let Us Move On" finds Dido continuing in her casual, mysterious vocal approach, complemented by production to match the sentiment (Jeff Bhasker is onboard here).  Like the previous two cuts, this one is pleasant and Dido keeps things simple, particularly vocally on the chorus ("Let us move on...for this is short / and it will pass").  Kendrick Lamar drops a verse that matches the sentiment of both Dido and the cut itself.  It isn't the year's greatest triumph per say - it feels like it is missing something - but it is an enjoyable cut if not necessarily exceptional.  On "Blackbird", Dido continues to indulge into her refined vocals, if perhaps a bit much.  Listeners do get a clever lyric, intact with a staccato vocal execution: "He put the coffee in the cup and with milk he filled it up / he added sugar and I never knew he liked it like that..."  The production has some nice cues, though remains subdued. Songwriter/producer Greg Kurstin assists on "End of The Night", which takes a cool electro-pop approach, intact with driving synth and programming.  Dido's best moment is during the bridge in which she exploits her upper register ("After the fall comes loves / I hat to hate and love to love"). The results? Pretty good.  "Sitting On The Roof Of The World" is one of Girl Who Got Away's strongest showings. Dido sounds beautiful, commanding, and never over-sings and the production matches her reservedness.  Backing vocals accentuate the lead during the second and successive iterations of the chorus.  The chorus itself is simple, but there is a beautiful innocence in its penning: "There I was / sitting on the roof of the world  / there I was, there I was / Not knowing how I go there or how to leave..." "Love To Blame" contrasts the simplicity of "Sitting On The Roof" with an interesting groove with a reggae undertone coupled with a pop/electro beat.  Dido's upper register continues to shine, particularly given her breathy vocal approach. Lyrically, she hits a high mark with lyrics "She said I've dotted my I's and I've crossed my T's / had time for friends when they needed me..." "Go Dreaming" makes one nod their head, given the percussive, driving beat with Europop flavor.  On "Happy New Year", Dido agains floats too casually, a detraction throughout Girl Who Got Away.  "Loveless Hearts" is more commanding than the latter, with Dido's vocals always commanding without necessarily being 'fiery' or forced.  Closing cut "Day Before We Went To War" is appropriately placed, but isn't quite as enjoyable as the beginning trio or the easygoing juggernaut "Sitting On The Roof Of The World".  Does Dido miss the mark? Nope, she sounds solid and for the most part&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Girl-Who-Got-Away/dp/B00BWGL6BS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Girl Who Got Away</a>&nbsp;has more solid moments than ill advised ones. The main problem for Dido is that sometimes the productions are too cool and the vibe too restrained and unflustered. Usually, being 'flustered' might be a detraction, but a shakeup wouldn't kill Dido.  Not known as a vocalist for histrionics (nor is that expected of her), Girl Who Got Away could have been even better and made a bigger splash with some more risks.  But examining this set for what it is, it is solid.	1
i was not sure after the last cd.  But after hearing the first 6 songs, i bought it, i was hooked. its dido at her best, sounding fresh, every song is great. If your a dido fan from her first cd, than youll love this one. It make me happy. put a smile on my face, If you want something different from all the music that sounds the same, give this girl who almost got away a chance. it a great cd. thanks dido.	1
I'd better at once make it clear that "No Angel" and "Life for Rent" still are my favorite Dido albums. Both albums contain such a rare large number of great songs and I always gladly return to these her first two albums.  You had to wait for five years on Dido's third album "Safe Trip Home" from 2008. Personal events in Didos life were reflected on this album, which had a distinctly sad tone and which was significantly less commercial.  "Safe Trip Home" contained fewer "big" songs than the first two albums, but it has a warm and honest feel that compensates the less distinctive songwriting. Songs like "Look No Further", "Quiet Times" and "Northern Skies" are individually very strong songs, which also helps to lift this album.  Now five years have passed again, and Dido has just released her fourth album. One can hardly say that her music has taken a revolutionary turn, but there is generally a far more easy mood on the album, which is also to a greater extent than previously is spiced with electronic elements.  I do, however, feel, like iI did with "Safe Trip Home", that some songs sound a little too similar, especially if you choose deleuxe version, which contains six extra tracks.  "No Freedom" is a great pop song which has a sound close to the "Life For Rent" album.  The quiet and almost acoustic "Sitting on the Roof of the World", is for me another the album's great songs.  Some songs take longer to embrace. Among the songs that have grown on me are "Loveless Hearts" and "End of Night".  On the bonus disc, which generally keeps the level of CD 1 songs like "All I See" and "Lost" are my preliminary favorites.	1
A party song I can listen to morning, noon, and night! I absolutely love the vocals on this song. Great.	1
What can you say here, Deep Purple after 8 years release a top flight recording again!  Band members Ian Gillan  (67) vocals, sounds as good as ever, Don Airey (64) keyboards, organ, sounds crisp and fresh, Roger Glover (67) bass, keeps slapping those strings, Ian Paice (64), drums, sounding as good as ever and Steve Morse (58) the young pup, keeps playing those great riffs.  This album was produced by Alice Cooper famed producer Bob Ezrin.  Deep Purple has been going for over 45 years and continue their magic carpet ride.  Tunes i really enjoyed here were, "Hell To Pay", a classic, great sound, the magical "All The Time In The World", the uncanny "Vincent Price",  "A Simple Song" and "Blood From A Stone".  Go Out and get this Deep Purple fans you won't be disappointed!  After several weeks this is a solid five star release.	1
The vincent Price song was a nice tribute to the legend but the rest of the album is boring and stale.  Guys please call Blackmore before it's to late, ever since he left, Deep Purple are a shade of their former selves.  Every album they release without BlackMore now shows how much they need him and that Purple = Blackmore.	-1
graet	1
While it would be untrue to say that "NOW What!?!" is my favorite Deep Purple album, I still enjoyed it and found the musicianship to be outstanding, particularly from Steve Morse who plays off Don Airey's keyboards brilliantly, and is one of the most expressive guitarists I have ever heard across numerous musical styles. Of course Roger Glover's bass and Ian Paice's drums provide a powerhouse backbone for the band, and while Ian Gillian doesn't have the ability to reach the highest highs that he did decades ago he's still amazingly versatile. The writing here is very good overall with a couple of standouts (I'm partial to "Aprs Vous" and "All the Time in the World"), and the collection as a whole works cohesively in several different genres. I was appreciative of the homage paid to the late, great Purple keyboardist Jon Lord who died a year before this was released, particularly "Uncommon Man". This is enjoyable listening and while faithful to their roots, the progressive hand of producer Bob Ezrin (famous for producing Pink Floyd's epic "The Wall") sometimes manifests itself in subtle ways. If you are a Deep Purple fan you should like this; if you're new to the group this might not be the best album to introduce you (try "Machine Head" or "Burn" instead).	1
I've tried to like it. WHen I heard it was Bob Ezrin producing, I went for it.  But... no. Nothing here. I understand the fact that these guys are old, that their best work is behind them, but I expected some spark of geniatlity. There is none here. There are a lot of sparks of great musicianship, because they are all, of course, top notch musicians.  The songs are lifeless, no groove, no form, all of them instantly forgotten after you finish listening to the whole damned album. Morse's guitar is the worst: no tone, no strong riffs, run of the mills solos, of of his worst registers ever.  Heck, it is impossible to even remotely comapre this one with the great PURPENDICULAR.	-1
In 2013, British proto prog legends Deep Purple returned with a new album that also meant to be a return to their 1970`s sound. Now What? Is far from that, but still has some 1970`s flavor that makes this album a listening delight. The best part of this album is the excellent guitar solos by Steve Morse and the outstanding keyboard hooks by Dan Airey that almost equal the ones done by the deceased and long-time keyboardist Jon Lord. However, Ian Paice, Roger Glover and Ian Gillian shine on this album on drums, bass guitar and vocals. The opener A Simple Song has an incredible intro with Roger Glover on bass guitar, Ian Gillian on vocals and Steve Morse on guitar. Then, the song turns upbeat after the the intro, which is almost shocking. Weirdistan is a great follow-up to A Simple Song; Out of Hand has a Kashmir-like intro and melodies; Hell for Pay has a good uptempo vibe, as well as Bodyline, which sounds pretty similar to Def Leppard. Above and Beyond is, in my humble opinion, the jewel of the crown on this album. It is much softer and melodic than the previous two tracks; what makes this song even better is the Ian Gillian`s vocals with the excellent guitar work by Steve Morse and the keyboard work by Dan Airey that makes this song a remembrance of the late 1960`s-1970`s sound. Blood from A Stone follows up with a melodic sound. Again, Dan Airey excels in his keyboard work, particularly in the use of the Hammond Organ, which was heavily used by Jon Lord for decades, especially in the 1970`s. Uncommon Man has a wonderful keyboard progression at the very beginning; another track that has not to be missed out is Aprs Vous, which is quite similar in vibe to that of Hell For Pay. All The Time In The World can easily be the album`s 2nd best track and there is one good reason for this statement: the song`s middle section is as evocative as in Above and Beyond. Vincent Price and It`ll be Mine close this incredible album in great form. Overall, Now What? finds Deep Purple in a great shape, musically, lyrically and vocally speaking. It is a great way to pay a well deserved tribute to Jon Lord,  dead in July 2012, who was the band`s heart and soul, along with his former mate Ritchie Blackmore. Grab this one, if you are long time fan of the Purples.	1
I liked Deep Purple back in the day, but had reservations about the new album because it had been so long. Wow my worries were for not. This is a very good album of songs. There is variety, well produced and most of all great musicianship. The band really brings it. I highly recommend this CD.	1
Talk about a band that peaked early on in their career and has ever since then always strided to but have never been quite capable of reaching that same level of excellence, Englands Deep Purple are undoubtedly best known for their sixth studio album, 1972s Machine Head (which was home to epic singles ilke Highway Star, Smoke On The Water, and Space Truckin). But they have stuck in there, continuously grinding it out year after year, releasing one solid album after another every few years. And for that alone -- well, that, and the fact that they are one of the most influential things ever to happen to the hard rock genre -- they should be respected.  But Deep Purple are also still very much on todays radar because they are still excellent musicians. Yes, their sound has gotten a little dated and unsurprising over the years, but they are still highly capable of writing a great song that is filled with memorable guitar chops, steady bass, prominent, flowing keyboard lines, and infectious vocals. The bands nineteenth full-length, 2013s Now What?!, is, of course, no exception to this rule.  Cuts like the appropriately named opener, A Simple Song, practically scream vintage Deep Purple, as they find a lovely acoustic intro flowing into heavy territory with big riffs underneath Ozzy Osbourne-esque vocals before once again settling down into a melodic and docile outro. Weirdestan is an equally as hard-rocking follow-up number, this one with an assortment of simple, brutal (and ultra chunky and crunchy) power chords and piercing solos; as is Out Of Hand, which begins with an atmospheric (and nearly symphonic-sounding) intro followed by an explosion of big, downtuned guitar crunch and raucous grooves. And this all comes to its head when the number uncorks some jazzy, partially shredding and partially wailing guitar soloing.  Nothing really stands out about some of the songs, namely BodyLine. But whatever points the album loses by occasionally bogging down in those bland moments, it more than makes up for by surrounding it in Hell To Pay, a groovy, honky-tonk-tinged rawker with more excellent guitar solo flights, some catchy, big, anthemic, and shout-worthy choruses, and even some keyboard/synth/organ-sounding solos, and Above And Beyond, which opens on a purely metallic note, with a crashing drum and downtuned bass intro.  The album then explores its more melodic and sensitive side, dipping into power ballad territory, but does so without ever losing any of its central momentum or energy. The dreary and dreamy Blood From A Stone is primarily occupied by bluesy guitar lines and warmly clean crooning, although it is further highlighted by some jazzy piano breaks, too -- breaks that sound like they would be right at home on the last Jerry Lee Lewis record (!). And following this up comes An Uncommon Man, a terrifically ominous, foreboding, and ambient mood-enhancing piece that features soaring melodic leads, towering harmonic solos, and classical music-inspired keyboard runs (which come courtesy of synth-ace Don Airey). And it is all anchored by a crashing, cymbal-heavy drum beat.  Apres Vous is an again up-tempo and lively metal song, this one with prominent, beeping bass lines, Black Sabbath-y riffage, and some more excellently ripping solos. Then, following the mildly dark and very brooding balladry of All The Time In The World, comes an again hard, muscularly-riffed, and this time even somewhat doomy-sounding heavy rocker in Vincent Price to close out the album.  So, there you have it. Deep Purple are still extremely relevant, inspired, heavy, and all-around exceptional. Predictable? Maybe. But you would not have it any other way!	1
They still have it.  This is quite good and holds true to their "sound" that I was looking for.  Glad they are still making music.  It will definitely stay in rotation in my collection.	1
great musicians with steve morse, roger glover, etc. but not as hard hitting as i thought it would be. great in person, if you like the hard hitting music and tremendous guitar work of morse. he can play anything and everything.	1
This is by far the best rock album that I have heard in a real long time. This album sounds authentic and has a true rock & roll spirit to it. Rock is alive! Thank you Deep Purple!	1
Great Album from my fav. band of all time. Lets hope those smucks in Cleveland wake up in put DP in the hall. Long overdue !!!	1
DP has been revitalized again with this bold, satisfying outing. The songs are sinewy, smart compositions that benefit enormously from Bob Ezrin's (Kiss, Pink Floyd. Alice Cooper, Kansas ) production. Finally, Steve Morse can throw off all comparisons to Ritchie Blackmore, now gone for 20 years. He owns his role in the band with gusto, But the real star here is keyboardist Don Airey. Airey's clever arrangements show his confidence and flair. While Ian Gillan doesn't have the durability in his upper range that he used to, the vocalist hardly needs it here. His tone is still strong at age 67, and his ability to compete with Airey and Morse remains undiminished. If you like Deep Purple, I can't imagine you not really enjoying "Now What ?!"	1
Now What?! is the nineteenth full-length studio album by the legendary British Rock band Deep Purple, it was their third studio album with Don Airy on Keyboards and their fifth with Steve Morse on guitar. It was produced by Bob Ezrin and released in 2013.  On very first listen, a lot of the album washed over me, leaving a generally positive, but honestly not too impressed or interested impression. With repeat listens however, it revealed itself to be not only a passable, or even above average affair, but a genuinely good one, with literally no weak tracks. It's a grower for sure.  Usually, I really enjoy any Deep Purple album, and have enjoyed most Morse era albums to some extent, however sometimes they can feel like there is a bit of filler, or there's a minor lack of consistency, stopping the albums feeling as great as the old days even when over half the album has some genuinely great songs. Now What?! is the perfect Morse era album, it all fits perfectly together, there's variety yet consistency and all the songs are as good as the very best tracks on another Morse era album.  Highlights include the symphonic `Uncommon Man' dedicated to the late Jon Lord, which feels like a mixture between Close To The Edge era Yes with Works era ELP, the energetic and memorable `Apres Vous' which has a very catchy chorus, and the interesting and characterful single `Vincent Price' although to be honest its all great.  The only real negative thing I can think to say is that the track order may undersell the album's both power and variety. I listen to this record a lot but I often choose to listen to the record on random/shuffle now, and always find it a great and exciting album all the more for having done so, but that's just personal preference, most people have no problems with that running order. Seriously, it's a great album; the rhythm section are tight and steady, Airy and Morse make a real impact and Ian Gillan fits into his older vocal style more comfortably here than ever.  Overall; Now What?! is a very good album from the veteran Rock band, easily in the top fifty percent of their catalogue. It's a well produced and well written collection of interesting songs, with a great sense of subtly, musicianship and even a few surprises. Check it out if you like Deep Purple, and especially if you've liked their modern output. And if you do check it out, don't just listen to it once, give it a good few spins and really let it sink in, you'll thank yourself for it after a while.	1
Calendar days keep flying past. Deep Purple carries the Hard Rock flag high. Amazing that they continue to create spectacular tunes while others from their era have run dry.	1
I was a real fan of purple but the las few discs are quite the same style. The same kind of stuff. This one is no exception. It has beautiful passages, specially the keyboardist shines, but but IMHO they offer nothing new, at least for me.	-1
It seems Deep Purple is back and in full form again. This is one the best Deep Purple albums released in decades and the best of the albums with Steve Morse in the band. them. Heavy Keyboards, Blistering guitar work, Thundering bass and drums and Ian Gillian at the helm on vocals. The chemistry of the current lineup really shines on Now What. Steve Morse is in top form and his guitar work is amazing. Don Airey has really stepped up the plate too on this release. Thunderous keyboards dominate the album just like you  would expect from a Deep Purple album. This latest release was produced by legendary Bob Ezrin ( Pink Floyd, Kiss, Alice Cooper and many others) and it really shows in the final production on this one. If you love Deep Purple and want to hear something new I would highly suggest you add copy of Now What to your collection! I think once you hear it you will be glad you did.	1
So far this is easily my album of the year. Its only June but I seriously doubt anything will pass for a better record the rest of the year, but who knows at this point. Steve morse guitar work is great. Of course the rhythm section is rock solid like all DP records. What really stands out to me is Don Aireys keyboards.....outstanding! It's also nice to hear Ian Guillan has not lost his voice at his age. Easily 5 stars!	1
Deep Purple return after a very long absence of new music with their amazing new album called Now What?! which shows why they are considered to be one of the best rock bands of all time regardless of the lineup. Produced by Bob Ezrin from Pink Floyd and Alice Cooper fame, Now What?! is an example of a band firing on all cylinders and working together creatively to produce excellent new music that respects the past while forging a fresh future. The current lineup features Ian Gillan on vocals, Roger Glover on bass, Ian Paice on drums, Steve Morse on guitar, and Don Airey on keyboards and they all perform superbly on this album to create some really exciting songs and musical passages. Highlights include the rocking opener "Simple Song", the progressive sounds of "Weirdestan", the signature rock vibe of "Out Of Hand" featuring some great keyboard sounds, the great groove and guitar playing of "Bodyline", the sweet build up and intense crescendo of "Uncommon Man", and the very smooth sound of "All The Time In The World". Besides being an amazing album of all new material that cements their relevance, Now What?! is appropriately dedicated to Deep Purple's late keyboard player and founding member Jon Lord whose influence on music continues to this day. Now What?! is highly recommended to all Deep Purple fans and anyone who likes good quality hard rock with a progressive twist - a very solid 4.5 stars.	1
I have been a fan of Deep Purple since 1970 thanks to some great older brothers that turned me onto them. I own all their studio albums and a bunch of their live stuff. My favorite album is Burn. I didn't think they'd ever top their Steve Morse debut Purpendicular. But with this album they have. I have to agree with the critics and say this is their best album since Perfect Strangers. And I've always wanted Bob Ezrin to produce these guys & I can say I was not dissapointed at all.	1
This is a great album, there is not one thing wrong, I'm a lifelong DP fan & this rates as good or better than anything they have ever done. The music is tight, the vocals are good & Steve Morse is just an awesome guitar player. Buy it.	1
Got to admit I really like the Morse era of these guys a lot better than the earlier stuff. The two distinct styles compliment each other quite well. Steve's guitar playing is real good here. And the band still has chops. It's fresh and new enough to be interesting but still enough old school sound to recognize. A really well engineered / sounding CD too. Way to go!	1
Nobody thought Deep Purple would be giving us anything but hits packages by now, but out of nowhere they come out with a great new CD. Not just good, but GREAT. While there is no Smoke on the Water here, this whole CD is Deep Purple goodness, including majestic organ riffs (even though Jon Lord is no longer with  us), memorable hooks, guitar riffs, and serviceable vocals.  Two of the 11 songs are over 6:00 in length, four are over 5:00, the rest over 4:00; there are no attempts at hit singles, which is great since no one wants to hear a "single wannabe" from Deep Purple. They do what they've always done, rock out. I've always felt Deep Purple was underrated, they never seem to get the same level of respect as Black Sabbath for example, and they're every bit as good and influential.  While I admit that I bought this on a whim, ready to laugh it right off my iPod, the joke's on me. This CD is on repeat play, the truest test of a good album.	1
The choice of getting Bob Ezrin to produce the new Deep Purple album was a real masterstroke. To those people who can't be bothered with a "modern" Deep Purple album, should simply take a chance and listen to this album a few times. It's as memorable as Deep Purple have ever been. There's no point in comparing this new album to their past classics. Those albums are timeless, but that does not detract from the overall excellence of "NOW What?!" An album which doesn't patronize the listener or show the band resting on their laurels. This is an exciting and heavy rock album that's relevant and fresh, without rehashing any elements from their past anthems. It's a work Deep Purple should be justifiably proud. Money well spent.	1
I love DP, love all versions that their ever were of the band.  Loved Slaves and Masters, House of the Blue Light and Purpendicular.  I thought Steve Morse brought a fresh kick in the butt to this band with Purpendicular.  Abandon had a harder edge to it, and would unfortunately be Jon Lord's last full effort with the boys. Then Bananas and Rapture were both great, but I couldn't help feel they were just by the numbers albums, were nothing was truly memorable but they weren't bad albums.  Now What ?! finds the boys with a fresh energy that you can hear on Purpendicular, but whereas Steve Morse ran the gauntlet on that album, this time Don Airey finds his footing in the band.  Don Airey's keyboard presence on this album, is well, un traditional of any Deep Purple line up or album since maybe Mark II's In Rock.  And while that is definitely not a bad thing, it does sound a bit overdone in this day and age, almost going over the top to show how much Jon Lord is missed to not only the boys in the band, but to rockers and rollers all around the world.  It's beautiful to hear, it's just too bad we are hearing this keyboard prominence after the passing of Jon Lord.  Not to dwindle off on that path, the wit and humor of Ian Gillan's vocals and lyrics are still present, Roger and Paicy still anchor that DP sound, and Steve Morse, I feel, this is his most reserved outing with Purple.  He's channeling the classic sound on this album more than any other album he's been featured on.  A great album nonetheless, it's a stretch to call this their best since 84's Perfect Strangers, or '96's Purpendicular,  but it's definitely more interesting and memorable than Bananas and Rapture.  If your a fan it's yet another evolution in the sound of the Purple machine, pick it up!	1
they have not sounded like this in years thank you BOB EZRIN-THE DEEP PURPLE SOUND IS BACK- JON LORD WOULD APROVE	1
I like this New DEEP PURPLE Album . Some of the songs have a more rock vibe , than previous bluesy albums. Ian sounds great on vocals. Steve Morse is playing awesome . One of the better DEEP PURPLE Albums in the past 20 years .	1
Great song	1
Hallelujah, the greatest praise.	1
Good Product at a fair price	1
Love this song!!	1
Great sond	1
Love the song.	1
Love it! Love it! Love it! Love it! Love it! Love it!	1
This is such a great song! It is God's truth in the form of a song, so comforting. I could listen to it all day.	1
Good to listen to. Like the words. Not objectionable at all. Very happy with this purchase. Would recommend it to anyone who loves the Lord.	1
This song has been a great pick me up song. I love it as I drive to work each day and my 3 children sing it to me daily. Highly recommended.	1
The song is beautiful and thought provoking and her voice is even more beautiful.  The rhythm, and toward the end the electric guitar, make the recording extremely beautiful.	1
I love this song the quiality is great,adn I enjoy putting it on my own personailized cd. I would recomend this way of purchasing	1
Great song by Amy Grant.  Great beat, powerful words, beautiful melody.  This song is somewhat laid back but yet very inspiring at the same time.  Kudos to Amy.	1
Amy has told the truth in this song . Some times it takes something bad to get us to be trurhful in prayer to god	1
I have to admitt, this is the number 3 song on my Kindle Fire. I am sooo pleased with it. It is well worth the money.	1
This is a good recording of this song. This song talks about how we can be honest with God & He loves us just the same  : )	1
Sho Baraka is known for making his listeners think, and he takes everything a step farther by directly challenging the faith in a way that even the artists from Reach Records won't do. Thats big. Talented Tenth is a reference to the essay W.E.B. Dubois wrote during his rivalry with Booker T. Washington over issues regarding the education of African-Americans. Dubois argued that there were unfound talents among the black race, and they should be harvested upon to show America how the black race can be educated to great extent. Therefore, we have a concept album on our hands, and those are the most exciting ones to review, if not the most tricky. Sho uses some objectionable language in the album, and I'll be the first to admit that despite my faith, I catch myself spilling some curse words too. Therefore, I was not offended, just surprised. And it definitely accomplished its goal of making me think, albeit not quite the way he likely intended.  Sho's lyrics are thoughtful, and he is possibly the deepest rapper in CCR besides Lecrae. However, my beef with the album is the quality of the music, not the message. Sho is pretty limited in his flow, and his rapping mixed with some great beats only results in a solid album, at best. Peter Pan is a good track, and the controversial song, Jim Crow, is a real thought-provoker. I personally didn't like it.  The song was well-produced, and there were some phenomenal lines on it, but while Sho succeeds in elaborating on the present day racism he has seen, the song fails in a bigger way. By talking solely about racism with African-Americans, he alienates other races, some of which have to deal with worse racism at this point in time. Many of them are not in the States. The song also comes off as whiney, and it reminds me of a lot of people in my high school. Black racism is scowled upon, yet both black people, and whte people seem to think it more acceptable to pile onto the Mexicans, or Asians. I kind of wish Baraka could have used his great talents to make a bolder track about racism in general, calling out all sorts of people. Something like Bizzle would do. Instead, he drops somewhat cliche lines about Hollywood using the black people to get white people rich, and stuff like that. Overall, the song is pretty good, but in so many ways, I hated it.  Unfortunately, I found myself skipping songs because no matter how hard-hitting the message, I sometimes (maybe even a lot) got bored, and occasionally even kind of angry.	-1
I'll admit I didn't really jump on board when this album was released last year.  It's definitely a contender for Rapzilla.com's Album of the Year for 2013.  After my first listen I was amazed. He didn't copy the similar formula that many hip-hop artists have used since his emergence.  Talented Xth brings a unique articulation of content which is severely needed in the genre.  He doesn't pull any punches or mince his words, as described in the song Jim Crow.  Sho definitely brought his A-game his flow and wordplay is first rate.  I'm glad he didn't use auto-tune and 808 heavy tracks.  Stated plainly songs like Jim Crow sadly won't make the Top 5, or BET countdown but should.  It's content isn't as deplorable as some have suggested.  Personally, I would equate it, with watching the Roots saga.  You are going to have your feathers ruffled but, for good reason.  Addressing racism, and hypocrisy even in the industry circle with which he had close ties with  without name dropping is a tall order.  But, Sho pulls its off. I believe that once you listen with the intention of gaining insight and not dismissing it as a "diss record"  you will be pleasantly surprised.  I like how this album flows like a story book as opposed to a regular full length album with intros and outros.  Tracks like Michael, Exodus, Denzel,  Get Happy interlude, Me!, King,  Cliff and Claire display Sho and his featured guests creative flow and spiritual maturation. Ali is the motivational single that really lifts your spirit.  Hopefully, High Society and Hello Revolution will release another dope album.  Because the Lord has given Sho Baraka a gift that needs to be shared with the rest of the world.  I'm glad that he has taken the road less traveled even if it does get him ostracized.  Listen and listen well, go and be doers of the Word and not just hearers only.  Talented 10th gets the job accomplished.  Keep fighting and moving forward Sho!	1
Almost a year ago this album impressed me and still have it on repeat. I think Sho has progressed and along with High Society I look to more of his work in the near future.	1
This album was very creative and different and set itself apart from all artists in general. He did a great job with the lyrics being scripture based and the inspiration of each song was felt. I really really love this album	1
I listened to this on a loud C-130 and forgot I was in the Middle East for an entire hour.	1
The folks over at The Bach Guild division of eOne Music have outdone themselves this time to celebrate Beethoven's birthday in 2012. (Actually, December 17 was the date of his baptism, as his birthdate is uncertain -- but who's counting?).  This collection from the vaults of Vanguard Records is sure to please. It is full of both familiar "greatest hits" -- mainly in the symphonies and piano sonatas -- as well as delicious Beethoven rarities and pieces off the beaten track that even people with serious classical music collections will no doubt be dying to hear.  The highlight of the set for me is the collection of Piano Sonatas performed by Bruce Hungerford, a remarkable pianist who died in a tragic accident in 1977, before he could finish his recordings of the complete Beethoven sonatas for Vanguard. What he did complete is an amazing legacy of powerful, expressive performances that rank among the best recorded. (For a previous release of these recordings, see&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/here/dp/B0000023BX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">here</a>.)  Then we have the late string quartets performed by the Yale String Quartet. Again, amazing performances that were certainly among the best available when recorded in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and still just as satisfying. Fantastic in sound and performance quality. Their "Grosse Fuge" -- which in my mind counts as the first place "modern" classical music made a stand, almost 90 years before Stravinsky's "Rite of Spring" -- is amazingly fluid and really must be heard. The Yale Quartet gives the late quartets emotional and musical depth on par with anyone -- these performances stand the test of time. (See one of the previous releases of this music&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/here/dp/B0000023BV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">here</a>.)  For me the biggest surprise in this set were the performances of Symphonies 3 and 5-7 with Sir Adrian Boult conducting the Philharmonic Promenade Orchestra of London (a precursor to the National Philharmonic Orchestra) in his later years. I wasn't expecting much from these. Boult was the ultimate interpreter of British music from the early 20th century, and I will always treasure his first cycle of Vaughan Williams' symphonies greatly, but Beethoven? I assumed these would be dull, but my goodness, I was very wrong. These are dramatic performances, recorded in beautiful, rich detail and terrific early stereo. (An earlier release of this material is found&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/here/dp/B0000023B1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">here</a>-- perhaps credited to the London Philharmonic because the "Promenade Orchestra" at the time was made up mostly of London Phil players.)  Another set of jewels are the complete set of Cello Sonatas performed by Antonio Janigro and Jorg Demus. Wonderful classic performances that again, simply should not be missed. (See an older release&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/here/dp/B0000CABII/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">here</a>.)  Then we have two relatively seldom-heard full-length Beethoven works -- the full ballet of "The Creatures of Prometheus" and the complete incidental music to "Egmont", both of which are usually heard for the overtures only. Both performances are by the Utah Symphony under its great long-time conductor, Maurice Abravanel. Sadly I have to admit I hadn't paid much attention to either piece in its full length before, and I'm very pleased to have these recordings now. (See the LP releases for these&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/here/dp/B00125K3OA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">here</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/here/dp/B008FES20S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">here</a>.)  To round things out, we have a further assortment of pieces for solo piano performed by Denis Mathews and Jorg Demus. The Demus recordings are general some bagatelles and simpler pieces, certainly simpler than the Sonatas performed by Hungerford. Denis Mathews offers a smorgasbord of variation pieces. The sound suffers somewhat in these sections, but enjoyable all.  Overall, this is an amazing set that outshines, in my view, the previous "Big Box" sets eOne has previously released, impressive as those have been. (For me, the Mahler set certainly comes close.) The sheer volume and quality of the material from the Vanguard vault -- and the fact that it goes far beyond the standard "Best of Beethoven" fare -- makes for a set that not even serious Beethoven collectors will want to pass up -- unless they already have all these recordings. Even they may want to pick this up, however, just to save themselves the trouble of ripping it all to their portable devices.  Happy birthday Beethoven! And to us all.	1
I am not purchasing this set because I already own multiple recordings of most of this music, however I just wanted to mention that at $0.99 this set is a no-brainer. The Yale String Quartet renditions of Beethoven's later String Quartets are alone worth the price of the set. Those are truly magnificent. Even when the price jumps up, the inclusion of those tracks will still make the price a bargain.	1
Buy this along with another Beethoven Box	1
Excellent Bruce Hungerford, pleasant incidental music, etc but Denis Matthews is disappointing. Still well worth it	1
Amazing collection I use while studying or relaxing.	1
What is included for the price is excellent. Make sure to control how much of this you download though ;)	1
Wonderful selection and interpretations	1
Great item! Would highly recommend!	1
I'm NOT a classical fan... usually. But this collection is the best performances of this music I have ever listened to. Five stars, all!	1
Great background music or for relaxing.  These Bach Guild Big Boxes are nearly always good quality at amazing prices.  Get them while they're new for the best bargains, but even when the prices go up they are still quite nice.	1
PRO Quality: Generally very good. Price: Paid $1 for it.  It's practically free. Download:  effortless  CON No complain what so ever.	1
YAHOOOOO. AWESOME SET OF GREAT MUSIC. This is a standard selection of Beethoven at an unbelievable price. I would recommend to any lover of classical music .	1
Get up and dance what are you waiting for? do something that feels good so get up and BUST A MOVE!	1
15 hours of music and 176 songs. This is one amazing deal! This Big Box Set is a must for any collector, even if you like another genre. I found the quality was great. Also, having access to all this music via the Amazon Cloud Player lets me share it with my family too.	1
Vanguard Bach Guild continues to impress with its ridiculously low-price MP3 Big Boxes, and this Beethoven set is no exception.  99 is all it takes to secure 15+ hours of great music, with many great performances included. You get Symphonies 3, 5, 6 & 7 conducted by Sir Adrian Boult, piano sonatas played by Bruce Hungerford, string quartets, incidental music, you name it.  There are some glitches in this set - the 3rd movement of the Op 132 String Quartet is missing, and the movements for the "Waldstein" Piano Sonata are mislabeled and sequenced incorrectly (and there's a horrible case of "CD skipping" near the end of the third movement). There are others, but they're covered in other reviews.  Download this and you're good to go for the foreseeable future, though those glitches may have you skipping over some of the selections.  Recommended.	1
Alot of what I said about the Mozart box I can say about this one. If you are not a snob, needing the absolute best recordings of the absolute best perfomers, but just looking for some classical to enrich your music collection, you can't go wrong here. And, frankly, some of the performances are outstanding. Freakin' fantastic deal!	1
At a very good price. Performances are good and these Amazon bargains afford one the opportunity to explore music without being hurt if you don't care for the selections. Amazon has many classical bargains and at these prices you can afford to experiment.	1
This collection of music is great.  The sound is clear and precise, the price is unbeatable.  Hope to see more like this.	1
Good for kids movement	1
Jamming this song back in the day. Awesome jam.	1
Did not finish this book. I tried to like it, but that was not in the cards for me. Oh well, maybe I will try this again another time.	-1
You'd have to PAY me to download this piece of crap. Song has a skip in it anyway- karma's way of acknowledging a bad idea.	-1
This is one of my favorite Christmas songs ~ I have it by several artists and like them all ~ until now. This version of Santa Baby has a very different sound then any other version I've ever heard. Lachi has a capable voice ~ but I didn't care for the style of the music & odd tempo. I do like some light jazz but didn't care for this rock-jazz combination ~ which is predominately rock.	-1
The remix version is creepy to me... would not recommend it.  I actually deleted it from my Android and asked for a refund.  It's just creepy... like a scary movie..  I don't like all the hoopla.	-1
My my	-1
WHO IS THIS HOLDING MY EARS	-1
This is not really my kind of music. It was not purchased ..It was a free download.  Thanks for the free music though.	-1
This song sounds like nothing less than Kool and the Gang's earlier tune "Summer Madness" (minus the awesome synthesizer) circa 1975. Hopefully Paul Hardcastle got authorization to remake this timeless classic. If not, there might be legal issues in the future. Clearly it could be argued that "Summer Madness" is the inspiration for Paul Hardcastle's "No Sress At All".	-1
The wife loves this song, I don't. YMMV.	-1
Amazon, how dare you categorize this as Hip-Hop. I never would have predicted Nelly would do a song like this. Straight off the Disney Channel, the sound and lyrics are juvenile. This is embarrassing.	-1
Again, not my type of music, bubble gum pop style doesn't do it for me, and adapting it for dance doesn't help.	-1
I know I know. I bought this under duress. Every time it plays I shudder to think that I actually spent money on this.	-1
Not  Bad....	-1
One : the song is slow and lame. two : it flat out sucks three : desperate to keep his career going and four : should of just retire. justin timberlake is overrated nuff said.	-1
Great song, but this version is too long and overproduced. It isn't the radio version, and although it is a nice song, there is way too much going on. You could hear the song at any given point and think it was a different song. It is also 9 minutes long, which gets a little tiresome. If you are looking for the typical radio version, this is not what you're looking for.	-1
I've been a fan of both musicians for years. Emmylou did a lot of RC on her "old" WB albums and they still sound fresh. This, on the other hand, sounds dated, boring and one note. It is almost as if having a great songwriter (RC) and a haunting vocalist (EH) paired up stifles both artists in a strange way...	-1
Followed and liked them both for years, but for me the partnership doesn't gel and we're left with a succession of dreary songs. Doesn't do either of them any favours. The Emmylou and Mark Knopfler combination at least had some charm and vitality.	-1
I never thought I would give an Emmy Lou Harris recording a C-, but that is what this collabrative CD rates.  It is "so-so" at best.  One song is pretty good, one song is horrid (Black Caffine), and the rest are just not that great.  I am surprised Ms. Harris released the CD.	-1
I was very disappointed with this artist, he has a great idea for a song and messes it up with the F word and acts like it adds some thing, when it does not. Too bad! I would not suggest this song.	-1
never received it!! had previous review for other songs but only noticed 17 at that time. now I see all these. just copy and paste the other review for everything cuz same comments apply :-(-  had forgotten I even ordered this until I started writing reviews for other purchases!! ugghhhh!!!  other songs this same comment. damn! since I don't remember them I most likely don't have a copy of the original order, where it was supposed to come from and too late to get the item or be refunded!! ugghhhh!!!  close to $100 worth of music never received!!	-1
This song is so very poor. It's not memorable, it's abusively basic in flow. Nothing special. I hear no good singing either. She gets loud but so do Howler Monkeys. But some of these "artists" have dedicated fans, and maybe very rich (which is the very likely reason why her song[s] become "Hits") and it's no wonder droppings like this become Top songs.	-1
It seems unappreciative to say I didn't care for this CD as much as others of the same type that I have purchased.  The price is certainly right, but the sound quality left much to be desired.  This is one I will likely delete from my collection, sad to say.	-1
Not what I expected	-1
I don't know what it was about this song - maybe too much "theatrics", but I did not like this version of The Anthem. I love Planetshakers' version much better.	-1
It has good music for a man who can't really sing but his lyrics make up for it if you want your 14 year old learning from him about BJs. I mean with today's lyrics it's not so pleasant when a singer just learns how to hide nasty lyrics never mind those that count on them. I purchased it. I'm 65 and like the tune. But wouldn't play it or embarrass myself in front of my grand kids.	-1

Great being able to buy old music via MP3, and the price was excellent.  Love the cloud player options for downloading purchased music to phone or computer.  However, I was disappointed because it wasn't the version they play on the radio.	-1
This is the elevator version of Dubstep. Something for your mother and I don't think she will like it either.	-1
When it has came down to Robin Thicke's music, he has had some really good ballads and definite seductive love songs like Lost Without U, and The Sweetest Thing as well as Magic. But he really took his music into a 180 degree turn, and turned that magic, and made a wasted time in his work with Blurred Lines, the lead single with T.I. and Pharrell from his upcoming Blurred Lines really doesn't ignite. In fact, it makes him less of a sex symbol with his songs, and turns into a silly noise. I really didn't like the song at all. It definitely feels like the weakest thing he has ever recorded in his decade-long career in music. I hope he never records something like this ever again. Let us hope there is much better in his career when his next album comes out soon.  Song: F	-1

I didn;t realize when I bought this that there was explicit language in it. I clearly do not understand the current need by entertainers to use language that most people don't care to hear. I guess it just goes with these coming of age kids and their need to be the bad-boy/girl. whatever.	-1
The song is very horrible i wouldnt reccomend it, especially not for kids, the singer has a horrible voice, i have no idea as of to how this song even made one sale!	-1
I like the beat of this song & I like Robin Thicke.  I saw him on Oprah and heard them say the song had profane lyrics.  So when I came to Amazon I was searching for the CLEAN version of this song.  I downloaded the song & began to listen only to discover that the lyrics on the CLEAN VERSION had profanity as well.  VERY ANGRY & DISAPPOINTED!!!  I wish there was a way I could get my money back for this song.  I thought clean meant......profanity-free. Amazon reps when u read this review, plz contact me or refund my $1.29.	-1
good club record that's all you wanna let loose in a club and party yes this all rthis song is good for but comparing it to marvin gaye's gopt to give it up is and was a far superior song you can't touch marvin's classic and erobin thicke might be a good singwer but he has no soujl he's not a soulsinger and you can't com,pare him to soul greats like marvin, al green, curtis mayfield, luther vandross, johnny taylor, tyrone davis and plenty others even teddy pendrergrass, smokey and stevie wonder.	-1
nothing to be taken seriously about this song, it's just for fun, and people shouldn't read too much into it. listen to it on your way home from work, and enjoy the ride.	-1
Robin Thicke is a disgusting individual. I bought this song because he states that the meaning of the song is not the objectification of women but it totally is. From having naked women in his video to the asinine lyrics, this song is trash and would love to get my money back.	-1
I was expecting the song I heard on the radio, not this offensive, explicit version.  Uses "b..." word, etc...no thanks!  Deleted it.  Waste of money.  A singer who refers to women in such a derogatory manner is not an artist, and not worth listening to, imho.	-1
Why did it now say anywhere that this version had so much swearing? I can't use this. It's foul. Where's the clean version? I wish I could return this version.	-1
I'm a huge fan of this guy. His vocals are smooth, soulful and damn sexy. He's also made some great songs (singles and otherwise). Most of his material is good.  However once in a while he creates something you're a little indifferent about. This song takes things a notch below that even. I don't like it. First time I heard this song I didn't know what to think. He went from mostly smooth, meaningful ballads on his last album to...t h i s. I know sometimes ballads don't always move product but man. This song is the worst! I was actually interested in knowing what the song would be like since when I first watched the video it was upbeat. Had no problems with that. But once the singing started and I listened to the lyrics I was highly unimpressed. The beat is not my cup of tea at all. The only thing I really like about the song is the guests (although to be fair they don't particularly add anything to this song).  Some have said that they like this song because it's upbeat. That's fine but I think most people that like this have seen the video and are just thinking one word: SEX. Sorry. Just not impressed in the least. Hope his album has some quality records whether they are fast or slow. Any more songs like this and I will have an eternal headache. I probably only made it through the whole video once.  2 stars.	-1
I love Robin Thicke and I like Pharrell but this song did nothing for me.  I even gave it the benefit of the doubt and listened to it a few more times...still nothing.	-1
If you're part of the LCD (lowest common denominator) that the entertainment industry caters to these days, you will love "Blurred Lines" by Robin Thicke.  The video for the song (I guess you've seen it more than once) is full of near-naked golden bodies dancing around to a stupid beat (although Mr. Thicke himself is fully clothed), with none of those annoying 'instruments' or 'melodies' to get in the way.  So, if you're shacked up in your own little room by yourself you should really enjoy this one. And it's got THREE stars so you can be fully 'starstruck', cause it's got 'featuting' twice!	-1
When it has came down to Robin Thicke, musically he seems to have it all, as a singer and a father. But surprisingly, he had a song that really did not appeal in the he could've brought out from his past songs. He has done very well as a soft blue-eyed Soul crooner with songs like Magic and Lost Without U. Blurred Lines, Robin's latest song actually is not very good. It really seemed more like a attempt for him to get into the Youtube crowd of music lovers, but instead it felt more like a joke. I actually was not very impressed with the song, and it honestly was just as bad as the overexposure we've heard from people more interested in the Call Me Maybe and Psy music crowd. For Robin Thicke's next album, he has to have beter songs than this one was.  Song: D+	-1
I listened to the song on YouTube and thought I'd buy the song as it's a very catchy tune.  From 2:13 - 2:32 in the song, there is a terrible mix job cutting the Nelly part in, some of the words are different and it doesn't flow with the song very well.  You can actually hear the cut with the mix and it just sound strange and does not flow well with the rest of the song.  Save your money and listen to the one on YouTube.	-1
Could not get this to download.  Kept getting error saying download failed.  This is a waste of money.  Don't buy if you want to download to your computer.	-1
I would like my money back please.	-1
It disappoints me to see that Paramore has strayed so far from it's alt rock roots. I understand that they always select the more pop friendly songs as singles, like "the only exception" and "still into you" but this time they've crossed the line. This song is completely meaningless pop trash and just epitomizes the fact that they have sold out. Goodbye.	-1
Openly, when it has came down to Beyonce' Knowles, she has been the most over-consumed, shrill artists of the past decade. It has been more of the oversaturation, and her voice stopped showing. That really showed with the lagging of song from her fourth album, 4. Of all the songs she did for that album, Love On Top has to be one of the worst songs she had done. She really let her voice and the tone go badly. The way her high notes are on the song, and not really good. I really wasn't impressed with the song. It honestly has been one of her worst songs she had ever done. Whatever Beyonce' does on the next album, she needs to show that her most important asset, her only asset has to be on top, her voice. Because it speaks louder than words.  Song: D+	-1
When it has came down to Beyonce, and the music she had from her lackluster 4th album, 4, she just doesn't have the voice and the connection with her songs to really match what she did have from her earlier career. That showed in a lot of songs from that album. Dance For You, which became the 5th single from that album just doesn't have the ignition she had brought out to her fans like Single Ladies had shown. I really didn't enjoy the song at all. Not only does she not deliver in the conviction with her song, she really feels like she tries to bring the sexy out, but it feels more like a lagged effort with the song. If you are new to Beyonce' Knowles music, find another song to dance to, because this dance a lagged tune.  Song: D+	-1
When it has came down to divas, Beyonce' Knowles has to be the most overconsumed, most annoying artist of the past several years. Sadly, her voice really stopped showing on her 4 record on almost all the songs. Her lead-off song from that album Run The World (Girls) doesn't actually ignite a fire, but leaves a flame to be doused over with water. I honestly found the song to be much of a weak anthem. Sadly, I really didn't find the song to actually strike the match in her song. She really was starting to let herself go. It isn't a song that ignites, but feels to be overdrawn and tiring, just as is the case with Single Ladies (Put A Ring On It.) I definitely think she needs to take more time and find a better voice that runs the world that she claims to own.  Song: D+	-1

What I simply and always say, is that when a artist has to come out with a song, they don't actually deliver when it has came down to song choice. For Fantasia to try to make that attempt with going to a modern R&B voice and sound in her music, it actually hasn't actually drove the point home. Her song Without Me, with Kelly Roland and Missy Elliot, the second single from her album Side Effects Of You is honestly one of the worst choices she has made into song. I really found it to be much weaker in the song from Fantasia, while it is more of a song that would fit into Kelly Rowland's sound, or something that Ciara would make. I definitely was not that impressed with the song, and it definitely is Fantasia's low point.  Song: D+	-1

Ignore the Saint Motel and Arctic Monkeys song reviews I made, even though they do sucks to extremes, this is definitely the worst song ever. Yeah, you heard me call the Saint Motel song 'Bonafide Trash', but at least that song hasn't been bothering me too much even though I don't want to hear it again. But this song sucks so scathingly bad that I don't even want to say anything good about it. The album it is on is even bad for this song. The whistling melody in the beginning of and throughout this entire song is the most avoidable thing in musical audio to ever be created. So do the melodies of the lyrics, but let's just stop with the musical reasons why this song sucks and get to some other chaos. Everything that uses this song is equally as bad just for using this song, especially that Supercuts commercial. Because this song deserves no attention. It does not deserve to have any good things said about it. It is so bad that I would take this song out of existence and into the Devils wrath, because that where it belongs. Fitz and The Tantrums need to disband because they suck big time. Listen to CHVRCHES and The Neighbourhood instead of this trash.	-1
come on demi, Cher Lloyd is trash and you ought to be ashamed for collaborating with that no talent hack. She is seriously like the female JB, propelled only by mindless dweebs. If you don't care, then how do you expect us to? Enough said.	-1
Love Demi but EDM? Really? This seems like a desperate attempt to stay relevant in lieu of current pop music trends. The lyrics are vapid and redundant and the song lacks the vocal impressiveness of her past singles like Skyscraper and Give your heart a break.	-1
I am perplexed at the stellar reviews 'Extended Play' has been getting in the press.  If you read them, they are almost word for word the same, so someone's doing a killer job with their PR.  It's as if no one dares to speak badly about elder statesmen.  And so those who assume I'm a fair-weather fan, I've purchased everything the band and solo artists have put out since 1973.  I'd be lying if I said I wasn't curious about their four song Ep.  What had a ten year absence brought (after a 16 year one before that)?  Well, not much - that's for sure.  First off, any Fleetwood Mac album since 1987 has been a result of Lindsey Buckingham's solo work being taken and morphed into a Fleetwood Mac album - and it always shows.  'Extended Play' is no different.  Three of the four are Buckingham tunes - and iffy ones at that.  The one Stevie Nicks song is from 1973 - which isn't a shock. Almost all her material for the last 25 years has been pulled songs she wrote in the '70s.  If they weren't good enough to record then.......guess what?  Let's start with her "Without You".  Cat Stevens should sue for plagiarism.  The music and arrangement has "Peace Train" written all over it.  (and enough with finding these songs on YouTube, which she did on her last solo disk, and from a woman who claims not to own or use a computer.)  The criticism of Nicks' voice back in the '70s was somewhat unwarranted, but like a prophecy waiting to be fulfilled, she lived up to it long ago.  Nicks' voice has been shot since the late '80's and for the life of me, the people who trip over themselves to sing (ha!) her praises is beyond me. The woman can no longer sing more than three notes and it is painful to listen to - mostly due to the nostalgia I'm feeling of what used to be.  Her vocal limits can work when songs and vocals are arranged correctly. But I can think of a few instances in the last 20 years where that has worked. It didn't hurt that the harmony vocals helped save those few songs.  For this outing, the harmonies are barely there....and they're all hers.  Buckingham's "Sad Angel" is just half right. It's sad.  I don't know it would have even worked as a solo song, but it doesn't pass muster as a band one.  And speaking of solo stuff, his "It Takes Time" is just that.  Seriously, if you're going to do a group record, then a song with just you and a piano isn't the one to present in this venue. Save it for your solo work.  The only song that pseudo-works is the horribly titled "Miss Fantasy".  Buckingham writes notes he can't possibly hit - and doesn't - but doesn't jigger the vocal arrangement.  It is here that Nick's muted harmony on the chorus actually (almost) saves the song.  What is sadder than the actual release is the band's assertion that this is some of their best work.  Yikes.  I get that they're 63 years old and up, but has their hearing gone too?  I'm not sure whether to blame Buckingham or co-producer Mitchell Froom.  Froom was a wiz with Crowded House, Forest for the Trees and Suzanne Vega.  But he bombs out here.  Or maybe this is the best he could do with which he had to work.  I expect more from a band like this and not be expected to take with gratitude anything they push our way once every decade. They don't just get a pass. Either way - skip it.  Save yourself $3.98.	-1

I was excited to see Tamar had another song out and purchased it without even listening to it.  The lyrics are original but the song is a sample of a song that I wasn't crazy.  I generally don't like when an artist samples a song with new lyrics.  I was very disappointed.	-1
When it has came down to Jennifer Lopez, she hasn't really brought out her better songs out there. It has felt more like the same thing she has done before with her songs, which sadly has felt old, and not exciting anymore. She has made so many dance songs, that it doesn't feel like she excites anymore. Live It Up, her first after leaving MCA. Her last album did not do the trick very well, and her cavalcade of consecutive dance songs have felt less intriguing than exciting. Her latest dance song Live It Up with Pitbull doesn't actually feel like she has brought out more than her A game. It feel like the same thing she has done before, from her recent songs like Dance Again, and Goin' In. I really didn't feel Jennifer brought out something different. I think if Jennifer Lopez wants to get out more for her music, she should try and deliver better than feeling like she has done the same song from before.  Song: D+	-1

now the  dream got  a ok pen game for others, however on his own, he just ain't got alot going for him.  as is the case with his previous other albums  R.Kelly, Michael  Jackson and Prince are his blueprint for the music he makes and he stays stuck in tribute mode as to enhancing or adding the best of what those  artists had to offer. production on his albums save him, because vocally to me he sounds like a  constipated version of Kermit the  frog. i just don't care for this cat's voice, and now  the lyrics here were  wack.  talk about a one trick pony?  he just phoned this in and said  whatever and threw his hands in the air.  sorry  to tell this turkey  but this ain't no 12 Play and I'm sure he will  try again and again and again.	-1

When the sample is played it only gives a brief sample of about 30 seconds. That leaves out the end of the song which I find many songs here are cut off at the end. These are typically offerings from Sony. Quality highly resembles the old pirated songs where burn spots left 'boing' sounds and got cut short, difference here is only the cut offs remain now. Often the cover copy \\ fakes come up and recoarse seems too difficult to go after. About 30% of my bought downloads I want a refund on and they offer no fair way to 'make it right' for me.	-1
I did not get much out of this one. This is not R. Kelly's first gospel tune. However, Clean This House left me flat. Unlike his other collaborations, this one was missing a bit of seasoning.	-1
the cost is too high the return on investment too low and vastly over rated in my mind. Nothing more to say.	-1

When it has came down to Britney Spears and her music, she doesn't seem to have the spark to match younger artists like Taylor Swift or Jennifer Hudson with voice. Britney has not made very good songs for the films either. It has been a very long time since she had a song hit the movies since her work with the lackluster Crossroads. She has decided to give it another whirl with Ooh La La, the lead single from the film The Smurfs 2. Surprisingly, the song didn't feel like it had ignited in the spirit for The Smurfs. It felt more like it had ignited with Britney pears fans, but not really a song that delivered in its strength. If you are a die hard Britney Spears fan, than you'll definitely want to download this song, but I didn't like it because it didn't have enough in the heart.  Song: D	-1

Ok First of all the only reason why i ever Love Hillsong was cause of Darlene Zschech. This is the frist time Darlene Zschech is not on a Hillsong album!!! Darlene Zschech has been on every hillsong album from 1992-2012. I always knew a day might come where she would not be on it. I'm more of a Darlene Zschech fan than a hillsong fan. But if your a Hillsong fan you'll love this cd. But us Darlene Zschech fans are sure sad.	-1
I'm not real happy with this one, though I usually like classic piano.  It is fairly well done, just not a pleasing recording to listen to for a long period of time.  I like piano music to sleep by at night, and this one just doesn't relax me.  I may delete this one.	-1
I buy all of the 50, 100, 99, and whatever Amazon decides to have for a simple reason. For a buck (almost all of them), I have a list already created with music I enjoy listening. You really can't go wrong with them, regardless of the repeated tracks, or average interpretations. However, this time I am very disappointed for the simple fact that the composer info is not provided. This is unacceptable, and I hope the publishers of this album will rectify and provide the information in the future. Until then, I can't recommend this one, hence the one star.	-1

Now, before you press that "not helpful" button simply because I gave this album two stars, hear me out. I am a lifelong Yes fan, and they are my all-time favorite band (Dylan is my all-time favorite artist, Yes is my favorite band). I love these guys, and I have all of their albums. I saw this incarnation of Yes at the Tower Theater in Philadelphia last year (with Oliver Wakeman) and hung out with all of them backstage for quite awhile. I've always loved these guys, and I loved every album this band has released (including 1980's 'Drama,' 1987's 'Big Generator,' 1991's 'Union' and 1997's 'Open Your Eyes').  Until this one.  Look, I'm going to come out and say it, 'Fly from Here' blows. Yes, the Roger Dean cover art is great, and the funky Yes logo design is quite nice, but the music just isn't what it once was. The playing is alright, but it is not what it should be for musicians on this level. Benoit David is an okay singer, but I've come to the conclusion that he simply does impersonations on stage. He sounded alright the night I saw him, but he's either impersonating Jon Anderson or he's impersonating Trevor Horn (as he does here). Don't get me wrong, he's talented, and he's a nice guy too, but he just doesn't have much personality as a vocalist. That, for me, is a problem.  And then there is the production. Trevor Horn, in my opinion, is one of the best producers of the modern era. His work on '90125,' ABC's 'The Lexicon of Love,' and the Art of Noise records are just phenomenal. The guy is simply a genius as a producer. But on 'Fly from Here,' the production sounds very stale and quite amateurish, like he is using a GarageBand like computer program instead of proper production techniques. Considering all of the wonderfully produced records being made in this day in age (like Radiohead's 'The King of Limbs'), there is absolutely no excuse for a band like Yes to have an album this poorly produced, ESPECIALLY coming from a first-rate producer like Trevor Horn.  The songs are also somewhat of a disappointment. A previous reviewer described this really as a Buggles album, with Benoit David singing and Steve, Chris, and Alan playing along and occasionally throwing something in. To some extent, that is true. Steve Howe does get a solo piece here which is quite nice (I personally prefer 'Masquerade' from 1991's 'Union,' but that's just me), but the rest of it just doesn't seem to fit Yes very well. 'We Can Fly from Here' is a track that has been floating around since 1980, and it was even performed on the 'Drama' tour (a live version of it recorded at Madison Square Garden in New York in September of that year was released on the 2005 'The Word is Live' box set). Really, extending the track into a 22-minute suite just wasn't smart. The track worked brilliantly as a 6-minute tune, and if it were recorded on this album as it was performed on the 'Drama' tour, perhaps I wouldn't object to it. But trying to stretch it out into a lengthy epic suite like 'The Gates of Delirium' and 'Ritual' (and shortening it's title to 'Fly from Here') is just ridiculous. 'Life on a Film Set' could easily have appeared on the Buggles' 1979 album 'The Age of Plastic,' and 'The Man You Always Wanted Me to Be' is somewhat sappy, surprising coming from Squire. His voice doesn't sound bad, but the lyrics just aren't good.  Don't get me wrong, I do like the Buggles. But if I buy a Yes record, I want to hear Yes. I don't want to hear the Buggles. That why I bought 'The Age of Plastic.'  The final complaint I have is that Geoff Downes just doesn't click with Yes anymore. He is an ideal fit in Asia, with Wetton, Howe and Palmer, but in the 2011-present version of Yes, he just doesn't blend. He was right for Yes in the early '80s, but for some reason, he just doesn't seem to be on the same page as the rest of the band nowadays. He is a stellar keyboardist (one of the best), but he just seems out of place in the new Yes.  Look, I'm all for Yes trying new things, but this album just doesn't work. It isn't well produced, it's not well written, and in 20 years, when one is making a list of what they would consider classic Yes songs, let's be honest, NONE of these songs would even be contenders. This album is the first time I have ever felt disappointment from my favorite band, and I hope it is the only time. If this were some other band, maybe this record wouldn't bother me. But I was expecting so much better from musicians like Yes.  I recommend the album 'The Living Tree,' by Jon Anderson & Rick Wakeman, which is also new for 2011. While that record is far more stripped down, it is well produced, it is far more intimate, and it is also better performed. That is the record Yes fans should be buying. 'Fly from Here' isn't. Buy 'The Living Tree' before 'Fly from Here.'  Overall, this record was such a letdown to me. Like I have said, it is the only Yes album that has left a sour taste in my mouth. I hate to jump on the bandwagon (especially because I am such a fan of the 'Drama' album), but this group needs Jon Anderson back desperately. Peter Frampton also played the night I saw Yes, and he definitely outperformed them that night. But that's irrelevant. The new record just isn't what it should be. I had such high expectations for this band's first album in 10 years. This album was well below my expectations.  I know I'm going to get a lot of unhelpful votes for this, but honestly, stick with the Yes albums you already have. If you don't own 'Fly from Here,' take my word for it: you aren't missing much.	-1
I don't understand, how serious Yes fans can consider this 'Fly From Here' to be a REAL YES ALBUM.  Step back to the real world, dudes: This is nothing else than an album that could be better titled as "DRAMA, Vol 2"... ... But this time, the performing band name is MAYBE.  ... Hey, but... What can you REALLY expect when there's no more Jon Anderson and Rick (or even his so-talented son Adam) Wakeman, back in the full gang??? In addition, Trevor Horn has 'Buggles-ed' the music once again...  This 'Fly From Here', definitely, only has the cover art (another excellent work of the maestro Roger Dean) of a Yes album... The music, really performed by the band MAYBE... And ZERO stars.	-1
Steve Howe's acoustic song is beautiful but out of context, in my opinion.  I am a big Yes fan  but....  I agree 100% with FatElvis, who says that 'most of the performances are uninspired and lacking conviction'.  Indeed there are great moments here and there, some great passages and riffs but not much critical mass. Just a few good songs, i must sadly admit.  I also agree that the solos of a keyboard wizard are missing. Isn't Yes about 'Kick ass' burning keyboard solos?  Howe plays beautifully, but the songs are indeed kind of hollow and too simple for my taste after knowing what Yes can do musically.... You will freakin see what i am talking about.  It sounds a bit like Drama, but is nowhere near that great album.  This record lacks Deepness as a unit, the Yes deepness which has been lost for quite a while.	-1
I really wanted to like the first release in 10 years from one of my favorite bands...Everything seemed to be there...except for good lyrics and any sense of melody...I listened to the CD three times yesterday and I STILL do not remember a single chorus or verse...So sad.  The new singer does a decent job but I miss Jon Anderson...Many people have compared this recording to Drama...Not as good...not even close.	-1
Got tired of it way too quickly.	-1
"Drunken Hearts" by Wallpaper sounds like a bunch of songs you've heard before and sort of like, but don't really love.  There is the whoa-hoa filled, sing-along chorus and the relentlessly upbeat rhythm that has a horn punctuate the sound from time-to-time.  Kind of catchy, but not memorable.	-1
I got say from a fan's standpoint this whole lp filled with garbage yet too many dick riders think cash and young money run the game. I wish more people would realize this industrial rap garbage is killing the true lyricist shine and I recommend avoiding this record.	-1
Well if you would look at all the horrible releases that's came out of Cash Money/YMCMB like<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/I-Am-Not-a-Human-Being-II/dp/B00BDZV9M4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">I Am Not a Human Being II</a>, and<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Hotel-California/dp/B00BDZV7DA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Hotel California</a>, you would think that this compilation would have little to offer. If you approach this album with the mind state of knowing what you are going to get, average rhymes over some of the best beats that money can buy (seriously if you bought this album expecting to hear intelligent lyrics then I don't know what to say). Now that YMCMB is signing any and everyone becoming more than a powerhouse label, Brian Williams aka Birdman aka Baby aka B-32 (took that one way back) decided to do was to showcase what everyone can do on this compilation while playing the role of Diddy on the album (excessive talking on tracks). While there is nothing that stands out too much, he puts together something decent for the summer.  True enough, formal rival Mystikal now signed to the label starts off the album (you remember "Drag 'Em In The River"...you and that song are probably the same age lol). Here he sounds refreshed as he was during his No Limit days. "Million Dollar" with Detail and Future is average. Detail sounds like a Drake wannabe. "Tapout"  is the lead single of this album. The song is your obvious formulaic style with half decent lyrics and your R&B/rapper style person on the hook. In this case is Future. "We Been On" is actually kind of good. The beat and R. Kelly providing a nice hook to the song is the reason why it works. "Dreams Come True" has a nice beat, but no one on that track says anything work remembering, and the fact Yo Gotti was only on the hook was a waste of a guest appearance. Rick Ross gets a solo song "50 Plates" is nothing special either. "Bigger Than Life" has a nice hook by Chris Brown. Tyga spits an ok verse, but Birdman's is garbage, and Wayne's kind of good. "100 Favors" is the oddest colab with Detail, Birdman, and Kendrick Lamar (Note to K. Dot: If you are going to mention all those rappers name in that wonderful verse, the very least you could have done is colab with someone on a lever WAY lower than them). You can guess how that turns out. "Everyday" featuring Birdman, Cory Gunz, Busta Rhymes, and Mystikal is one of the good tracks here. The fact that Busta and Mystikal together on a song gives us a nostalgic feel of their colabs back in the late 90's. "Burn This House" featuring Detail singing is garbage. Even worse "Panties To The Side" is by far the worst song on here. "Angel" is also a bad sex song. "Sunshine" is completely awkward, although I do enjoy Caskey's presence on the song (he has a good mixtape that came out this year). T.I. makes a strong appearance on "Have It Your Way". "Paint Tha Town" featuring Birdman, The Game, and Lil Wayne is pretty solid surprisingly. "Fly Rich" ends the album.  Overall, Rich Gang is average. As said before the beats here are great. The hooks too are not bad. If you are the kind of person who listens rather than just hears lyrics in songs, avoid this album. There are some shiny spots here and there, but the album is more suited for the club style atmosphere. Like many summer compilations such as<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Ryde-Or-Die-Compilation-1/dp/B00000IFNQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Ryde Or Die Compilation 1</a>and<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Irv-Gotti-Presents-The-Inc/dp/B000068TKH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Irv Gotti Presents The Inc.</a>there is room for many hit singles but no substance. Expect a few solo albums from the YMCMB camp to drop later on this year based on this compilation. Peace.  Lyrics: C- Production: B+ Guest Appearances: C Musical Vibes: C+  Top 5 Songs: 1.

I love the song, I hate the download. It is flawed, it has errors in it, distortion and garbling towards the end of the track. This is the first time I have experienced this.	-1
I really was disappointed by the song	-1
I like the beat & the tune,  but could do without the lyrics.  Where Al's Word Crimes has similar beat & tune but happier, fun lyrics.	-1
Just ok. This is like listening to an unknown ok pianist. Nothing special or inspiring here. Skip it this time.	-1
Stupid.	-1
CRAP CRAPCRAP double crap.... crap on a bun crap to slap.... don't buy it in my opinion.  UGLY UGLY.UGLY. Extremely UGLY.	-1
ITS BS Amazon forces you to download their software medial player in order to download the music you paid for. I don't want their media player. I will never buy music from Amazon again.	-1
I'm sorry for anyone who finds this song even exists in my music library. I do confess it was bought by me, however, it was due to the request of a family member. He wanted it played at my dad's memorial service. Thank God the disc player wouldn't accept it because once I heard it, I almost died myself. Sorry country fans. I'm just a good ole rock n roll girl at heart.	-1
They complain about Rappers writing beating your woman songs, but why can country singers write beer drinking songs and its ok. Does drinking a beer solve everything ?? I think not.	-1
Want to go to sleep in a hurry? Play this song which may make you want to drink a case. BEAT IT!	-1

I hated to rate Kid Rock's last album "Born Free" so low, but nothing on that album stood out to me as something that would be a classic, it may have gone to #1 in the US and done fairly well around the world, but that was fans anticipation that Kid's latest album would be great, but the proof is seen in how many songs you remember now, how many have radio play, how many clips where made and remembered and the singles chart positions.  I am glad Kid Rock abandoned using Rick Ruban's help to produce this album, as it does sound a bit more like Kid Rock now. However, I was excited to not only hear that, but that Kid wanted this album to be something more like "Cocky" which to me is one of his best albums yet where I enjoy listening to that album almost from start to finish. But what has been the outcome here on "Rebel Soul" has been rather disappointing for me.  The opening song "Chickens In The Pen" is not a strong opener, nor is it a great song. Usually upon hearing the first track of an album, it sets the mood for what is about to come, but like on "Born Free" the first track here made my heart sink that this album was not going to put Kid back on top of his game. The lyrics are too weird for me to even understand what Kid was going for on this track. I thought maybe it would be tongue in cheek lyrics, but "the mule keeps kickin' the chickens in the pen, Let's rock all night and then do it again" I dunno... I just expect better from Kid Rock. The song is just too stupid to be good if you ask me.  Lets Ride - it sounds like Kid has taken a real liking to the 60's and 70's sound of Rock N roll bands like 'The Who' and 'Alice Cooper'. It's certainly not a bad thing at all, however the song comes off sounding pretty average for it's genre.  Catt Boogie - About the same as "Lets Ride", its decent, but not all that memorable.  Detroit Michigan - OK, KID. WE GET IT ALREADY, YOU ARE FROM DETROIT, BUT PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE stop singing about it. The lyrics sound good, the melody is pretty good, up until the chorus, it just doesn't sit right in the song. A song that could have been good, but he does a better job with this type of thing later on the album.  Rebel Soul - I expected a title like this to be southern rock, but it sounds country to me. Kid's done some great country songs, but this song here to me is not worthy of naming the whole album after. Definitely a filler sounding track.  God Save Rock N Roll - What is Kid thinking these days? First Rebel Soul is not southern rock, yet this one here has ROCK N ROLL in the title and is a country tune? Next.  Happy New Year - This is a cover song? Why did Kid chose to cover this song? It's pretty simple lyrics, and i'm convinced Kid can do much better then this. I was surprised to see this song was leading the votes of favorite song from this album on Kid's website... why, I just don't know?  Celebrate - Not a bad song, but like track 2 and 3, it is easy to forget, but amongst the rest of this album, it's one of the better ones on here.  The Mirror - I absolutely hate auto-tuners. Kid doesn't need to use them, and ruined what could have been a decent slow song had he not used those annoying stupid auto-tuners that should be banned from anyone being able to record with. I did say something the same on Alice Cooper's last album, and was informed that it was an effect and not an auto-tuner, so if that's the case with this song too, then Bathroom Bobby, never EVER use that effect ever again, it sounds horrible.  Mr Rock N Roll - I was losing faith that there wasn't going to be a stand out song on this album, and i'd be reviewing it the same way I did Kid's last album, but Mr Rock N Roll showed up and brightened my day. I wouldn't say this song is 5 of 5 stars, but it's around the 4 mark. It's my favorite track on this album, and easy to get into and rock with. The lyrics are great, has a lot of familiar names of classic songs in it, and is worthy of Kid adding this track to his live shows.  Cucci Galore - At first I thought, WTF is this $#!%? lyrics spewing out of "My names Cucci, Cucci, Cucci galore" and repeating. Then a screaming rock chorus of "Do you wanna go down"... the song makes little sense to me other than it's a typical Kid Rock bragging about having money, fame, women and hot tubs etc... but as weird as the lyrics are, and a WTF imprint it left after the first listen... for some reason, it's not a bad track, as much as it makes little sense, it's catchy.. and about the only song on here that has any boom bass in it, where as most of the other songs on here are classic rock or country sounding, this one combines a bit of rock with a sort of hip hop beat to it. Weirdly, this track grew on me!  Redneck Paradise - Euhhh, seems like Kid has done this song before. I'd rather better red neck songs about drinking or "Born To Be a Hick" over this feel good attempt at a trailer park sing-along filler.  Cocaine and Gin - Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz, I take back that thing I said about rather listening to drinking songs... only when they rock, this one is just a filler for boredom.  Midnight Ferry - I was so sick of hearing halleluiah preachy songs by this point that I just can't even get to the end of this track. Not a good way to close the album. Kid has said he wants this song played at his funeral, I would take "Only God Knows Why" over this any day and any night.  I added up my ratings, and can only give this album a 1.9... a bit higher then the last album, but far from the 4 to 5 star ratings for albums Kid has done in the past. Just to be clear, no, I am not a rap or hip hop fan, so with those sounds being absent here have not left me bitter, but I do miss the heavier sound of songs like "So Hott", "American Baddass" and Kid's earlier album sounds... I do miss The Twisted Brown Trucker Band... plus, what I would have loved to hear was songs like on "Cocky" that started off slow, then rocked your @$$ off by the end. Hopefully Kid Rock will return to that sound on the next album. But even so, the songs on here, there are a few decent tracks, but only one or two worthy of being included during live shows, but only barely worthy of being called a hit song... not something I would be disappointed by if they didn't appear on a greatest hits album in future... but compared to Kid's best stuff, really only Mr Rock N Roll would be worthy of standing next to them... but again, not hard to understand if it was passed by as a greatest hits selection.	-1
kid  rock  is a  frustrating  act  because  just solely on  the  music  front,  he  covers a  few  styles,  problem  is on an  album like  this  he forgot the  songs  and  settles  for  cliches  of  what worked  more effective  years  ago.  in  truth  musically  he  should  be  more of  a alternative  act,  than  a parity  act  at this stage.  country,pop  and  hip  hop  are all part of his  hybrid  however  nothing  here  ever  touches  on  what  got him over  for  covering  bases  as a artist. this album is just kinda  there with very little hit  and  alot of miss  from  the songs.	-1
Its ok	-1
Tried something a little different than what I usually listen to; glad I did not pay for this song.  Not my favorite.	-1
I DID NOT KNOW THAT THEY WOULD NOT HAVE CAPS	-1
Had I known what the lyrics were on this album, I would not have bought it. Before you buy this album, do a search on the lyrics of each song, then make an educated decision before buying this album.	-1
Was sort of looking forward to her new one, but a huge disappointment. Definitely not worth your money. Go elsewhere for a hit than this. Not to mention it greatly sounds like "Brave" by sara bareilles	-1

There is no question when it has came down to Katy Perry, she has definitely been known more for trying to be a pussycat in music, than trying to ignite with sex appeal in voice. She shown that shallowing down with her marriage Russell Brand ending late last year. But her trying to get back into music with her next album, doesn't seem like a far cry, it feels more like a waste to the ears with her lead single from the upcoming record Prism is definitely a waste upon the ears. Katy has definitely lost her talent in her voice, as she tries to make her own version of the Sara Bareilles song Brave. She sounds more like a whimper of herself than someone who can ignite, like she did to her fans with California Gurls. I think Katy should go back to square one with her voice, than ignite something new.  Song: D-	-1
You get almost nothing on this and the song is available for free online legally. So what is the point? You are a sucker if you buy this. They are just trying to steal your money. The case it comes in is very cheap looking and flimsy. It might as well be a paper sleeve.	-1
This is a decent song. It is very on-trend with the pop music that is out nowadays, and very within the vein of KP's 'empowerment anthems'. It kind of sounds like something that was left off of Teenage Dream. I can see that this was a song made to be put in some athletic commercial,  one of the leading songs for the Olympics (and possibly World Cup) or any sporting event, due to the stomping mid-tempo beat and the sort of shout-heavy chorus. It is just kind of weird that there are so many borrowed quotes in one song (Eye of the Tiger, I Am Woman, Staying Alive, Muhammad Ali), and rhyming cliches (I went from zero / to my own hero). And upon release there was already controversey that this song relates heavily to&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Brave/dp/B00DRDSL4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Brave</a>&nbsp;by Sara Bareilles. I can see this song being number one, but it lacks substance for me. Apparently Katy Perry is trying to come 'darker' with this album, but if Roar is any indication of what is to come, it really just sounds like a lackluster part two to Teenage Dream, or maybe its B-side. Also, the album art is very Lisa Frank-ish.	-1
I always knew she didn't possess one original bone in her body! This song is a total rip off of Sara Bareilles' Brave!! Go listen to it and tell me they don't have the same melody. It's a damn shame - Roar is one of the biggest hits of all time now, yet I bet barely anyone is familiar with the far superior Brave. The world is so unfair.	-1
nothing special of course. just like her other songs it sucks as usual. Isn't your 15 mins up by now?	-1
This is obnoxious drivel, just like the rest of Katy's unoriginal pablum. She is so out-of ideas (not that she ever had any) that she ripped off an old Survivor song, Eye of The Tiger.	-1

I can not stand this song it honestly has a bad beat and it really is not encouraging, but i guess you have to hear it to find out! P. S. Lady gagas applause is a whole lot better!	-1
When it has came down to what music has today, it has been more lackluster than anything that is really worth meaning in voice. For Katy Perry she has had a whole lot to prove in music. Following up to her massive success in Teenage Dream, she has tried to ignite into her voice, but her latest single Roar feels more like it is a whimper in song and voice alone, to match her mood. But the song is also a cheater for Katy as well. The song sound too similar to the melody of what Sara Barielles did earlier this year with Brave. I really found the song to not ignite in her feeling of the song. It sounded more like she lost herself in time, trying to hard to make a anthem as brilliant as her mentors, Queen. Maybe she shoule find more to roar about for her next single.  Song: D	-1

When it has came down to Katy Perry, she hasn't really hit the nail on the head with her music as much as the fans wanted. That lackluster appeal is written all in her album Prism. Her song Roar from that album is absolutely a cheater in song as well, which sounds too close in ear to what Sara Bareilles did with Brave earlier this year, which honestly was a much dearer song in voice and sonnet. I really didn't find the song to be a s empowering as was the case with her influence Queen. I really found the song to not only not deliver, but I found it to be another boring pop song that had lackluster drive in the words of a diva. If you are a hard core Katy Perry fan, you'll want this song, but it isn't really worth the money and the roar.  Song: D+	-1
Katy Perry returns with another song destined for the top of the charts, "Roar".  Ms. Perry doesn't break any new ground with the song (it is basically nicks the tune of Sara Bareilles' "Brave" completely), so long time fans will certainly lap it up by the truckloads.  Most of Ms. Perry's work is generic pop and "Roar" is another mostly pleasant, but forgettable number.	-1
As far as top ten pop chanteuses go Katy Perry fits the bill for unoffensive mass pop pablum. However everything about this "song" with regurgitated lyrics ("eye of the tiger..' really?) and the inane supposition that she is being held back or down by someone or something, comes off as ersatz suffragette. The lyrics are sparse and infantile and the dragging pulsing synth that leads to the chorus aggravates more than inspire. This is a B-oh-oh-oh-oh-re even by Katy Perry standards.	-1
Was sort of looking forward to her new one, but a huge disappointment. Definitely not worth your money. Go elsewhere for a hit than this. Not to mention it greatly sounds like "Brave" by sara bareilles	-1
Katy Perry's "Roar" is nothing of a roar. It's more Simba's first attempt at roaring in "The Lion King" where he merely sounds like a child cat. Here are some of the main problems with this song...it is completely unoriginal, it one part it sounds like a complete rip off of the recent The Fray song you heard in the commercial for Bing...it rips lyrics directly from Queen's "We Are The Champions" and "Eye of The Tiger" by Survivor. To top that off the song is not sung well, Katy again proves she cannot sing on this track even with all the digital effects producers have added to try to hide this obvious fact. While it is leaps and bounds above the quality of her previous songs off her horrible album "Teenage Dream" it is not a good song overall. It is merely ok at best due to the fact that at least it is not filled with extremely immature sexual lyrics...the beat is ok but completely unoriginal and blends in with almost every other single song in the genre released currently. With so much better songs to listen to, i.e. this is easily something that should be passed on. It is a very mindless songs where the lyrics are not put together because the songwriters thought they sounded cool together instead of actually making sense... Just forgettable and nothing remarkable at all due to how uncreative the lyrics are and the fact of the poorly sung vocals on the track.	-1
When it has came down to what Katy Perry has tried to deliver after the smashing success of California Gurls, she hasn't actually deliver her best as a songstress, and instead delivered nothing more than a weak voice and style to match. Her personal life had shattered with her marriage to Russell Brand ending in divorce and strife, and she has a lot to regain in herself. Roar, the latest from Katy, and the lead single from her upcoming album Prism has a lot of her fans turning heads at her, for a sound too similar to the strong Sara Bareilles song Brave. Katy turns her version of the sampled song, and makes it weak from the ears and heart. While it might be a treat for die hard Katy Perry fans, it definitely isn't one of her better songs. I would definitely pass this one up.  Song: D-	-1

When it has came down to Lady Gaga, she has lost her crown in her music and her message from driven voice and innovation from her music. She had a lot to prove and she didn't find it with her recent music. Sadly, with her new music, it really has been more of a miss than a strike. Applause, the lead single from her third album Artpop is actually not one of her better songs. In fact, it felt definitely weaker than a lot of the tracks she did from her last album Born This Way, and I wasn't impressed with the bulk of the songs from that record either. I think for her and for her little monster fans, maybe Lady Gaga should take a break and find her voice again with her songs and than she'll find more for her fans to applause.  Song: D	-1
When it has came down to what Lady Gaga has had in music, it has honestly been more of a lukewarm than a driven reception. I was definitely not thrilled with the material so far she has laid out for the Artpop record. Her collaboration with R. Kelly on Do What U Want was really a weak and not strong spot in her works. So is the lead single from the album Applause. It definitely was one song that felt like a boom at first with so many of Gag's little monsters, but instead made itself become a bust in voice. The song doesn't ignite in the way Love Game and Born This Way did. Overall, I really didn't feel Lady Gaga gave it her all enough to make even more applause than she already has in her music. Is it worth checking out and downloading? Maybe, if there was more applause to it.  Song: D+	-1
The music is good but the lyrics are pretty cheesy and lame. Undead is a great song and there's a few alright ones here and there but this is nothing special regardless of the other 5 star reviews on here. 90% of the lryics are aobut them trying to get women and just cussing a lot pretending they are touch and cool, pretty sad. Check out the new Slipknot that's worthy of 5 stars	-1

Keyshia  Cole  vocally  has  gotten better and  that is saying something  because she is more of a  stylist than  a  actual pure singer.  problem with her is that it feels like a reality show character and  coming through her work, throughout her whole career and there is no  balance whatsoever.  the difference between her and Blige is  that Blige had better material and  balance. i don't hear any  creative growth with Cole's  music, however  vocally she has  gotten a little bit better, however a formula is established and she will be  around and probably like  Blige on a lighter scale, it will be the same ole song for years to come.	-1
Keyshia Cole has one of the best voices in R&B today. Unfortunately, the subject matter on this album is limited to juvenile love-drama, mainly orchestrated around break-ups, cheating, and circumspect relationships. Lyrically, she comes across far younger than her 31 years, relying far too much on slang and occasional vulgarity. It's hard to get past the first song, "Enough of No Love" where featured guest Lil' Wayne raps tastelessly with over-the-top curse words. I experienced a difficult time listening to the album once, with no interest in listening to it again. Hopefully, she will present a mature album her next time around.	-1
Hide your wallets so you can make her go away. gosh this is so replusive. not even worth 1 star. Not worth the hype folks move along.	-1
This album wasn't very good.	-1
I should have just downloaded the single "Roar" but I loved her other works and never thought that I would dislike every song but one.  Big waist of money.	-1
Seriously? What is this crap? People who seriously consider this music need to have their brain examined for poop smears on their medulla oblongata.	-1
The first and second songs are pretty good, but the rest are pretty mediocre.  My 8 year old daughter (who LOVES Katy Perry) even told me she thought this CD was boring (except for "Roar").  My advice, just buy "Roar" and not the whole album.	-1
Way better than Teenage Dream. This album is not just filled with sex with bad overly obvious sexual innuendos that weren't really even innuendos because of they obvious they were. This album even while not perfect is much more consistent maybe a little boring to some as many of the songs are slower paced but it definitely is much more tolerable than most of the tracks off Teenage Dream which was recently voted worst album of the decade by Billboard voters.	-1
alot of hype and  not much depth.  she got  a  chance to  have  a good greatest  hits package.problem  for her  is that  alot of material  seems to contrived and  leaves very little to the imagination. not all her fault.  she is  a marginal vocalist and she rides on cliche  grooves and familar sound cuts. this time  this album is flat.  she got her own lane until she runs out of a hit.	-1
Hide your wallets so you can make her go away. gosh this is so replusive. not even worth 1 star. Not worth the hype folks move along.	-1
Prism is much better than Teenage Dream. But the whole album is still NOT for children. There are several songs that are not for children the main one is "Birthday" DO NOT buy this or let your children listen to this! There are some songs that are okay for children but NOT the whole album and definietly NOT the song caleld "Birthday" so if you hear your children listening to this stop it immediately, also do not let them listen to Teenage Dream almost ANY song other than Firework is very sexually explicit! The title track Teenage Dream, California Dreams, ET, Peacock, Last Friday Night are ALL sexually explicit and NO children should listen to those, if you let your children listen to those you are a horrible parent.  Now as for this album there is at least WAY WAY less sexuality...the only major sexual song is Birthday and the lyrics in the other songs are much better, but the major problem with this one is another problem Teenage Dream album had is that it forces way too much high pitched vocals that don't sound good because there's just way too many high pitched vocals in that song...luckily not all songs like are like that...but even the more decent songs are just completely generic and suffer from poor vocals...they're just not AS bad as the others but still not worth listening to. A lot of these songs are clearly influenced by if not directly copying many other songs so the originality is not there, even Roar is highly similar to several other songs including Eye of The Tiger by Survivor, plus the song This Moment copies what made Trapped in The Closet by R. Kelly famous there is no way that similarity was done on accident. Lack of originalty and too many repetitive bad sounding high pitched vocals ruin the majority of the album. Some bad lyrics. Cannot recommend the album has a whole despite the album not being all bad there are some decent [VERY generic] tracks but still not really worth listening to because there is WAY better music out there. This album and the artist themselves is FAKE. This artist never would have had a hit song if it weren't for buying her own radio airtime [confirmed by radio stations] and buying Youtube views [also confirmed by Youtube and VEVO] what ultimately makes these songs just horrible is just the fact of how horrible of a person Katy Perry is. She is a lying, cheating, and backstabbing person who doesn't belong in the music industry. She never would have ever charted if she didn't cheat to chart.	-1
OK with this many songs (and many really really really bad songs here) where are Farmer's Daughter, Hushabye, Keep An Eye On Summer and especially (I can't believe they left it off) -- You're So Good To Me????????????? Are you kidding me??  Avoid at all costs!	-1
Tried something a little different than what I usually listen to; glad I did not pay for this song.  Not my favorite.	-1
Good download	-1
MILEY SUCKS!	-1
Is it just me or does this song = "Somebody I Used To Know" (Gotye)?  Derivative, auto-tuned to hell & irritating as usual. Another classic from Hannah Montana. thankfully, this one won't last long, either.	-1
Tongue stuck out ... check. Outfit with bits hanging out ... check.  Nude scene ... check. Two stars because if the song was sung by someone with even a tad of emotional range, this might be OK. As for it being a reflection of her life, well, no. She didn't write it. Mozella, Moccio, Skarbek, Dr. Luke and Cirkut did. A personal song written by 5 people, huh?  I love me some good pop, but this is not that. Rant over :-)	-1
When it has came down to what Miley Cyrus has been doing in music, it has been trying so hard to strip herself away from her Hannah Montana image. She failed to ignite it with her Can't Be Tamed album and the lagging songs from that record. Now, she has tried it again with the Bangerz album. Wrecking Ball, the second single from the album is actually one of her worst songs she had recorded. It feels more like a cry for her heart, and missteps her soul from her inner voice. I definitely found this song to not be a ballad, but for her it is her own revolution and not a very god taste in music. Well, Miley should find better than songs that make her sound like she is a wrecking ball.  Song: D+	-1
Miley Cyrus' train-wreck status, and atrocious other music, makes it hard embrace what, on its own merits, could be a solid song.  People may be critical of me not focusing only on the song but, in certain circumstances, you have to consider the bigger picture.  When Avril Lavigne released "When You're Gone", it was a relatively emotional, heartfelt song.  However, it came so soon after her bratty, and obnoxious, song "Girlfriend", that it negatively impacted how I felt towards the latter song.    Cyrus' run of horrid music ("We Can't Stop", "Party in the USA", and "The Climb"), and her ridiculous "I'm trying to shock you to show you how grown up I am" behavior, detracts from any positive vibe one could get from "Wrecking Ball".  It's possible that, somewhere down the road, Miley will grow out of this phase and focus more on trying to be a quality singer.  Until that time, I cannot view this song positively.	-1
Aint' nuttin original bout dis! Plus, anyone with musical taste knows it but I wonder about all the comments I see around saying "Mileys Song". she is just a good song writer......the song was written by:  Lukasz Gottwald  Maureen Anne McDonald  Stephan Moccio  Sacha Skarbek  Henry Russell Walter  Not Miley Cyrus......She is a processed, shat out product that "sings" what is put in front of her by her record company.....no talent here, just polished fake garbage like Justin Bieber and all that fake junk. Look it up before you praise someone for work they didn't do....But on the "glass half full" side...Her voice ain't all that bad and there are manufactured pop stars that annoy me a lot more than her...hence...the two star rating versus a one star rating. I do believe her forthcoming endeavor w. the Flaming Lips might actually end up being good music and may be indicative of artistic growth.	-1
I do not like this "musician" and certainly would never line her pockets with my hard eraned money.  Please reverse purchase	-1
song skips so I don't enjoy it	-1
Rehashing and regurgitating that is. He did it decades ago with Dire Straits then carried on through his solo works. From songs about people travelling to make their way (Telegraph Road, Privateering), to tough characters who brag about their lives (Money For Nothing, Heavy Fuel, Hot or What). And some poor folk who are down and out - these artists are stuck in a groove with their working class poor tales. Then he throws in some dull as hell bluesy songs which does nothing for his music or the genre. He alternates with sad songs using mandolin - a good way to trick people into thinking you've written a good song these days. His conversational songs now grate on me, as uninspired as the rest. Go take a nap, Knopf.	-1
I bought her last one the archandroid  I thought it was dope. Im always on guard for  artist that "go left" I feel like thats a excuse because if they did mainstream stuff they would be exposed for how wack they really are but with Janelle its different. I think she got a lot of talent I think this album has too many features and I don't know, shes got a lot popular so maybe she felt like dialing it in..it just doesnt resonate with me..	-1
When a new artist comes out with a song, she has to really drive into her first song. For Sevyn Streeter who sung back on Chris Brown's big hit She Ain't You, which worked very well for him, she has to have a song make it on her own and work brilliantly. Her debut single, It Won't Stop from her first record Call Me Crazy, But.. isn't actually a strong song from her voice alone. I really found it more drowned out from her, because Chris Brown's voice overpowers the song so much, that it feels more like her sonnets are robotic and not as strong. Does the strong work, well it would work more from her if she was going to bring more from her voice and heart. She might sound sensual in the beat, but Sevyn doesn't at all. Hopefully, with her net set of songs there will be better from her to match and beyond, than she could say It Won't Stop.  Song: D+	-1
When it has came down to new artists they have to really find their voices. Sevyn Streeter, whom sung back up for Chris Brown on his Michael Jackson sampled hit She Ain't You, has a lot to prove from her own spotlight. Sadly, for her debut single It Won't Stop, I found the song to not even ignite at all. It felt more like Chris Brown was taking over with the song a bit more than her rhythm. She really didn't bring out more from the voice to stand and drive her sensual rhythm. I think if she wants to thrive in it for the long run, she needs to find ore from her voice to say it won't stop. Because for her and from her, it just didn't feel like it stood from the song. Hopefully, if her debut record comes around, there will be more than just a second of heartbeats in song.  Song: D+	-1
I was unable to listen to this as a sample before I bought it.  However, since it said it was the radio version I purchased it anyway because I love the radio version.  I have NEVER heard this version on the radio and was NOT what I wanted.  It is faster than the version I have heard and love.  So, just a warning, if you are wanting the slow meaningful version, this is not it.	-1
no	-1
No, I am not buying this box set for what it is currently selling.  I don't need any bells and whistles.  I'm not 13 years old and I wasn't 13 when I saw The Clash for the first time in San Francisco (London Calling Tour @ The Warfield Theater, April 1980, IIRC).  So, do I care about the music or some decals, a poster and a couple of fanzines?  Take a guess!  So, essentially, if I want the 3 CDs of demos, 'rarities' and B-sides and the DVD, I am supposed to pay an additional $135 above for what I can get the remastered 5 studio albums?  I don't think so!  I don't need a 'cool box' and some miscellaneous crap that I will save until . . . . until I decide it's nothing but crap and throw it out.  Yes, I would love to hear the 3 CDs of unreleased song and watch the DVD, but I'm not willing to get ripped off because Mick Jones can use the extra money.  I might have been born at night, but I wasn't born last night!!  Go straight to hell Mick!  I'm buying the remastered studio albums and will use my savings of $135 on something that 'really matters'.  Oops!  I forgot to mention that you get really cool badges too. ;->	-1
This song stinks the malodorous reek of a wet fart	-1
Every since the "controversial" #1 Spot, its been hard to be excited for any new release. Big ups for V.Rose, this talented pop singer blends well with hip hop	-1
Once again Amazon Digital purchase has failed me.  The song cuts out in the middle, skips a few words and continues, totally sucks.  Please refund.	-1
When it has came down to Miley Cyrus, she doesn't even seem to ignite with pop music. Now, she is wasted her voice and ruined her heart in her songs. Wrecking Ball from her upcoming album Bangerz is definitely a wasted record. Fr her to team up with Mike Will Made It on the song 23, she does not even ignite into the song. In fact, she is someone that whimps out her voice and rap into the drive. I definitely could see if he wanted to hire someone more famous into the song like Britney Spears or Beyonce' Knowles. But having Miley into the song, actually turns the song into a waste of time. I really do not recommend downloading this song, not only because it is cheap. It sometimes shows that the right person can also make a song come alive. This 23 is definitely a bust.  Song: D	-1
I'm just gonna go right out and say it... Miley needs to stop. She's making a fool of herself every day now. She wants to sever ties from Disney, that's fine, but, Growing Up: You're doing it wrong. In a topic not related to Miley, I'm not a fan of this stop-start rapping technique that a lot of people like to use. To me, it's like playing with the pedals in a car, where you punch the gas then slam the brakes. Punch, slam, punch, slam, punch, slam...you get the idea. Like as if I were in a car, similarly, this technique makes me nautious and irritable. However, this is FAR from the worst steaming bag of fermented crap I've ever heard. That title goes to Lil' Wayne's "Mrs. Officer". Talk about blow-your-brains-out annoying.	-1
Will not buy any more MP3 since I can not download them.  Have not played the music, would like a refund it possiable, but I understand if that doesn't happen.	-1
This is such a wannabe club song!  It is way too repetitive, saying the chorus over, and over!  I expect more from a song that deems itself a dance song!	-1
I used to drive a school bus and would download music that the kids liked. This is unfortunately one of their favorites. Now that those days are over, I'm deleting it!	-1
First, Gangnam Style, then Thrift Shop, then Harlem Shake, and now this pile of crap. Seriously, this song sounds like a preschool-level picture-book with an audio CD for toddlers to play duck duck goose to. The lyrics will prove you that. Now that we know society has gotten worse than it already has been by this song: a nursery rhyme for babies and toddlers that is actually peaking high on the hot 100. This is ACTUALLY doing "successful"? I think this song should have gone in a filthy toilet with everything else in music I hate to the core.	-1
Free download..  kinda blah, but can't resist free...  lol	-1
A freebie from our friends at Amazon.  I always enjoy a good freebie, it is a great way to try things.	-1
just not my type of rendition.  Thought her voice was a little weak, but maybe other things she's done is better.	-1
Not what I thought it would be	-1
I personally do not think guitar music is for sleep and relaxing, although there was a couple flute tunes included	-1
This  SUCKS !! - Can't seem to download this to my cloud player terribly disapointed. Will not try again :(	-1
There is no question that Lorde has had one of the biggest anthems from the past year with the success of her song Royals. But after that, she honestly hasn't seemed to show that she has been a strong successful songstress in the way she had shown from the beginning. Her latest song Tennis Court, the third single from her debut album Pure Heroine actually lags a bit into the drive from the heart. I just felt that the song definitely showed not to be one of her better songs. It was good at first, but honestly not as strong as Royals. It is alright, but not anything really driven. I definitely felt that this song for Lorde showed to be more of a fault than a ace from the hole. Hopefully, when Lorde comes up with a follow-up album, there will be more than just a miss on a tennis court.  Song: D+	-1
I would like my money back	-1
HATE IT	-1
Just ok,not really my style. Some songs should not be messed with too much and think this one was overdone	-1
Good novelty version but not Symphony quality.	-1
the music sucks only got it because it was free	-1
I wouldn't have bought it.  Not bad. Not my favorite rendition of this song. Thanks for the free Christmas song, Amazon!	-1
Not my cup of tea...wasn't really wanting this just trying to find something else.	-1
Another lackluster track from Pitbull.  Can just one of his songs be different from all his other songs? I guess not.	-1
If the artist edited the song a bit, it might have worked, because refrain is catchy. But the arrangement is a bit too Broadway/ TV showish	-1

There is no question that Katy Perry has been so overexposed, that sadly the quality of her songs has shown that her voice has withered away. Her music has been more like a fashion of time, but honestly the songs that she has recently shown for her Prism album, have been less than stellar with her previous work. Her latest set of songs have not really had the knock-out punch she had with Teenage Dream. Her latest single, This Is How We Do, the fourth single from her Prism album, feels more like it is a retro throwback to the 80's in music. Sadly, I found the song to not only not deliver, but bring a sag out from Katy's voice. She might be a character to a younger generation, but she needs to find better from her voice than a song that loses her at heart. That is how you shouldn't do.  Song: D+	-1
There is no question that Katy Perry has had her share of good songs with her fans, but there are some songs that are not even worth the voice, and absolutely not worth the time. The songs from her record Prism have absolutely been weak from the voice and absolutely wasted from the heart. Her last song Birthday has been a very weak song, and shows that she cannot follow-up a great song with her fans like Roar, and lose her audience within a blink of a eye. This Is How We Do, the fourth single from her lackluster album Prism feels more like it is a trip back to an 80's style song that feels more like it is lost within its time and absolute heart. It really feels like it lacks momentum and heart from her voice, and feels just jaded within the times of today's music. I think Katy should re-think herself and find better from her heart and for her fans, and that should be how she should do it.  Song: D+	-1
Don't care if its your birthday or not. The song is awful. She needs to be banned from radio completely. Hide your wallets so you can make her go away.	-1
When it has came down to Katy Perry, she has really made some tacky and tasteless songs that haven't hit the nail on the head. Trying to follow-up California Gurls hasn't really been a big success. She did hit it with her fans on Roar, but several other songs haven't really been good. In fact they have been so awful, that she has run out of her vice and songs. Her last song Dark Horse was really terrible, and just showed that she was course at the heart of the matter. Birthday, the third single from her album Prism isn't really a strong song. It feels like Katy has run out of ideas and voice. I really didn't find the song to hit the nail on the head. Well, maybe she should take more time than rush herself and than she could bring out better birthdays to celebrate with her fans.  Song: D+	-1
When it has came down to Katy Perry, she really has made some terrible songs for the past several years. But trying to follow-up the success she has had with songs like Roar and California Gurls hasn't been a very strong feeling. Most of the songs she has came out with haven't been very strong, and felt very weak at the heart. Her last song Dark Horse with Juicy J was terrible, and not really a very good song. Her latest song, Birthday, the third single from her lagging Prism record tries to bring in the party-style anthem she hasn't been able to bring in with her voice work and heart. Sadly, the song feels like it has been what she has done before, old and washed up. Katy Perry needs to find better in her voice and at heart, and then she could feel like we're celebrating more birthdays, loving her music.  Song: D+	-1

She just tries to hard to sound like whatever crap is getting played on the radio. She's going for some dance-oriented club friendly pop sound but there's just nothing original about it. The same can be said for any given KP tune. I'd rather stick my dog's turd in a vaporizer and smoke it!	-1
When it has came down to Katy Perry, and the music she has put out, she just doesn't ignite into what she had brought out when she ha started with I Kissed A Girl a few years ago, and sadly the quality of her voice and music has died. The songs she had put out as single from the lackluster Prism do not ignite into what she had before like California Gurls and Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.). Dark Horse, the latest single from the lackluster Prism album firmly does not ignite at all. In fact the song that she did with Juicy J does not even impress. Her voice feels more robotic and dormid into the song, where there is little to nothing to hear from her. I think Katy needs to go back to square one in her songs, and not be a loose cannon or a dark horse. Maybe than, she'll find better in her songs.  Song: D	-1
When it has came down to Katy Perry, the quality of her music and her voice has absolutely died in cheap theatrics and lacking real talent. Her songs just haven't been able to hit the nail on the head in the eye and ears have shown in regards to tracks like I Kissed A Girl and Roar have shown. But not everything is really worth the money, and absolutely not even worth the time resolved from her marriage with Russell Brand. Dark Horse, the latest single from her album Prism is absolutely not a really driven song from her voice. Trying to be more of a street kind of sound, has weakened her talent in her voice. She and Juicy J not only do not have any chemistry, but the rhythm just isn't the best of Katy Perry in voice. Perhaps she needs to grow up, and find more from her own dark horse.  Song: D	-1

I'm not sure how this collaboration happened but the results are well...less than satisfying. I like pop music as much as anyone else and i LOVE hip-hop but this sounds forced, like a pop star experimenting with urban sounds to show that she can be edgy and cool. Definitely liked Unconditionally better.	-1
I usually love all of her songs. I just can't understand what happened to her fun, energetic, & carefree style.	-1
Unnecessary rap segments...The rapping in this song seems so forced I have no idea why it was put in there aside from just following the trend of pop stars featuring rappers in them.	-1
When it has came down to what Katy Perry has done in music, it hasn't actually been the best for both worlds. For her hard core fans, and for those new to her music. For her to follow up her Teenage Dream record with the release of Prism, it has been easier said than workable. So far there hasn't been that strong strike to find a voice to call her own. I wasn't actually thrilled with the release of her song Roar, which sampled Sara Bareilles' brilliant song Brave. Her latest song from the Prism record also doesn't actually feel like it is anything better. Unconditionally, the second single from her Prism record is actually not worth listening to. It felt scattered and not anything that broke into a better ballad in her voice. Maybe, she should find something more to say that she loves unconditionally.  Song: D	-1
Such a poor song with bad vocals and bad lyrics. Sounds the same as anything else nothing new here. Wish there was something good but here there isn't.	-1
When it has came down to Katy Perry, she has not really hit the nail on the head in her voice and original rhythms as well. Her song Roar which she stole the rhythm and sampled Sara Bareilles' song Brave which was more down to Earth and intimate from the voice alone. For Katy, trying to make something original is like trying to find a new voice, which should work and it hasn't. Unconditionally, the second single from her latest album Prism is actually a very poor ballad. She really doesn't ignite from her voice and the feel of the lyrics isn't really the strength at best either. It really was a poor;y recorded and delivered song. I think if Katy Perry is going to have better in her career, she should try and make a song that feel ore unconditional with love.  Song: D-	-1
Disappointed this is the next single since it's not as good as Running on Heaven and also personally Black Stead are much better songs off the album! This is not gord!	-1
So where are Tell Me, Mother's Little Helper, Dandelion, 2000 Light Years From Home, Play With Fire???????  With 50 songs to choose from cannot fathom how they could miss these classics?!?!  Especially when they have selections like We Love You and Little Red Rooster?????  Are you kidding me?????  Who is the idiotic fool who put this mess together???  Ridiculous!!!	-1
More Christmas Music?  Why would I order Christmas music oin February?  Please reverse this "purchase".  It gives me a bad taste in my mouth about my new Amazon Kindle.  I am beginning to be afraid to use it.	-1
Not as good as I thought it would be it was much better in the movie!!! If I had it to do all over again I would buy another version of it or just spotify one!!!	-1
Good	-1
Sounds kinda like a theme for "Shaft."  The artist's voice is obviously appealing and witty.  I can't tell if he is tenor.  Sounds like one of the soundtracks for "Shaft."  The title of this tune also fits "Shaft" themes.	-1
watched her on PBS, had to turn the channel. Stop shaking your head.	-1
I love the cd, but the clarity is terrible. I can't really make out all the sounds on each song. I have all of her cd's and they all sound great, but this one sound like it being played on a cassette player. She need to remaster and reissue and then it will be great!!!	-1
Too much background organ noise.	-1
To quote Avril Lavigne's response in regards to racism allegations..."LOLOLOL!!!" This song is a frickin' joke. Her career is long over. Go away already.	-1
Not relaxing	-1
It's a bargain, but obscure pieces, and even some mono recordings.  If you like music, pay a bit more for classier classics.	-1
If you really want to increase your brain power, you'd listen to the complete works rather than the sliced-and-diced snippets provided here. Give yourself and the composers some respect.	-1
There are two aspects of this download that keep me from recommending it.  First would be the random order of the various tracks. They jump all over the place, with an aria from one work, a few tracks from another, etc. It might not be bothersome if you're new to classical music, but it seems awfully disjointed if you're a more-than-average fan of classical music.  Second - and most egregious - is the recording of the "Messiah" that makes up the majority of tracks in this download. This is simply one of the limpest, most-lifeless, bordering-on-amateur recordings I have ever had the displeasure of hearing, and that hearing covers just shy of 50 years worth of listening to classical music.  The very first downbeat to the opening Sinfonia is a train wreck, with instruments sneaking in at different times. The orchestra is OK once it gets going, but it's a rather monochromatic sound. The chorus is the worst kind of neutered, wimpy singing that gets featured in the very worst of HIP performances and recordings.  But the real problem with this recording lies with the vocal soloists, whose singing doesn't rise to the level of accomplishment one can often encounter at high school variety shows. The singing barrels over into embarrassing when the soloists attempt to get artsy and ornament their singing, hilariously so in the bass recitative "Thus saith the Lord," where our musically challenged soloist decides to add a shake to his voice every time he sings the word "shake." Are you kidding me? Hey, why not also spit every time you sing the word "sea" and fake a dry voice when singing the words "dry land?" This is amateur hour writ large.  Good points? The recorded sound is excellent! But what good is that when the recordings themselves can't be taken seriously?  Avoid this.  BTW - if you're looking for a really good recording of "Messiah" as an under-$10 download, then look no further than Johannes Somary's Vanguard recording of the piece. It's currently available as part of three different Vanguard "Big Box" downloads - Big Box Handel (ASIN: B00BK3LPFU), the Big Handel Oratorio Box and Big Box Christmas (ASIN: B00A2KV7XW). That "Messiah" recording has it all - great soloists and chorus, a very good orchestra and an interpretation that is - for lack of a better term - mainstream, yet unique and engaging, and good analogue sound.	-1
How many times this sissy wanna be G. is going  to rap about shooting and f... his alcoholic mother and ho girlfriends and police officers and his doctors and glorify violence and drug use. Sounds like a regurgitating Castrated goat.	-1
Wow...time hasn't been great for the 'of Shadester....I bought this album not only because it was $5.99 but also the critics said it reminded them of Em's earlier albums.  I don't know what they were thinking because this album is garbage.  The only song that's good is the one with Rihanna and that's the last track.  Eminem's earlier albums had lyrical structure, humor, and most importantly, beats by Dre.  This album doesn't have any of that and it's sad because I WANTED to hear that in this album and it failed to deliver.	-1

I bought the first one of David Miller's 'Best of Meditation", liked it and decided on this one which is almost exactly like the first one with the same music. So I feel like he tricked me into buying the same thing twice.	-1

There are so many cases where cover songs can be worth their effort. But often, when it is done for films, it can be a bigger bomb. The biggest exception where it is brilliant and beautiful is Whitney Houston's I Will Always Love You from The Bodyguard. With so much hype for The Hunger Games, Lorde tried true to make a cover song to call her own. But sadly, this is a time where a cover is more than a absolute waste of time. Lorde's cover of the classic Tears For Fears song Everybody Wants To Rule The World is absolutely terrible. I found the song to be a disgrace from the mood of the classic that is more distinctive from the 80's. I do not recommend this, even if you are a fan of The Hunger Games. This was definitely a bad song to download, and Lorde really needs a makeover with her voice!!  Song: F	-1
I got it for free. At 1st I didn't really like it. I like Black Veil Brides and The Fray. It's just not my kind of music. Now I like this song though. I had to hear it a couple of times before it hit home.	-1
CRAP CRAPCRAP double crap.... crap on a bun crap to slap.... don't buy it in my opinion.  UGLY UGLY.UGLY. Extremely UGLY.	-1
Decent tune but a little overplayed on the radio.  This song worked well for a friend's playlist so I had to grab it.	-1
The song performance is cute, but the song is very short, and the last seconds are an ad for more music. The ad ruins the song and makes it undesirable for my grandchildren. I deleted it because of the ad.	-1
Crap	-1
It's alright	-1
my friend was just trying to find random free songs. I don't even know why she downloaded this one. I was pretty confused.	-1
For one thing, I have to give Kesha credit for daring to try some songs without the use of autotune on this album in contrast to Animal. That might not be a bad thing, if she didn't sound even WORSE without it than with it. This proves that her ability as a singer is very limited at best, as is the case with all the other mainstream sound-alikes we have being produced just to make money off the masses. I will not blindly blame Kesha for 100% of this typical, generic-sounding, cookie-cutter dung heap; The majority of the blame goes to that loser known as Dr. Luke, who produces a handful of the other mainstream sound-alike puppets. He is a control freak beyond further investigation, and he never lets anyone whose records he produces have much of a say, if any at all.  Also, I know people might try to defend this atrocity by saying that it was meant to be funny and that I "have no sense of humor," but when it gets to the point of becoming downright dirty and sexually explicit... that is when I no longer see the humor. If anything, it just makes me want to puke. Call me a prude all you want, but anything as sexually explicit as some of the lyrics on this album is an automatic turn-off for me. Sexual innuendo can be done tastefully, such as in the case of Depeche Mode, i.e. "Let my body do the moving / Let my hands do the soothing...." that is as far as it goes. Also, if I want some humor in music once in a while, Devo takes care of that just fine, thank you. At least their humorous elements, with a few exceptions, are actually CLEAN. The same can hardly be said about this album, I hate to say. It just goes to show the standards of what is deemed "acceptable" in today's society, as sad as it is.	-1
Look, as a member of the LGBT community, I appreciate the message and sentiment behind Same Love. But real talk - that was one of the most bland civil rights anthems I've ever heard. And now vocalist Mary Lambert is trying to venture solo with a redux of that dud?  Sorry honey, but if you really wanna make it in the cutthroat pop world, you gotta make yourself stand out. You don't wanna be known as "that chick was sang the chorus of Same Love" and this debut single ain't helping matters. Good voice, boring song.	-1
When it has came down to it, when a collaboration has became a trio, the feeling doesn't shine as brilliantly as you would hope for. That honestly is the case with Run This Town from Jay-Z, Rihanna and Kanye West. The latest single from Jay-Z's upcoming album The Blueprint 3. The song is dark, but honestly I don't feel the chemistry as much with Kanye West in the song, as much as we've heard the collaboration between Jay-Z & Rihanna. This also is her first single since the domestic violence spat with the controversial Chris Brown back in February. I give her some credit for stepping out again, but she needs to bring more into her songs to match the mood. Hopefully, for Jay-Z, when his album comes out, he can dominate the #1 spot again, and have a better arrangement of songs.  Song: D	-1
Why does this fool expect anyone to be loyal to him? His track record pretty much invalidates any right to such presumptive claims. Seriously though, talk about a double standard...women who aren't loyal to him are called "ho's"; yet I'm sure he's done his fair share of sleeping around. Or has he forgotten about his longtime GF karreuche tran? LOL	-1
I did not request or order this song, I do not know how it appear in my account but I was glad when given the opportunity to rate it.  What you hear over and over will eventually pentrate your heart and what is in your heart will fuel your behavior, actions and speech. Look at the condition of the world today and the music that is being made. You have the power to guard your heart.	-1
I stupidly only listened to the sample of this song before purchasing it.  It is boring, repetitious and I immediately deleted it from my devices and cloud.  A complete waste of money.	-1
I see Lil Jon hasn't changed a bit. Still shouting in that raspy voice of his. Guess what buddy? It ain't 2004 anymore. Crunk is dead.	-1

Honestly, having been forced to hear this a number of times, my best friend and I thought it best to go somewhere where we were sure we we not going to hear it. We went to our favorite retro-style, dive bar where a lot of classic rock enthusiasts, metalheads (of which I am one), and even hipsters like to hang out and have a few casual drinks, and also where tracks (not songs) like this atrocity are highly condemned. Not only that, but there was a dance-floor oriented, rave-type bar right next store, so there was NO EXCUSE for a few certain people who came in and decided they were going to ruin it for everyone by playing this vile piece of trash on the jukebox.  My goodness, why do people actually like this vile, disgusting, putrid, non-artistic trash? It is complete, over-the-top noise pollution enjoyed only by classless people who like to "get down and dirty" after getting wasted out of their minds. It turns guys into pigs and girls into sluts, and that is a fact! This kind of garbage is what is destroying society, no questions asked. There is not one shred of musical worth in this 3 1/2 minute piece of steaming, vile disgusting, gross and despicable abomination of a "song" whatsoever. If giving this track NEGATIVE 1,000,000 stars was an option, I'd slap it with that in a heartbeat.  Also, people have actually played stuff like Tupac, Beastie Boys, Big L, B.I.G. and Run DMC at this same bar, and I never minded that at all, so I am by no means biased against hip hop as a whole, despite not being a fan.	-1

When it has came down to Beyonce' Knowles, she has been a product as a singer, and not really a human singer. Sincerely, and sadly the quality of her songs have absolutely been awful. The surprise album she pulled out last year has had some really bad songs from Partition to Pretty Hurts. But her latest song is definitely one of biggest low points, trying to be a edgy hip hop artist, and instead throws it all away. Flawless, the latest single from her lackluster self-titled record is really a pathetic song. She doesn't actually deliver from each and every note. Not only is the chemistry she and Chimamanda awful, it sadly is just as poorly overplayed as her work with her husband Jay-Z on Drunk In Love. I think Beyonce' should re-consider finding her own voice again, and stop rushing records that make her weak from the heart, and more flawed in the soul.  Song: D	-1
When it has came down to Beyonce' Knowles right now, her life has been in peril. Her self-titles surprise album has been more of a waste of time in the ears, and absolutely her heart. Sadly, the end of her marriage with Jay-Z has shown in her music and wasted On The Run tour. Now with the two of them coming to a close as husband and wife, Beyonce' has picked the wasted Flawless as her latest single from the lackluster self-titled record. She really doesn't the credit of being hard core into the rap and hip hop game.  Her rapping is just as poor as is the case when she did Drunk In Love with her soon to be ex-husband. I think the next record she does, she could be smarter in voice, and feel flawless from the heart. This song though has been a waste of time and real heart.  Song: D	-1
When it has came down to what Beyonce' has done musically is out of the box release a album with a surprise ordeal of hype. But sadly, the weight of her making a musical leap hasn't actually been the biggest ordeal in music. Her last album 4 was absolutely one of the worst records that she did in her career. But so far, the songs she has came out on her self-titled release Beyonce' doesn't actually feel like anything that really strikes the soul of the voice. XO, the second single from Beyonce' Knowles record doesn't actually bring in the hype in her music, the way she did with her earlier work and her Destiny's Child appeal either. Instead, the song tries and wants to bring her voice into something that Coldplay had done years ago with their melodic and intimate sound. I really didn't find the song worth listening too, and doesn't match what she did as well-played. This XO, is knocked out.  Song: D+	-1
When it has came down to Beyonce' Knowles, and the surprise she has made for releasing a surprise album, she sadly has made the wrong choices in making great music from her heart, and instead releasing music songs that have not been as strong as they could've made before. Blow, from Beyonce' Knowles self-titled record actually starts slow, and instead feels much weaker in voice and heart. She instead tries to be a bit more sensual and instead it blows up from her face badly. It is not what she had with Diva or the wasted Countdown from her 4 record or Check On It. It instead feels like she is singing something she had made before from her music. I think instead Beyonce' Knowles needs to grow up and find better from her voice, so it doesn't feel like she has blown it.  Song: D+	-1
There is honestly so much that can be said about Beyonce' Knowles and the severe overexposure she has had in her music the past decade. Honestly, when it has came down to it, she has been more of a product than a actual diva at the heart. Somberly, the ballads she has had has been nearly 100% corny, rather than striking the nail on the head. at the voice. Unfortunately, the ballads she has came out with have been poor, but one in a few have been good, but not going as strong from the soul. So when it came down to her pulling a surprise record out for her fans, most of the songs have been more like a waste of time than really worth the effort. XO is one of those songs that really doesn't ignite as a ballad. She really didn't strike the way she tried to do when she covered Etta James' classic standard, At Last. The song really was not strong for her as a ballad, rather than weak from the soul. I think Beyonce' Knowles shouldn't pull rabbits out of her hat, that would not multiply from the heart, rather than leaving raw carrots to the side.  Song: D	-1
When it honestly has came down to singers of today, they have sincerely lost their appeal from the heart. Sadly, some artists have honestly have been so oversaturated, the appeal of the songs have stopped coming from the heart. Beyonce' Knowles has honestly been the most overexposed artist out there for the past several years, and sadly her voice in her songs have really stopped coming from the heart. When she had came out with a surprise album out, many people have wanted to hear something really exciting. But many have also wanted to hear her come out with something that was worth its money. Sadly, the songs have not really been worth the effort. XO is absolutely one of those examples. The ballad doesn't ignite in the soul of the heart, the way she would've wanted. I also didn't find the song to deliver, it just really wasn't worth the heart. It might be good for die hard fans, but it wasn't love in the heart.  Song: D	-1
It is absolutely so sad that whenever someone talented becomes more like a manufactured product, that the voice slowly withers away and died. Unfortunately, Beyonce' Knowles is one of those singers who is a manufactured product. The quality of her songs have been more like a disgrace, than a symbol of talent. She honestly has not found better for her own work. When she made waves by pulling out a surprise album, it might have been good for some, but honestly the result was a complete waste of time, and a waste of her own voice. Partition is one of those songs that has been sincerely annoying. She really didn't bring a lot of drive into the song, just weakened her own heart. I really found this song to be a complete waste of time. Beyonce' does not have any chemistry to play seduction onto Jay-Z, she just makes the listener say, " Why Do I Even Bother With Her?" Overall, if you a new fan of Beyonce's music, go back to her early work with Crazy In Love, because her best in not even here.  Song: D	-1
It is absolutely awful whenever someone talented has became more of a product than a strong singer. Beyonce' Knowles pulling a surprise record to the music industry, well has had a lot of wasted songs that hasn't delivered from the soul of the heart. In fact most of them  have shown to be more Rap and Hip Hop based than soul based. Her songs from her self-titled fifth record have been more like a drive down from the songs she could've made. Partition from the album has honestly bee one of the weaker songs from the album. She didn't really give it her all in a song trying to be more sexy to her man on the outside, than being a trophy overall. I just didn't find the song to absolutely impress. In fact, I found it to be weaker from the heart than what was from her work before. Maybe when her next album comes out, she needs to have stronger from her work than the wasted songs from this record.  Song: D	-1
"He popped all my buttons, and he ripped my blouse/He Monica Lewinsky-ed all on my gown"- very feral, primal lyrics. Again, this type of music is to attract the lowest common denominator. To attract the brainless masses who blindly idolize oblivious to the fact that the emperor has no clothes (or, shall we say The B!tch has no real talent) Get a grip, mindless Beyonce zombies, smell the coffee! Can't you smell a turd from a mile away? when it took seven people to write the song and six producers. If that doesn't bear the pungent stench of doo, then what?

There is honestly a difference between being a singer, and being a manufactured product where the voice of the songstress slowly passes away, and the intimacy does not come from the heart. Tragically, Beyonce' Knowles is one of those singers who has been more of a product, than a actual artists that can move you. When it has came out to releasing a surprise album, it has been more like a joke than anyone who has a real sentiment for their voice. The songs that she has came out with, sound overall more pathetic than show a real sense of her voice. Her collaboration with Jay-Z also shows that she and him have no more chemistry in what they have done together. Drunk In Love, sounds more like drugged together in love. Beyonce' and Jay-Z do not ignite, no matter how much the song. They have done so many collaborations like Deja Vu and Crazy In Love, that they do not connect in music and song. It is honestly time for Beyonce' Knowles to just retire, and go away. This song is definitely not worth it, and Beyonce' is more drugged than talented.  Song: D-	-1
There is honestly a difference between a singer who makes people listen from the heart, and a singer that is more like a manufactured product than a real singer. Unfortunately, Beyonce' Knowles happens to be more of a product than a real singer. Sadly, the feeling of her songs have been severely overplayed, to where it has made people stop enjoying her music. Her work is not really enjoyable anymore, that all the stunts she has had at pulling a surprise album up her sleeve to the populace, to where it is not even enjoyable anymore. Also, her work has been so overplayed that anything that she and Jay-Z has recorded for the past several years, to where it is more of a joke than a real singer. Her collaboration with Jay-Z, Drunk In Love does not even ignite from the heart. Honestly, the song is so severely overplayed to where my ear started to bleed in public. I really found this song to be more of a problem than anything that strikes from the heart. Also, the chemistry she and her husband has shown in the song is so poor that I don't even know if they should work together. They had better songs like Crazy In Love, but this song is really the pits. If you are new to Beyonce', I would say pass this song up.  Song: D+	-1
It is sincerely so sad that when a artist has been so overexposed, that the quality of their voice has slowly and surely passed away. Beyonce' Knowles has been severely so oversaturated, that the quality of her own work has been severely annoying than really enjoyable. When she had pulled out a surprise record, many people were more interested in the product than took a strong listen to the person behind it. For her collaborations with her husband Jay-Z, they have became too much of the same thing where they have been more like lackluster chemistry than really striking while the voices could be hot. Drunk In Love which was the lead single from her self-titled surprise record, has really been more of a drag out of the numerous songs they have done together like Crazy In Love and Deja Vu. I really didn't find the song to be a good match for the two of them. I found this song to be more annoying than drive it all the way home. Perhaps Beyonce' should take more patience into her music, than rush it out and pull surprises for her voice.  Song: D	-1
The vocals are pretty pedestrian as are the lyrics. Can't understand this chicks popularity. I like the drum and bass type arrangement & Jay z's rap is ok	-1
Ummmm Amazon this isn't Partition this is the song Yonce. Don't know who needs to be contacted but this isn't even the correct song!  Revision 3.28.14.  Research it a bit found out on the LP version Yonce is featured first then Partition comes along afterward. Sorry Amazon thought y'all made a mistake. Beyonc you need to release Partition as a single!	-1
When it has came down to what Beyonce' Knowles, she has been more of a product, than a real singer. The lackluster surprise of her coming out with a 5th album without a release date, unannounced, feels more like she is trying to be too much like what Michael Jackson did, and the quality of his music died like the way he died in 2009. Partition, the latest song from Beyonce's self-titled record tries to deliver a raunchy sound, and sadly the heart of her voice has died, like she has lost in herself. I really and definitely found this song to be even worse than the songs she had done before that had delivered the same kind of sound, like Naughty Girl, Diva, and Baby Boy. If you are new to her music, I would definitely say no this song, and go to Naughty Girl from Dangerously In Love, because this song is absolutely a waste on a good talent.  Song: D-	-1
When it has came down to Beyonce' Knowles, she is the most annoying and overconsumed artist of the past decade, and sadly the heart of her voice, has died and she has died in voice and music. Quality of the heart has put in place for quantity, where the songs don't actually deliver from her. Partition tries to show that Beyonce' can be as raunchy and oversensual in voice as she was when she came out with Naughty Girl over a decade ago. Yet, for someone who became a new mother a few years ago, maybe she needs to stop showing poorness in her voice, and show motherhood that should have blossomed her soul in her songs better. I really didn't like the song because it didn't drive. Absolutely not even a download for new Beyonce' Knowles fans, go for Naughty Girl instead from 2003.  Song: D-	-1
When it has came down to Beyonce' Knowles, she has been the most overexposed artist of the past decade, and sadly the quality of her voice has died in each and every note she has sung. For her music, she really has lost the drive in her newer music. When she made word late last year that she had a surprise record, sadly for her the word was not even close to the hype in her music. That has even showed with the numerous collaborations she had done with her husband Jay-Z. Their latest collaboration Drunk In Love does not come close to igniting. It sounds more like she is trying to be in Hip Hop, than a songstress. Sadly, the chemistry she and Jay-Z have in song has died and in fact sounds worse than any of the earlier songs she and Jay-Z had done before like Deja Vu and Crazy In Love. I think the next time she pulls a rabbit out of the hat like that, it should feel more timid and loveable than lagging like a wild hare. She really has lost it, and sadly doing work with her husband feels more like a snore than being drunk in love.  Song: D+	-1
Beyonce' had her day in the sun...now she, Jay-Z, and Kanye should just take their money and get out of the business. All their recent music pales in comparison to their releases from years gone by...boring, unimaginative and lame like her last album. Stick it!	-1
When it has came down to Beyonce' Knowles, and the hype around her music, it has been more of a disgrace than a strength in her voice. She has became so much of a product, that sadly the quality of her voice has died. That has shown on the tracks with her self-titled record and the lagging voice she has shown in songs. Her latest single Mine, the collaboration she has done with Drake doesn't actually deliver in voice and heart. Unfortunately for her work with Drake doesn't actually deliver in a soulful voice, and feels something more like she has tried to deliver an rhythm that make her completely sounds like a Alicia Key's song. I think Beyonce' Knowles definitely lost her voice for awhile, and she definitely needs to take a break and find her voice all over again, because it isn't hers anymore.  Song: D	-1
When it has came down to Lady Gaga and her talent, she actually didn't deliver in regards to the music from her Artpop record. Instead, the songs have been a big boatload of jiggles that haven't really hit the nail on the head at all. She had a lot to prove after the smash of Born This Way and that didn't happen at all. She showed that failure with Applause and Do What U Want with R. Kelly on the album, and she had decided to release another version of that song with Christina Aguilera, and sadly it misses the mark as well. The two of them not only do not have enough chemistry, but fail to ignite voice and soul altogether. I think that Lady Gaga needs a real reality check for the next set of songs she releases. This did not do what it wanted to do already, so why re-release it.  Song: D+	-1

When it has came down to Shakira, she has been a better judge lately on The Voice than a strong singer. While she has had some great songs to begin with like Underneath Your Clothes and Hips Don't Lie, but lately her songs just haven't really hit the nail on the head not for her, but with the people she has recorded with that have been more wasted in voice and heart. Her collaboration with the overexposed Rihanna on Can't Remember To Forget You. the lead single from her self-titled record isn't actually a strong cup of tea from the two of them. In fact, Rihanna throws the song away, not just in heart, but in voice as well. I actually found this collaboration to be worse than even when Shakira collaborated with Beyonce' on Beautiful Liar nearly a decade ago. Perhaps Shakira could find better to not forget when her next collaboration comes out down the road.  Song: D	-1
When it has came down to cover songs, nearly all the time they have been cheaper than how dynamic the original was to start with. For Kelly Sweet, who did a brilliant rendition of Aerosmith's Dream On a few years ago that worked well, it definitely has been a surprise, but for continuing that with others it just doesn't work as well. It works poorly like Mariah Carey trying to do another rendition of a Def Leppard song as if they were trash. Kelly's cover of Phil Collins' massive staple In The Air Tonight doesn't feel like it actually has the stamina. In fact, the cover feels whitewashed and made cheaper in voice and absolute harmony of the soul. I really was not impressed with the song, and for Kelly, trying to be something she is not is just very poor. The song choice and song matter, but for Kelly, she should do better to keep something in the air tonight.  Song: D+	-1

One of the only things getting played on mainstream radio these days in South Florida that i can really appreciate is Bachata. Romeo is one of the top players in the Bachata game. Drake's "rap" in the song couldve been written by a 2 year old. Very un original rhyming knee-growz!	-1

First of all, you can barely make out most of what they are saying.  The production values are terrible.  I could have done a better job with a 1980's 3 channel analog mixer in a garage with no sound buffering lining.  In fact, I'm pretty sure they recorded it on a 10-year-old webcam and mic set-up using sound-mixing emulation software that they obtained in a cracked version.  Secondly, the message is stupid.  They don't really have anything worthwhile to say, and I regret wasting the time giving them a chance to change my mind.  Everything about this band, about this album, was a waste of time.  This is why they needed to put a photo of a blond with suggestive body tape on the cover.  There's no way the music was going to sell this album!	-1
Got this for free, and have never heard of the band or song title, so have not even listened to it yet. Thanks:)	-1

Maybe you need to be high to like this one.  I don't get it.  As a DJ,  I figure the kids will request it though.  They haven't yet.  Maybe they have better taste than I thought.

Look, I like Ingrid Michaelson but honestly this is more of the same. She seems to be unable to write lyrically thoughtful songs. All are her songs are rather juvenile and asinine pop ditties (The Way I Am, Be Ok, Maybe). I was really hoping to see some artistic growth but I'm sad to say this ain't it. "Girls chase boys chase girls." Really?!	-1
They're still at it? LOL. I haven't even heard of the Fray since my middle school days nearly 10 years ago, when everyone thought that "how to save a life" song was the s*** because it was oh so cool to be emo. Sad to see they haven't grown musically along with their fans.	-1

Once upon a time there was a director who, along with some friends - a writer, a cameraman, some actors - made a movie. It doesn't matter what the movie was about. It could have been about aliens, or cowboys and indians, or a young couple suffering through a rocky relationship, or a bank robbery gone wrong. Whatever it was about, the director wanted to make the best movie he could make, and for the audience who saw that movie to care about the characters, and to empathize with the emotions they felt. At some point, he approached a composer, in order to give that film a musical voice. The composer - who was well-versed in musical theory and composition - was as much of a storyteller as the director was, and wanted to enhance the film with his music; to bring out subtle emotions so the audience could feel them, to highlight subtexts that acting alone could not convey, to make it a better film than it would be without the music being there.  The director and composer decided what sort of music was needed, and how much, and then the composer went away and wrote: he wrote music which was specific to that film, tailored to those scenes, and those characters. His score gave the film an identity, with an overarching structure, recurring thematic ideas and musical reference points that drew characters, concepts and locations together, so that they felt like a part of the fully realized world the movie inhabited. He poured all his knowledge and craft into the score, making it interesting and compelling from a musical point of view, while simultaneously serving the drama on-screen. He made the action more exciting. The made the horror scarier. He made the relationships more romantic. He made the tension so tense you would bite your fingernails to the quick. Of course, the composer would have a musical style of his own, and once in a while a certain way of phrasing an instrument, or the way a chord progressed, would relate back to something else that same composer wrote before, but that's inevitable when a composer writes as much personal music as a film composer does, and would not detract much from the new work. The composer then recorded that score, using the finest musicians he could find, bringing all that talent and experience to bear on the music. The resulting work was a perfect marriage of pictures and sound, with music that was memorable, musically compelling, interesting and complex, dramatically appropriate, emotionally powerful, and crafted solely to serve that film and no other. This approach was so successful that everyone decided that this should henceforth be the way films should be scored, and everyone lived happily ever after. The end.  Except that it's not the end, because brothers Anthony Russo and Joe Russo decided that, when it came to their film Captain America: The Winter Soldier, they would ignore all of that and ask composer Henry Jackman to write one of the most grating, themeless, emotionally barren scores I have had the misfortune of hearing in several years. The words "clichd" and "generic" could have been invented specifically for this score, which takes all the worst aspects of modern film scoring and amplifies them a hundred fold, reveling in their lack of coherent musical ideas, individual identities, and musical inventiveness. In these circumstances I would usually break out my `polar bear with a migraine' photo and leave it to speak for itself, but my friend and colleague James Southall's excellent review of this score made me want to make some points of my own.  The film itself is apparently very good; more of a political thriller than a super-hero movie, it picks up Captain America's story two years after the events of The Avengers. Now living in Washington DC and struggling to adjust to life in the 21st century, the Captain himself Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) finds himself thrust back into action when a SHIELD operative is attacked by a mysterious assassin known as the Winter Soldier, whose exploits date back to the cold war. Teaming up with fellow super-heroes Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Falcon (Anthony Mackie), Captain America must uncover the mystery surrounding the Winter Soldier's identity, and stop the threat he poses to the world. The film has a fantastic supporting cast, including Robert Redford, Sebastian Stan, Frank Grillo, Emily Van Camp, and Marvel Universe regulars Samuel L. Jackson, Colbie Smulders and Dominic Cooper, and looks set to be one of 2014's most successful films.  In musical terms, however, Captain America: The Winter Soldier is an absolute disaster. The Marvel Universe films have always been a bit hit or miss when it comes to their scores, with little to no musical continuity between them, and a revolving roster of composers ranging from Ramin Djawadi to Patrick Doyle to Brian Tyler. Alan Silvestri's score for the first Captain America film was excellent, filled with all the things I talk about in my opening paragraphs, and - best of all - containing a rousing, memorable theme for Captain America himself. Sadly, Winter Soldier's composer Henry Jackman ignores everything Silvestri did, instead composing a more `modern' score which emphasizes sound design and electronic textures over anything resembling actual music. I hate writing paragraphs like this, because historically I have liked Henry Jackman's work a great deal. It's astonishing to me that a composer who can craft such wonderful scores as Gulliver's Travels, Puss in Boots or Wreck-It Ralph could turn around and write something as obnoxious as this.  There is a new theme for Captain America - a bit of martial heroism for brass and snare drums introduced in "Project Insight" - although why Jackman decided not to use Silvestri's established theme for the character is beyond me, especially when Brian Tyler even quoted it in Thor 2. There's a bit of warm Americana which appears in the brief "The Smithsonian". And that's about it, in terms of positive things I can say about this score. Probably the worst aspect of Jackman's score is that, for the most part, it's not even made up of his own ideas. For example the opening track, "Lemurian Star", is little more than a combination of Hans Zimmer's now-ubiquitous extended brass note from Inception, John Powell's synthy action rhythms from the Bourne series. Similarly, the big action set pieces which come later - "Taking a Stand", "Into the Fray" and "Countdown: for example - have moments of power and grandeur, but have no real individual identity. Despite a couple of them containing repeat performances of the new Captain America theme from "Project Insight", nothing about them ever really says `this is music for Captain America'. Jackman's theme is so nondescript, it could be from any superhero or action movie from the past 20 years, and the action rhythms and percussive patterns Jackman employs sound like all the other action rhythms and percussive patterns everyone from Hans Zimmer down has used for the past decade.  At the other end of the scale cues like "An Old Friend", "Alexander Pierce", "Frozen in Time" and "Natasha" are quieter but say nothing; they just meander along for a couple of minutes, presenting muted orchestral textures, string sustains, serious timpani rumbles. Unobtrusive, understated, but completely inert in terms of anything resembling musical development.  Worst of all are cues like "Fury", the truly awful "The Winter Soldier", "Fallen", "Hydra" and "The Causeway", which are simply appalling: little more than exercises in repeated string rhythms and loops overlaid by various banging and clanging industrial sound effects, and groaning electronic textures. Both "The Winter Soldier" and "The Causeway" contain what sounds like a processed scream as part of the electronic sound mix, and which appears to be an attempt at a leitmotif for the Winter Soldier character himself; when I first heard it I had to stop and check that it wasn't my own screams I could hear over my headphones.  I have been around the film music industry for a long time now - almost 20 years. I have attended scoring sessions, and attended lectures and seminars on the art. I have met pretty much every major composer working in Hollywood today, and I consider many of them friends. I understand fully that the demands put upon a film composer's shoulders are enormous, ranging from ever-decreasing budgets and ever-decreasing timescales to having to deal with temp tracks, focus groups, musically illiterate directors, and boardrooms full of producers who all want to have their say about how the music should sound. Long gone are the days where one director and one composer would work together to craft their musical vision of a film, as in my rose-tinted once-upon-a-time story that opened this review. Truthfully, I'm not sure my idyllic fairytale of the film score world was ever what it was truly like. In many ways, you can't blame Henry Jackman for giving his employers exactly what they wanted: that's his job, after all. But, still, there has to be a way to write a score which fulfills all the demands set by the no-nothing money men, but doesn't strip away all the emotion, doesn't pander to the common denominator, and still manages to contain some semblance of identity, uniqueness, and inventiveness for both the composer and the film. There has to be a way.	-1
When it has came down to Mariah Carey in her songs, she just really doesn't deliver anymore in regards to voice, sonnet and soul in regards to her songs each and every time. Sadly, the last several songs she had put out like #Beautiful and the lackluster Triumphant from 2012 have been less than stellar in regards to voice and absolute spirit. Sadly, with the songs she has came out with from her upcoming album The Art Of Letting Go, they just haven't added up in regards to voice and spirit in what Mariah had been known for. Her latest song You're Mine Eternal is not one of Mariah's better songs, and feels weak in her voice and soul in what a love song can really be. The song alone is not really anything worth raving about, but remixed with Trey Songz on the song, feels worse in voice and spirit. As for Trey Songz, he has had better collaboration with other divas like Toni Braxton a few years ago with Yesterday which was more sensual and delivered better in the mood. I think Mariah needs to really go back to what her a good singer to start with, otherwise she should retire.  Song: D+	-1

"In Harmony" is the title track off of Icelandic singer's Asgeir's English vocals debut.  The album and track were recorded two years ago in his native tongue and re-recorded and released in 2014 with new vocals.  This track is an acoustic based number that sounds like a million other acoustic based numbers.  There is a nice ending flourish with horns that saves it from being a total waste.	-1

I am not reviewing the record (CD) by the Dead , I love that, This is a review of the MOFI Japanese version, basically, it is a very bland sounding CD, with not much punch to it,just bland.

This is another case of where I'm not going to completely penalize the real talent on this track, Rita Ora, with a one-star review just because she is collaborating with the atrocious Iggy Azalea.  Rita Ora's voice is fun, sexy and powerful.  She has some solid hits so far and will be a talent to be reckoned with for quite some time.  Her contribution to "Black Widow" is solid.  Unfortunately, she is pair with Iggy Azalea due to music industry's current obsession with forcing audiences to believe Iggy is actually talented.    "Black Widow's" success on the charts (going as high as #3 on Billboard) is due to Ora's presence.  This is the case with all the other high charting songs that Iggy has road coattails on ("Problem", powered by Ariana Grande, and "Fancy", powered by Charli XCX).  When the current fad is over, Iggy will be gone any relevance in the music industry.  Rita Ora, on the other hand, will be around.	-1

Iggy Azalea is the latest thing to come into the hip hop world and frankly it would have been just fine without her. Her debut album "The New Classic" is an exhausting 51 minutes through a wanna be rapper's attempt at breaking into the mainstream. To an extent, it worked, but she comes off as annoying and it's obvious she's trying way too hard to fit into the rap game. Let's take a look at the singles. "Work" was the lead single off of the album and was nothing more than atrocious. An absolutely ridiculous (not to mention annoying) beat doesn't work well with the "started from the bottom" lyrics that has become so popular in rap as of late. The lyrics range from relatable to absolutely nonsensical in about three seconds flat as we go from "16 in the middle of Miami, no money no family" directly to "I've been up all night, tryin to get that riiicchhh, i've been work work work work working on my S#!+" Just awful. "Change Your Life" doesn't bode much better though it does have a decent feature from T.I. The song had potential for a catchy hook but flops thanks to an unoriginal lyrical half of the hook. The beat is the worst part as Iggy struggles to stay on top of it for pretty much the entire duration of the song thanks to lazy production values that left nearly nothing to be desired of them. Then we have "Fancy" arguably the catchiest of the bunch and without a doubt the one single that Iggy will more than likely only be known for, for the rest of her career. The entire song features nothing but a few notes on what seems to be a guitar that somebody clamped the strings down to, it sounds like a DJ Mustard wanna be beat which is the worst kind of wanna be there is. The fact that they were able to pull a catchy song out of it is absolutely baffling. Most of that is thanks to Charli XCX who lays down a fancy hook with a stereotypical bridge. The song loses any and all steam it has two minutes into it leaving us with Iggy lazily chanting her name over and over again for the last minute and a half over the awful beat. On top of all of that, the lyrics are downright awful ranging from nonsense to "what the hell did she just say?": "Swagger on super, I can't shop at no department Better get my money on time, if they not money, decline". WHAT? Where to even start on that is a seemingly overwhelming feat in and of itself. As for the rest of the album we're left with a mix of songs that are just trying and failing to be replications of the singles. Most of the tracks here are ridiculous over the top pop tracks that she attempts to rap to. "Black Widow" and "Goddess" are two tracks that are extremely guilty of this. Again, awful lyrics more idiotic production and you've got yourself an album that belongs in the garbage can. "The New Classic" isn't bad. It's really bad. With almost every track trying to be a top 40 hit, it's exhausting just to try to sit through it, and the fact that none of the 15 tracks here can even start to make sense lyrically is just a slap in the face. If you decide to sit through this atrocity just be aware that the moments when it does shine is not a worthy pay off of the rest of the album.  FINAL SCORE: 3/10  Pros: + Catchy beats here and there  Cons: - Downright awful lyrics - Bad production values - Every song is trying to be a top 40 hit	-1
i guess if you use the gwen stefani formula and fergie solo then throw a bone to missy and nikki and have a 90's vibe going on then it will make you appear as something more than the surface. iggy the chick from down under is basically doing a olivia newton john for hip hop and selling her vibe with a across the board appeal. the cleaver miami vice logo for her name on the album cover shows high aspirations to sell the hype, however she is more trl than 106 and park despite how she wants to come at it.	-1
Sorry but this album is by no stretch a quality record and the beats are horrific probably 20% of the album good. I don't see why people are raving about this record because it's not even close to a new classic and iggy azalea lacks greatness compared to other female rappers and being the face of T.I.'s hustle gang she's garbage and yeah go ahead and call out that busta asap rocky cause their both wack.	-1
Giving this album 2 stars is being nice. Not to mention her voice just gets SO irritating after a while. "F*ck Love", "Bounce", and "Work" are good songs. "Black Widow" is okay but at this point way overplayed. Same with "Fancy". Other than these songs, the rest are pretty much garbage. The comparisons between Iggy and Nicki need to stop because if you do any research at all you'll find that Iggy doesn't know the first thing about rap. She just isn't good at it, period. She may be able to come out with hot singles ("Fancy", for example), but that does not in any way mean she's a good rapper - because let's be honest here, she's not.	-1
No talent, this slut needs to sit down! And this message go to all the culture bandits stealing our music! Back off!	-1
Iggy Azalea tries to fill the gap Nicki Minaj left about 3 years ago after turning completely pop/commercial/crazy. Toss in a little trendy Macklemore & Ryan Lewis style with catchy hooks and lurid topics and try to get as much $ as possible. I'll stick to Foxxy Brown, Lil' Kim and Eve, who at least kept it real back in the days...	-1
Her first single sounds like Kesha meets Gwen Stefani.  Miss Iggy is clearly very talented, but the lyrics are the same bravado encouraging self-destructive and reckless behavior.  She and so many other stars could really use their talent to lift people up and encourage positive choices.	-1

First, he wants women to talk dirty to him. Now he wants them to shake their asses for him. Guess what bud? Women are not objects who exist solely to satisfy your sexual desires. Your girlfriend Jordin should be ashamed of dating someone like you.	-1
"Wiggle" is another in a long line of a sub-genre of hip hop that I refer to as 'douche hop'.  It's when the singer is trying so hard to convince you that he's a mack with the ladies, that he just comes off as desperate (Any song by Ray J falls into this category).  After a series of lady-friendly, energetic songs, Jason Derule has has apparently decided to try to be raunchy and tap into his inner R. Kelly.  Alas, he does come off a lot more like Ray J.  First there was "Talk Dirty To Me", now there is this phonic embarrassment, "Wiggle".    "Wiggle" tries to use the raunchy flute work of many similar songs and Jason tries to go on and on about how he wants to see that lady work it.  But, the flute sounds more like the cheap plastic recorders elementary school kids used and Derulo sounds more like a guy standing on the sideline try learn how to get raunchy with the ladies while watching other, more skilled players, do their thing.    Derulo would be better served by going back to romancing the ladies from his earlier music.	-1

I would've definitely prepared the idea for Carrie Underwood to record this song on her own.  When I first heard this song on the radio, I was totally dying for this song just to be a promotional single. Actually, I was also thinking "You have totally GOT TO BE KIDDING ME. THIS is ACTUALLY a song?". The fact that THIS SONG is becoming huge right now is totally shocking and intolerable. I am completely repulsed. I can't believe that this song is something associated with Carrie Underwood, because as far as I'm concerned, she is just about the only thing that is a pro about this song. Why? Does Carrie Underwood have a sassy, whiny, and bratty voice? NO!!! But Miranda Lambert definitely does in this song, and I'm 100% sure that she has been even worse than this.  Why can't people realize that songs like this are not important to country music and turn to something from Sara Evans or Cassadee Pope instead? Even when good female singers are trying to make themselves useful and make songs that actually mean something, which are also songs that define importance, those female artists just get carelessly and recklessly tossed in the gutty water by untalented and uninspired female artists like Miranda Lambert. It's just saddening, depriving, heartbreaking, and disgustingly inexcusably WRONG!!! Listen, there are better songs out there. Pay no attention to this crap that deserves to be flushed down the toilet the second you learn about it. You SHOULD venture Sara Evans for music that actually means something.	-1

Despite this being a label album, its really just another Flame album. V Rose only gets one track to herself, and its the forgettable Threw It All Away. Ever since Clear Sight separated from Young Noah due to "creative differences," the label has stuck with their two artists. Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question. And its ok, but its not as good as Flame's usual stuff, which has been declining as of late in my opinion.  I'm kinda disappointed, as the guests did not shine particularly bright either, so i'll give it a 2, maybe a 2.5 No knock on the message, thats great. But I didn't feel that this album was that good overall.	-1

There are definitely sometimes where a artist can get so experimental, that the quality of the songs dies as well as the heart in the mind. For Ed Sheeran, who based hip hop music to inspire his work, well, it honestly hasn't really shown to be good for his songwriting. While I was not very impressed with his last song Sing from the album X, he definitely needed to do better and sadly that is not the case with his latest song. Don't, the second single from his second album X, feels like it is more urban on the guitar, than driven into the song. Surprisingly, I found this song to be a real departure from the simplicity of the songs that made him a knockout from the beginning like The A Team and Lego House. I really found Sing to be a twist backwards, separating himself from good music, and Don't shows that following. I absolutely do not recommend the song. Listen to the music from Plus, than see if you like the music from X.  Song: D+	-1
There is no question that Ed Sheeran really has let his sound go in his songs. While he has been more influenced by rap and hip hop acts like Jay-Z and others, it really hasn't brought out better in his music. In fact, it feels more like it has wasted his heart in his music. I was not a fan of Sing when it came out earlier this year, but his latest song Don't definitely is the pits. It is one of his worst songs that he has brought out. The second single from his X record is definitely one of those songs that can drive a artists down when they be experimental on a sophmore record. While Sing was fair, Don't doesn't deliver. He needs to find better in his work. I think if he is going make better in his craft, he should consider going back to songs like Lego House and The A Team. While his main influence has been in rap and hip hop, it really has dragged down his work.  Song: D+	-1

nothing too exciting here. sounds like a john mayer ripoff song...marvin gaye's estate should sue him too like they did to robin thicke( I totally hear the melody of Let's Get It On in Sheeran's song). But they should team up w john mayer and sue ed for plagiarism.	-1
Clearly, I stand alone in having a negative opinion.  But, I'm ok with that.  I think Ed Sheeran's "Thinking Out Loud" is a textbook example of why music executives keep churning out cookie-cutter, formulaic songs; people completely eat it up.  The formula for "Thinking Out Loud" is classic.  It is the easily manipulative 'deeply sensitive' love ballad which, unlike Sheeran's other ballad style songs, does not have any dark or edgy lyrics (like "A Team" or "Lego House").  It is simply a cheesy schmaltz-fest.  Combine the music and lyrics with a very sappy video of Sheeran and his on-screen love ballroom dancing, and you have formulaic 'awwwwwww' song that listeners repeatedly show they are suckers for.  It can be somewhat overlooked if it is a good song.  Alas, "Thinking Out Loud" just isn't that good.	-1

If you are looking for a christian rap album this is a solid 5/5. If you are not you will find  a few good beats and an occasional decent flow. The issue is that he switches his flow constantly which could be good......but he does not do it well. It feels forced at points.

In a former life I would have told you LP was my favorite band. They had four amazing releases in a row (including the Jay Z mashup). Then...they got worse. But, you could still find the occasional gem (e.g. Waiting for the End, which can hang with the best of anything they've done).  And then we come to this album. It's total garbage. I don't want to be unclear: it's worthless. At least half the songs are amateurish guitar riffs with Chester screaming like he's in his first high school band. It's embarrassing and terribly pointless. The other half of the songs are not as bad, but are still bad in their own right. There is simply not one decent rack on this whole album.	-1
good song	-1
Let me start by saying, I love Linkin Park. I have all their albums and I've seen them live five times. So I can't even begin to describe how disappointed I am in The Hunting Party. Even their last two albums (which weren't nearly as good as the ones previous) had some great highlights that made them worth the money. This album sounds like Mike and Chester are singing with a completely different band. Nine out of the 12 songs are heavy metal or speed metal which is weird and out-of-place. Their lyrics, which are usually clever and smart, have been reduced to Chester screaming, "you don't know what you got till it's gone" cliches. "The Last Masquerade" is another sound-a-like Transformers-style song. The only highlight is the first track "Keys to the Kingdom," and it's barely a highlight at that. If you're a LP fan, I recommend listening to the album in it's entirety before you decide to buy.	-1
I really wanted to like this album.  High hopes were dashed quickly.  I think LP are past their prime.  Didn't really care for any of the new songs.  I guess I'm in the minority though, as most seem to like it pretty well.  Maybe it will grow on me.	-1
When it has came down to Usher, he has put out a lot of strong music when he was dealing with his heartbreaks like Confessions, and Raymond Vs. Raymond, but sadly there are a lot of songs that don't actually work for him very well. Good Kisser, the lead single from Usher's latest record just doesn't ignite. The song tries to being in a vibe similar to what Prince may have with his music, taking a step away from his influence, Michael Jackson. Sadly, the song for Usher is definitely not one of his high points in music, instead falls a bit from his grace. Hopefully, there will be better music from Usher down the road, because he needs better in his hearts right now. He has a lot going as a judge on The Voice, and for his tribute to Michael Jackson for his posthumous song Love Never Felt So Good, but either way he needs better for his voice, because this was the pits.

...but this is probably her worst album. I'm going to make this one short.  I'm a HUGE Tori fan. I have all her studio albums and two official EPs. I've listened to this album 4 times, and it's been torture. See, there's no fire here. The only songs I really like are the title track and "Trouble's Lament." The rest are torture to listen to. It's easy listening, bland, bordering on flat out vapid. I'm talking about the music itself and the vocal melodies. Yes, there's some cool lyrics, but, musically, this is just bland. The song "Promise" could be sung by Mariah Carey, and almost no one would notice that it was written by Tori. It's a safe-as-can-be pop ballad. I literally groaned in disgust as it played.  Sorry, Tori. I'll listen to your other albums, and I'll still go to your show when you come to town, but this album is going to be collecting dust.  I gave it 2 stars and not one out of pure mercy and because I'm grateful that she's still around. But...wow. I can't believe how predictable and boring this album is.	-1

Just the other day, I was sitting in my room, listening to Sgt. Pepper and thinking to myself, "Man, this album is okay. But what it really needs is a bunch of spacey noise and auto-tune. And more freakouts and distortion and weirdness for the sake of weirdness. Yeah, that would make this album awesome."  Then, lo and behold, the Flaming Lips and their "fwends" release this album. Wow, it's like fate!  Back to reality...  I've been a fan of the Flaming Lips since the 90s. They have released some excellent albums that will stand the test of time. Unfortunately, they've become a band of gimmicks as of late (gummy skulls, ridiculously long songs, blood, etc.). This is the worst gimmick of all. This is a complete embarrassment to music. The cover of "Lucy" was enough on its own. Was it really necessary to cover an entire classic album? That's a question that really doesn't need to be answered out loud.  Is it worth listening to this? Maybe once, just to experience the horror. However, I will leave you with this warning: you will never be able to forget you listened to this travesty. I only hope that one day I can again listen to Sgt Pepper without being reminded that this atrocity exists.	-1
Wow, I don't know anything by FL other than that cool -albeit morbid- track about everyone being dead at some point, but like many others I've listened to a few Beatles records and plenty of Beatles tributes and covers version of their catalogue.  So I do appreciate Flaming Lips putting a unique spin on these oft' heard tracks. Instead of merely copying them, as has been done before. I've enjoyed the wonderful BIG DADDY doo-wop take on this LP and it works on many levels, and everyone from Cheap Trick (recent live) to Dub All Stars reggae groves have taken a run at SPLHCB. Unfortunately this CD doesn't compare to anything I've liked about the Beatles. As each track started in my player, I hoped for the best, but from high pitched and whiny vocals to purposely out of tune guitars and a mish mosh of sounds, none of this worked at all for me. Some tracks had an ok vocal but I missed the drums, some tracks had a ok sound track but the singing ruined what might have been a decent sound-bed. If I were to play a track on a Breakfast with the Beatles style Sunday Morning radio program, to tell the world there was a new Flaming Lips Beatles CD, I'd probably go with "Lovely Rita". It was the best of the lot. This disc of music doesn't benefit anyone.	-1
this is aweful and I love the lips	-1
A god awful take on one of the greatest albums of all time. I honestly have no idea what they were thinking when they started to make this. Props to The Flaming Lips for making by far one of the worst albums of all time.	-1
When it has came down to Mariah Carey and her music right now, she doesn't really deliver. Not just in her music, but her marriage to Nick Cannon has absolutely failed. Her album Me I Am Mariah: The Elusive Chanteuse has been absolutely nothing but a big failure. She honestly does not have anymore what she used to, in songs at heart, the artists that really have delivered in voice and soul, and the talent as well. Her latest album hasn't had the songs either. #Beautiful featuring Miguel is definitely not a strong duet heart and soul. Miguel seems to take all the talent away from Mariah, and you really don't have much of her voice in the song. She could've brought out much more into the song, and a better stride. If you are new to Mariah Carey's music, I would absolutely recommend passing this one up for something much better from her like her work back in the 90's. Her songs were there and her voice was stronger.  Song: D+	-1
When it has came down to what Mariah Carey has made out of her music, it honestly hasn't been as strong as she had shown it when she came out back in the 90's. Her latest set of songs on Me... I Am Mariah: The Elusive Chanteuse has not been the strong set she made it out to be and instead wasted her heart out from the set of songs. Her lead single from the album #Beautiful isn't a strong nail on the head for Mariah and instead weak from the heart of her voice. Miguel brings out much more from the song alone than Mariah. Her voice feels very weak, and there just isn't enough chemistry to make the song deliver from the heart of the matter. She had much more when she worked with the great Whitney Houston on When You Believe and Boyz II Men on One Sweet Day. It really isn't a strong song from her, and instead weak from the heart.  Song: D+	-1
I thought just the mere combination of Miguel and Mariah would make this a hit song.  Saw the video which was okay, then purchased the song.  It's absolutely boring.	-1
Not that big of a fan of this download from Coldplay.  I like a lot of their music, but Bo Bryce sings this song better.  Had there been one of her downloads for this song, it would have been the version I would have downloaded, even though Coldplay made it popular.	-1
Neil Patrick Harris has been very lucky to somehow make a career out of a terrible tv show but it's even more ridiculous to think that he wants to try Broadway. I have no idea what his talent is, but acting and comedy clearly is not.	-1

I am a huge Led Zeppelin and Robert Plant fan but I did not care for this soft noodling and boring "world music." If you like it, well that's great, it is just not my cup of tea. I do not like the direction Plant took after Fate Of Nations. For me the best stuff is Principle of Moments, Manic Nirvana, and Fate of Nations is solid. I just wish he would have stayed with a more classic sound. Even the albums I mentioned, which I do like, are really poppy and sort of 80's. If he had simply incorporated way more heavy guitars and more of a Led Zeppelin sound droves of fans would be much happier. Still I was glad to see him in the early 90's and did enjoy the show.	-1
Why bother write anything.  Let's see the BEST THING ABOUT THIS RELEASE IS:  M.C. and Label didn't release this Greatest Hits....can you believe it?!  So, in all honesty there 4 songs worth listening to.  As a whole, Motley Crue is not Country, and trying to make it country...didn't work out.  Sorry to say, this was a waste of money.  I Grew up with these guys, and I own ALL 45 releases and re-releases and re-re-releases...and I grinded my teeth as I opened this hoping it was going to be 50% good...NOPE.  Guys Just retire...you had a great run.  Farewell.	-1
I just saw Motley Crue, Camden New Jersey 8/23/2014 so I knew when I got back to CA this CD was waiting for me in the mail. Personally as a rocker, not a country fan, except for Willie, Waylon and a few this CD was a big disappointment. I probably won't listen to it again. I just want to hear Motley Crue, not country covers, my mistake I should have known better. Sound quality is good and well mixed with this stereo only (right-left-sub) CD. Packaging is not that good as the disc comes out of the center fold and is hard to handle especially while driving. If you are an admitted country fan and a closet rocker you will love it, but a pure rocker and a Motley fan, not so much.	-1

First let me say that I love the Counting Crows original work.  Their first two albums are absolutely brilliant.  Now let me talk about how I feel about this one.  It just seems like a rambling of words.  In fact, I don't understand why everyone is rating this one so highly.  A lot of the melodies sound very similar.  A lot of the song are way too long at over 5 minutes a piece.  The only song I really seem to like is "Scarecrow."  This rest are just so-so.	-1
Surprisingly boring to the point of being quite dreadful. They have not aged well, at all. Avoid this and check out the new Gov't Mule Stones and Pink Floyd cover albums!	-1
This song is utterly unrecognizable...is this even a Calvin Harris production? Oh I'm sorry, because I thought he sold out and became a creepy 50 year old Frenchman named David Guetta. And who is that god awful screecher doing the vocals?	-1
I love JB's first few albums, but his last 3 albums have been total garbage.  I didn't think it was possible to get a worse record than the laughable Naked Ride Home, but this is even worse than that piece of manure.  Terrible songs with no melody what so ever... and the lyrics are even worse!  Avoid at all costs!!	-1
Okay, this is where I get off this train. Can anyone say Maroon 5? I was a big fan, but now I'm off at the next stop if they don't go back to that original style that made them so wonderful. Everything up to this point has been great, but the pop stuff makes me sad. *update the next release is even worse:(	-1
I loved the first three Train CD's but ever since they scored that huge hit off of Save Me, San Francisco they have been attempted to copy that success.  This is NOT the way to go...and the public seems to agree because it is not doing nearly as well as the last few outings.  Honestly at points I thought I was listening to One Direction...This CD is full of catchy hooks true...but over-produced bubble-gum pop music was not what I was looking for.  Next time I will listen first and buy later.	-1
A couple of good tunes you can download. The rest isn't worth having the CD.	-1

Blacc Hollywood by Wiz Khalifa is his third studio album since his mainstream breakthrough. His last album ONIFC was a complete sleeper lacking the appeal of a big single, too many songs, and lazy and even sometimes boring production values. Wiz tries to right those wrongs by going back to what he did with his debut studio album, Rolling Papers, by adding more pop appeal and going for bigger songs. Unfortunately, it comes out with mixed results. Let's get one thing straight. Wiz Khalifa is not an extremely talented rapper, his sluggish flow works for a very few number of beats, and his lyrics are extremely limited to weed, money, sex and more weed. This album does nothing to change that for Wiz. Like previous albums, he makes an attempt to change the formula by doing some crooning like on the big single "Staying Out All Night" with a big pop hook. It doesn't work out very well for him though. In fact, "Staying Out All Night" was the only real successful single here. The hook is catchy, and the verses work out well enough, though the lyrics are just as painful as ever. He takes a whack at some other big songs like the lead single "We Dem Boyz" which is nothing short of absolutely painful. The beat is incredibly lazy, the hook might be the most unimaginative hook we've seen in a big song in recent memory, and the rapping is so far out of Wiz's league it's sad. Unfortunately they even decided to do a remix with Nas and Schoolboy Q, and they can't do anything to save it. We get close to successful singles with songs like "So High" and "Promises". But they both fall flat as well. "Promises" doesn't even get close to Khalifa's style, as it seems like it would have been a better fit with a Ty Dolla $ign mixtape. "So High" fails in the production category as well as the lyrics aspect of it. It's a boring R&B attempt, that has some absolutely pathetic rapping on Wiz's end. The only songs here that even really get close to the "Staying Out All Night" standard are the songs "A** Drop" and "True Colors". "A** Drop" adds some much needed variety production wise, it doesn't really fit with the rest of the album but it's entertaining enough as is. "True Colors" might have a NIcki Minaj feature, but it's able to stay entertaining long enough with a pop friendly beat and a solid hook. Blacc Hollywood is just not a good album. There isn't enough variety to keep it interesting for very long, the big songs are overshadowed by poor production and Wiz's lazy flow. Do yourself a favor and take a pass on this one.  FINAL SCORE: 4/10  Great: Staying Out All Night A** Drop True Colors  Good: KK Raw You And Your Friends  Okay: Promises House In The Hills Hope  Meh: Still Down So High  Bad: We Dem Boyz We Dem Boyz (Remix) No Gain The Sleaze	-1
Maroon 5 has joined the likes of all the other modern day groups. What was once a very talented group now sounds just like Justin Bieber and the likes with the swilly high pitched runs that all sound exactly alike. This may be fine for todays youth who have no idea what constitutes a song with staying power or true musical value, but for us  old classic rock people, I think Adam Levine should stay with his spot on the "Voice" .	-1
So bad. Lyrically it sucks, lot of repetition and some straight up bad ideas for songs. Then it just sounds lifeless on instrumentation and Adam Levine has harsher high notes than ever, in-between all of the autotune of course.	-1
it was returned no credit for return on my debit card  jserrone4@gmail.com	-1
This is awful.  Levine should remove all his tattoos and get a sex change.  His vocals sound auto tuned and do not reflect how great his ability really is.  This should be listed with girly teen pop crap!	-1
This is an OK album, but you completely lose any real drums and the sound that many of us old school Maroon 5 fans love. Hopefully their next album will be closer to their roots.	-1
I'm really disappointed in the music and would not buy again	-1
I have purchased many of these $0.99 sets. These sets make great background music to play while working on my office computer. This set has problems. Essentially, the recording is very poor. I have compared these with  a full EMI set I own, track by track on my home system. I feel that the source material for these MP3's must be very old. There are much better sources for this music out there for a low price. The tone and dynamics of these recordings make them unlistenable.	-1
Seattle electronica duo Odesza's "Sun Models" is an average song at best.  It has a pretty boring beat that doesn't illicit much of a feeling towards anything.  Madelyn Grant addition to the song is more annoying than complimentary.  The end of the song switch the beat to more cooler sound that would have been better served to featured throughout the song.  It was too little too late to redeem this one.	-1
Not for me I like that Amazon offers a wide variety of free music it gives me a chance to listen  to artists and genres that I would otherwise pass by.	-1
This song sucks. Every time I hear this song it makes me so mad. The beat of this song sucks. The trumpet solo is the worst thing about this song. Even when I think I'm not going to hear this crap on the radio, it suddenly comes on. Tell me, idiots who like this trash, what do you find amazing about this song? This song is utter trash. Don't listen to it.	-1
If ever there was a song that aspires to be something more, but leaves you feeling 'meh', this is it.  Nicki Minaj and Ariana Grande are already big time, chart-topping talents.  Jessie J is getting close to that status (already scoring hits with "Domino" and "Price Tag").  "Bang Bang" is a song designed to bring three sexy powerful voices together for a sexy, raunchy tune.  It ends up being just an 'ok' song (more like a 2 1/2 star song, rather than the 2 I'm giving it).    It's hard to quantify why "Bang Bang" doesn't deliver.  Though, in all likelihood, it is because the studio over-produced this track, which typically happens when multiple big talents are brought together.	-1
White Stripes wanna bees!	-1
Typical buckcherry	-1
Well, the single track "F#%@ it" is almost a parody, but more an alternate explicit version of that song by that chick who sang "I don't care/I love it" with the chorus changed up a bit in the words, and done with a hard rocking backing sound that does sound great. Definitely a 5 star song, a personal favorite for the year, and worthy of being apart of the Buck Cherry greatest hits.  However, there is 6 other songs of garbage filler. Calculating that, I come up with a rating of 1.5, so I'll give the LP 2 stars to be generous. But honestly, this is more like a release of a great single with fillers around it, a decent price, one great song, but you might wanna just buy the one song there instead of the LP, unless you're a die hard Buck Cherry fan who must own everything they release.	-1

Would someone tell me, how in God's good name can this be anything but a desperate bid to get radio airplay, or reach the target audience for this type of music: Aguilera super-fanatics, fans of The Voice/American Idol type singers, and teenage chicks. Check out how many producers had their hands in this:Producer Alex da Kid, Chris Braide, Busbee, Mike Del Rio, Jayson DeZuzio, Dem Jointz, Jason Gilbert, Jamie Hartman, Aeon "Step" Manahan, Max Martin, Steve Robson, Lucas Secon, Shellback, Supa Dups, Tracklacers. P-L-EEASE! how can somebody produce a timeless classic (ie Beach Boys Pet Sounds, Pink Floyd Darkside of The Moon)wit so many cooks in da kitchen! This is another ploy to make money and sell songs on itunes for a buck twenty nine each! I am giving it two stars because, although it's overproduced as most major label artist do to get played on the radio, at least Christina has a great singing voice and foxy as hell! (unlike Britney Spears, JLo or some of the other music business hacks out there, who not only rely on seven or eight producers, but also need their producers to mask their lack of singing talent)	-1
Christina  Aguilera  is one  of  those talents where i keep  expecting her to  go full  Etta James and expect a classic song or albums, etc. instead of getting her doing corny 2nd and 3rd tier tracks left over from  lightweight acts. hearing an  album like  this  shows me how desperate  she is to be accepted as to making an artistic  statement.  she has the kind of voice that should be running things and easily showcasing her skills with far better material. autotone,and this  voice don't go. she is more known for being a judge on the  voice than this corny material she is pushing out.she outta be doing a Linda Ronstadt  as to trying to compete with Rihanna. Xtina is better than this.	-1

I wasn't a fan of this cd. From what I've read, this was rushed due to Nicks touring schedule. And it's obvious that it was rushed. Her vocals are not very good at all on these songs.  The only song I really love is Belle Fleur - and Nicks sounds her best on this song. It makes me wonder if maybe it wasn't recorded earlier than the other songs.  But what I really wish she had done is taken the demos that we've all listened to on youtube and had them build music around those vocals. After all, this is when Nicks sounded her best and it's the voice I really wanted to hear these songs produced with. I'm so glad we can all go out and hear those vocals when we want.  But since she did decide to re-record these songs, I wish she had taken more time to do so. And if she was going to do this project, where the heck is 'Julia', one of her best demos ever????	-1
only 1 song i like	-1
Not Good	-1
I know why they were in the vault.	-1
I am not surprised at the glowing reviews here. Most people who review Nicks' music loves her persona as much as, if not more than, her actual abilities. But I look at her music, not just as a fan, but try to listen more objectively. Good artists do not always put out good music.  I like Nicks, though her recent work isn't what I would call stellar. She is more than a decent writer, but if she doesn't have the right producer, her material is banal. It's also not surprising that she, once again, visited old material (just as she did on her last record, and 'Shangri-La' and many on Fleetwood Mac's 'Say You Will' songs as well as their 'Extended Play).  She's been pulling stuff from 'the vaults' for at least a decade and a half  now. '24 Karat Gold' is not a new concept for her.  Had she released the actual demos instead of redos, THAT would have been something worth listening to.  Nicks has a few things going against her with '24'. While her voice might be stronger than it was in the mid-80s, it is also very limited in range. Kids, this is what 3 packs a day will do to you (her admission, not mine). She has very few songs which are arranged with any kind of high note....and I'm not talking them being that high.  Though with the right vocal arrangement, her material can work. She just doesn't have that here.  The other thing she is lacking is a balance of harmonies. She has been working with her two backing singers for 3+ decades and honestly, it worked initially, but that vocal combo is doing Nicks no favors. They are too similar to ever be considered 'harmony vocals'. Though harmony is exactly what Nicks needs to make her songs work.  ...and dare I say it...she needs male harmony vocals.  Let's jump right to "Twisted". That song worked back in 1996 because of Lindsey Buckingham's production, arrangement  and yes, harmony vocals. (and let's forget that she released the demo on 'Enchanted' years back....so she's rehashing rehashed songs).  I find the vocals on this record to be very monotone. It goes back to her range, or lack of one.  For the good rhythm of "Mabel Normand", the she rarely moves off of two or three notes, making each line sound like a run-on sentence. The new version of "Cathouse Blues" can't even hold a candle to a very stripped down demo.  Whatever relationship/issues Nicks has Buckingham on how he handles her music, in the long-run her artistry is better for it. '24 Karat Gold' won't be going into any kind of rotation for me. It had potential, but it seems to be squandered.	-1

Barbra needs to retire. This is a tired album of duets on all of Barbra's hits. Awful.	-1
Wow, I wonder how many times Barbra can regurgitate the same songs on an album.  ENOUGH, already.  I have those same 10 songs that she has been recycling to the point where I hate every one of them.  One can only hope Barry Gibb is sitting with pen in hand as I speak whipping up some songs to sing with her that I can stand to listen to.  I used to be such a big fan till she couldn't learn a new song.  who in the world has not heard her sing these same songs till we could cringe.  What I would like for her to do is use her massive talent on something most people are not sick of.  The public works pretty hard for their money and she keeps sending in the same old, same old all the time.  We can't recycle our work in the private sector.  In the meantime I listen to Rosalyn Kind and find her to be much better since she is so relaxed sounding.  I also discovered I like Lady Gaga.  At least she doesn't sing the same songs on every album.  What a waste of talent.  The public deserves better than she is giving for their money.  I am happy I got the mp3 download - much less money wasted and I am about ready to remove it from my mp3 player since I do not enjoy it.  What a disappointment.	-1
it was  hit and miss in places.  the best duet was with Stevie wonder and it worked. the rest are met with mixed results at best. good arrangements and production. the duet with John Legend was comedy. i mean Barry Gibb and her  were on point. her and John Legend make a good early nap and you might not wake up anytime soon and that is the problem with the bulk of this set. this could have been way better. it feels like product placement and it never takes off. wasted chance with Lionel Richie as well.	-1
I was hoping for more, but there really isn't much here.  The arrangements are very safe and somewhat tedious--there's nothing here that challenges any of the singers.  Some of the vocals sound like they were mailed in, or sent in via attachment on an email.  The choice of songs is rather annoying, too--we've all heard all of these songs over and over in many different versions, and unless you're going to do something new with them, why bother?  Oh, yeah--because you can make a ton of money without having to challenge yourself to do anything creative.  Very disappointing.	-1
I just listened to the album twice on iTunes.  This cd pairs a singing giant with many musical midgets--I mean, Blake Shelton and John Mayer with Babs?  Plus, some of her classics are changed crazily: "People" with a calypso beat?  Worst of all, I wanted to hear Barbra's voice, not suffer through mere male mortals' mouthings.  I did download the last tune, her duet with Elvis on his "Love Me Tender"--which, despite an unneeded new intro, worked.  Save your money, skip this release, and just listen to Essential Barbra Streisand.	-1
Pretty disappointed - a step down from their last work.  Three really good songs, but the rest .....kind of blah... Pins and Needles, Breaking the Skin and Never Ending Hole = excellent !!	-1
It's decent,  but if you need to clear some space on mp3 you could pick this song.	-1
poor sound quality	-1
Didn't realize that this was an Elvis Costello project! T Bone did what he could with it! 20 tracks/18 songs of Folk/R&B! Thanx!	-1
