Nicki Minaj lays the smack down again -- showing more character, personality, and solid identity within a single verse WITHOUT EVEN TRYING than most rappers show in an entire album. Nicky is something ELSE, man. She's so good at what she does that... hell, it ain't even FAIR, man. It just ain't even FAIR.  Incredibly, this song was actually held back as a bonus track on Pink Friday -- and I don't know what actually happened here: 1. the song was either a throw-away that somehow found traction with Nicki's audience, or 2. more likely, an intentional decision was made to keep an obvious monster single hidden (available only as a bonus) to push the album organically after the first push at radio stalled (which they ALL do, eventually). MOMENT 4 LIFE was, indeed, the correct choice for lead-off single (the first 2 singles were "preceeders," which means that they came out before the album, making MOMENT 4 LIFE the actual lead-off), but the idea of using a bonus track as a "follow" at radio is -- as far as I know, anyways -- untried (especially with so many radio-friendly units still left on Pink Friday remaining to break at radio!). My personal belief is that the label did this on purpose; notice that the video was already done. (!) That's a reveal, folks. That shows the cards. It's an interesting way to push a record, and it's especially risky for a new artist. They probably did it on purpose, too. That's BRILLIANT.  Marketing effort aside now, the track itself has Nicki flexing, goofing, and gear-shifting comfortably in double-time, interspersing the brilliant verses with a much slower chorus -- both of which are massively commercial. I almost feel like the versus are more hooky than the chorii. (!) No question this is a stand-out track; you KNOW this is Nicky from the first moment you hear the voice -- and what's especially good about this record is that you KNOW you're listening to a unique voice, even if you haven't yet heard Nicki's stuff before. A girl I work with actually stopped speaking in mid-sentence when this song came on the radio, and, pointing at the dashboard, she asked me: "Who IS this?"  That's all that needs to be said.  It's massive, alright.  5 stars for the title, and 6 stars for the brilliant idea of using a bonus track as a follow at radio.  Heh.  Whoever thunk-up that idea deserves a big fat bonus.  An exceptional unit, with everything here being done by people who know EXACTLY what they are doing.  Massive.	1
My fave Nicki song is Moment 4 Life. This song is about getting married and wanting to have this moment for ever. Love! And Drake's rap...I like that too!	1
Money well spent. This item came in a timely manor and performed as expected. I am satisfied and would recommend to a friend.	1
I'm becoming a quick fan of Nicki Minaj, I like the lyrics,hip hop sound and rap.  The videos to her songs a great too.  I like that she features other artists as well on her cd's.	1

I enjoy listen to top 40 USA music and getting my music here is the right place for me to find those hard to find cuts. Jam on	1
as described	1
Classic get your butt moving kind of song.  Nice beat, fast paced, and a lot of my girlfriends love to have this played at parties.  Just a good song to do exercise too as well.	1
Good fun, gotta love it	1
I appreciate being able to choose whether I want an explicit version or not and knowing I can rely on a clear copy as I expect it to be. No surprises here.	1
Great download quality.	1
Good song, I hate reviewing songs but I want them off my review list. Everyone has their own preference of who or what they like.	1
As heard on the video game "Just Dance," this song makes you want to do just that. Not every song nicki puts out is worth listening too, but this one, Va Va Voom and Starships are must-haves for your music collection!	1
I used to like this song but I'm not crazy about Nicki anymore. The sound quality is good. The song starts where it should and ends where it should. Doesn't have an awkward cut off. No complaints.	-1
I got into this song after hearing two very cute little British girls sing it on Ellen. Thankfully, there was a clean version!	1
Now, how can you not like this song?? I mean this is like one of my faves from Nicki.  The first verse, how can you not remember that?? This song can always pick you up when you're in a foul mood. Good job, Nicki. Love your moves on Just Dance 4, by the way!	1
Nicki Minaj??? you say. Yes. It's true. I have to admit though that this song is catchy. She's annoying but I'll still give a listen.	1
I love Miss Nicki Minaj. Her voice, her body. And this song is a great example of why I love her music.	1
Just want to keep this review simple. Its a good song. I love ms. minaj so pretty and crazy, good music to boot. And when AMAZON recommends a new artist to listen to, i tend to listen. Usually this works out great and i find a new band or artist i like. Nicki Minaj is no exception!	1
I love this song! It was very easy to order through Amazon. The price was decent however with all the apps out there I won't need it in the future :)	1
mmm... Nicki! Awesome lyrics w/ great beats! Besides being a gorgeous babe, Nicki sings awesome lyrics! :-D Love how she sings in two different voices, and the lyrics... the lyrics are just F'in mind blowing!	1

I like some of Nicki Minaj's music, she has talent and she's not bashful. Super Bass is just one of some of the songs I like by her.	1
I really like a lot of Nicki Minaj's music, and I can't wait until she release a new new album. Yeah!	1
It's a great dance song though seeing some young kids singing the lyrics to this song was slightly unnerving.  Besides that, I thoroughly enjoy listening to this a few times in a row.	1
Never heard of Nicki Minaj until I heard this song. Getting overplayed and become an opening act for britney spears femme fatale tour. You won't get pass the first 30 seconds of the song. Completely Unlistenable	-1
I choose this song to demo my new stereo system, this song was my first purchase mp3 ever! It proved my stereo system is quality and got me addicted to mp3 files!  I love the fun spunk of this song!	1
This song is so catchy I love it! I haven't heard another song like it, good dance tune, great drive with the windows down blaring from the speakers song!	1

i don't listen to music due to the fact that music sucks  and i rather be in a quiet room	-1
Whether or not you actually pay any attention to the lyrics, one has to credit Kanye with an absolute mastery of rhythm in this song.  I for one think the lyrics are controversial simply because they can be, which is par for the course for Kanye West.  I personally don't care for them, but I suppose it depends on your outlook.  Nonetheless, I will still blast this song proudly with my windows down =)	1
I purchased and rated it because it is a great song, I highly recommend it to those who like Rap.	1
This is a great song for cameo's by other artists. It really brings out some of the talents by getting everyone to come together to make a cohesive product.	1
Can you believe it? after all that has occured, the disbandment of THE ISLEY BROTHERS, spending time behind bars for tax evasion, MISTER RONOLD ISLEY is back with redoubled vigor on this stunning transgeneration project. Like fine wine, his great voice continues to improve, marking fifty years of amazing work!!!. The album blast off with the bouncy,steamy "TAKE IT HOW YOU WANT IT", a song for the younger fans. Next is a modern classic.."NO MORE", I love this one!!. "IF I LOSE MY WOMAN" is so bouncy yet mellow. TI duets on the very hip hop flavoured "PUT YOUR MONEY ON ME" another cut for the young fans. "SUPPOSED TO DO" & "DANCE FOR ME" are very bouncy, sexy and mellow songs, I love them very much!!. "WHAT I MISS THE MOST" is my very most loved song here, a true ISLEY classic!! this one realy melts my heart!. Next is the pleading "I NEED YOU" pretty good stuff. ARETHA FRANKLING duets on the reassuring classic "YOU'VE GOT A FRIEND" both voices blend perfectly. The final piece here is the soothing "YOU HAD ME AT HELLO".Not bad either. Now fully solo, it's a new game for RONOLD ISLEY, having done so well in the past, I believe he will do well in the future. I suggest this record to new and seasoned fans alike, it's a tad different, not as classic as "THE HEAT IS ON" or "BETWEEN THE SHEETS" albums but overall pleasing, enjoy!!!.	1
Ron Isley's first disc since being released from prision, really doesn't have any standout tracks other that What I Miss The Most. The production is boring and I'm surpised R.Kelly didn't contribute anything to the disc or for that matter Ron's label mate Ne-Yo. If Ron Isley wanted to make a remergence into the music scene, then maybe a soulful tribute album would have been better. I'd love to hear Mint Condition on Fight The Power or hear Joe & Raheem Devaughn take on Smooth Sailling.	-1
ron isley has never disappoints you had me at hello is beautiful as what i miss the most also was a little sad r kelly didn't produce or sing with ron but overall i love the album m drake	1
Mr. I has been in the business for 50 years and is still shutting it down! These young artist need to take note.  This is the kind of CD you can put in and play all the way through.  Stand outs to me are No More, Lose my Woman, Money on me.  Also You Got a Friend with Aretha is the truth!  My only criticism is only 10 tracks, I wanted more.  I highly recommend this CD	1
Mr. Isley has always one of my favorite artists (solo and w/the Isley's)and this selection of music does NOT dissapoint! His voice is unique and I love it!!! His songs definately give me romantical thoughts! :)	1
Ronald Isley is still as smooth as he ever was on this album. Inundated with ballads, the women are sure to find tracks that will have replay value and the gentlemen can learn a thing or two from these lyrics for Isley speaks on giving women what they want from a material and emotional standpoint. T.I. and Aretha Franklin are featured here; they do quite well. Isley sounds very gentle as he croons through all ten tracks.  "Supposed to Do" is sure to be a favorite, especially to the ladies. Isley says that a women is supposed to have breakfast cooked for them in the morning and good sex at the crack of dawn, as well cars and homes, all courtesy of their man. It's a great and sexy ballad indeed. "Put Your Money" is one of the more contemporary tracks on "Mr. I." I enjoyed it. T.I. does a nice job with his bars. "What I Miss the Most" is the performance of the album. He is doing some serious crooning and the beautiful lyrics and fantastic instrumentation only enhance the song.  There are no missteps and no filler here. Just press play and hold your lover!  Mikeisha's Top 5  1. "What I Miss the Most" 2. "Supposed to Do" 3. "No More" 4. "Put Your Money on Me" 5. "If I Lose My Woman"	1
My lovely children can be a bit sneaky. Either that or I just wasn't paying attention when they asked me for it. Probably the latter.	-1
its a song what else can I say I purchased it after hearing on the radio so I must have liked it.	1
This is a great song and it is on my list of song when I lift weights and run a 5 1/2 K. Yes, I would recommend this song to anyone. You will not be disappointed.	1
Love this song, so glad I could easily find it again and listen to it whenever I want, great artist.	1
Can rate this exactly because it is my daughter's purchase, but if there were problems I would have heard about it.	1
Money well spent. This item came in a timely manor and performed as expected. I am satisfied and would recommend to a friend.	1
Excellent quality MP3 sound.  Love listening to this song on my IPOD TOUCH!  Would purchase again and again.  Wish Amazon Cloud songs could be shared with Apple Cloud...	1
I LOVE this song. It's everything great that The Peas are - switched up beats, different melodies, sweet sentiment - I just can't get enough! ;-)	1
YOU REQUIRE US TO WRITE TOO MUCH ON YOUR ITEMS AND SOMETIMES THERE'S JUST SO MUCH ONE CAN SAY ABOUT SOMETHING	1
Money well spent. This item came in a timely manor and performed as expected. I am satisfied and would recommend to a friend.	1
If you like the Black Eyed Peas, you will definitely LOVE this song.  it is well worth the price, and I would definitely buy it again	1
classic song with a twist a little techno like but the voices are cool and so is the band i enjoy this song its worth it	1
I have heard this song a lot lately, in various stores and pumping through the loudspeakers at the gym before I turn on my ipod. It sounds like something that was designed by a committee to hit that perfect combination of catchy, trendy and completely inoffensive. Somehow it's also gratingly annoying and sticks in your (your here being "my") head for days after it's been heard. It's worse than "It's A Small World After All." Perhaps it's the familiarity of the "Time Of My Life" lyric that adds the hook, because the rest is comprised of a startlingly unoriginal dance track with generic lyrics about losing control on the dance floor and being freaky freaky, etc., which should, in theory, just blend in with the rest of the background noise. I might just walk out of the next store where I hear this playing if I am near the exit and don't have a full cart of groceries which I will have to abandon. To the powers that be who decided to assault my ears with the repeated plays of this little gem, please, for the love of all that is good in the world, pick something else.	-1
I'm sorry to say this but this is one of the worst BEP singles that this group has ever put out. I hate that they used an old song, yet the older song is way better. I'm having the time of my life and I never felt this way before? What the hell is that? Lyrics are so lame and like a lot of people said, it seems that they are just doing this to make money.	-1
We don't have as much new, great music to choose from & maybe that's why Little & Ashley are such a standout for me, but I think this is a really sweet & very cute song...it is so charming.  I'm very tired of sophisticated & ugly.  I think I could listen to them sing anything & like it.  Really nice sort of generic Christmas type song.  Nobody of any religion could object to it on any basis...except maybe that it is no religion @ all.  When I saw it, I tho't it might be another cover of "Song For A Winter's Night" written & sung by Gordon Lightfoot, & also covered beautifully by Sarah McLachlan...I've probably listened to that song by each of them 1,000 times, & never tire of it.  TY for the nice present, Amazon!	1
I downloaded this for free, and for the price, this is an enjoyable addition to my collection of Christmas music that I load onto my iPod each Christmas season and delete right after Christmas. If it is still free, definately try it. If you have to pay for it, make sure it meets your tastes in music first.	1
Awesome little holiday tune. I would recommend this to any person who enjoys holiday songs over the Christmas Holiday season.	1
I liked the music and variety it offered.  Very good value for the price and easy to download onto my player.	1
I got this as a free download from amazon. Nothing can beat free, especially when it's a good song that you like!	1
Little and Ashley harmonize very well in this recording. The lyrics bring visions of a beautiful winter night outdoors with a smattering of bells. Who doesn't like sleigh bells? I like it!	1
I really like the way that this duet's vocals blend together, and the piano is very spritely and befitting of a celebratory holiday season. Good one.	1
After Chrisette Michele's debut album her second album Epiphany left a lot to be desired.  It wasn't exactly a knockout punch and was more like a sophomore slump.  Others liked it but I felt it was lackluster and pedestrian.  I left that album completely disappointed especially since her debut, in my opinion, was a classic.  When I found out Chrisette would be releasing a new album I kinda felt indifferent about it.  On one hand she was featured on my favorite song of the year Rick Ross' Aston Martin Music in which she absolutely brought her A game and on the other hand I was still disappointed about Epiphany.  I found out she would be releasing a mixtape to whet the appetites and to serve as a prelude to the new album.  I downloaded the Love Thy Brother mixtape and largely thought it was wack.  So I came into the album with rather low expectations and after listening to the album I'm still not happy about the output.  Let Freedom Reign is not cohesive and features songs that are clearly out of place.  There's a few songs where she channels her former self such as If Nobody Sang Along, I Don't Know Why But I Do, and I Sang Along but those moments of goodness are few and far between.  So In Love ft. Rick Ross is an above average song as well.  Both of the singles are weak; Goodbye Game & I'm A Star.  They lack personality and are pretty much standard fare and with a talent like Chrisette we need more than the standard.  It pains me to say this but again Chrisette Michele has failed to deliver the goods.  For me, that's two albums in a row and that's unacceptable.  I cannot recommend this album especially on a release date that's crowded with better efforts from Jazmine Sullivan, Ron Isley, El DeBarge, Miguel, Eric Benet and Slim Thug.  In other words, you can pass on this one unless you are a die hard Chrisette Michele fan. 2.5 Stars. A	-1
Chrisette Michele brims over with confidence on "Let Freedom Reign", the follow-up to her no. 1 album "Epiphany" as she tells us she's a star tonight on the uplifting "I'm A Star", declares she's a beautiful queen and she'll be her number one on "Number One", and tells us how cool she is on the Trancey Dance number "So Cool" (penned by Ne-Yo). The dramatic title track "Let Freedom Reign" is spoken verse set to martial beats and featuring Talib Kweli and Black Thought, while "I'm Your Life" is upbeat with an insistent piano riff.  The album is more upbeat than its two predecessors, but she slows things down on the piano ballad "I Don't Know Why, But I Do" (with her searing vocals questioning her feelings and motives), "Goodbye Game" (with a deceptively upbeat intro leading into a fiery ballad - simply spectacular), the piano-laced "So In Love" featuring Rick Ross, "Unsaid" (with clattering percussion), the spare ballad "If Nobody Sang Along", and the guitar-laced "I Know Nothing".  Her best album yet!	1
thank u	1
Love it	1
Not her best album, but Chrisette Michele doesn't make bad music.	1
I'm disappointed by this album. Especially, what she said in that song "Let Freedom Reign" the nerve of her to say "I'm just black in America, I'm not Afro american, Just a passive american, Making belief I'm better than, What we've been, what we've been." Woman Afro/African/Black is the same thing! What are you 9 years old?!	-1
Nothing you can say, can take me away from my girl. Not since the beginning of India Arie's career has anyone with a voice like this been so instrumental to my music scene. she has put out 4 albums and all four are the best.	1
Really surprised by this album. In fact honestly,if I'd actually only listened to it half way and than shut it off I wouldn't see it as meriting a review at all. During the last couple of years I've seen the emergence of a series of albums by contemporary R&B female artists that I'd describe as "high concept" releases. Some are extremely successful both in creative and commercial terms. Janelle Monae's&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/The-ArchAndroid/dp/B002ZFQD0E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">The ArchAndroid</a>&nbsp;is a perfect example. And that appears to be what Chrisette Michele was going for on her third release. Her first two albums. In her liner notes the concept is abundantly clear. She's decided to address the troubles of the modern day recording industry such as the obsession with surface value and resulting creative crisis's. On that end it's apparent that she has found herself in the middle of one. She isn't sure if the jazzy R&B/funk direction is for her after all. And seems to be changing her mind about her adventure. It all comes into her commentary. You'd think with an album with such a worthy and lofty mission that it would be a masterpiece. It didn't turn out quite that way.    For one thing there's one simple contradiction. Much in the same way Funkadelic one proclaimed they were "rescuing dance music from the blahs",this album definitely has a similar concept. The problem comes because a lot of the music embraces many of the ideas it's supposed to protect people from. Songs such as "I'm A Star","I Don't Know Why,But I Do" and "The Goodbye Game" all embrace just about every contemporary hip-hop/R&B cliche one can imagine. The bassy techno strains of "So Cool" is even more puzzling at first. It isn't until you listen to some of the other songs do you find out why they are there. There is a title song and it is one of the strongest songs on here. Featuring Talib Kweli it's a powerful modern funk message song speaking about the hypocrisy of modern society,especially in dealing with matters of race and national defense. In an era when topical songs are extremely rare,this really speaks volumes. Another important song is the epic "If Nobody Sang Along". And THAT'S when the commerciality of some of the other songs is explained. As in the liner notes she's filled with a lot of doubt,contemplating selling out for further popularity or sticking to her guns.    As anyone who reads my reviews a lot know I am not a "cranky reviewer". In fact anything below a four star review is very rare for me these days. The only reason I do so here is because Chrisette Michele is someone whose creative integrity I respect and trust. I completely understand and relate to her conception on this album. And I also support the fact she HAS a concept that's socially relevant. A friend of mine from Oakland had a conversation with me a few years ago about how critical people have become with music and film these days. His contention was that today's trouble was there WASN'T ENOUGH analytical criticism of these art forms in these day and age. That they were all seen as conventional media,little more than commercials and not looked into with more of a fine toothed comb. This album really helps me understand that. The modern cliche's she embraced,even in irony didn't add up to a creatively potent album. The fact she subdued her excellent vocal ability on these tunes didn't help either. If she'd extended the albums two best songs into a full cinematic album concept ala&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/What-s-Going-On/dp/B00007FOMP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">What's Going On</a>&nbsp;or Curtis Mayfield's&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Back-to-the-World/dp/B000B9WDIW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Back to the World</a>&nbsp;it would've been an easy successor to her previous two triumphs. Unfortunately,as it stands this is her most creatively erratic album thus far. Chrisette Michele is still,however a talented lady. Better luck from this point on! She deserves it!	-1
Chrisette Michele is one of the artist I think , is slept on.  She has a very soulful voice and has been compared to some of the "old-school divas" like Ms. Anita Baker.  I have enjoyed all of her cd's I own and was not disappointed with this one. I love that gives us a little something different while still giving us her beautiful voice. One of my faves is "I'm a Star".  I let a friend from work hear that one track and she went out and purchased the cd.  She has a catchy tune with Ricky Rozay that the hip-hop set would love called "So in Love" (they collab great, love Maybach Music from his cd). "Goodbye Game" .....great break-up song, "So Cool", all great tracks.  If you like Neo-Soul check out Chrisette....this cd as well as her previous discs.  She has a very soulful voice that I love!	1
LET FREEDOM REIGN is, to me, a slightly different departure from EPIPHANY, whereas the music has a slightly harder edge to it, but make no mistake, Chrisette's voice is matched perfectly for the tunes chosen.  Problem here is that I feel that the lady I was introduced to with her first disc, I AM, no longer exist.  We have now been introduced to a new Chrisette, who is willing to give more than we bargained for.  In some areas, that's good.  Evolving is a part of life--I just don't know if doing so in this manner is going to be good for her or her fans, but I guess time will tell.	1
Let Freedom Reign is a great progression in Chrisette's musical career. I was blown away by the originality of her debut album and while her second was good, I felt that her creativity and songwriting ability were subjugated by the label thinking that pairing her with Ne-Yo would garner crossover appeal.  Let Freedom Reign is a phenomenal album featuring strong songwriting & lyrical arrangements and just plain good music. It ranks up there with Erykah Badu, Monica & Fantasia's recent albums as a cohesive, consistent r&b album. As a fan of strong singer/songwriters, I am glad that Chrisette seemingly went with her gut and wrote 98% of the songs. Personally this is what draws me to her as an artist - her lyrics are thought-provoking and deep and while the album doesn't have a lot of hook-driven tracks, it is a grower because the more I listen to it, the better it gets.  To those who listened once and are disappointed, please give it more of a chance to "marinate on your brain" by listening to it over time because this album is brilliant in construction & content. Unfortunately for Chrisette she is not a priority of her label so hopefully good word of mouth about this album will cause more people to give her music a chance. She is one of few young r&b female artists who are intelligent, write thoughtful lyrics and don't use sex to sell their image and I appreciate that and hope that more people discover her music.  My standout tracks are: I DON'T KNOW WHY, BUT I DO; GOODBYE GAME; I KNOW NOTHING; IF NOBODY SANG ALONG; I'M A STAR & NUMBER ONE. (**IF NOBODY SANG ALONG is an especially honest track on which Chrisette debates selling out her image & songs so that she can fit in with other artists vs. remaining true to herself.)	1

On a superficial note, this is the 1st deluxe digital album I've bought & it was worth the purchase.  The booklet is amazing and being somewhat of a nerd who enjoys reading album liner notes, I felt that this booklet along with the video for "I'M A STAR" made this a worthwhile purchase.	1
Not a big fan. But I love real music.  I listen to this every song and have to give credit she can sing!  She is a little different but still a real singer.  This is worth buying.	1
Chrisette Michele "Let Freedom Reign" (2010) This is yet another modern  R&B  project badly produced. The vocally gifted Chrisette Michele fairs best on ballads. The strongest of which is "I Don't Know Why, But I Do".  The other ballads are lyrically mediocre and under-developed. The title track has unique rap, spoken word elements coupled with an oddball vocal arrangement.  Less guest appearances would have been the way to go on this misfire.  Guests tend to take the focus away from the featured artist. Audio-tune and other vocal tweaking devices are wasted on Michele's self sufficient vibrato. Let  the vocally challenged Brandy, Britney Spears and Rihanna use the tricks. They need the tricks. Michele doesn't.  I hope Michele's next release takes a more natural approach as was exhibited on her debut in 2007.	-1
I recommend you buy the Target Exclusive Version with two bonus songs, What's The Matter, and I Want You. The bonus songs are worth getting this version. Chrisette Michele amazes me after each release. I really enjoy this album. This album is different than her last album. I think sometimes you've to change it up a bit, or it can get boring after awhile. She is a really great singer, she can write her own songs too, which is great for an artist, because many artists don't. I think her album sales should be higher than they are, because she is a talented artist. Maybe she can make it past gold status on this album. Putting Rick Ross on this album on the song So In Love was a good thing to do. I hope she collaborates with more artists on her next album. This album is one of my favorites of 2010. My favorite songs on the album are: 1. If Nobody Sang Along 2. So In Love Feat. Rick Ross 3. I Don't Know Why, But I Do 4. I'm A Star 5. Unsaid	1
I love Chrisette's voice and she can flat out sing! The first time I listened to this CD I was on the fence. However, after listening a few more times I get it.  This is a solid effort and her vocals are on point.  I like it better than her last CD and that says alot because I loved that one too.  She is definitely one of the best artist out right now even though she doesn't receive the attention she deserves.  I recommend this CD!	1
I really like Chrisette and I like her music. Good CD, it speaks the truth as always. I am never disappointed with your music. Keep it up, you will always be a Soulful Sister! By the way, great job on the Anita Baker tribute on the 2010 Soul Train Awards. FREEDOM REIGN!!!!!	1
I am a firm believer in giving artists second chances case in point Chrisette Michele . Her last cd left me questioning whether to invest in her work again when previous cd before that was BANGIN . I'm not sure who to point fingers at the label, her producers , the marketing team or the artist. Without a doubt she's beautiful , talented , humble and can belt out a tune or two I'm just not sure what exactly went wrong on this third cd. Out of the entire song selections I can only bare 3 songs to listen to . I understand artists don't want to be forgotten so they get pressure from their labels to drop product, but how about taking the time to get a strong team behind you in every aspect of your career consumers and music lovers such as myself get a little disappointed when artists go from great to garbage. Crossing over to style that isn't yours naturally just to sell music isn't a good move .	-1
if you like dance music and you like Enrique, you will love this single.  excellent track, way to go.	1
Great song!	1
fun song to jam out to	1
I'm a huge Enrique fan, I like this song, not my favorite, but still worth the download..has a great beat & catchy lines..haha..	1
I loved the song ever sing I heard it on a Karaoke stage, I just think it is dirty enough to dance to but romantic enough to get your groove on with.  simply love the song.	1
I bought this song for my teen age song, because I have the amazon account I have no idea anything about it.	1
IT's explicit but it's all good it makes the song sound more realistic from a man's perspective and worth listening too.	1
So I'm a die hard Enrique fan, I've always thought he was hot, even when he still had the mole lol.  But he was gone for several years and I kinda just forgot about him...then I hear this on the radio, well I hear "Tonight I'm Loving You" and I thought this song is great, I went to Youtube and gave it a second listen, then I found out he was really saying something else.  Needless to say, that just made me like the song even more and I must have hit that replay button 100 times, and it still hasn't gotten old yet.  Sorry to any people who think he didn't need to be vulgar, but the song makes more sense and is more powerful when he says the other word, and I've never even heard him curse before it's kinda hot lol.  Oh yeah and it's just a word so get over it.  As for the quality of the song, it has a great beat, it really makes you wanna get up and dance, it has catchy lyrics and an awesome video as well.  I've heard two other songs recently by Enrique and they were just as awesome, I'm so glad he's back and making some great songs!	1
Love the song how it talks about perception and that your children shouldn't feel less because they are already the most beautiful creatures on this earth.	1
The lyrics to this song I think a lot of young girls should listen to the beat is nice but the words are better I love pink she,s a powerful women and I applaud her and she can sing live wish is rare today . shes doing it!!!!!	1
Like it	1
She's great, love her voice, her music, her enthusiasm, she's on fire.  She's really a talented entertainer in addition, again what's not to love?	1
A wonderful track	1
nice	1
This song is a must for your portable electronic Christmas playlist.	1
Finally bought it!. Heard it on the radio for several years. Play it several time a day. BUY IT NOW!	1
I was about to write EB off because his last album "Love & Life" lacked the soulfullness of his previous albums. It could have been that EB was trying to go in a different direction and gain the Adult Contemporary middle of the road audience with Love & Life, Thankfully He returns to his Urban roots with this "Lost in Time".  I'm overwhelmed with the excitement listening to this album. Yes, Yes, Yes, This is the EB we know and love! The EB that blurs the lines between him and Maxwell. Imagine if they did a song together, Wow! That would be something!	1
Two years ago Raphael Saadiq released an excllent album The Way I See It which paid tribute to the Motown of the sixites. Two years later, Eric Benet touches on the seventies with his fifth album Lost In Time. Benet pays tribute to the era in particular with the ballads in this excllent album.   Track By Track  1. Never Want To Live Without You  - The album opens with a nice slow which showcases Benet's voice in top form.  **** out of ****  2. Feel Good (feat. Faith Evans)  - I still remember the first duet (Georgie Porgy) Faith & Eric did from Benet's A Day In The Life album. Eleven years later the chemistry is still there with this grown & sexy party jam.  Faith Evans is proving to be a go to duet partner with this song and her recent grown & sexy duet Lay With You with El. Debarge from his new album Second Chance. **** out of ****  3. Sometimes I Cry  - The lead single where Benet uses his falsetto to work wonders. Listening to this song and seeing the video I was reminded of the classic Lenny Williams song Cause I Love You. **** of out **** 4. Always A Reason  - This is another smooth slow jam, that reminded me of the classic song Sideshow by Blue Magic. **** out of ****  5. Paid (feat. Eddie Levert)  - I've never know Benet' to duet with male singer but this song sounds like one of the best songs The O `Jays never recorded. **** out of ****  6. Take It (feat. Chrisette Michele)  -The second female duet on the album, this is more a modernized song and the lovely Chrisette Michele's voice complaint's Benet's voice very well. **** out of ****.  7. Stir It Up  - This is another modernized song and just makes you feel good while listening to it. *** out of **** 8. Summer Love (feat. India Bent)  - Benet brings it back to the old school with this song and I could easily see Stevie Wonder singing a song like this during his Songs in the Key of Life era. Benet's daughter also shows that talent runs in the family. **** out of ****  9. Lost In Time  - Another amazing ballad which is remiscent of the doo wop sound of the fifties and sixties. **** out of ****  10. Good Life (feat. Ledisi)  - Now an Eric Benet album wouldn't be complete without something to dance to. Listening to this song I found myself snapping my fingers and just motivated to dance.  **** out of ****  11. Something's Wrong  - The album's closes out with a jazz infused ballad, which once again showcases one of the finest voices in R&B today. **** out of  ****  Eric Benet has produced a excellent fifth album which continues to show his talent as a singer. This album will not only please those who appreciate real R&B music, but also those whose the days when singers would put their heart and soul into their work.	1
The opening cut on Eric Bent's new CD "Lost In Time" is a breezy seventies-sounding ballad which reminds me of the Diana Ross/Marvin Gaye duet "You Are Everything". That seventies vibe continues on the upbeat "Feel Good", a duet with Faith Evans with hints of Prince.  "Sometimes I cry" is the albums lead single, a smouldering falsetto-sung Maxwell-style ballad laced with horns. The bouncy "Paid features Eddie Levert (and lyrics about trying to get by on meager wages while still staying positive), the lovely midtempo "Take It" features Chrisette Michele (and Bent again channeling the spirit of Gaye), the lilting Jazzy "Summer Love" featuring harmonies by his daughter India, "Lost In Time" (sounding like The Chi-Lites), and the groovy horn-peppered "Good Life" featuring Ledisi being other standouts in what is yet another outstanding album by Eric Bent.	1
thanks a lot	1
Singer, Songwriter and Musician Eric Benet found himself at a personal and professional crossroads. In spite of a decade that had began with great promise, thanks to his gold-selling and Grammy-nominated Tamia duet, "Spend My Life With You," his reputation as low-key R&B love man was nearly destroyed thanks to acknowledged infidelity against his then-wife, actress Halle Berry. His third CD, the intensely-emotional Hurricane, finally ended his six year recording hiatus and produced a couple of hits, but he didn't completely restore the groove until 2008's Grammy-nominated follow-up, Love & Life. Now, over a decade into his solo career and nearly a decade removed from Hallegate, Mr. Benet's fifth effort, Lost In Time, feels just as well-crafted as its predecessor, giving his faithful following exactly what they expect---lush, love-struck ballads and mid tempos featuring twists of sophistication and sensuality.  When Mr. Benet entered the studio for Love..., he confessed (during an interview to SoulTracks, no less) that he'd sequestered himself in the studio with longtime collaborators George Nash and Demonte, employing old school methods to crank out melodies for the songs rather than the other way around. The process of anchoring lyrics to a strong musical foundation continues to serve him well, evidenced in vintage-sounding tracks like "Always a Reason," which could've been an outtake from a Stylistics album in the way it interpolates "Break Up to Make Up" and employs a tender falsetto to coax his way into a reluctant heart: "There's a lifetime of tears we could both leave behind, cuz' in so many ways, we've been broken inside/All the questions you ask, we'll find answers together in time , all you need is to believe..."  "Never Want to Live Without You" is another blue-light-basement-party special, filled with confessions of a man who's wronged his lady and vows to move faithfully into a brighter future.  The exquisite title track describes the heady sensation that new love creates, and vulnerability reaches new heights with the aching slow-burn of a ballad, "Sometimes I Cry," brimming with tear-stained, Prince-worthy pleading for another chance (or at least a fresh box of Kleenex): "There's a smile on my face, yeah, but I'm broken inside/Sometimes I cry, when I'm all alone with this heart of mine. "  Even the most successful performers need to shake things up from time to time, and that's what Mr. Benet accomplishes, surprisingly, on the Gamble-and-Huff-recalling "Paid." What could've been an ill-fitting and self-conscious duet is, instead, a freely funky jam that laments having more month than money and how the lean green is getting harder and harder to come by. Eddie Levert's baritone complements Mr. Benet's tenor as they grumble about getting "paid on the first, paid on the last, and struggle all through the middle/M-O-N-E-Y never seems to multiply for me," a rich experience for the singers and the audience alike.  Still, in spite of its overall excellence, a few songs in the line-up manage to fall short. "Take It," which pairs him with Chrisette Michele, sounds like a tentative I-don't-want-to-outshine-him/her vocal run instead of the fun frolic it was meant to be, and "Good Life," featuring Ledisi, has a great message but needs a more modern backdrop to really drive it home. "Something's Wrong" wants to wrap up the collection with a conscience, but it seems to contradict itself in stating that, yes, the whip is fly and the cash is flowing, yet the evidence of mankind's suffering isn't exactly making his day, thank you very much: "I avert my eyes as I travel them roads, of people begging on the street/Don't mess up my vibe and show another sick child ain't had enough to eat." Huh?  More nuanced than Hurricane, but less exuberant than Love & Life, Lost in Time---even with its missteps---powerfully demonstrates Mr. Benet's artistic assurance and finesse, qualities that will keep the Milwaukee, WI native from becoming, well, just that.	1
It's very obvious that Eric Benet knew what ole' skool was all about.  This was an exceptional disc with so much ole' skool flava that it was like living in a time warp.  I spent my time trying to guess what past hits he took the melodies from while driving.  His voice is still melodic and was capable of handling the materials that was given to him.  He is definitely one of the unsung heroes of the R&B world and as long as he keeps his heart in the past, then I'll keep buying his cd's.  Hey, he can update his sound if he want to....just don't forget about ole' heads like me, who can appreciate his talent for tapping into the past and making it sound so new again.	1
This Cd is so good. I enjoy every song on this album. If you are in a relationship, it would be a great resource. Buy it, you will like it. Trust meif you are a Eric Benet fan.	1
Eric B. proves over and over that he can just flat out sing! This brother has brought some serious emotion to each of the songs on this project.  (even though we, the public think we can tell who he may be referring to on some songs)  Great project and one that will give you listening pleasure for times to come.	1
Wow, SOMETIMES I CRY- Eric Benet is a singing fool- I've always loved his music but the force behind his falseto in this cd is amazing. Welcome back man... we missed you! Go get the cd	1
I enjoy this CD for the most part. There are a few songs that I don't like, but over all it is a good CD.	1
'Lost In Time' matches one of the industry's greatest voices with some outstanding music and lyrics of 80s nostalgia that should *never* go out of style. Classic, soulful, and reflective, the CD conjures up summer memories of my childhood in the 80s. The influences of touchstone songs such as Cheryl Lynn's "Got To Be Real", The Stylistics' "You Are Everything", The O'Jays' "Backstabbers" and The Gap Band's "Yearning For Your Love" are heard throughout the CD.  My favorite songs are: "Paid" ft Eddie Levert, "Always A Reason", "Stir It Up", "Good Life", & "Never Want To Live Without You". I also enjoy his rendering of "Better & Better" originally done by Ms. Lalah Hathaway even if he brings nothing new to it.  I gravitate to artists like R. Kelly, Cee-Lo, and Marsha Ambrosius who are making some great retro music. Eric Benet is no exception. On 'Lost In Time', Eric Benet finds his niche in the classic soul stylings of the past. This is an outstanding CD from beginning to end, and I am incredibly proud of him!	1
During the December of 2010 a lot of excellent R&B and soul albums were being released at roughly the same time by Ron Isley,El Debarge,Charlie Wilson the the newer Chrisette Michelle. I myself had always enjoyed Eric Benet since the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/True-to-Myself/dp/B000002KQU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">True to Myself</a>&nbsp;days when he was merely and up and coming neo souler in the vein of DeAngelo and Maxwell. As with those two at the time he had something to proove musically but in many ways since than the modern music scene and Benet's own personel journey have led him to the place I'd always been hoping he'd go. Even today neosoul is defined as a rather retro sounding music that,in some way must owe some sort of musical debt to whatever digital hip-hop style or rapper is popular at the moment. Intricately crafted songs are not priorities but rather simple,sing-along hooks with the overkilled "Whoh ho,whoh ho,whoh ho!" chant are the order of the day. Either that or you have overly naturalness obsessed performers who through their insistance on live instrumentation in ones face to such a degree it's slightly off putting. Now in the case of Benet's tribute to 70's R&B styles here he manages to strike the right balance,as only a select few modern albums have between live instrumentation,in the pocket production and extremely well crafted songs.    Much of the music here is highly inspired by Thom Belle and soul balladeers of the early 70's such as The Delfonics. "Never Want To Be Without You","Sometimes I Cry","Always A Reason" and the title song will all attest to that as they feature the same kind of scaling melody,strong accentuating horns and even that defining electric sitar type of sound. It's at the time that the albums tempo goes up that it really gets great. Now in terms of retro soul it's all too easy to fall into the obvious clishe of doing just ballads and midtempo  numbers even if well done. But when you have songs like "Feel Good" and "Good Life",recorded with Faith Evans and Ledisi respectively you know your in a good place:these songs take the funk/disco/soul hybrid of the early 80's now called "boogie",with it's string and horn charts and churning rhythm sections and hooks mixed with modern mixing and production techniques for a very potent and funky experience. The O'Jays Eddie Levert comes in on "Paid",a churning,wah wah guitar powered update of the classic Gamble/Huff Philly funk sound (very close to&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Back-Stabbers/dp/B00160ANKK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Back Stabbers</a>&nbsp;in fact) whose message reflects how the socio econmic status of the 70's paralells to todays similar issues and how vital yearning and less confrontational and profane message songs are to contemporary R&B music.    The album is rounded off with the jazzier Billy Paul styled tribute "Something's Wrong" and,as with much of the other romantically themed music on this album we see someone who has learned from the mistake of having been a philanderer in their youth and has an important message for their audience not to make the same mistake and why. It's by no means beggy and preacher-most of the time the powerful music and Benet's trademark carmely vocal delivery tell most of the story. And while I must admit live instrumentation is always vital to R&B and always will be it's even more wonderful to see them in the hands of someone who produces them in the best way possible and,equally so does so without restorting to any modern clishes:most important of which is that need to owe some debt to the currently overdone hip-hop/R&B genre. Yes this album will naturally have an appeal to anyone whose musical tastes were guided by the 70's and early 80's R&B generation but is also quite encouraging to younger up and comers who see that the kind of music with the kind of production they've loved FROM these people hasn't disappeared and can be expanded on for todays audience. And for that alone,even if unintended I thank Eric Benet for releasing this album as it is.	1
Eric Benet is a real musician. He has the ability to play instruments, he has wide vocal range, and so much of his music is simply timeless. "Hurricane" is and will likely always be my favorite of his LPs, but none of them are lackluster. A lot of people love Maxwell so much, but I love Eric Benet just as much as I love Maxwell. Maxwell is no better musically than Eric is.  The reason this LP is titled "Lost in Time" is Eric Benet is paying homage to music of the 1970s. I enjoyed every track. This album's weakest moment is the duet with Eddie Levert called "Paid." I could not get into it though I like both artists. Most of the songs on this album are about relationships. Luckily, most of them speak on the positive side of relationships and I appreciate that. I get sick of hearing about heartbreak and sadness. Love certainly has a happy side. He joins forces with Faith Evans again (they also sang "Georgy Porgy" together) on "Feel Good." Eric is telling his woman how good she makes him feels on this track. The album's lead single, "Sometimes I Cry" is a splendid record. It is an emotional number as Eric is clearly singing from his heart. I love Eric Benet, but after hearing that track, it motivated me to listen to this entire album at once and I am glad I did.  If you have read my review, you will know that I am about to encourage you to invest in this LP. There is live instrumentation, and what music lover can't appreciate that? Additionally, he has never sounded better. What are you waiting for? Invest!  Mikeisha's Top 5  1. "Feel Good" 2. "Never Want to Live Without You" 3. Sometimes I Cry" 4. "Always a Reason" 5. "Lost in Time"	1
This is a great, fantastic & refreshing CD release by the talented musician & producer Eric Bene't, titled 'Lost In Time'. This great CD opens with a great track, "Never Want To Live Without You" : great music, vocals & harmonies. Other great tracks include "Feel Good" (great vocals by Faith Evans), "Sometimes I Cry" (great laid-back track with great high pitched vocals), "Always A Reason" (great guitar/vocals/harmonies), "Take It" (great vocals, featuring the great & lovely Chrisette Michele), "Stir It Up" (great violin intro, great sax & vocals) & "Good Life" (great 'racy' track with great vocals featuring Ledisi). A good track include "Paid" : great vocals featuring Eddie Levert. Solid tracks/gems include "Summer Love" (wonderful melodical track with beautiful vocals & harmonies, featuring India Benet), "Lost In Time" (fantastic title track with beautiful melody, drums, vocals & harmonies) & "Something's Wrong" (a beautiful closing track with great melody/vocals/chorus). There is no weak track to really talk of in this great CD. On overall, this is a great, fantastic & refreshing CD release by the talented Soul/R 'n B artist Eric Benet, a highly recommended listening.	1
By itself, Eric's mind-blowing duet with the legendary Eddie Levert ("Paid") merits buying this CD. Eric Benet and his producers have come up with a wonderful tribute to the sounds of 1960s and '70s Soul on this effort which is definitely one of 2010's absolute best R&B CDs. This is the kind of music that touches the soul, nourishes the heart and tugs at the listener's heartstrings...and the kind of music that younger artists and musicians should be making. Eric, on behalf of all (myself included) who love REAL music, I'd like to thank you for recording such a gorgeous and timeless CD.	1
Eric Benet is a singer that I respected but didn't really pay much attention to.  For whatever reason, I was not a fan of his music although I recognized that he had talent.  I guess I figured that I had Maxwell & Lenny Kravitz that I didn't need another light skinned funny haired singer.  Turns out that I need some Eric Benet as well.  So when I found out he was making a comeback and releasing a brand new album I literally was like "whatever".  But boredom has a sneaky way of leading to discovery.  There I saw his new album lying in wait on the internet and lo & behold it smacked me right in the forehead.  Eric Benet's Lost In Time is an outstanding effort and a great comeback album for the soul singer.  There are some nice clean grooves and crystal clear vocals.  Everything is appropriate and every song fits.  The arrangements and songwriting are superb and each duet guest shines and complements Eric Benet.  Lost In Time is a fantastic album and has made me a fan of Eric Benet.  Now I must go back and discover his older albums because I clearly have been sleeping.  I highly recommend this one as it's one of the best soul albums of the year and easily worthy of purchase.  5 Stars.	1
This CD is great from start to finish. I was not feeling his last effort but he made up for it with this one.  The 70's influenced track sound makes me really miss what music used to be.  Highly recommend this CD!!	1
Brother Benet,  Let me just say that you're the truth. While I haven't bought all of your albums, I bought a few of them and this was one! This CD is so smooth and it tells the truth. Listeners can do nothing but that: SHUT UP and LISTEN. I did not have to skip tracks or anything of the like. Keep giving us great music. My family and I saw you live in Miami, FL at the 'Back to Me' Tour with Fantasia as the headliner, and you did your thing! Keep making the music, keep the love, and you will never lose your talent!  All the Best, TB  ******AND THAT SONG 'PAID' FEATURING THE LEGENDARY EDDIE LEVERT AIN'T NOTHING ELSE BUT THE TRUTH, EVERYONE NEEDS TO HEAR THIS SONG AND THIS ALBUM******	1
This is one of my all time favorite songs. Perfect for the holidays to play for others to subtly point out the ridiculousness of the overly commercialized "holiday" season.	1
Ken Elkinson is a composer and multi-instrumentalist based in Los Angeles, California. As a young adult, he was part of the competitive Classical piano circuit, who later studied Jazz and Pop piano, picking up guitar, bass, saxophone, clarinet and French horn along the way.  In college, Ken took classes in music composition, percussion, recording studio techniques and improvisation to enhance his music education.  It was during this time he began work on his first original Solo Piano CD, Midnight Conversation, which was released in 1997.  After 9 solo piano albums, Ken Elkinson decided to begin composing ambient music, and the result is a new 6 CD box set entitled Music For Commuting.  Featuring 60 tracks and over 4 hours of music, Music For Commuting has 3 double length CDs which represent progressive days of the week.  The music was composed specifically to help calm drivers while commuting, but his calming music is well suited for massage, yoga, meditation, and academic studies.  On this 6 CD collector's edition, Disc 1 Monday-Tuesday begins the work week in a deep and droning manner, as if shuttling the commuter through the hardest days of the week.  Disc 2 Wednesday-Thursday is much brighter while featuring upbeat, anthems and 1980's synth-pop elements.  Disc 3 is made for Friday and the weekend, taking the commuter into an enjoyable relaxing mode by spacey and futuristic music filled with a perfect sense of optimism.  Songs can be purchased by individual mp3 downloads.  Music For Commuting is an all instrumental mix of Ambient, Chill Electronica and New Age music, but most are from an ambient perspective with lighter melodies.  All 60 songs blend beautifully into one another, and Ken performed every note you hear, so there was no instrumental programming involved during production.  Ken Elkinson instead used a combination of 8 keyboards and synthesizers on this value packed collector's edition CD which enables the listener to arrive at their destination in a calm and relaxed attitude.	1
For years I have been searching for a perfect New Age album (besides Andy Summers' 1988 guitar-and-synthesizer classic Mysterious Barricades), and I believe I have finally found one in the form of Ken Elkinson's new release, Music for Commuting.  Music for Commuting is really a series of 6 CDs, most beautifully packaged as a compact and easily portable box set of 3 CDs with two albums each. To paraphrase Elkinson's description of each two-album set, Disc 1: Monday/Tuesday is dark and edgy, Disc 2: Wednesday/Thursday is more buoyant and based on Elkinson's love of 1980s synth pop, and Disc 3: Friday/Beyond is spacey and futuristic.  Regardless of these distinctions, the music on all six albums or three discs is really of one accord. Although there are latent guitar and percussion sounds on some tracks, the music is generated entirely with keyboards and synthesizers and sounds exactly like keyboards and synthesizers, and like Mysterious Barricades, the emphasis is on texture and sound, laced with beautiful melodies, tantalizing chord progressions, and ethereal chord washes.  Even with such a single style and sound, each of the 60 tracks in the box set is original and unique, setting it apart from most other instrumental albums that need to mix up styles and genres to maintain interest. This is quite an impressive feat on Elkinson's part and speaks to his masterful compositional skills.  The music itself functions on several levels. As the title suggests, it's perfect for commuting. It's also ideal for meditation and relaxation. It's intellectually, emotionally, and spiritually satisfying. It's akin to a religious experience. It would be a great soundtrack for a science fiction or fantasy movie.  Listening to Music for Commuting is like swimming in an ocean of bliss. Its cascading layers of soothing sounds have the effect of mental therapy, like acupuncture for the mind. It is the epitome of pure New Age music and as a result is one of the best in the genre.	1
Since I read a lot lately I love to put a few (up to 5) CDs in my CD player and then read for hours on end. Ken Elkinson's Music for Commuting could just as well be described as Music for Reading or Music for Relaxing. I've listened to the entire set while reading a Kindle book and then listened while falling asleep. I find the music especially relaxing so it is probably a good solution if you tend to feel road rage a lot while driving. Basically this set is filled with dreamy ambient landscapes of sound. The music is peaceful, calming, warm, soothing and can cause you to feel elation. This CD set would also be perfect if you like listening to music in the summer while you gaze up at the stars on a dark night. I love this set of 3 music CDs and I think you will too.  ~The Rebecca Review	1
Jazmine Sullivan returns with her sophomore album Love Me Back and it is an outstanding effort.  With a voice reminiscent of Mary J. Blige in terms of pure passion and emotion, she makes you feel every word she's singing.  She reemerged on the scene earlier this year with her single Going In Circles which was a throwback to 90's R&B but updated for 2010.  It's arguably her greatest song to date.  When she is singing about pain such as the second single 10 Seconds, she has that rare quality in her voice that is distinguishable and unique.  She's easily one of the most soulful artists to emerge in the past 5 years.  True soul music.  The album delivers on that premise with song after song of great arrangements, soulful singing, and great lyrics.  She brings out her inner 80's on Don't Make Me Wait and Ne-Yo serves as the only guest on the duet U Get On My Nerves.  The only songs I'm not really feeling are Love You Long Time & Redemption, not because they are horrible songs it's just that I'm not really feeling their vibe.  Jazmine Sullivan comes through with another solid effort that showcases her talents and is thoroughly enjoyable.  She is a true talent in music and this album is worth a purchase as it has powerful songs with plenty of replay value.  She has that voice that makes your hair stand up in the back of your neck. You definitely won't be disappointed with this album if you are a fan of Jazmine or quality R&B/Soul music.  4.4 Stars.	1
November 30th, 2010  1. Holdin' You Down (Going In Circles) - An anthem-like song that features a bit of heartbreak. We've all heard said song this summer/fall. A-  2. Ten Seconds - A nice song about wanting a guy to get out of your face because he broke your heart. Nice production. B-  3. Good Enough - This track is amazing and has grown on me immensely. It's kind of emotional and gets you right in the heart. A  4. Don't Make Me Wait - A fun, playful 80's-sounding song. Catchy and grows on you. B+  5. Love You Long Time - My man Salaam Remi who produced and co-wrote the excellent "Lions, Tigers & Bears" got all over this track too. Obviously the best song on the album, it has an upbeat demeanor and feels like a love letter sent to one *REALLY* lucky guy. Sorta like Mariah's "I'll Be Lovin' You Long Time" in subject matter, but just think better song. Hot marching drum sounds. A+  6. Redemption - A track kinda like "Call Me Guilty" from 2008's&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Fearless/dp/B001CJOHG6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Fearless</a>&nbsp;but even darker. Has a hip-hop beat and the gospel-inspired chorus is a real highlight. A-  7. Excuse Me - I love the feel to this one because it really, really sounds old-school vocally and production-wise. A true standout. B+  8. U Get On My Nerves (Feat. Ne-Yo) - A cool duet idea between two relatively new artists. Not the strongest track here but has an extremely addictive albeit simple piano arrangement that will get stuck in your head if you pay attention. B+  9. Stuttering - The repetitive nature of the chorus can get annoying, but probably not overly so. Still a great track. Nice and simple piano riff fills the air. B+  10. Famous - I see this song's point especially vocally, but I didn't love it on initial listen because it's also repetitive. But what strikes me now and caused me to change the grade from a "C+" is because of its strong, emotional tone. B-  11. Luv Back - "Luv Back" features sort of an island/reggae sound in production and a happy vibe even though it's essentially a break-up song. It will have you singing along. A+  12. In Vain (iTunes Pre-order track) - This track took a long, long time to grow on me. At first it doesn't really seem like it goes anywhere so those of you who didn't get it, it's all good. It's good, but not great. Anthony Bell did a KILLER, "A" effort song on the debut called "In Love With Another Man" with Jazmine and this song is no comparison. B- (not available for sale anywhere now).  **********************  So may I start with the cover art? Can you say fierce? I freakin' love it! It makes me think of the older days with the leather jacket, boots and the classic model car.  Anyway, this is an excellent album like&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Fearless/dp/B001CJOHG6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Fearless</a>. And although I didn't think it surpassed it in quality at first, it definitely has now. It has a slew of excellent songs and absolutely no average or dreadful songs to be found here. The producers also worked the tracks out here especially "Excuse Me", "U Get On My Nerves" and "Good Enough" which happens to have the best intro on the album.  I love this woman!! Her voice! Her choice in genre! Her lyrics! I will buy her next album and support her because that's what I do: support artists I really enjoy that put in hard work AND make superb albums. Any of you who are slightly disheartened by any negative reviews, don't be: you will love this album. I'm sure of it.  I hope you guys liked my review and I'm so glad I was one of the first to put it up. Jazmine Sullivan's music is close to my heart because she's so honest like myself and she's just fun to listen to. Oh, and did I mention THAT VOICE? Definitely the craziest vocals on Urban radio right now.  (This review has been updated a few times since it's creation)  "A-", 4.6 stars or an 9.2/10. (not an average)  DOWNLOAD: "Love You Long Time" "Luv Back" "Good Enough" "Redemption" & "Holdin' You Down (Going In Circles)"	1
Jazmine Sullivan's multi-Grammy nominated debut "Fearless" criss-crossed the musical spectrum from Soul to Hip Hop to Reggae to Dance to acoustic pieces. "Love Me Back" is her sophomore disc and her throaty soaring vocals are on full display on songs like the retro Soul talk-to-the-hand Salaam Remi-produced ballad "10 Seconds" or the groovy upbeat "Don't Make Me Wait" which sounds like it dropped from the eighties.  Other standouts are the Missy Elliott-produced Hip Hop-laced "Holding You Down", the spectacular Gospel-tinged "Redemption" (which finds Sullivan rapping the part of a crack addict, as well as a male woman-beater), the gorgeous ballad "Excuse Me" (which samples The Manhattans), duetting with Ne-Yo on the bitter break-up piano ballad "U Get On My Nerves", "Famous" (where she talks about her pre-stardom dreams and how she wants to inspire girls to want to be like her, to be somebody, against sweeping strings, squealing guitars, and a spare backdrop - think "Dream Big" from her debut), and the Dancehall hand clap-infused "Luv Back".  A worthy follow-up to her spectacular debut.	1
I purchased this CD for one song and was surprised that I liked the whole thing.  She's got pipes!	1
just want to hear her new artist	1
great cd !!! another underrated artist!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	1
Everything she touches turn to gold and this CD is no exception great music.	1
A true example of a sophomore jinx. Songs like "10 seconds" an "In Vain" has nice moments but she could've came harder then that. The rest of the album i heard nothing good. I thought after listen to the new single "Dumb" that it was time to stop sleeping on her second lp. I thought i was missing out on something great cause i luv that "Fearless" Album an the new single, but i should've stayed a sleep after listening to the samples a year ago.if You luv "Dumb" and "Fearless" just pass this by...nothing good to hear on this lp.	-1
An artist's sophomore album is often the one where they truly come into their own, and can show off who they are as an artist. It is very rare that the second effort is just as powerful as the debut, and it is the mark of an amazing artist who is able to pull that off. Luckily, Jazmine Sullivan is one of those rare artists who continues the momentum of her debut with her 2010 album, Love Me back. Jazmine is one of the rare artists whose voice alone evokes emotion, making every performance sound personal and passionate. She also marks herself as an artist who is truly "fearless", as her debut title suggested, taking several risks with her new material which nearly always pay off. Although this album is neither as instant, nor as haunting, as her debut, it is an excellent follow-up and one that continues to mark Jazmine as an artist to watch.  Lead single "Holding You Down" immediately showcases Jazmine's incredible voice over track reminiscent of 90s R&B. Despite containing multiple samples, courtesy of Missy Elliott serving as producer, Jazmine easily makes it her own. Although it is not as instantly catchy as debut single "Bust Your Windows", it certainly matches anything on her debut in terms of quality. Second single "10 Seconds" takes on more of the haunting quality that permeated much of Jazmine's debut, as she sings about her giving her man ten seconds to leave after he mistreats her. Jazmine delivers an extremely passionate performance, with just the right balance of anger with a touch of sadness. The bridge is particularly strong.  "Good Enough" depicts Jazmine at her most independent, telling a man that she refuses to waste her time on someone that does not appreciate her. The lyrics are relatively simple and straightforward, doing an excellent job of showcasing the song's message. It's a creative take on a break-up song, with the woman acknowledging that she's been unappreciated yet simultaneously realizing that she can, and will, do better.  "Don't Make Me Wait" is the album's first truly upbeat track, and a fan favourite likely due to the similarities to Prince. Although it is not a personal favourite, it is a nice change of pace that keeps the album from becoming too dark. The track does get repetitive in places, but Jazmine's delivery keeps it strong. "Love You Long Time" is another of the album's less memorable tracks, but it is quite a strong filler track. This is one of the rare songs where Jazmine truly sounds happy, focusing on a relationship that is going well. The main problem with this song is that the production is slightly too busy, and almost overwhelms Jazmine's voice which is not an easy feat given how powerful a singer she is. Although it does not necessarily stand out on its own, it is far from a weak track. "Redemption" is another truly haunting track, and one that was quite a big risk. Jazmine nearly raps the verses before belting the chorus, singing about finding redemption for one's mistakes. It is lyrically quite a powerful track, yet as a concept/storyline song it is one that many fans might not appreciate. Like it or not, Jazmine should definitely be credited for her creativity and the fact that was willing to take such a large risk.  "Excuse Me" is Jazmine's first proper love ballad, and it easily proves that she can shine just as much on happy songs as on her darker tracks. Both vocally and lyrically, it does not quite compare to some of her strongest work, however it certainly proves her to be versatile with her subject matter. Her passionate delivery makes her just as believable on a love song as it is on tracks about anger or heartbreak. "U Get On My Nerves", a duet with Ne-Yo, is a bittersweet break-up song in the form of a dialogue between the two singers. This is one of the most highly criticized tracks for everything from a supposed lack of chemistry between the singers, and for sounding much too "polished" for Jazmine. Although the rawness of her voice is toned down, it does not detract from her ability to evoke emotion. This track is an unexpected standout, and a personal favourite. Despite the complaints, there does seem to be vocal chemistry between the singers, making the track truly believable. "Stuttering" is another rather risky track, where Jazmine literally stutters some of the lyrics. The concept behind this song is that something about a man renders Jazmine nearly speechless, so that when she tries to speak, she ends up stuttering. Luckily, her risk once again pays off to become one of the album's stronger tracks, despite some lyrical weakness. Her vocal performance on this track is more subdued than usual, yet retains its usual passion. It is a creative, somewhat gimmicky, track which ends up working, particularly on the powerful bridge.  "Famous" is yet another highlight, and a personal favourite. Any artist who sings about fame runs the risk of sounding self-centred. However, Jazmine manages to craft a masterful track that truly sounds genuine and even relatable, with vocals that can give chills. Where other artists use songs about fame to complain about the constant attention or to brag about what they have, Jazmine instead describes the desire for fame and to be important. Although this is by far the longest track on the album, Jazmine easily manages to keep it fresh throughout so that it never seems to drag on. This track is truly Jazmine at her best. Despite "Famous" appearing to be the perfect closing track for the album, Jazmine is never one to end her albums on a serious note. Carrying on in a similar vein to "Switch" from her debut, Jazmine closes off this album with the fun, reggae-tinged "Luv Back". This track brings the album full-circle. Where "Holding You Down" described Jazmine questioning why she keeps going back to a troubled relationship, "Luv Back" has her telling a man that she's completely over him and moved on. This track once again proves that Jazmine is just as strong on upbeat and happier tracks as she is with her darker material.  Overall Mark: 4.5/5  Only two albums into her career, Jazmine Sullivan has already established herself as a force to be reckoned with. Both albums so far have been true showcases of her numerous talents as a singer and a songwriter. Love Me Back builds on all of the strengths of Jazmine's debut, especially her ability to take risks with her music. Jazmine is unafraid to try new things with her songs, and more often than not, they work well. The only problem with taking so many risks is that it makes the album a little less cohesive in places, with certain tracks ("Don't Make Me Wait" for instance), sounding a bit out of place. Jazmine still does somewhat better on her darker material than the love ballads, however even the weaker tracks on the album are solid quality. Her passion and ability to evoke emotion from even the simplest lyrics certainly help to make even the weaker tracks sound believable. It will certainly be interesting to see what Jazmine will come out with next.	1
I wasn't holding out much hope for this follow-up cd, having been let down before by other recording from other artists who had the bomb first but tired second.  Not in this case....I'm loving this better than the first disc!  She's got some ole' skool flava going on in here and perfectly mixed it with her signature voice...there is no denying that Jazmine is part of the rebirth of R&B.  She is a true artist committed to her craft, and as long as she's giving that commitment to her fans, then we will be committed to listening.	1
WOW- Another "underrated" artist- Jazmine does nothing but DELIVER on this release- in a era of non singing, no soul having r&b singers... JAZZY KILLS IT. I really wish she were getting the attention her style deserves... you got my vote sista	1
The lead single of this project, HOLDING YOU DOWN (GOIN' IN CIRCLES)was released last summer and it instantly became a favorite of mine with great use of a sample and a modernized old school feel.  The second single, 10 SECONDS, was released a few months after and featured a soulfully smoldering performance by Jazmine as she calls out a cheating lover.  I thought both singles and they accompanying videos were excellent and hoped that they had created enough "buzz" to increase interest in the album upon release.  Unfortunately the album wasn't released until December and shortly after disappointing low sales, Jazmine announced on Twitter that she was quitting the music business (which she later recanted - thankfully).  As an r&b music lover, I understand her pain & frustration about the status of this genre of music but I also believe that if more artists like Jazmine continue to release music that is more soul rather than hip hop/soul, eventually the pendulum will swing back to a place where she and other singers like her are more appreciated.  I enjoy this album as much as her debut - there are ballads I love that showcase her voice as well as uptempo songs on which she smooths out the raw soul of her voice to fit more "pop-oriented" production.  Overall the only 2 songs that I still don't like are: U GET ON MY NERVES w/ Ne-Yo - the track is just "ok" when I hoped for a magical duet between the two voice & FAMOUS - I appreciate the plaintive, honest lyrics but the arrangement of the song makes it difficult to listen to.  Other favorites (in addition to the two singles already released) are:  DON'T MAKE ME WAIT - uptempo track with an 80's retro beat  GOOD ENOUGH - the synthy opening of this ballad segues into a Prince-sounding track with Jazmine's emotional & raw vocals  STUTTERING & EXCUSE ME - smoky ballads  LOVE YOU LONG TIME - interesting military drum beats used on this uptempo track make it interesting  REDEMPTION SONG - great storytelling lyrics, Jazmine raps then goes into a killer chorus  I wish her label would release one more track but sadly these days r&b artists usually only release 1 or 2 tracks and then we hear that the artist is "working on the next album" - they just don't take time to groom artists or "grow" their music anymore if it doesn't crossover to the mainstream charts.  To Jazmine, as a fan I say, please stay strong and continue to release good music!	1
This is a solid/fantastic CD release by the talented R n' B superstar Jazmine Sullivan titled "Love Me Back". The great opening track is "Holding You Down (Goin' In Circles)" : great track with great (music, vocals & rapping). This song does give a good glimpse of what is in this great CD : great joyride, fun & when all is said and done, you'll "Love Jazmine Sullivan Back" for the love she dishes out on this CD! Other great tracks include "10 Seconds", "Don't Make Me Wait" (very soulful track with great vocals & great guitar), "Love You Long Time" (great al cappella intro & great drumkit sound) & "Excuse Me" (very soulful track with great vocals). Okay/good tracks include "Redemption" (good rapping), "Stuttering" (great bass/piano combination) & "Famous". Solid tracks/gems include "Good Enough" (fantastic soulful laid-back track with great techno intro), "U Get On My Nerves" (wonderful R n' B track with great vocals intro by Ne-Yo, beautiful harmonies with Jazmine Sullivan & chorus) & "Luv Back" (a fantastic closing track with a beautiful melody & chorus. This is the title track for this CD with great techo/keyboard sound. This is also my favourite track from this wonderful CD). On overall, I was blown away by the unique & fantastic vocals of the talented Jazmine Sullivan, got much much more fantastic music than I expected, a highly recommended CD. With this fantastic CD release, her fans should certainly "Love Her Back" as well as spreading the love to new fans!	1
One thing that I don't like about today's music is that it's geared toward the lowest common denominator: sex, or the act itself. Now, I'm not a prude by any means, but shouldn't a song leave a lot to the listener's imagination? That's why a lot of the 'old school' singers from 25-50 years ago could make songs that actually hold up better today than most of the pre-fabricated, over produced slop that infects popular music, especially R&B today.  Sullivan's music is what is needed today: you still acknowledge today's styles and what not, but you still work on the main thing: making the song memorable and letting the listener fills in the blanks so to speak.  She is pretty, that is no doubt. But, I'm more impressed with her singing qualities and her song writing skills, because she'll need those qualities if she wants to be a long lasting star, after she's not the hot young singer of the moment.  I think that she'll last a long time if she keeps on doing what she's doing: making sure her voice, writing, and talent always take center stage.	1
Mz. Jazmine Sullivan did a spectacular job with her sophomore endeavor! I can't take the cd out of my player.  'Holding U Down' is mos def a hit with her sultry vocals transcending the listener under her captivating spell.  '10 Seconds' portrays a picture of revenge and the video is hott!! The video made a book junkie such as myself reflect on which urban lit read that this would be perfect for...charge it to my head!  'Redemption' tells poignant tales of lovers and their actions vs consequences with a jazzy beat that has you swagging with the beat.  'U Get On My Nerves' has a smooth rhythmic vibe enhanced with Neyo's vocals to heighten your pleasure. 'Stuttering'...'Famous'...what can you really say?  Jazzi Sulli laid down some masterfully lyrically mesmeric tracks that will enchant you with each and every fascinating tune!  Magnificente!!!  TTT	1
the new Album from Jazmine Sullivan she is at her best with alot of people my favorite songs are  1. Holding you down(Goin in cirlces) 2. 10 Seconds 3. Don't make me wait it samples vanity 6 4. Good enough 5. you get on my damn nerves duet Ne-yo  I do think that Jazmine sullivan in my opinion she could have done alot better to me this is not her best album but I love her performance at the 2010 Soul Train Awards she was excellent.

She is a great singer,  this is a great cd. 'Holding you down' is  a great hip hop dance track. '10 seconds' is another great song but more of a ballad, yet another great song.  This entire cd is a mix of fast and sloe songs.  However her voice sounds great on each song!  My favorite is 'don't make we to long' it's kind of a trow back to r&b dance songs.	1
I have uneven feelings about Jazmine Sullivan's sophomore effort, Love Me Back. The current standard of laptop-style production sounds cheesey  when paired with Sullivan's superior vocal ability. A live studio recording session with real musicians seems more suited for  her misguided and under-used talents. Just on the heels of her 2009 CD Fearless, this release is a rushed ill-conceived effort. It pales in comparison to her CD debut. I think more time should have been devoted in the development of this project. The two single releases off this project, the Grammy nominated, "Going In Circles" and "10 Seconds" are the best  tracks. I also favor "Redemption" for its' vocal arrangement and storytelling elements. It should be considered as third single release.  But, Sullivan's duet with the popular Ne-Yo is likely to be the third single to garner heavy rotation radio airplay. That song really gets on "my damn nerves, damn nerves"! Too often today's music results in good voice presented with bad material. I hope Sullivan's future projects will be more creative with time invested. This incomplete and rushed sophomore CD could've been great. But, it is just OK.	-1
I was eagerly awaiting the release of Jazmine's second CD.  However, this CD is all over the place.  I am not sure what direction she was going for and honestly it doesn't sound like she knows either.  The best effort is Holding you Down. For me it when downhill after that.	-1
This is the personification of a Solid Sophomore Effort. Jazmine Sullivan, or shall I say Ms. Sullivan, hit a home run with this album, as she did with her debut album 'Fearless.' Jazmine has a unique voice and she uses it to the full and this is what makes her music so good. I bought her debut album 'Fearless' and it appears that she still is.....'Fearless' because the music sounds even better! It is timeless music that sounds like it's effortless for her to produce.  1. Holding You Down (Goin' In Circles) "It has that: `You got me under your spell' vibe. This is the first single and it is a song that makes you want to dance like you've never danced before; this song samples from Mary J. Blige's song `Be Happy.'"  2. 10 Seconds "The 2nd Single and it is a blazing track that depicts the climax of problems within a relationship. This song also has a beat sample from Mary J. Blige's song: `I'm Goin' Down.'"  3. Good Enough "If you don't want me, someone else will! Jazmine sets an ultimatum for her lover in this song: `If I'm not good enough for you, hit the door and I will be good for someone else.'"  4. Don't Make Me Wait "Funky, upbeat song that has a Vanity 6 vibe."  5. Love You Long Time "This song makes you bounce when you hear it. It's an upbeat song about the opportunity to love, love for a long time."  6. Redemption "This is the dramatic song on the album, it reminds me of `Call Me Guilty' from the 'Fearless' album."  7. Excuse Me "A ballad about self-expression."  8. U Get On My Nerves Duet With Ne-Yo "A hot duo about a relationship that is beyond over."  9. Stuttering "This is a song about a nervous crush."  10. Famous "The pros and cons of becoming Famous! Sang it Jazmine!"  11. Luv Back "This is the Reggae joint on the CD, once you lose love it is hard to get it back."  Overall, the album receives an A+. Jazmine get your gown ready for the Grammy's because you and your extremely talented label mates, and might I add: FELLOW GRAMMY NOMINEES, Fantasia and Monica will be in the house along with you anxiously waiting to hear the results. You all deserve to win! Real R&B hit hard in 2010 and the world better stand up and recognize. In my opinion, you're a winner already by just being nominated, that's an honor. Keep making real music Jazmine, keep reaching our hearts, and we will never have a problem to `Love You Back' because you show this love to us by giving us the gift of music.	1
With her second LP&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Love-Me-Back/dp/B003W3VD26/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Love Me Back</a>,  R&B singer Jazmine Sullivan follows up her lauded debut&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Fearless/dp/B001CJOHG6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Fearless</a>&nbsp;with another, equally consistent effort.  Well rounded and crafted with chilling vocal performances by Sullivan,  `Love Me Back' is both creative and retro, blending old and new styles together well.  There are no misses or songs that find the vocalist ever choking as `Love Me Back' proves to be nearly flawless and finds Sullivan improving as a vocalist if anything.  While it will always be `Fearless's' "Bust Your Windows" that defines the rise of this star, she has continued her upswing strongly on this exceptionally well thought out second effort.  "Holding You Down (Goin' In Circles)" should come over as extremely clumsy given its manic production, but instead, Sullivan `holds down' the multiple samplings and gimmicks of the production extremely well.  Vocally, Sullivan is perfect with a well nuanced performance and solid songwriting, most notable on the soulful hook: "I Keep going in circles, circles/round and round/and while you're doing me so wrong/I just keep holding you down/ I feel so stupid, foolish/loving you this way/But what can I say/But I wanna go/I wanna go/but I keep coming back." On the equally sound "10 Seconds" (another track built around soulful sampling), the production is superb and Sullivan absolutely KILLS it with her soulful vocals.  Again, superb songwriting serves as the buttress, particularly on the intelligent chorus once again: "one, two, three (four!)/five, six seven (ooh)/eight, nine, baby I'm getting closer..."  Sullivan is two for two; 2-0.  "Good Enough" is a nice change of pace as far as production work.  Here, Sullivan achieves great attitude.  The bridge may be the highlight as it serves as an `epic' moment.  "Don't Make Me Wait" is a departure for Sullivan, finding her singing over a neo-disco groove - something we've never heard from her before.  The production is solid and while the vocal parts may be written the slightest bit too fast-paced, it is another solid, noteworthy performance.  Similarly, "Love You Long Time" features big drums that provide a rhythmic driven production work.  A short performance, the cut packs enough punch with superbly commanding vocals by its muse.  "Redemption" is an oddity, but also a personal favorite.  Sullivan opens up the track rapping and instantly gives the impression that there is a `story' behind this cut.  She brings it all together on a soulful, gospel laden hook in which she asks the Lord to "... hear the sinner's prayer."  By the bridge section, Jazmine's soulful vocals take over and captivate making this both one of the album's anomalies and highlights.  "Excuse Me" may be the very best moment of the album - `the crowning achievement' of `Love Me Back.' Here again, a sampling approach to the production work helps to `amp up' the soulfulness of the performance.  Sullivan follows-up the valedictory "Excuse Me" with "U Get On My Nerves" featuring Ne-Yo, a fine duet.  The chemistry between the vocalists is unquestionable.  On "Stuttering," Sullivan once again shocks with a gimmicky performance, but not like the rest of contemporary R&B these days; even with her use of gimmicks, it seems more soulful and classy than other artists who couldn't pull this off.  "Famous" features a fine driving (rather pounding) beat.  "Famous" is not the best of the album, but with such a consistent effort as this, it is by no means bad. Closing cut "LUV Back" is a surprising uptempo cut to close the album.  The production is spastic, but do we expect any less from the creative, cerebral production of Missy Elliott? (The Answer is a rhetorical `no' by the way.)  Overall, `Love Me Back' is another fine addition to the R&B discography of 2010.  Let's face it - this girl can `sang.' It is a shame that R&B has became so based on `trends' that we fail to honor those new singers that are avoiding gimmicks for nuanced, complete vocals performances like Sullivan, Chrisette Michele, etc.  Exceptional effort!	1
Great R&B album. Jazmine can really sing & its good to hear someone who actually has a voice & can hold a note. Its a nice move up from her Fearless album. I'm feelin every track on this album. I love this girl's voice. Hopefully this album will get better media coverage than the last one did.	1
Nice song with a nice beat.  You can sing along to it and place yourself in the song and dance to it.	1
I downloaded individual song. It's nice to be able to buy just the songs I want. I love amazon music!	1
I enjoy this song very much. This is a new artist to me but I really like this song. I would recommend it.	1
I love this song and I sing it to my kids. Because, in this hard, cold world as long as there is breath in my body they will always be able to rely on me. That's what the song is about although the original intention is from the artist to his romantic significant other.  My favorite line: You can bet that, never gotta sweat that!!	1
i like the album	1
Great Song	1
its giving listeners an old school sound with a younger attitude.	1
Just love hearing good music and this record and artist has it all. Besides I like paying for the songs I want verses the whole album.	1
No matter what type of music or who the artist is, I love music. All types of old and new.	1
I love Miguel, his first album he really hit the mark with. Sure thing is a classic in the making.	1
This is another one of Miguel's songs that I play everyday.  This is actually my favorite song of Miguel's and the first song I heard from him.  I know I'll be purchasing more of his music in the future.	1
I love this song...everything about it.  I love the beat, the words and the delivery. The song is clear.  It was easy to purchase.  Very satisfied.	1
HATE having to write an amount of words for a review when it was only a one song download.  Good song though!	1
this is a sexy song.  he sounds great live.  This is a beautiful song.  I recommend this song for your playlist.	1
The first time I heard My Chemical Romance, it was on the radio. It was their breakthrough single, "I'm Not Okay(I Promise)", and I took the title quite seriously. They were not okay. They were actually quite not good at all. However, when they released their 2006 album, "The Black Parade", a friend played it for me and I was instantly interested. It was a wonderful connection between classic rock allusions and influences mixed with the Misfits. It even had a storyline, though it was nearly impossible to follow passingly (like most concept albums). I was eager to ehar what they did next, and over the course of the next four years "The Black Parade" was constantly in my CD player and on my iPod. Needless to say, when I heard lead off single "Na Na Na", I was pretty floored. It was a pretty righteous song, all quick guitars and nonsense, but fun, lyrics and possibly the best solo of the last few years. It was, and is, a terrific rock song. I was now eagerly excited to hear what came next. "Danger Days" does not disappoint any of my expectations, which were already pretty lofty. It is a fun, tight record with a pretty nifty comic book concept and more than a fair share of killer tunes. Like "The Black Parade" this is a big, shiny rock record with bigger hooks, with some of the songs, specifically "Sing", "Summertime" and "The Kids from Yesterday", begging to be played live in large arenas. "Planetary (Go!)" is downright funky, a truly danceable track with some pretty funny and clever lyrics to boot. "S/C/A/R/E/C/R/O/W" features the records most mega chorus, and the garage punk tunes "Party Poison" and "Vampire Money" succesfully call out garage bands of the past while still putting a special My Chem spin on the genre. Occasionally the group falter, most notably on the boring "Save Yourself" and "DESTROYA", two tracks that failed to leave any discernable impression on me after repeated listens. Musically the record is more melodic and keyboard driven than any of the bands previous records, but this style fits the band perfectly. Where their earlier records (which I went back and have a passing interest in as time has gone by) were more aggressive, and "The Black Parade" was pretty melodic and epic, "Danger Days" mixes the two while adding tighter songcraft. Lyrically the record is strong, and features some of lead singer Gerad Way's best lyrics to date. I enjoyed "Danger Days" fully. It's a tight, well constructed rock record that's as much fun to listen to as I assume it was to make. If you like MCR, you will almost certainly enjoy this record, and even if you haven't in the past, you might still find yourself nodding your head to quite a few of the songs.	1
When I originally heard "Na Na Na", I was afraid that this album would be their downfall. The song grew on me over time and now it is one of my favorite tracks. Then "Sing" came out and it was the same reaction again..."uh oh." I didn't know what to expect when I bought this, but I decided to give them chance since I do love the past three albums. I am very happy to say that this record is amazing. Danger Days may not be as strong as their previous album, but it could just be that I haven't listened to it long enough for it to be up there. Still, I really do recommend this album to all of the MCR fans. This is one of the best albums of the year. It didn't let me down like others have this year.	1
I really love it!	1
Mind sufficiently blown. :)	1
Fantastic album.  Love Sing, and so many others.  Great sound for MCR, unfortunately didn't get into them till very recently and didn't get the chance to see them live.	1
Right price - right item!!  The ease of being able to download the song and listen to it immediately is the main reason I use Amazon.	1
MCR's albums keep getting better and the sound keeps changing for the better. (I also recommend Conventional Weapons -- titled: Number One ... Number Five -- which are essentially the extras from this same time frame that didn't fit this theme.) The theme comes even more alive if you watch the videos that go with it. Highly recommend.	1
Welcome to the black parade was a better overall album, but this one is not bad.  They are a good band I am looking forward to their next album.  Takes a little while getting used to their lighter style, but it flows.  Picked this album up for a $5 special since I liked their previous albums.	1
I so heard of this band years ago and i had no idea they had come out with a new album. Man it's awesome and to top it off it came so fast i was totally taken aback by how fast it came and it was in mint condition. So this was a great buy for me.	1
I'm one of those that really did not give MCR a chance because they were emo or punk or I don't know; I was just judging I admit. Then out of the blue, when this album came out, I just happened to turn to MTV2 and saw the music video for Na Na Na, and it literally blue me away. Not just the song, but the visual style of the music video.  And then Sing is an even better song and a better music video.  But, here's the thing. It's a Post-Apocalyptic concept album--the same with Linkin Park's A Thousand Suns. And they both came out around the same time. It was like when The Prestige and The Illusionist were in theaters. Most people saw The Prestige (A Thousand Suns--and with very mixed results, but I loved it), and not enough people saw the Illusionist (MCR TTLOTFK). It's a shame too many people were fussing about how they hate Linkin Park's experimental career instead of giving MCR a chance. In other words, ATS sort of cast a shadow over MCR since they both had similiar albums and ATS was a little bit more contraversial.  I have listened to Black Parade; it's been in my CD for a while back a year ago. And I can truthfully saw that this album is better (and I have no reason to be bias toward one or the other, but I can say that Linkin Park's ATS may have helped me like this album more).  If you liked this album, you would probably like Linkin Park's A Thousand Suns, and vice versa.	1
Danger Days is a concept album:  it throws us into the badlands of a post-apocalyptic wasteland right from the start.  While there are stand-alone songs, the whole of Danger Days weaves the Mad Max concepts in & out.  Between tracks we get a DJ host named "Dr. Death".  Dr. Death's tongue-in-cheek news, weather & traffic reports are reminiscent of Fallout 3's "ThreeDog" and Iggy Pop's "Angry Bob" (from the cyberpunk film "Hardware").  If there's one thing different here for My Chemical Romance it's the addition of keyboards--"Sing" and "Planetary (GO!)" are good examples of how a song can still be high-energy and original even with a synth background.  The songs that stand out as 'hit' material are more accessible than their earlier work: while The Black Parade was a bit more appealing for existing MCR fans,  you could easily hear "Bulletproof Heart", "Gravity", and "Planetary (GO!)" on the radio and that wouldn't be a bad thing.  Ballads like "S/C/A/R/E/C/R/O/W" and the shout-punk "Na Na Na (Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na)" are pure pop guilty pleasure.  I thought Danger Days would just be a fun album to listen to from time to time; instead I've been pleasantly surprised at the enjoyable sounds they're broadcasting for us in Danger Days, from their own vision of a blasted land.	1
My Chemical Romance has never disappointed me. I've never heard an album of theirs and thought: "This is just bad." But I don't think I've ever been as excited about a MCR album as I was about this one. The second I got it, I started listening to it on full blast, all the way through, and I didn't stop for a week or so. I was pretty much in awe. This isn't just the best thing MCR has done ever, it may be the best album I've heard all year (or at least it's in the top 5).  There isn't any part of Danger Days that drags. It's fast-paced, it's fun, it's sometimes extremely touching. It has a concept that it sticks to throughout, but all of the songs could also make sense out of context. It's the kind of CD that you could listen to over and over and not be bored.  Danger Days shows a lot of musical talent, a great understanding of showmanship, even if it's just through speakers, songwriting ability, and fantastic focus on detail. It doesn't just tell a story, it creates its own world. It's sort of like they took everything they've ever tried to accomplish on an album and turned it up to 11. I, for one, am so impressed and thrilled that it exists.  I was planning on listing highlights of the album, but now I'm having trouble picking just a few. I'll give it a try though. The favorites of mine that really stood out for me were "Save Yourself, I'll Hold Them Back," S/C/A/R/E/C/R/O/W," "Summertime," "Destroya," and "The Kids From Yesterday."	1
Danger Days is a redirection by MCR, following the epic goth/angst driven Black Parade.  This disc is supposed to be a concept album, but nevermind the goofy threads tying it together.  The songs are powerful, fist pumping anthems.  I can't believe Na Na Na didn't get more airplay than it did.  It's a phenomenal track that sets the tone for the rest of the album.  Lying below the surface of these songs is an optimistic, fun driven spirit.  I'm glad they didn't try to do a sequel to the Black Parade.  I think this one outshines their breakthrough, and ought to be given much more recognition than it's gained so far.	1
My Chemical Romance goes the Sgt Pepper's route on "Danger Days," where they record an album in the guise of another band. In MCR's case, it's "The Fabulous Killjoys," set in some sort of future where these rockers are rebels trying to save the world from...well...something. Not that it matters, as Gerard Way paints a great big, noisy picture of a comic book world where Glam Rock rules, Queen is King and David Bowie is a major prophet.  Nowhere is that truer than "Danger Day's" initial single, "Na Na Na." Built entirely around the hook, it just plunges into amphetamine hyper-speed and doesn't let up. There's no way to avoid just how catchy the darn thing is; it's like Bowie's "Jean Genie" switched from 45 to 78 RPM. There's plenty of heroic chants ("Sing," "Planetary"), anthems for saving the girl ("The Only Hope for Me Is You," "The Kids From Yesterday") and soaring choruses all over the place. The story - as it is - gets tied together with vignettes by DJ Dr Deathray in pure comic-book fashion.  While the concept doesn't really gel, the music is still super. There isn't anything as Queenly regal as "The Black Parade's" title song, but then, nothing on that album compared to "Stone Cold Crazy" like "Na Na Na" does. Way still has a way with a phrase, and little couplets like "I've got a bullet-proof heart, you've got a hollow-point smile" pierce out from the music. Also, this album starts to poke into U2 territory with "Sing" and "The Kids From Yesterday"; that's never a bad place to look for inspiration. "Danger Days" shows that My Chemical Romance aren't afraid to tweak the formula that's made them stars.	1
The problem here is that their last album The Black Parade was so good. That being said this album isn't bad, but it's not great like their last effort. Most of the songs here are enjoyable to listen to. From start to finish it's a good album.	1
This CD is amazing!  The Black Parade saved my life, and I was afraid Danger Days would be disappointing but OMG - the boys have outdone themselves.  I've heard some reviews say it's not as hard as their other 2 CDs, but I don't know how they could say that.  Just listen to Vampire Money - it's crazy hard punk.  I totally recommend this CD to anyone who loves MCR, and all of those who don't know much about them.  This is what music is supposed to be - not all that junk we hear on the radio and not all the artists winning the awards.  Support the band!  Buy it, buy it, buy it!	1
I bought this song simply because of the video attached to the song.  Every time I hear it, it brings back the memories of watching him sing it with his little shoulder shrugs and dance moves.  Another singer who passed away too soon.	1
I downloaded it for a wedding.  It made them happy, good quality recording, so I was happy.  I'm not sure I'd have downloaded it otherwise.	1
i started one day thinking about my wife this song came to my mind.iwent to music on my kindle fire and found it.it brought back memories i have been listening to it since thanks tommy a.	1
After hear the song it is very uplifting and great for soothing the soul. It really brought tears to my eyes.	1
When I first heard this on you tube I knew I had to this her version of this song! It just takes me into worship completely. I love it.	1
Great song, great singing.  Another praise and worship song to take you into the presence of God.  Love this song.	1
Experience worship with knowing God loves you for who you are. Draw nigh unto Him and He'll draw nigh to you.	1
I have listen to this song over and over because Oh How I Love the Lord and He is worthy to be praised....	1
Take a trip back in time to the good ole days, and add this awesome track to your collection!  Be happy!	1
I love music	1

GREAT RECORDING - GREAT MESSAGE.	1

It just doesn't get much better than this music especially this track.  Great addition to your music favorite music collection.	1
Classically upbeat, feel good to the soles of your feet record with a driven beat. As an eighties baby I can appreciate it.	1
If you aren't singing along or dancing to this one, check your pulse. If you are a rapper and think you can say it better, think again. The truly great songs can't be touched by the new guys, only honored. This is a great song.	1
This is my favorite song from the O'Jays.  Of course, it's the only one that gets any play on the oldies station, so that helps.	1
Great to listen to and good sounds and music.  Sounds come through very well, even on mps player and smartphone.	1
Its what I listen to at the gym!! Brings back a lot of memories!!! Makes me work harder,makes it easier!!!	1
The chorus of this song is very fin to dance to and it has a very positive message of showing love to others and by doing so getting them to show love. It's great for a party or for background music for a video on a related topic.	1
Sure, Peter Noone was a safe teenybopper idol and the Hermits weren't frequently used in the studio, but what a great string of lightweight pop singles they left behind in the wake of the second wave of the British  Invasion. Granted, this stuff isn't quantum physics, but songs like  "Im Into Something Good," "Silhouettes" and "Mrs.  Brown You've Got a Lovely Daughter" were infectious ear candy for  those of us who were barely in our teens in the mid-sixties.  One of the  first six albums I bought (I now have over 6,000) was Introducing Herman's  Hermits with the three previously mentioned singles on it.  It also  contained a lot of covers like "Sea Cruise" and "I  Understand," but this was a singles band which is what makes this such  a terrific collection.  The only singles missing are their last two to  chart in the U.S.--"Don't Go Out  Into the Rain (You're Going To  Melt)" and "Museum," both from 1967. Instead we're given a  handful of failed singles from 1968 to their breakup in 1970, although  several of them hit the top ten in the UK: "Sunshine Girl" (#8),  "Something's Happening" (#6), "My Sentimental Friend"  (#2) and "Years May Come, Years May Go" (#7).  Since this is,  after all, a UK release it only makes sense that these songs--though  unfamiliar to the average American listener--are included in this Best Of  package.  [Note: No. 1 songs like "Mrs. Brown" and "I'm  Henry VIII, I Am" are on this set, too, even though they were never  released in the UK as singles.  So this collection seems to be a compromise  for fans on both sides of the Atlantic.] In any case, this is a wonderful  collection of sixties pop confection.  So, listen people, this is a dandy  and not a must to avoid. [Ouch!]	1
As it turns out,this is the one-disc version of the 2-CD title of the same name,but with a different cover(see my review).A good collection of the British Invasion band's repertoire,but how many time must these labels put out 'best of' compilations?As I put the CD in my player,I checked out the twenty-five cuts,as usual,with a few of the highlights being "I'm Into Something Good","Wonderful World","Sunshine Girl","Dandy",etc. By today's standards,this is pretty innocent material. Pretty much aimed toward the completists.	1
Among the Herman's Hermits compilations currently available (as I write this, it is still available in the UK), this is as good as any.  Their American chart history was very different from their UK chart history. Some singles were released in one country but not the other and even where a single was released in both, it often did much better in one than the other. Despite having a UK number one hit with their first single, they were much more popular in America than Britain from 1964 to 1966 but the positions were reversed thereafter.  The American top ten hit, Leaning on a lamp post, and two other American top forty hits (Don't go out in the rain, Museum) are not included here, though none of these made the UK charts - only Museum was actually released in the UK. Also missing is Hold on, the title track of a film they starred in. The only UK hit missing is Oh you pretty thing, a Peter Noone solo track recorded in the early seventies.  Herman's Hermits began with I'm into something good (a cover of a song by Earl Jean of the Cookies), their only British number one hit, which also made the American top twenty. Six top ten American hits including two number ones were never released as UK singles, these being Can't you hear my heartbeat (a UK hit for Goldie and the gingerbreads), Mrs Brown you've got a lovely daughter, I'm Henry the eighth I am (an old music hall song), Listen people, Leaning on the lamp post (inexplicably omitted from this collection) and Dandy. Two UK singles - Show me girl, You won't be leaving - made the top twenty but were not released as singles in America.  Some singles were released in both countries, these being Silhouettes (a cover of a fifties song by The Rays), Wonderful world (a song that has also charted for both Sam Cooke and Louis Armstrong at different times), Just a little bit better, A must to avoid, This door swings both ways, No milk today and East west.  There's a kind of hush was a top ten hit in both charts although it was a bigger hit in America. I can take or leave your loving just missed the UK top ten and just missed the American top twenty. After that, Herman's Hermits never again made the American top forty but continued to chart in Britain.  Their remaining major UK hits were Sleepy Joe, Something is happening, My sentimental friend, Years may come years may go and Lady Barbara. Here comes the star (an Australian song) and Bet your life I do (written by members of Hot Chocolate before they became famous for their own music) were lesser UK hits.  Despite missing a few songs, this collection will provide enough Herman's Hermits music for most people. Some years ago, there were two CD's available in the UK titled Best of the EMI years (Volume 1 1964 - 1966, Volume 2 1967 - 1971). These are now out of print but together remain the most comprehensive collection of their music yet released on CD.	1
Herman's Hermits were nearly as successful as The Beatles and The Stones in the sixties and also made the American breakthrough. They had a knack for hummable, melodic tunes and they featured in a movie or two that I saw as a kid (Ms Brown You've Got A Lovely Daughter was one of those movie hits, the daughter in question being the puppy of a racing dog if I remember correctly!). What set them apart, was the lovely harmony vocals and the British accent; unlike most, they never affected an American or even mid-Atlantic accent in their catchy music. This excellent collection includes all of their greatest hits, taking the listener down memory lane to revisit the innocence of the 60s with glorious pop songs like I'm Into Something Good, Sleepy Joe and humorous ditties like I'm Hennery The Eighth I Am. My personal favourites include No Milk Today, There's A Kind Of Hush, My Sentimental Friend, Years May Come, Years May Go and Lady Barbara. I suppose they were considered a teenybop band and therefore weren't taken as seriously as some of their contemporaries, but time has been kind to their music - compared to a lot of today's chart stuff, this is a classic, timeless sound. This album will appeal to everyone who loves clever, tuneful pop performed with feeling and intelligence.	1
This is very folksy, and clearly distinctly Christian-sacred in its tone. It sounds quite amateurish--like something that you might here at a college chapel service during praise and worship.	-1
the song that I bought is great. I received the song in a timely manner. the transaction was hassle-free. I love to shop with Amazon. Keep up the good work.	1

Hey thanks to Amazon.com I got this great christmas song. I downloaded it from the vast libaray that they have. The cd contains many very good songs and catchy beats not thast fm radio music you hear after every thanksgiving. Try IT	1
Very awesome song. Love the harmony and the up beat tone to the song. A must have for the holidays.	1
Great add to your Christmas Playlist.  I love listening to this and highly recommend this to add to your Christmas listening enjoyment.	1
Awesome little holiday tune. I would recommend this to any person who enjoys holiday songs over the Christmas Holiday season.	1
Good Christmas song.  It was free so no complains here. Nice words and music is nice to listen to. Good	1
I like the mix of the two voices and the bluegrass sound they gave to the Christmas music. Want more from these two.	1
Love the song so much that I play it every day!!! Hope to find more of this singer and his group!!!	1
This song is uptempo and full of harmonies.  It is a little country in style.  I think it's catchy and a good song to sign along with if you're so inclined.  I was able to download this as a free mp3 so that made the choice easier.  Listen to the sample and decide for yourself.	1
I got this as a free download from amazon. Nothing can beat free, especially when it's a good song that you like!	1
I love that we can download music so fast and it is available online for free storage and great service.	-1
This is a well-written folk song about the real meaning of Christmas -- a nice change of pace for the holidays.	1
its easy to listen to , not one of my favorite requested but a nice change of pace. and what christmas is about	1
As fof Christmas songs go, this one is nice to listen to but I look for songs to perform at nursing homes. This did not make my top 10 list.	1
Liked the lyrics and the message of the song....a little off put by the country sound (just not one of my favorite genres) but not enough to stop listening. Again the message is the reason for the season	1
This is a Christmas song the really touches the meaning of the season.  I heard it once and bought it.	1
Loving me some Christmas music.	1
Great Music!!!	1
I got this on Amazon and I love it! I had never heard of Landon Smith but I will look for more of his songs.	1
I liked the music and variety it offered.  Very good value for the price and easy to download onto my player.	1
I downloaded this for free, what's to say? It's a nice value and made part of a nice Christmas compilation CD.	1
I love all holiday music and Christmas is the very best music of all.  This is a great selection.  Thanks so much for providing such beautiful music.	1
A great old song from my high school days.  Lots of nostalgia, and hard to find!!	1
It really takes me down memory lane, I couldn't believe I still remember the words! I still love it! love it!	1
Simply put, this is a great song with a nasty beat, great mixing and sound quality, knocking percussion, dope flows and lyrics and even some good singing from Akon (though he sounds the same on every collaboration he does). Snoop and Dre are one hell of a tag-team, and it's a shame to me that they haven't collaborated on a full album together, at least in a long time (see Doggystyle). Now this Detox album better drop soon because he's taken over a decade in between releases, and I've heard enough chit chat about this damn album.	1
dre's back with a new song after 12 years you wanna hear him and snoop together again this is your best bet features akon and some guy who sounds like nate dogg. not a bad song but once again dre talks about smoking weed no new ground too bad the g funk era is gone.	-1
Great song by one of the best producers in the industry right now. I'm glad Dr. Dre doesn't get caught up in the "industry" culture where people are compelled to produce tons of crap in a short span. He takes his time, and produces gold!	1
Money well spent. This item came in a timely manor and performed as expected. I am satisfied and would recommend to a friend.	1
Buy this!! If you like this kind of music, this is a great tune!! Apparently I have to write at least 20 words in review in order for it be be posted. This is a great song, and worth purchasing!!	1
great	1
Great Song	1
Yes, I know ABBA had many hits (my second favorite is "Fernando"); however, most of their music is kind of slow (at least it doesn't have fast beats), this song is an exception  I like the beginning with the piano and kind of slow start, then it moves to a faster beat with guitars and feminine singing.  The words don't impress me much one way or the other (but at least they are not melancholic), and, to me, this is a danceable song. Music is so subjective, but I have tried to be specific with what impressed me with this song.	1
What can I say.  This is Abba.  Well known group and dozens of really great songs, and this is one of them.	1
I loved them when I was a teen and I love them now.  ABBA is one of those groups whose music is ageless.	1
I have been a country man for the past 12 years. switching back to rock and roll and loving it.  great song that I use to listen to when I was younger.	1

It seems sort of silly to write a review about a song you bought. I should think most people buy a song because they like it.	1
Embedded DRM prevents burning Amazon.com downloaded MP3 to a CD. Digital player only.  I do not recommend these downloads for this reason.	-1
Boston --- they don't make music like this anymore.  I love listening to the oldies so much better than most of the so-called music of today.  Guess I'm just lost in a time warp.	1
Love Boston. This album rocks - takes me back to my wonderful school days and fun times. A must have for your Classic Rock music collection.	1
Great.	1
Exceeded my expectations by a mile	1

Another great song from the 80's that I got so that I can rock out to it.  Glad I bought this.	1
I loved it.	1
Archer. K-Log. Top Gun. Kenny Loggins. Danger Zone. I don't really need to say anything else. The only people that doesn't like this song are Hitler and the terrorists....because they're in the Danger Zone.	1
Music review is based solely off of personal taste.  Just because I like it doesn't mean you will.  I love this one.	1
The rest of the album was really, really pretty bad as far as I'm concerned.  A weak follow up to their first album.  No wonder the album wasn't re-mastered, they were smart enough to realize, "Hey, this record is pathetic.  Total waste of vinyl, plastic whatever.  But the song itself, "Don't Look Back"  was, at the time of release worth the cost of the album.  Still love this or I would not have downloaded it.	1
a song that gets played way too much on good ol FM radio loses it's luster	-1
This has got to be one of their very best songs with their very distinctive sound. Fantastic guitar work!	1
Memories	1
If I did not really like this song I wouldn't have bought it...	1
You don't have to be a baby boomer to appreciate good classic rock and roll. Boston is one of the best rock and roll bands ever.	1
I like most of Boston's music - great sound!  I love being able to download music for reasonable price and make my own CD's with just the music I like.	1
These tracks were recorded live at some radio shows in Europe and at some Glamnation shows in the US. Adam is one of the best live performers who actually is better live than on disk. This EP showcases Adam's great vocal abilities.	1
Adam Lambert is one of those rare performers who can actually sing with out all the studio gimmicks. This is a must have for all music purest. This live recording in concert without the benefit of retakes or studio gimmicks shows just how gifted this man is.	1
This album is pure bliss.  Adam Lambert has the vocal chops to do anything.  Anything!  This album feels like Mr. Lambert is singing me a lullaby, except I don't fall asleep, I just keep hitting the "play" button.	1
Acoustic Live captures the sheer beauty of Adam's voice !Very rarely does an artist reach the depths of our souls with their voice ! Adam is that unique one who does. When artistry meets genius " Acoustic Live " the music comes alive,it speaks to the listener,you feel the passion,the pain and the joy ,it's the ultimate musical high ! This is a Masterpiece in every sense of the word ,a must have for all who adore stunning vocals !	1
What do you say when words fail to describe and define something?  I am speechless and that's an oxymoron for me.  But this man's incredible vocal talents leave me absolutely speechless.  This isn't just a voice ... it's a delicate, yet robust, instrument that knows "no boundaries' ... Adam can sing any key, any register, any 'genre' and make it sound like something I've never heard before.  His voice soars to the heavens and just keeps on going beyond.  His control is amazing, his pitch is incredible, his enunciation is impeccable and his desire to please his fans is unparalleled.  Acoustic Live! takes the best of the best from various performances this past year ... his riffs, his nuanced notes, his emotions are all played out on this offering.  I have but one 'complaint' if you can call it that ...  There should have been at least 7 more songs to savor.  A real coup for Mr. Lambert who is fast becoming "The Voice" on the current pop scene.	1
THIS CD IS A HIT FROM START TO FINISH. I LOVED CHARLIE SINCE BACK IN THE DAY WITH THE GAP BAND AND I STILL LOVE HIM TODAY. THIS R&B JAM IS VERY LAID BACK & GOOD AS THEY COME.CHARLIE YOU REALLY DID THIS TIME. A PLUS AND THEN SOME!	1
Although it definately had it's great moments Charlie Wilson's previous solo album&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Uncle-Charlie/dp/B001P4OACE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Uncle Charlie</a>&nbsp;not only suffered from too many cases of overproduction but lack of direction as well,concentrating a little too much on being musically modern than on well constructed songs and grooves. This follow up really does an excellent job at making up for that. Charlie has gone out of his way to make his solo music very distinctive and,as with everything he's done no one is going to mistake this for a Gap Band album from the early 80's. Basically this is an album consisting of midtempo jams that use a lot of modern flourishes such as slippery beats and chanted vocal choruses. But all the same there's still a lot of the unique creative flavors that defines Charlie Wilson. True his voice has weathered to a degree with age but on songs such as "My Girl Is A Dime","You Are","Once And Forever","I Can't Let Go","Where Would I" and "Lotto" both the modern spirit of music and his own musical flavors shine through at the same time,something he didn't quite get to with his previous album. It's on the uptempo songs that the improvement is even more marked. On the twinkling funk/dance of "Never Got Enough" and to a somewhat lesser degree "Life Of The Party" and the stop-n-start "Crying For You"  Charlie manages to make faster music that is both true to the 70's/80's disco and funk scene from which he came but is also true all the same to the somewhat more high tech revial of that music taking place in the here and now. So not only are the grooves strong and make you want to dance and enjoy yourself but it seems to lift his own spirit that he no longer feels he has to stop being true to himself musically to be successful. Sitting in the middle of that road is a faithful cover of Roger Troutman's "I Wanna Be Your Man" featuring Fantasia in a powerful vocal duet. As the previous reviewer pointed out this album is free of rap/hip-hop guests and influences but that is not really what is important. What is important is how this album establishes Wilson as a contempory artist whose able to cross bridges of generations and changes on the music scene since he began while being true not only to himself but the listener. Overall this album has all the makings of a very positive follow up and I'm looking forward to hearing it when it comes.	1
Uncle Charlie still doing his thing after all these years.	1
just love it	1
LOVE IT	1
GREAT CD.  MUST HAVE CD	1
Thanks	1
Great Buy!!!	1

If you don't have his recoreds you need to listen to all of them he is a good vocalist and the songs are great too.	1
Wonderful project.  There won't be one song that you won't like on this CD if you are a Charlie Wilson fan.  He's pretty much put something for everybody on it.  Thoroughly enjoy listening to the CD.	1
This is a fantastic solid CD release by the talented R 'n B singer-songwriter & producer Charlie Wilson, titled "Just Charlie". This fantastic CD has 10 great tracks. The opening track, "My Girl Is A Dime" is great track : great (guitar, vocals, chorus & harmonies). Other great tracks include "You Are" (great lyrics), "I Wanna Be Your Man" (great drums/bass combinations, great varied pitch vocals & the song featuring the fabulous Fantasia), "Life Of The Party" (great dance track with great vocals), "I Can't Go", "Crying For You" & "Where Would I Be?" (Great harmonies). The only okay/good track is "Never Got Enough" & there is no weak track on this fantastic CD to really speak of. Solid tracks include "Once And Forever" (a beautiful ballad track, wonderful music, great vocals & very persuasive lyrics) & "Lotto" (fantastic sound intro, wonderful piano note pickings throughout the song, great rhythm guitar thrown appropriately at intervals, great melody & chorus. Singer has got definitely a great & impressive lady declaring, "Feels like I hit the Lotto..." This is my favourite track from this fantastic CD & hence the title of my review. On overall, I was pleasantly surprised & blown away by the beautiful R 'n B music, vocals & lyrics on this CD release "Just Charlie" by the great Charlie Wilson, a highly recommended listening. A well deserved 5 star performance!	1
This album was is another classic. Anyone who don't respect the mastery of his voice is basically not a music lover. I thought this album might be a tie between his second release. Unlike Trey Songz and these young cats' singing now, I rank Charlie right in the top five of all active R&B artist today. Reverse his role with any of them and he would improve their vocals. I hate when people put in music and listen to it as a fan. Don't just hear the music,listen to it. He has 5 singles right now on this album and I guarantee that! He's in heavenly in rotation right! To that's a sign of a great voice. The man is in his 60's holding it down and keeping our music alive. Not just have a beat with chants! Great album!  Coach,	1

Just love this music and the words. Simple and sincere; from the heart. Our worship leader sings background in his group, and i know he can sing! Vashawn has a humble spirit, and it comes through this song. I don't know him. I just saw in interview with him, and he was what God wants us all to be in that interview.	1
Another tune that I like and I wanted to add some gospel music to my play list. And, this is a good one!	1
I love the lyrics to this song. I also love the harmony of the choir singing in the background. I was happy to see I could get this song in the mp3 format to add to my collection of songs.	1
Every now and than you hear something that stops you and reach you this is the song that does that for me. A must have in my collection and I know you will agree with me also.	1

This is one of the gospel song I like . I will tell anyone about this song cause I like it and it's nice to listen to if you like gospel songs like this one.	1
I taught it to a youth choir and they blessed the congregation.  It is a powerful song and easy to learn. The youth choir was able to relate.	1

I enjoy this song and like that its available in a single instead of full cd I have options that way	1
Awesome song.  Great with daily devotion.  I believe this song is inspired by the Holy Spirit.  Also, I listen to this song while working.	1
This is a Awesome praise song, even thourgh words can't express how Awesome God is but for me this is a Awesome praise song. Only this he shouldn't have said in the song "almost holy one" because God is the Holy One.	1
I purchased this song for my mother. She loves this song. I think the song is ok. Maybe for older listeners.	1
It's a great song! A reminder that there is nobody greater than God. Also the kids love it and find it inspiring as well.	1
This song reminds me that there is nothing in the world that compares to Jesus, and encourages me to lay it all down in exchange for His love!	1
Very inspiring gospel song that is awesome when sung in church or played while exercising at the gym. I highly recommend this song.	1
This is on of my meditation songs. I love it! Starts my day uplifted.  My husband heard it on my playlist in the car and purchased it right away.	1
I always enjoy downloading from Amazon, they make downloading MP3's so easy and they usually always have the individual songs I'm looking for!	1
Since this album contains both `Animal' and `Cannibal' I just decided to post my reviews for both albums here.  There is nothing special that comes from buying this version other than you save a buck or two depending on where you buy it from.  It would have been nice had she given us some B-Side tracks or some remixes or something that validated buying the album, but then again, if you don't own either and want them both then get this one.  First; `Animal':  "When Ke$ha blew up the radio waves with `TiK ToK' I was kind of bewildered.  I mean, the song was catchy and fun to a degree, but she sounded BEYOND drunk and shallow to an extreme, and when she started getting nominated for Grammy's I was taken even further back.  I mean, she didn't seem to have a lot of talent.  I finally got out of my own head and decided to buy this album and check it out.  I get it now.  I've been listening to this album (along with `Cannibal' and her new remix album) nearly non-stop for the last couple weeks and I'm still wrapped up in it.  It's flawed, sure.  There are some songs on this album that just don't work that well, but overall there is far too much good here to dismiss Ke$ha as a talentless hack, sucked into the media storm surrounding her strange sense of style.  She isn't just a `dirty little freak' given more credit than is due.  If anything, she isn't regarded as well as she should be.  This girl not only has a voice (stop acting drunk Ke$ha, you have pipes so use them more) but she has swagger that makes her songs infectious.  As much as I claimed to dislike her for so long, I NEVER change the station when one of her songs comes on since, well, I love listening to this girl.  I mean, who doesn't find something strangely endearing about Ke$ha's onslaught of radio singles?  The albums singles aren't completely indicative of this artist as a whole (maybe I shouldn't go so far as to call her an artist) but it doesn't hurt the cause.  `TiK ToK' may be the worst overall single, and it's still a fun and flirty song that sticks in your head.  `Your Love Is My Drug' is above and beyond my favorite song by Ke$ha.  It is just so boisterous and bouncy and fun and insanely catchy.  It was one of the first POP songs I learnt to play on the guitar, and this was all before I admitted to myself that I liked this girl, the song is that good.  `Take It Off' is just such a ridiculously filthy club track that is filthy in all the right ways.  If this doesn't illicit endless hours of rave-like gyrating then I don't know what will.  `Dancing With Tears In My Eyes' is another side, a softer side, to Ke$ha.  It isn't her best trip down this isle (`Hungover', without doubt or question) but this side to Ke$ha is nicely constructed here.  It retains her catchy pop style, but it adds a layer of heartbreak that sits on her well.  As good as the singles are, the rest of the album mostly exceeds her promise.  My favorite tracks on the album, outside of `Your Love Is My Drug' include the lovelorn `Hungover', the vengeful anthem `Kiss and Tell', the achingly sincere `Blind' and the throwback jingle `Backstabber'.  `Backstabber' is such a cool change of pace, recalls to mind an almost modernized jazz feel with elevated club beats and feisty lyrics.  `Kiss and Tell' rides the same vein as `Your Love Is My Drug' in the musical department, this song taking a different lyrical approach (that of a cheating boyfriend).  The chorus is catchy as all get out and it is just a load of bouncy fun.  `Hungover' is soft and gentle and is the closest thing to `haunting' Ke$ha has on the album.  `Blind' is just beautifully constructed.  It shows that vulnerable side to Ke$ha, and strips away her trademark `drunk singing' and shows us what she can really do vocally.  Why wasn't this song a single?  Why didn't they introduce her as a more serious contender to the pop world?  She has more talent (vocally) than Britney Spears and yet whoever was in charge of her exposure botched that up.  `Blah Blah Blah' is fun and fresh.  It feels a little dated, but in a fun way.  Ke$ha does fall into the whole `shallow' category thanks to her endless barrage of ill-advised lyrics, but it doesn't mean she isn't fun.  She's not as artistically focused as Lady Gaga, so she can't always get away with the density of lyrics, but she understands her audience very well, so it kind of doesn't matter.  `Animal' is a good song, but I think the remix album spoiled me, since the `Switch Remix' is just so brilliant.  `Steven' is okay, and it is a different song for her (although the obvious Imogen Heap inspired opener is kind of obnoxious).  The song grows on you, but it just doesn't work as well as the majority of the album.  I feel about `Boots and Boys' kind of how I feel about `Beautiful, Dirty, Rich' by Gaga; painfully tacky by fun nonetheless.  `Party at a Rich Dudes House' is fun but dumb and does nothing for Ke$ha as an artist.  `Dinosaur' is just bad.  So, in the end, as you can see, I really like this girl.  There, I said it.  I know, it totally makes no sense but what can I say; she delivers.  If you are expecting something truly original or something that will stand the test of time then LOOK ELSEWHERE, but if you want some primo-pop that will get you moving and will surpass your expectations then sink into this one.  It's far better than you think it is!"  Second; `Cannibal':  "Despite the fact that the Billboard Remix of `Animal' is superb and `Blow' is just, well, perfect; this album just doesn't do it for me.  There are only nine tracks here and the majority of them feel cheap and rushed and unfocused and nowhere near the level of surprise and excitement that I felt when listening to `Animal'.  So yeah, `Blow' is awesome and just works like magic.  The bass lines are explosive and the overall energy is insane here.  Her best club track, period.  I love that breakdown at the end ("make it rain on em"), but the entire song is flawless.  The Billboard Remix of `Animal' has most of the haunting texture that was accomplished in the `Switch Remix' on her `Dance Commander' album.  It's eerie and complex and layered beautifully; just superb.  `The Harold Song' is soft and pretty, and the chorus swells upward with perfect pitch, but it feels less entrancing than her better attempts at that vulnerable sound.  `Sleazy' is fun, although the remix featuring Andre 3000 is FAR better.  It's fun and flirty though, and so you'll enjoy it.  `C U Next Tuesday' is a different sound for Ke$ha and it works to a degree.  It isn't too memorable, but it has a dreamy quality that is kind of enchanting while you are listening to it.  OK, I kind of like `Grow a Pear', although I have to say that it is the definition of tacky and doesn't really work, despite the pre-chorus being kind of brilliant ("you should kno-o-oo-oo-ooow").  It's a crazy song really, and for shock value it works (she says mangina, so she gets props for that) but it's also kind of beyond stupid.  I like `We R Who We R' to a certain degree, but it's probably my least favorite single she's released.  `Cannibal' has a nice beat and all but it's also just downright tacky with no real substance or point.  This is Ke$ha buying into what the media wants her to be; a trashy whore.  She is better than this, and she even shows us that in moments of the song where her vocals far outweigh the disgustingly shallow material.  The tribal beat is kind of cool, but I hate the thoughtless lyrical content.  `Crazy Beautiful Life' is also rather vapid to tell you the truth, but the bouncy `Blue October'-lite beat almost makes up for the content.  This album would have been MUCH better had it had five or six more tracks with some substance.  I mean, this is kind of like taking what she did in `Animal' and cutting it in half, and you needed those extra tracks to make up for missteps and add that something special to the album.  Instead it comes off a tad halfhearted."  In conclusion, this works quite well and I have no regrets over indulging in some teenage pop trashiness that is far better than I expected it to be.	1
It's for my daughter, great collection at a great price.	1
The Animal and Cannibal (Deluxe Edition) by Kesha is a mix of electronic,pop, and dance hits.  Your Love Is My Drug, Tik Tok,  and Take It Off showcase a daring musical side that would also make strong party tunes.	1
Pretty good album. I had fun listening to it back in 2011.	1
Well, here I am.  I never thought I'd be reviewing a Kesha album.  I was one of those people who used to deride pop music as "poor quality fodder for the weak masses" when I was younger, but I have since become more diverse and eclectic in my musical tastes over time.  Still, I never thought I would have grown fond of Kesha, of all people - one of the most disliked and disrespected pop artists out there, often held out as a shining example of the degradation of quality present in modern music.  Still, I find myself strangely attracted to her music, and I truly love this album.  I'm now going to go through each song individually, and give a brief explanation of my feelings on them.  "Your Love Is My Drug" (5/5) - Though the metaphor of comparing the rush of love to feeling of drug-induced highs is hardly an original concept, this is still a nice song.  The lyrics aren't particularly inspired or insightful, but the beat and chorus are infectious enough to keep one entertained for the duration of the song.  "Tik Tok" (5/5) - This is arguably Kesha's most well-known song, and it's a good one.  I know many point to this song as merely an example of poor lyricism over a catchy electronic beat, but I honestly like this song.  The feel of the song is very energetic, and the lyrics accurately capture the feeling of pure, unfettered freedom from societal constraints.  You truly get the sense that the narrating character  of the song (an idealized version of Kesha herself, perhaps) really and honestly does not give a f*** whether or not using "a bottle of Jack" as a dental hygiene tool is within acceptable cultural norms.  I especially love this song because the listener of the song gets to vicariously enjoy the feeling of energetic, reckless freedom the song portrays, but without the inherent dangers realistically living such a lifestyle would actually entail.  Also, it does make me wonder what it feels like to be P. Diddy...  "Take It Off" (5/5) - If "Tik Tok" merely touched upon the heady delight of hedonistic freedom, this song exemplifies it to a much greater degree.  The lyrics paint an image of chaotic, unbridled, almost animalistic pleasures taking place - even though the location may not be the most glamorous.  Indeed, the venue is described as "dirty" and a "hole in the wall," foreshadowing future songs that showcase a disdain for upper class aesthetics.  The heavy autotune is used here as well, not as a crutch for a poor singer, but more as a full-blown vocal effect (as with much of her music) and I find it quite enjoyable.  This song always fills me with energy!  "Kiss N Tell" (4/5) - This really isn't one of my favorite Kesha songs.  It's not a very interesting song lyrically, but it's musically catchy enough to keep me entertained.  "Stephen" (4/5) - This also isn't one of my preferred songs.  I can't quite tell if it's meant to be taken seriously or not, but I suspect it's a joke song.  The song is catchy and listenable for the most part, but the parts where Kesha effects an odd tone of voice (almost like a failed attempt at an accent) do grate upon my nerves a bit.  Thankfully, it's a really short part, and the song ends before it outstays its welcome.  "Blah Blah Blah ft. 3OH" (5/5) - I know a lot of people dislike the chorus on this song, and I can understand why.  Listening to the words "blah blah blah" over and over again could be annoying, but in my opinion the song goes just far enough without being overbearing about it.  The music is catchy as you'd expect, but also lyrically somewhat interesting.  The song features one of Kesha's many sexual pursuits and portrays an image of a woman with powerful, dominant sexual urges and does so without an ounce of guilt or shame, which is (along with other songs of hers on the same subject matter) where much of Kesha's reputation for "sluttiness" comes from.  I, however, applaud this view of strong female sexuality unburdened by gendered double-standards (and honestly, if a similar song as this had been sung by a male rapper, for example, no one would have batted an eye, which exactly proves my point).  I have heard the original unofficial version and the one on the album that includes 3OH!3.  They don't add a whole lot in my opinion, but don't really hurt the song either, so either version is worth listening to.  "Hungover" (5/5) - This is one of my favorite songs off of the album because it is the very first song on the album that showcases Kesha's softer side.  This song could be interpreted as a simple song about missing a love interest who has left after a brief fling at a party, but I see deeper meaning in it.  After several tracks celebrating the bright, fiery energy of unrestrained hedonism, this song is a rather poignant counterpoint to the joys of such a lifestyle.  To me, this track represents the darker aspects of a life of constant indulgence.  First off, the title itself, "Hungover," illustrates this since a hangover is technically the unpleasant consequence of the fun of being drunk previously.  Not only is this song just about the more tangible pains such as regretting a lost love interest, or the feelings of loneliness after a party, but it also perfectly captures a hollow feeling of almost existential emptiness.  The inevitable consequence after the hedonistic high is the unpleasant crash - leaving the narrator with the uncomfortable, disquieting question of "what went wrong?"  "Party At a Rich Dude's House" (5/5) - After a song as meaningful as "Hungover," hearing this song next almost gives me whiplash.  This is about as light-hearted as one can get.  The lyrics match the title, as this is just a fun song about a party at a "rich dude's house".  Kesha, as usual, shows her irreverent disdain for the trappings of wealth.  The song does feel a bit jarring after "Hungover" but it could be seen as an attempt to lighten the mood for the listener after such a heavy song, and it IS fun to listen to (especially that bit about throwing up in the closet), so I can't complain.  "Backstabber" (4/5) - This is another song that's not really one of my favorites.  It's just okay.  The chorus is just a bit too repetitive for my tastes, and the lyrical content isn't particularly interesting.  Still, it's a decent enough song, and it doesn't last longer than it should.  "Blind" (5/5) - This is one of the songs that I really like.  It is just a very straight forward song about a breakup, but the driving beat and strong chorus keep it catchy and enjoyable to listen to.  "Dinosaur" (5/5) - This is purely a joke song meant to amuse.  To that end, it succeeds.  The lyrics are humorous enough and I do enjoy the bit of word play involved with spelling out the word dinosaur and having the last two letters made up by the words "you are" (and no, I didn't pick up on that the very first time I listened to this song - clearly, I am an idiot).  Anyway, "Dinosaur" is a very fun and light-hearted song that always makes me crack a smile.  "Dancing With Tears In My Eyes" (5/5) - This is another more downbeat song.  Unlike "Hungover" this one doesn't stir feelings of existential angst - this is a much more straight forward song about a lost love due to breakup (I assume).  Unlike "Blind" where the tone was more one of defiant indignation, this song is clearly about sadness and heartbreak.  It's a lovely song, and I enjoy it.  "Boots and Boys" (3/5) - Sadly, it seems like a great many albums have that one not-so-good song that serves as the filler song.  It's a song that's dull, uninteresting, and put on the album solely to take up space - and this is that song.  The chorus is just too repetitive for my liking and the lyrics are really boring after all the stronger songs on the album.  The only thing that keeps it from a lower score is the fact that it isn't so terrible as to be totally unlistenable.  Still, as far as filler songs go, while this could have been cut or replaced with something better, it's really not as bad as it could have been.  Frankly, we're lucky that it's the only filler song on the album.  "Animal" (5/5) - This is a great standout song on this album.  It really speaks to the idea of "living in the moment" as it details the story of of someone who desperately wants to cling to their relationship just as it is, but knows that this goal is somehow futile.  We never really learn why this is an unattainable goal, but the intensity of that desperate yearning is there nevertheless.  This is truly a beautiful song.  "VIP" (5/5) - This is a bonus track that comes on the Animal + Cannibal Deluxe Edition.  It's definitely one of my favorites.  It's got an absolutely swinging beat, a catchy chorus, and some interesting lyrics, to boot.  The song details Kesha's disdain for the elitist VIP culture, and is definitely worth a listen.  "Dirty Picture Pt. 2" (5/5) - This is the second bonus song from the Deluxe version, and I really like it too.  It's a rather sexually charged song (that's about the exact thing the title says) with a catchy chorus and it always gets me pumped!  You'll notice the "Pt. 2" in the title.  There is actually an original, alternate version of this song that doesn't feature Taoi Cruz.  I've listened to it and I honestly feel this version is the better one - he definitely adds the song and makes it sound better.  Overall Score (5/5): NOTE this score is not a mathematical average of previous scores; it's my subjective overall score.  Even though every single song on this album is not an instant knock-out, I still feel like most of them are good enough to really make this album equal more than the sum of its parts.  It's a fun and enjoyable album and it really puts me in a good mood, and the variety of songs help paint a picture of Kesha as a complex person - possessing both a wild partying side and a softer side.  Overall, it's a great first release.  Note that I did indeed buy the Deluxe 2 Disc version with the Cannibal EP included, but this review is long enough as it is, so I'm going to review that EP separately under its own separate amazon listing.  Go check that out if it interests you.  As for this set, however, I do strongly suggest you buy the 2 Disc Deluxe version if you don't already own Animal or Cannibal by themselves.  You can save a bit of money that way (and get the excellent bonus tracks), and both are definitely worth having.	1
This is great because I hadn't bought either of the albums separately. Other wise it would have been frustrating. It's a good fun album.	1
I have to start with some background on how I got this: I absolutely love Britney's "Femme Fatal" album, and of course Ke$ha co-wrote the smash-hit "Till the World Ends" from that album. My daughter kept telling me this sumemr "you gotta check out Ke$ha, you'll love it", but I never gave it much thought (nor do I listen to mainstream commercial radio). Last month I was visiting Edinburgh, Scotland and there I saw this 2 CD set on sale at a large CD store for such a ridiculously low amount (5 British pounds for the set) that I just had to pick it up, sound unheard. Came home and my daughter suggested I start with the Cannibal CD, and so I did.  "Animal + Cannibal" (2 CDs; 26 tracks; 90 min., plus 3 videos) is the combo "special deluxe edition" of Ke$ha's 2 albums from last year. "Cannibal" (10 tracks; 36 min.) is an incredibly strong collection, with hardly any filler on it. The first 4 tracks "Cannibal", "We R Who We R", "Sleazy" and "Blow" are (along with some of Britney's new stuff) some of the most enjoyable and infectuous mainstream stuff that I've heard in a long time. After a so-so "The Harold Song", it immediately picks up again with great stuff like "Crazy Beautiful Life" and "C U Next Tuesday". The final track "The Sleazy Remix" is not much of a remix, to be honest. This "deluxe" edition also contains 3 music videos (Stephen; Animal; Take It Off). I rate "Cannibal" 4.5 stars.  "Animal" (16 tracks, including 2 bonus tracks; 54 min.) is not nearly as strong for me compared to "Cannibal". Sure, there are several great tracks such as opener "Your Love Is My Drug", "Take It Off", "Blah Blah Blah", and a few others. Knowing how big a hit "Tik Tok" had been, I couldn't help but be disappointed when I heard it, as it certainly isn't the strongest song on here. This "deluxe" edition comes with two bonus tracks: the excellent "VIP" and the okay "Dirty Picture". I rate "Animal" 3.5 stars.  In all, quite the collection, and for what I paid for it in Scotland, an absolute steal!	1
I have always loved Eric Johnson's work.  He seems to keep getting more and more better with age.  A true virtuoso.	1
Eric Johnson's latest effort is awesome!  It's hard to rate which is his best because they are all good, and "Up Close" continues that trend.  From hooky rockers (listen to "Vortexan" without humming it all day!!!) to soothing to catchy this disk has it all played in Eric's smoothly flowing original style.  A home run and highly recommended!	1
The first new studio album in five years from Grammy Award-winning Texas guitar hero Eric Johnson has finally arrived, and it's quite the trip - and well worth the wait. Like his other CDs a mix of instrumentals and vocal songs mostly penned by him and showcasing his unique virtuosity on the electric guitar, Up Close includes some of the best work that Johnson has ever written and recorded.  The album is dripping with crackling guitars. If a guitar died and went to heaven, this is what heaven would sound like. Johnson is on fire, effortlessly weaving incredible, sparkling solos in and out of both the instrumental and vocal tracks. The vocal songs range from energetic blues and rock numbers to gorgeous, heartfelt ballads. Inspired like never before, Johnson plays and sings with a fervor not present in his previous work. Perhaps Johnson is like a fine vintage wine, improving with age.  I was first introduced to the music of Johnson 20 years ago by an employee at a local cable television station I was interning at during my senior year of high school. That was the year Johnson, then 36 years old, released his breakthrough second album, Ah Via Musicom, which achieved the distinction of having three instrumental songs reach the American Top Ten.  As accomplished and groundbreaking as Ah Via Musicom and its edgier and sonically more expansive 1996 follow-up, Venus Isle, are, Johnson has really poured his living, breathing essence into Up Close. The result is the best guitar-based album of the last several years, and one of the best guitar-based and general music albums of all time.  With Up Close, Johnson is at the top of his game as a guitarist, composer, and singer. He has created a masterwork of soulful jazz/pop/rock fusion that exudes passion, especially through his trademark virtuosic guitar sound. Even with guest vocals by Malford Milligan, Steve Miller, and Johnny Lang, and guitar performances by Jimmie Vaughan, Steve Hennig, and Sonny Landreth, the album is clearly all Eric Johnson up close front and center.	1
5 years since Bloom and, for sure, worth the wait.  Funny thing about Eric's music - in my case, there is always 1 song worth the cd price alone!  A "Gem" indeed! Just can't get enough of his beautiful, muddled-precision (Dumble amp?), finger-flying and inventive lead guitar tone.  Mucho kudos to his special guests, too.  Great music from all those dudes!  Johnson's song-writing talent just never disappoints.  A really great "stocking stuffer" music experience to close out 2010.....In Close!	1
I love their music and vocal gift so much. Mary Mary are truly anointed gifts from the Lord.  Remember Jesus loves you no matter what you've done and where you are in life. When no one else likes you He Loves you and what you do is never a surprise to Him.	1
There has honestly been no question that Mary Mary has been one of the most recognized duos in Gospel music the past several years. But every now and then, they can bring the influence into the mainstream fairly well. That shows with their latest hit Walking, from their album Something Big. The song isn't really bad at all. It slowly crept up on me, and really has a nice rhythm to it. However, my one and only gripe about the song from the two of them is that it honestly is very short. I wish they could've made it a little bit longer to appeal for those new to their sound. Still, this is a good download for anyone whom is both new to Mary Mary, or been a hard core fan of the duo. Keep On Walking with this one.  Song: B-	1
Love the song the process to download and play was easy I will definitely purchase more mp3's from amazon.	1

Downloaded this song no problems with my Kindle, I love my machine a joy to have and take whatever I go.	1
Good for driving, exercising, and you time!! It is worth the price and your time. Got an Excellent deal! Try it!	1
I bought this work out to and I love it.  I actually have it playing twice on my MP3 player. Thanks to their reality show I am more aware of their music. I love these ladies and their music!	1
I have always admire these young ladies since the first song I heard many years ago, (In the morning you'll be alright). They are truly women of GOD.	1
another great banger from the sisters love the beat and the vocals this is one to put you in the mood in the morning or in the evening when you wanna get uplifted	1
Mary Mary inspires me on so many levels. This song does not disappoint in that area. It will forever be in rotation on my Kindle Fire and iPod!	1
"Walking," the first single from Mary Mary's upcoming album, "Something Big," treads a fine line between the secular and the sacred.  With a beat that is perfect for "stepping," the song manages to superbly attract the dance crowd and the church folk.  That is probably the pair's intent and if this release is any indication, the album will truly live up to its name, "big" for the singers and "big" for the fans..	1
This is one of my favorite songs, I heard it on the radio so I had to buy it...Great song for a great buy!	1
MY FAVORITE song and it brought back memories of my wife, R.I.P and I on our 7th anniversary , no more to say	1
This is a great song to dance too. A must have at a dance party. Gets the people up out of their chairs and onto the dance floor.	1
How did I not know that mark used to be a rapper? This song is awesome. This guy is like a white Will Smith	1
Upbeat and fun, one of my favorite songs from that era of 1985-1992 when I was in a certain phase of my life where music was part of every day. I always liked this song.	1
This song is one my favorite songs from the early 1990's because of the energy it brings with it.  The lyrics are a bit silly at times, but it has a great beat, tempo, and is great for working out.  Also, the song has survived the passage of time well, as my 6 year old daughter loves the song too.  This song is a definite listen if you like up tempo music!	1
Great song	1
i brough this cuz growin up i couldn't get enough of this song	1
i brought this cuz when my niece was 18 months old its the first song my mom taught her so of course it had to be brought	1

Great workout tune.	1

This is really a good song for exercising with total "good" vibrations!  It's a very fun and "generating" sound for uplifting your mind, and body!	1
Who knew that one day Mark Mark would become a big star, a big name? But this song of his group's has held up well and its use in commercials keeps it in front of people from time to time. As rap music goes, this is pretty inoffensive and easy to listen to. Nice rhythms and a fun single to play once in a while.	1
I Appreciate the way she makes that saxophone call your name. Her music and style is in the prime with some of the best Jazz Artist to date and those that have left us. Jeanette Harris keep doing it girl. I hope they bring a Smooth Jazz FM channel back to Tampa, Florida.	1
Jeanette Harris a musical style is elite with hottest artists that shaped the world of jazz. She is on top in her class.	1
Satisfied is what this CD leaves me. Can't wait to see her in an intimate show bellowing out song of pleasure. This is electrfying!!!!	1
She is a really good sax player. I stumbled on this one. So, I downloaded on my kindle fire and bought the CD also	1
Great sound brought after listening to the short clips but very impress with the outcome added addition to the collection	1
My smooth jazz fix this is what the music needs to take you and thump and give you a groove that is hip	1
Great old tune	1
One of the old classic War songs.  Good rhythm and vocals make this good listening. It makes you want to pull out the bike and go for a ride or your 1980's classic car.	1
One of my favorite songs!  Never get tired of listening to it!	1
I love it __ and Everyone Love's Low Rider !	1
I admit that I simply enjoyed the song Low Rider by War because of the music and the timing of the instruments. Apparently, from what is written online via songfacts, this song alludes to some type of car that was extremely popular in the area of Southern California (where members of the band grew up).	1
fast shipping. great product.	1

Always use as a 'go to' song when performing. This is one song that will get, even the laziest, dancers up onto the floor. Not fast and not too slow. Perfect for the people who grew up in this era and still have the means to dance! LOL	1

War was a staple of of mid 70s AM radio playlists. And although I'm not the arbiter of the band's legacy, I would hope that this is the single they would choose to define their sound. Amazing sounds and images. If you've never heard this song, then you're in for a treat. If you already know it, relisten, and take a little trip (because low rider don't use no gas...an important feature from the days of gas lines!).	1
Everybody needs Low Ri Der in their vocabulary. Makes me want to get a 1949 Mercury, chop it drop it, shave it...and drive it around.	1
I grew up with this band and song. It will always be one of my favorites. Great beat, wonderful tempo.	1
This group still survives and this song still stands up today. Fun song to use during a workout  or just to groove.	1
This song is a classic. You've heard it in movies and television commercials. I didn't have it in my music collection until now. A fun song!	1
IT BRINGS YOU BACK TO WHEN I WAS YOUNG AND REALLY ENJOYED LIFE IT IS A FUN SONG TO LISTEN TO	1
This was always a favorite tune from my past. It not only works on my Kindle, PC (using Amazon Player) but I can play it in iTunes. And it was cheaper than the iTunes store.	1
I have always loved this song and could not wait to get it for my Kindle.  I listen to it all the time.	1
This song is awesome! The recording was nice and clear. I found that prcahsing and dowloading the tune from Amazon was a breeze!	1
Way better than Bob Segar	1
Great song and it does belong in the R & R Hall of Fame,	1
love it, love the way he sings the song, sounds amazing.	1
good song	1
Super catchy	1
The first I have heard of these people, and I kind of like it.  I'll pay attention in the future.	1
This song can be bouncy and fun, there are times where I do not know what she says so I am unsure of how meaningful the lyrics are; but it has a nice beat.	1
It's not super complex. It's not the most musically stimulating song. But it's fun, it's catchy. There's nothing wrong with liking it.	1
Heard this on the radio and I had to use a phone app to identify the tune. I just had to have it! Came home and purchased, love it.	1
Heard this at a wedding for the first time. Good song to add to your play list for those days you are all torqued up!	1
i heard this song on a gum commercial and just loved it from the beginning! i just came to say hello!	1
great song	1
i think I prefer a better version of it	1
Interesting	1
My 1 year old grandson thinks it is a lullaby.	1
for yourorkout pleasure	1
GREAT DEAL	1
I expected this to be the studio version.  It wasn't listed as a Live version, just listed by name and it was the only one that was actually Metallica doing it.  Unlike with digital books, you can cancel it as Ordered by Mistake.  I had to go to iTunes to get the studio version....not happy!	-1
I wanted the original release of this song, but accidently bought this live version. It still is a great version.	1
Tron: Legacy is a very belated sequel to the 1982 science fiction classic Tron, which starred Jeff Bridges and Bruce Boxleitner and introduced audiences to what were then state-of-the-art computer graphics in a story about a computer programmer named Flynn who gets sucked into his own software programme and is forced to take part in vicious gladiatorial games by the omnipotent Master Control Program. The sequel, which is directed by Joseph Kosinski, sees Flynn's son Sam (Garrett Hedlund) suffer the same fate as his father, albeit 20 years later, when he receives a mysterious message from his father's old video game arcade and subsequently becomes trapped in the same digital world - which in the intervening years has become bigger, more visually stunning, and much more dangerous. With the help of a beautiful warrior named Quorra, Kevin must traverse this astonishing landscape and find a way home. The film, which stars Olivia Wilde and Michael Sheen and sees both Bridges and Boxleitner reprising their original roles, is Disney's big movie for Christmas 2010, and features an original score by Daft Punk.  For those unfamiliar with their history, Daft Punk is a French electronic music duo comprising composer-musicians Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo. They first emerged as part of the French house music scene in the early 1990s and became hugely influential and successful, eventually going on to enjoy chart hits such as "Da Funk", "Around the World" and "Harder Better Faster Stronger". Their gimmick is that the pair of them wear stylized crash helmets and futuristic body suits on stage, giving them a sort of detached, other-worldly public persona a little like the Blue Man Group, or what Slipknot used to do in the hard rock scene. Bangalter has previous film music experience, having scored the extremely controversial French film Irrversible as a solo composer in 2002, but this is the first time Daft Punk, as a group, has scored a film.  Following in the footsteps of Wendy Carlos, who scored the original Tron, Daft Punk have expanded their electronic palette to include a 90-piece symphony orchestra recorded in London. The resulting sound is immense. Many readers may be under the impression that I don't like electronic scores, but I can categorically say that this is not the case. I like electronic scores when they have a reason to be electronic, not when synthesizers are simply used to double up or (even worse) imitate on an orchestra. With its overarching themes of the human world being invaded and overtaken by its digital counterpart, Tron: Legacy has a reason to be electronic, and Daft Punk's skilful merging of the two musical palettes is one of the most engaging things about this excellent score.  In terms of the stylistics of the electronic music, there's a little bit of John Carpenter, a little bit of Brad Fiedel, a little bit of Vangelis, and (obviously) a little bit of Wendy Carlos, all mashed together and filtered through Daft Punk's high energy rhythmic sensibility, but with a larger scope and a greater lyricism than any of these other pioneering electronic composers brought to their scores. There are no direct statements of any of Carlos's thematic work on the original Tron, but her fingerprints are everywhere, and I have to say that this is some of the best synth writing I have heard in a film score in years. It becomes even better when it mixes with the large-scale symphonic forces provided by the London orchestra, which humanizes and warms the electronic tones, giving them an emotional center and a great deal of power and gravitas.  Many will inevitably compare this music to that of Hans Zimmer, especially his recent score for Inception (listen to "Recognizer"), but while the orchestral tones are similar in their chord progressions and rhythmic ideas, the electronics have a sophistication way beyond anything anyone from Remote Control has shown to date. The multiplicity of tones, sample types, and nostalgic throwbacks to the synth sounds of the 1980s give the electronic parts of Tron: Legacy a depth and variety almost never heard in scores of this type. Whereas Zimmer and company often limit the scope of their electronic palette, Daft Punk opens theirs up to encompass a massive range.  The opening "Overture" introduces the main theme of the film, a heroic piece which has a vague similarity to Aaron Copland's classic piece Fanfare for the Common Man. "The Grid" features some stirring and dramatic narration by Jeff Bridges (the only cue to do so), which builds to an alien-sounding but wonderfully effective statement of the main theme. In the score's conclusive cues - "C.L.U", "Flynn Lives" and the "Finale" - the theme reaches appropriately epic proportions, while in the "End Titles" cue the theme is accompanied by a modern, driving, defiantly upbeat electronic accompaniment which is simply terrific. There is even room for a conventionally attractive classical love theme, "Adagio for Tron", which features an absolutely gorgeous cello solo, before going on to pick up a bubbling electronic undercurrent during its second half.  The action music is busy and powerful, with thunderous cues like "Rinzler", "The Game Has Changed", "Fall" and "Disc Wars" building layer upon layer of propulsive electronic sound design and booming percussion hits over a bed of churning, endlessly moving string lines. "Outlands" has a terrific Don Davis-style fading brass effect towards the end of the cue, while "Rectifier" has portentous horn blasts and an ominous, I'm-coming-to-get-you string figure which sounds more like something Elliot Goldenthal would write, and has a wonderful, palpable sense of danger. The moments of pure electronica - "The Son of Flynn", "Armory", the Terminator-like "Arena", the groovy "End of Line", the aggressive and highly-charged "Derezzed", the unexpectedly graceful "Solar Sailer" - are fascinating, and often have a mesmerizing dream-like ambience which is astonishingly effective. Some of these cues have the same hypnotic, euphoric aura that 1990s trance music had, which makes perfect sense considering Bangalter and Homem-Christo's respective backgrounds.  Knowing me and my tastes, Tron: Legacy is the last score you would expect me to praise, but there's something about Daft Punk's music here which is immensely engaging and interesting. Maybe it's the sense of freedom and lack of cynicism that composers new to film music always seem to have, being let loose in an exciting new world. Maybe it's their total commitment to the project, and their obvious thrill at being able to incorporate an orchestra into their music for the first time which makes things so appealing. Their electronic sound design is so fresh and lively when compared to the tired old samples we have grown accustomed to hearing over the last few years. And while their orchestral writing is certainly not groundbreaking in any way, it has a pleasing tonality and an appropriately grand scale which makes it very easy to enjoy. It's unlikely to win any awards, but in this case it really doesn't matter: this is one of my favorite scores of the year, and I'm as surprised to be typing that line as I'm sure you are to be reading it.	1
excellent CD, good shipping speed	1
Absolutely phenomenal score from an incredible band.	1
A great album by Daft Punk!  I love listening to all the songs on this album, but ones like Derezzed really help set it apart.  You won't regret buying this album, so buy it now!	1
The Track List  This review is for the COMPLETE score, which is currently not available ANYWHERE to my knowledge, but is the ideal way to hear this score (naturally). For reference, after seeing the film in the theater twice, I believe the correct chronological order of the music to be:  Overture The Grid Father and Son The Son of Flynn Encom Part I Encom Part II Recognizer Armory Arena Round One Rinzler The Game Has Changed Outlands Father and Son Adagio For Tron Nocturne Outlands, Part II Reflections End Of Line Castor Derezzed Fall Sea of Simulation Rectifier Disc Wars C.L.U. Arrival Flynn Lives Sunrise Prelude Tron Legacy (End Titles) Solar Sailer Finale  The Pieces  Overture is a mix of electronic and orchestra, and is not used in the film. It is the main theme of the film which is used many times and is a perfect overture.  The Grid is very similar to Overture, but features a build-up and voice-over by Jeff Bridges. Normally I don't care for voice-overs...but this one is awesome.  Father and Son is a slower version of the main main theme. Beautiful.  The Son of Flynn is an electronic piece that sounds more like a Daft Punk song, building upon its own electronic themes. Great.  Encom Part I and II are atmospheric film music which are uniformly excellent and a nice break after the faster paced The Son of Flynn.  Recognizer is the awesome music you remember from the Tron Legacy Trailer, a sinister foreboding piece that gradually builds upon itself to become an epic awesome musical masterpiece evoking appropriate awe and wonder of the first glimpse of a world only previously imagined.  Armory is a slow down-beat piece played while Sam is being suited up to fight in the games, it's one of my favorite tracks. Slow, methodical, and beautiful.  Arena, Round One, and Rinzler are all battle music from the games and to me are similar in feel. They are more brash, harsh, loud, and lively than more of the other tracks, featuring a lot of digital distortion. Still good though.  The Game Has Changed is another one of the best tracks, featured during the light-cycle battle. Show-down music. Great stuff.  Outlands Part I and II is atmospheric music to evoke the landscape of the digital world, and is similar to something John Williams or James Newton Howard would use in Hook or Peter Pan. Another of my favorites, though both pieces are very similar, almost to the point of being one piece.  Adagio For Tron is slow piece that builds in in sad gravity like Chopin piece, as it describes Flynn's creation of the new Grid, and how it was then corrupted and filled with tragedy by his creation C.L.U.  Nocturne is another of my favorites, mostly because it reminds me of Nightvision from Discovery. It's slow, sad, and sweet. I love it.  Reflections is basically the start of the theme from C.L.U., and thus is part of the theme of that character. Dark and sinister starting with strings and then moving into electronic sounds.  End of Line, Castor, and Derezzed are all club music from the End of Line club. The first is industrial sounding, the second is more rave-type club music (more upbeat, with a cut-out seconds after it starts). Derezzed is arguably the best "Daft-Punk style" track on the score, with infectious beats and addictive electronic stylings that will make you want to listen to it over and over. A perfect piece of music for a stylized fight. Fantastic.  Fall is an appropriate piece of music played during a quick crisis in the film, a piece that gets the heart rate up quick. I don't care for the electronic distortion on this track as it distracts from the main musical theme played.  Sea of Simulation is another slower paced piece that sounds very Daft-Punkish in tone. Soothing and slow, it's the music from the journey on the solar sailor. Another favorite.  Rectifier. Sinister villain music of threatening imminent demise. CodeMaster Talon told me it reminds her of Captain Hook's Theme from Hook. Appropriate music. A good track if you like Zaibach from the Vision of Escaflowne soundtrack or One Winged Angel from Final Fantasy VII.  Disc Wars is a piece full of determination which builds on itself. Less brash than the arena battle music, it is nonetheless appropriate battle music. Excellent.  C.L.U. is naturally the villains' main theme and an excellent sweeping sinister piece which builds upon itself going from sinister to contemplative to urgent, blending the best of Reflections and Fall. Outstanding.  Arrival is your brief breather before the epic finale. It's the music played when our heroes finally arrive at their destination and there is a spiritual tint to the piece as it goes from light and angelic to heavy and mortal. Gates of Valhalla music. Brilliant.  Flynn Lives is by far the best piece of music in the entire score. It is the epic climax music which uses Wagnerian string and horn motifs for brilliant dramatic effect. This piece literally makes the final showdown of the movie what it is. There are no words to describe how brilliant and awesome this piece is. Academy Award material if I ever heard it. The main Tron Legacy theme is used to its maximum potential.  Sunrise Prelude is....gorgeous. It combines the slow beautiful beats of the style of Encom, Armory, or Nocturne with the slow orchestral beauty that comes later from the finale. It's the last track in the movie and being at once sad, dramatic, romantic, and achingly beautiful... is absolutely perfect.  Tron Legacy (End Titles) is perfect ending credits music. It's an electronic, upbeat, catchy, fantastic remix of the main Tron Legacy Theme from Overture, The Grid, ect.  Solar Sailer is another slower paced electronic piece similar to Sea of Simulation (and goes quite well together with it). Not my favorite track as it's just not progressive enough in its melody for my taste, but it's a favorite track for many people (including my girlfriend).  Finale is the Sunrise Prelude (only orchestra with no electronic sounds) which morphs into the main Tron Legacy theme with carefully chosen electronic instrumentation. After a somewhat rousing main theme is quietly takes its leave like the last star of night under the light of day. An wonderful finale to a fantastic score.  The Score  Tron Legacy has one of the greatest musical scores in film history, easily on par with the best of John Williams, James Horner, and perhaps even the revered Ennio Morricone. It's THAT good. And this coming from me, a person who pretty much only listens to video game music, J-pop, and most of all, TONS of orchestral scores for TV shows and films (you would think Silva Screen Records is on speed-dial and City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra as my homepage for all the music I have from everything from El Cid to The Last Starfighter).  The first Tron had a very unique musical score that was largely made-up of electronic sounds, resulting a very appropriate computerized feel. When I heard that Daft Punk would be creating the score for Tron Legacy, I didn't know WHAT to think. On the one hand, I was a huge fan of Daft Punk's album discovery (check out my spotlight review on Amazon if you don't believe me). And on the other hand...there was just so much potential to get everything wrong and ruin the score by producing something that didn't fit with the vibe of the new film and the original. Hence, I tried to keep an open mind and not set my expectations too high so as not to be disappointed. I needn't have worried.  Some have said that the score needs to stand on its own, and is best heard separate from the film. I couldn't disagree more. A ballet is meant to be watched, an opera is meant to be watched, and a film score is meant to be watched. When you see the film Tron Legacy the music fuels everything on-screen. The film was actually cut to the music, resulting the movie feeling very much like an awesome long music video. From the opening notes and title of the film to the epic climax at its finish, I highly recommend seeing the film to fully enjoy the music. That said...  This score manages to perfectly capture the feel of the world of Tron, simultaneously paying tribute to the past while being completely fresh and new (I have heard the score to the original Tron and could not find any copied musical cues whatsoever). Rest assured, the themes in this score are brand new, yet totally appropriate. Sometimes the music is completely electronic, sometimes it is completely orchestral, many times it is a mixture of both, but it is always excellent.  Too Many Adagios?  It appears that most of the negative reviews of this score are from people who were expecting another Daft Punk album. In case you haven't guessed it yet, this is not an album like Discovery. Not even close. There are no words to any of the songs, and they were designed for a film, not a dance club. While some of the tracks certainly are brilliant in a very similar way to Daft Punk's past work (Derezzed and other tracks like End of Line and Castor), primarily this score succeeds as what it was designed to be. A film score.  Some have commented that the score to Tron Legacy is similar to other scores, and this is true. It may at times remind you of Mass Effect (with its heavy synthesizer use) or Inception (with its heavy two-tone use) but that is very unfair. This score blows Inception's score out of the water in every way. I had thought Inception had the best score of the year until I saw Tron Legacy, but it feel incredibly repetitive and unimaginative in comparison. And Mass Effects themes are not nearly as dynamic, full, or original in comparison (the tracks on Mass Effect are also very short).  Flynn Lives, And So Does Daft Punk's Greatest Achievement  When I heard the track Flynn lives I thought of the finale to an Ennio Morricone score like The Good The Bad And The Ugly where a soaring vocal would not be inappropriate. The main theme is simply that strong, that beautiful, that good. Honestly, this score belongs with the best of the best, and deserves to be listened to along with the best of great film composers of the last 30 years (Williams, Silvestri, Powell, Horner, Goldsmith).  It would be absolutely criminal if this score does not win an Academy Award. If you are a fan of film music you owe it to yourself to purchase the score immediately. Just be sure you get the complete score and listen to it in the proper order, and see the film at least once to experience the music the way it was meant to be.  Special note on the LP edition of the score:  This is the most complete version of the score available to my knowledge. While the tracks are not in chronological order, there is only one track missing. Ironically it is one of my favorite tracks and the one I listen to the most, Father and Son. This is especially irritating as this is a Disney album and Disney and Apple are very close partners, yet this is an iTunes exclusive track. Its absence is absolutely idiotic in this otherwise complete album.  Also, the beautiful album notes on a sheet of paper inside of the album rather than on the record sleeves, and there is no digital download or other extras included with this LP.  Musically, the LP version of this album is practically identical to the MP3/CD release versions, however the digital and orchestral parts of the soundtrack blend together slightly better (the digital sounds are less sharp), and the bass is greatly reduced. The bass from the MP3 shakes the foundations when I play the Overture, but is nearly unnoticeable on the LP. I own both and consider both an essential purchase.	1
Love it.	1
The original movie and score were a huge influence of my interest in technology as a child. The new score by Daft Punk does not disappoint with awesome crescendos of emotion. The music portrays emotion, tension and action as effortlessly as John Williams (Star Wars, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, E.T., etc...). This is my favorite score to be released in quite some time.	1
Incredible electronic soundtrack that perfectly fit the look and feel of this Tron sequel, and in many ways a perfect successor to Wendy Carlos' music to the original film. The music for the arena sequences and the alien computer landscape perfectly fit, and how excellent that Daft Punk made cameo's in the film as 'MP3s', spinning the right music for both a party sequence, as well as the party fight (changing the music with a nod of the head.) This score stands out in that its an enjoyable listen isolated from the film as well.	1
Great album.  If I didn't like it I wouldn't have bought it...	1
I don't buy things that I don't like or love!	1
good music	1
One of the best movie soundtracks ever created, evidenced by how much joy Daft Punk took to the project. The film itself is great, but the music? That will last me forever.	1
NOT TO BAD FOR A MUSIC SOUNDTRACK WITHOUT LYRICS. THE INSTRUMENTAL'S ARE NICE, BUT TOO SHORT FOR MY LIKING. THAT'S WHY I GAVE IT 4 STARS.	1
It's great music to listen to, if i like it im sure you will, check it out i know you'll just love it!!	1
In all of these songs there is some very cool beats and rhythms. It falls a little bit to me because it seems that there is to much or little going on. It pushes you instead of pulls.	1
Really great sound track about the voyage with a computer and traveling through our imaginations. Great for kids, great job Disney.	1
I don't know what I was expecting from a soundtrack provided by DP, but this wasn't it; it was better!	1
I came out of the theater after seeing this movie being underwhelmed by much of it but at the same time wanting desperately to own the soundtrack. The mix of orchestral and electronic music is masterful and the scope of the soundtrack is simply epic. This is an astounding piece of work, and I now effectively enjoy the movie as a 2 hour Daft Punk music video.	1
This is my first venture into Daft Punk and I was quite happy.  Good, deep, provoking synthesis.  It has a lot of replay value, and has made subsequent viewings of Tron that much more enjoyable.	1
Don't get me wrong, I am a big Tron fan and I enjoyed Tron Legacy but its strongest point was definitely the music and it is all captured here. The track "The Grid" is iconic as much for its originality as it is for its liberal use throughout the film. This album is definitely worth it and I am strongly considering ordering a hard copy of the album so I can add it to my collection.	1
If you live the movie or even just somewhat enjoyed the move, this is a great album for any collection.  And daft punk is great. If you did not like the movie but you enjoy the music that Daft Punk does then get the Remix album.	1
I love Daft Punk and this soundtrack is really, really good. I initially didn't like this movie. I thought it took too much for me to get to like it but now I love it and especially Jeff Bridges. There is even a scene in the movie where Daft Punk performs in the club. They always do a great job.  You will like this if you like:  - Techno, Dance, 'Drum 'n Bass'-like music. I hope you enjoy this music.	1
This is one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard. The bass is phenomenal. The whole album is great. Daft Punk did an excellent job when they wrote the music for TRON - Legacy.	1
Listening to a soundtrack album of any movie embraces the listener into the world of the movie itself. The soundtracks albums are created for listeners to experience the mood, emotion, and the environment in the movie as it is part of life at the moment. The tron: legacy soundtrack album is a great example of that. It contains 29 songs of bits and pieces written by Daft Punk, for the different scenes in the movie. It is one of the best soundtrack albums out there, in my opinion because of its elegant style of electronic sound as well as the full orchestra incorporation.	1
When the news broke a few years ago that non other than electronic music legends Daft Punk were going to score the music for the "Tron" 2010 reboot, it raised a lot of expectations among Daft Punk fans.  "Tron: Legacy" (22 tracks; 59 min.) starts off with the "Overture" (of course), followed by "The Grid", the only spoken-piece on this (featuring Jeff Bridges). But shortly after that, we are into a full-blown symphonic soundtrack, in which the electronic music is kept to a minimum (but for a few exceptions, more on that later). The general tone of the soundtrack is quite dark and threatening and the London Orchestra shines throughout. It culminates for me in tracks 9 "Outlands", with fantasic orchestral interplay, and 10 "Adagio for Tron", featuring a beautifully pensive orchestra. The "true" Daft Punk sound only comes in a couple of tracks from the nightclub scene in the movie (and in which the guys from Daft Punk make a hilarious brief appearance--when I saw it for the first time, I blurted out to myself "OMG, there's Daft Punk!").  In all, I quite enjoy this soundtrack more than I expected, but then again I love classical music and symphonic movie soundtracks. I have to say that I have been bewildered by the praise from many Daft Punk fans for this release, as this truly has nothing to do with the "usual" Daft Punk music, but to which I can only say that there are lots of other worthy symphonic soundtracks out there worth checking out, if that is really your thing. For the Daft Punk fans who want the "true" Daft Punk sound, check out instead the "Tron: Legacy Reconfigured" album. Last but not least, a shoutout to my son, who bought this for me as a gift some time ago, for no reason (other than knowing I would like this), just because he felt like it. Thanks Rick!	1
A brilliant soundtrack.	1
This is really cool stuff!  The 22 tracks, done in classical orchestra backing with the electronica of Daft Punk give a powerful fullness to the music, somewhat similar to the volumous magic of the Star Wars instrumentation and effect, only better!  It gives you a feeling of magnitude, as if you were sometimes floating in space, looking down on planet Earth.  The synthesization is magnificent.  It is a futuristic-type score that is often heart-thumping and driving.  As much as I love music, I was so "into" the movie when I saw it in the theater, I was not even consciously aware of the music.  Now that I listen to it separately, I wonder why not.  Obviously, the music and film were perfectly blended.  In other words, I was affected by the music without even realizing it.  This is not party music, but something you would play while you are either consciously relaxing and listening to it, or going about your business in the house (cleaning, in your workshop, whatever).  Sometimes it's slow and spacey; sometimes it is driving and thumping. The booming base is awesome.  If you play it in the car, don't blame me if you get a speeding ticket!  It makes you feel kind of invincible--and it makes you want to watch the movie again!  BTW, the CD looks like the disc they wear in the movie, and the album cover looks like it lights up!	1
When I saw the first trailer for TRON: Legacy at the beginning of the year I was immediately impressed by the music in it. I then learned the music was indeed the score and then I learned the score was being composed by the French electronic group Daft Punk. Daft Punk is comprised of the duo that is Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel De Homem-Christo. It's not an unusual sight to see artists from the popular music world foraying into films. In fact almost every great composer came from that background.  So, what was the task at hand here with TRON: Legacy? It was a huge one let me tell you that. Daft Punk had to follow what Wendy Carlos did with the original film. Wendy Carlos is considered to be the mother (or father depending on what time you're talking about) of electronic music. Her score to A Clockwork Orange was revolutionary in a way never thought possible. A decade later she brought her style to TRON. Now fast forward 28 years to today. Daft Punk has delivered a mesmerizing electronic/orchestral experience that carries the spirit of TRON and will blow you away.  The score is crafted and structured almost perfectly and never wanders or loses focus. The soundscape is a world on its own for the most part. The "Overture" introduces us to the grand theme of the film. The music has an echoing of the brilliant electronic scores of the 70's and 80's. Blade Runner by Vangelis was one that jumped to mind. Now let's talk about that soundscape. Like I said for the most part this score has an identity all of its own. However, there are moments where it slips heavily into the Hans Zimmer realm. Many people are calling it an Inception clone. Is it? Not really. The score does have signature Hans Zimmer elements in it. The score was mixed at Hans Zimmer's studio and the composers do thank Hans Zimmer, Harry Gregson-Williams and John Powell in the liner notes of the CD. So it is possible that some of those stylings could have rubbed off on Daft Punk, which is not necessarily a bad thing. Is it a Hans Zimmer score though? Not at all. The style and approach are very unique in their own respect.  The sounds are grand and vivid just as the visuals are. There is a wondrous enormity to the sound of the whole score. It fills the space from wall to wall with terrific simple melodies. I always say simpler is better. The simpler the sound the larger the emotional effect is. The CD is also expertly arranged. The way the score opens, progresses and closes with a reprisal of the themes is fantastic. "Flynn Lives" is quite the track let me tell you and will give you goosebumps. Throughout the whole experience the score swells up and down to create waves of intense and emotionally driven music. It was a fantastic ride and TRON: Legacy is definitely one of the better scores of the year.	1
I read an arcticle recently where the director was asked why he approached Daft Punk for the score, and he said "how could you not go to those guys". I agree, seems like the obvious choice. I've been a DP fan (not double penetration) since the moment I heard "Around The World", and this score is all I hoped for. Of course knowing it was a score I didn't expect a typical DP album like some of these 1 star morons. The music from TRON Legacy achieves what all the best scores should...it's takes you right back into the film. Just close your eyes, don the headphones and enjoy. Though "Derezzed" seemed to make it into all the trailers, there are a few other tracks with a driving beat and that heavy synth DP sound. "End Of Line" is very cool, as is "The Grid". "Fall" is quite dramatic, and "TRON (end titles)" kept me in the theatre longer than usual. 2/3 of this score is indeed mood music, but it has emotion and is still well done. I think Daft Punk succeeded in balancing electronica and symphony about as well as they could have. Oh, and the complaints about the black disc...I've played it fine in my home system, car and pc.	1
This soundtrack fits really well for Daft Punk. I'm really surprised that Disney released a soundtrack this cool. I heard this at a new years eve party and fell in love with it. The whole soundtrack sounded really edgy and cool. This is a must have for any party and long trip. It will defiantely keep you interested!	1
What is it that makes a memorable soundtrack for a film? It could be a memorable classical score, a great bunch of catchy songs, or a combination of each. Now, what happens if you take those two sounds and actually merge them into one? Well, when Tron Legacy was finally ready to go the director knew like its predicesor it still needed to be ahead of its time. That included the sound of the score. So apparently being a fan of the Electronica gurus Daft Punk, he went to them and the rest is history.  I am not a big collector of soundtracks, but the select few I do have just have that certain something. The Tron Legacy soundtrack however has so much more! The score on this soundtrack is a phenomenal blend of electornica with a classical score and the pieces fit perfectly. The sound is fluid and hard hitting and soothing all at the same time. This kind of a collaboration has never been attempted and Daft Punk pulled it off and they should be damn proud.  If you are not a fan of these kinds of sounds I promise you once you see how well it works with the movie as a whole you will run to the store and pick this up. The soundtrack actually moves the movie itself along and makes so much better. The Tron Legacy soundtrack is definitely going to set the bar for the way soundtracks are composed in the future and I would have been great to see this soundtrack get nominated for Best Origonal Score, but since the Academy is a bunch of clueless A**bags, another great piece of music gets over looked.	1
The Track List  This review is for the COMPLETE score, which is currently not available ANYWHERE to my knowledge, but is the ideal way to hear this score (naturally). For reference, after seeing the film in the theater twice, I believe the correct chronological order of the music to be:  Overture The Grid Father and Son The Son of Flynn Encom Part I Encom Part II Recognizer Armory Arena Round One Rinzler The Game Has Changed Outlands Adagio For Tron Nocturne Outlands, Part II Reflections End Of Line Castor Derezzed Fall Sea of Simulation Rectifier Disc Wars C.L.U. Arrival Flynn Lives Sunrise Prelude Tron Legacy (End Titles) Solar Sailer Finale  The Pieces  Overture is a mix of electronic and orchestra, and is not used in the film. It is the main theme of the film which is used many times and is a perfect overture.  The Grid is very similar to Overture, but features a build-up and voice-over by Jeff Bridges. Normally I don't care for voice-overs...but this one is awesome.  Father and Son is a slower version of the main main theme. Beautiful.  The Son of Flynn is an electronic piece that sounds more like a Daft Punk song, building upon its own electronic themes. Great.  Encom Part I and II are atmospheric film music which are uniformly excellent and a nice break after the faster paced The Son of Flynn.  Recognizer is the awesome music you remember from the Tron Legacy Trailer, a sinister foreboding piece that gradually builds upon itself to become an epic awesome musical masterpiece evoking appropriate awe and wonder of the first glimpse of a world only previously imagined.  Armory is a slow down-beat piece played while Sam is being suited up to fight in the games, it's one of my favorite tracks. Slow, methodical, and beautiful.  Arena, Round One, and Rinzler are all battle music from the games and to me are similar in feel. They are more brash, harsh, loud, and lively than more of the other tracks, featuring a lot of digital distortion. Still good though.  The Game Has Changed is another one of the best tracks, featured during the light-cycle battle. Show-down music. Great stuff.  Outlands Part I and II is atmospheric music to evoke the landscape of the digital world, and is similar to something John Williams or James Newton Howard would use in Hook or Peter Pan. Another of my favorites, though both pieces are very similar, almost to the point of being one piece.  Adagio For Tron is slow piece that builds in in sad gravity like Chopin piece, as it describes Flynn's creation of the new Grid, and how it was then corrupted and filled with tragedy by his creation C.L.U.  Nocturne is another of my favorites, mostly because it reminds me of Nightvision from Discovery. It's slow, sad, and sweet. I love it.  Reflections is basically the start of the theme from C.L.U., and thus is part of the theme of that character. Dark and sinister starting with strings and then moving into electronic sounds.  End of Line, Castor, and Derezzed are all club music from the End of Line club. The first is industrial sounding, the second is more rave-type club music (more upbeat, with a cut-out seconds after it starts). Derezzed is arguably the best "Daft-Punk style" track on the score, with infectious beats and addictive electronic stylings that will make you want to listen to it over and over. A perfect piece of music for a stylized fight. Fantastic.  Fall is an appropriate piece of music played during a quick crisis in the film, a piece that gets the heart rate up quick. I don't care for the electronic distortion on this track as it distracts from the main musical theme played.  Sea of Simulation is another slower paced piece that sounds very Daft-Punkish in tone. Soothing and slow, it's the music from the journey on the solar sailor. Another favorite.  Rectifier. Sinister villain music of threatening imminent demise. CodeMaster Talon told me it reminds her of Captain Hook's Theme from Hook. Appropriate music. A good track if you like Zaibach from the Vision of Escaflowne soundtrack or One Winged Angel from Final Fantasy VII.  Disc Wars is a piece full of determination which builds on itself. Less brash than the arena battle music, it is nonetheless appropriate battle music. Excellent.  C.L.U. is naturally the villains' main theme and an excellent sweeping sinister piece which builds upon itself going from sinister to contemplative to urgent, blending the best of Reflections and Fall. Outstanding.  Arrival is your brief breather before the epic finale. It's the music played when our heroes finally arrive at their destination and there is a spiritual tint to the piece as it goes from light and angelic to heavy and mortal. Gates of Valhalla music. Brilliant.  Flynn Lives is by far the best piece of music in the entire score. It is the epic climax music which uses Wagnerian string and horn motifs for brilliant dramatic effect. This piece literally makes the final showdown of the movie what it is. There are no words to describe how brilliant and awesome this piece is. Academy Award material if I ever heard it. The main Tron Legacy theme is used to its maximum potential.  Sunrise Prelude is....gorgeous. It combines the slow beautiful beats of the style of Encom, Armory, or Nocturne with the slow orchestral beauty that comes later from the finale. It's the last track in the movie and being at once sad, dramatic, romantic, and achingly beautiful... is absolutely perfect.  Tron Legacy (End Titles) is perfect ending credits music. It's an electronic, upbeat, catchy, fantastic remix of the main Tron Legacy Theme from Overture, The Grid, ect.  Solar Sailer is another slower paced electronic piece similar to Sea of Simulation (and goes quite well together with it). Not my favorite track as it's just not progressive enough in its melody for my taste, but it's a favorite track for many people (including my girlfriend).  Finale is the Sunrise Prelude (only orchestra with no electronic sounds) which morphs into the main Tron Legacy theme with carefully chosen electronic instrumentation. After a somewhat rousing main theme is quietly takes its leave like the last star of night under the light of day. An wonderful finale to a fantastic score.  The Score  Tron Legacy has one of the greatest musical scores in film history, easily on par with the best of John Williams, James Horner, and perhaps even the revered Ennio Morricone. It's THAT good. And this coming from me, a person who pretty much only listens to video game music, J-pop, and most of all, TONS of orchestral scores for TV shows and films (you would think Silva Screen Records is on speed-dial and City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra as my homepage for all the music I have from everything from El Cid to The Last Starfighter).  The first Tron had a very unique musical score that was largely made-up of electronic sounds, resulting a very appropriate computerized feel. When I heard that Daft Punk would be creating the score for Tron Legacy, I didn't know WHAT to think. On the one hand, I was a huge fan of Daft Punk's album discovery (check out my spotlight review on Amazon if you don't believe me). And on the other hand...there was just so much potential to get everything wrong and ruin the score by producing something that didn't fit with the vibe of the new film and the original. Hence, I tried to keep an open mind and not set my expectations too high so as not to be disappointed. I needn't have worried.  Some have said that the score needs to stand on its own, and is best heard separate from the film. I couldn't disagree more. A ballet is meant to be watched, an opera is meant to be watched, and a film score is meant to be watched. When you see the film Tron Legacy the music fuels everything on-screen. The film was actually cut to the music, resulting the movie feeling very much like an awesome long music video. From the opening notes and title of the film to the epic climax at its finish, I highly recommend seeing the film to fully enjoy the music. That said...  This score manages to perfectly capture the feel of the world of Tron, simultaneously paying tribute to the past while being completely fresh and new (I have heard the score to the original Tron and could not find any copied musical cues whatsoever). Rest assured, the themes in this score are brand new, yet totally appropriate. Sometimes the music is completely electronic, sometimes it is completely orchestral, many times it is a mixture of both, but it is always excellent.  Too Many Adagios?  It appears that most of the negative reviews of this score are from people who were expecting another Daft Punk album. In case you haven't guessed it yet, this is not an album like Discovery. Not even close. There are no words to any of the songs, and they were designed for a film, not a dance club. While some of the tracks certainly are brilliant in a very similar way to Daft Punk's past work (Derezzed and other tracks like End of Line and Castor), primarily this score succeeds as what it was designed to be. A film score.  Some have commented that the score to Tron Legacy is similar to other scores, and this is true. It may at times remind you of Mass Effect (with its heavy synthesizer use) or Inception (with its heavy two-tone use) but that is very unfair. This score blows Inception's score out of the water in every way. I had thought Inception had the best score of the year until I saw Tron Legacy, but it feel incredibly repetitive and unimaginative in comparison. And Mass Effects themes are not nearly as dynamic, full, or original in comparison (the tracks on Mass Effect are also very short).  Flynn Lives, And So Does Daft Punk's Greatest Achievement  When I heard the track Flynn lives I thought of the finale to an Ennio Morricone score like The Good The Bad And The Ugly where a soaring vocal would not be inappropriate. The main theme is simply that strong, that beautiful, that good. Honestly, this score belongs with the best of the best, and deserves to be listened to along with the best of great film composers of the last 30 years (Williams, Silvestri, Powell, Horner, Goldsmith).  It would be absolutely criminal if this score does not win an Academy Award. If you are a fan of film music you owe it to yourself to purchase the score immediately. Just be sure you get the complete score and listen to it in the proper order, and see the film at least once to experience the music the way it was meant to be.	1
I recently had the immense pleasure of catching a showing of Tron: Legacy this past weekend. I enjoyed the film a lot especially Daft Punk's score. I am a bit disappointed that American version of the soundtrack is missing several tracks and a few on the cd have been edited to just a couple of minutes.  I definitely plan on acquiring the 2 cd version of the soundtrack at some point. I would like to hear it as a whole. Now that I got my minor quibbles with the album out of the way, the music in general really blew me away. I liked that the guys in Daft Punk wanted to go beyond what they are known for in dance music. While many music critics were disappointed that the guys would experiment in more orchestral sounds, I thought the blend of classical, ambient, and techno really elevated the film. Of course the guys didn't totally ditched their dance roots. "Derezzed" was nothing short of classic Daft Punk. I totally dug "Tron Legacy" which combined the haunting melodies of the film's theme song with groovy dance beats. I really enjoyed every single track on the album. I was not disappointed in any of the songs. Tron Legacy is definitely a soundtrack worth owning.	1
Being a fan of both Wendy Carlos and Daft Punk, I was torn--should I wish for the old, or embrace the new?  I'm pleased with this score:  its sound may not carry the most recognizable musical themes I remember from the original, but the tone of Daft Punk's score is well matched to the world of Tron just the same.  Consider it more faithful to the *spirit* of Carlos' original score and you'll be happy.  There are sweeping synth passages that pulse and build in intensity ("Recognizer"), digital coughs and blips lifted straight out of an '80s arcade, and all of it is arranged in a way that clearly belongs in the film.  Strings blend excellently into the mix, such as the tracks "Outlands" and "Flynn Lives".  Sometimes a soundtrack--particularly one by a mainstream artist--can be more about promoting the artist than it is about the movie (for  example, the "Spawn" soundtrack was more about making two bands collaborate for each song and pulling music from multiple genres).  Daft Punk are very focused on the task at hand:  they create a sonic soundscape that reminds me why Vangelis' "Chariots of Fire" took the mainstream by storm--"The Grid", "Arena" and "Rinzler" are very similar.  The music to Tron: Legacy sounds just retro enough to hearken back to 1980 while just appealing enough to not sound stale today.  If you're looking for a good sampling of what's here, listen to the passage from "Nocture" to "End of Line" to "Derezzed" to "Fall".  If you want one of the few moments the score sounds most like Daft Punk, that would be "Solar Sailor".  And if you are considering the digital download, yes you do get the booklet.  It doesn't show as available in the track listing but when you download you will receive a digital copy of the booklet in PDF form.  NOTE:  the downloadable MP3 album from Amazon contains one bonus track.  However, reviewers are stating that the downloadable version(s) available from other Amazon stores (such as in the UK at Amazon.co.uk) offer a larger "2 disc" version of the album.  A completist might want to mull over the difference and download that version instead.  I'm not sure how the exchange rate factors into such a purchase, so if you're not from the UK, keep that in mind.	1
The music is  one of the things that make the film special. This soundtrack by Daft Punk is truly a symphony of many different sounds.  My favorite track is "Adagio For Tron".  This track starts off slow and builds in intensity while maintaining a graceful tone.  I love the violins playing on this song. "Nocturne" is another beautiful slow track that I enjoy.  "Clu" and "The Game Has Changed" are two tracks with a  menacing sounding tone.  "Clu" is an intense sounding four minutes.  "The Game Has Changed" also has a powerful beat. I love both tracks. "Solar Sailor" is a subtle two and a half minutes. This track sounds very soothing to me. I love the upbeat and techno sound of "Derezzed". This track pumps me up with energy. "Outlands" has a frantic tone to it. "Rinzler" has a suspenseful tone to it that is enjoyable to listen to. I really love the variety of tones to this score. The End Titles sound very funky.  It makes me feel more confident for some reason.  The music of Daft Punk is empowering, exciting and serene at certain moments of this soundtrack. I absolutely love every minute of it.	1
When it was first announced Daft Punk would be doing the score for "Tron: Legacy," anyone who has ever held the original film on a pedestal among sci-fi movies was most likely overcome with joy.  After all, Daft Punk's synthesized sound pulls a great deal from the early `80s when the original film was released. Even their helmeted costumes seem to resemble those worn in the computer world of "Tron."  However, what Daft Punk created was something much more serious than any of their studio albums. Like Christopher Nolan's new take on "Batman," "Tron: Legacy" has been described as much darker than the original film and Daft Punk's score, released ten days before the film, follows suit.  The overture introduces Daft Punk's newest adventure with quite possibly the biggest departure from their original sound to be heard on the record.  Gentle horns gradually fill the air just as a full string section takes shape. By the end of "Overture," timpani, cymbals, and a gong provide the ultimate climax, dramatically announcing Daft Punk's first full collaborative venture into cinema and the return of Tron simultaneously.  "The Grid" is the only track with any words put to the music. With Jeff Bridges providing a voiceover for the first half of the track, the song acts as an introduction for anyone who may have missed the first film.  As "The Grid" fades out and "The Son Of Flynn" opens with an arpeggiated synthesizer, listeners get their first taste of Daft Punks blend between their own unique sound and classical music. Although the majority of the tracks on "Tron: Legacy" utilize an excellent balance between the two styles, some of the tracks sway one way or the other, drastically changing the mood of the piece.  Tracks like "The Game Has Changed" offer an almost exclusively classical instrumentation while transforming the percussion section into a series of powerful electronic hits, rattling the eardrums and taking focus off of the ominous strings hidden beneath.  Although the London Philharmonic Orchestra provides all of the string arrangements, their true feature comes on "Adagio for Tron." Sounding a bit like Hans Zimmer's "Hummel Gets the Rockets" from the soundtrack for "The Rock," Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo of Daft Punk use this track as a means of showing off their prowess with orchestration, complete with a simple, yet beautiful cello solo.  As the mood darkens, the music dives deeper into the electronic realm while still maintaining at least some aspects of a symphonic orchestra. Tracks like "End of Line" pull entirely from the electronic realm except for a sustained string part which would typically get lost in a Daft Punk mix, but because of their extraordinary presence on the rest of the album, they remain surprisingly noticeable.  Easily the song most reminiscent of Daft Punk's previous work is the club ready "Derezzed." It's almost hard to believe this track falls on the same album as "Adagio for Tron," but Daft Punk fans will make "Derezzed" the song from the movie to know. Although less than two minutes in length, "Derezzed" finds Daft Punk letting loose and presenting their trademark sound for the world to see on the big screen.  Without words to accompany the music, this album may not ring as positively for all Daft Punk fans, but it will easily add a great deal to the action captured on film. This may be Daft Punk's first venture into film soundtracks, but the duo's masterful work on "Tron: Legacy" makes it hard to believe it will be their last.

For this soundtrack, don't think 80s, One More Time, or a new soundtrack masterpiece to cap off an already amazing year. No, think Inception-Lite, then add in some electronic beats. By Inception-Lite, I mean the music between soundtracks is kind of interchangeable, but there's clearly a more quality winner here. In fact, much of the soundtrack barrows from the Hans Zimmer school of thinking, not just the certain horn structure that was so infamously from Inception (The Game has Changed), but the strings, how the strings are arranged, the moods given off, etc. Granted, I know the soundtrack was composed before Inception ever came out, but the whole thing sounds very Zimmer-Esque.  Why is this? Well, the soundtrack may be "by" Daft Punk, but Joseph Trapanese did much of the orchestrations, with only the guidance of Daft Punk. Daft themselves did the electronic work. As a result, the work sounds very much like a modern soundtrack. But since Zimmer holds the example of the modern soundtrack currently in my mind, it sounds very derivitive of that for me. Not that this is a bad thing per say, but the entire score does hold an ever-present feeling of familiarity. It's mixed up by the electronic elements of course, which sound something straight out of a future nightclub, complete with weird DJ stuff, drumbeats and other tricks of the Daft Punk trade. Still, it doesn't sound amazing enough to stand on its own.  Another thing I must bring about is the theme. You know, the one introduced in the first track as a grandiose piece, comes back for a couple tracks at the beginning, then starting back with "Arrival," dominates the rest of the proceedings. It's a rather simple horn piece, and it's used to great effect, but if feels like it also uses it as a crutch much too often. Introduction moment. Bring in the theme. Action moment. Bring in the theme. Emotional moment. Bring in the theme. Triumphant moment. Bring in the theme. End credits. Bring in the theme, remixed by Daft Punk. You see my point? It's a great and memorable theme, but it's a bit too simple to be as used as often as it is.  Overall, Tron Legacy the soundtrack is not bad. It's a solid effort, but suffers from the stark feeling of familiarity wherever you go. Did it really take them two years to compose this? Still it's a must-have for soundtrack fans, and if it draws in non-soundtrack fans, then I'm fine with that too.  One thing I'll say though, if the soundtrack's job was to make you want to see the movie, then they certainly accomplished that.  3.5/5 Stars	1

I vividly remember when I first saw the original movie TRON back in 1982&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Tron-20th-Anniversary-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B00005OCMR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Tron (20th Anniversary Collector's Edition)</a>.  I was in college and I saw it on a whim in an afternoon matinee.  I was completely amazed and hooked.  I went back and saw it again that evening, and again the following day, maybe even twice (this was back in the days before everyone had video players).  I have since watched the original 1982 TRON many, many times.  Then when the trailers and promos for TRON:LEGACY hit the screens, I started salivating.  Today I saw the TRON:LEGACY soundtrack MP3 version on sale for $3.99, so I pounced on it.  I've been listening to it on and off all day and I have to say that two things have struck me.  First of all, it is heavy electronica, but not overbearing.  That is appropriate given the nature of the film it supports.  Secondly, it is engaging but not overpowering music, though in a few tracks here and there the music really drives!  You need to know up front that many of the tracks are quite similar to each other, but that also makes sense since this music provides the background for a world inside the web, where electronics are everything.  And, the music provides a consistency of place and environment that I look forward to experiencing in the movie.  I have been a fan of electronica-focused music since I started listening to the Alan Parsons Project (APP) in the late 1970s (I am still a fan and APP music appears regularly on my playlists).  If you like APP and the original movie TRON, I think I can say with a pretty high degree of confidence that you will like this soundtrack.  Now, with that said, you are not likely to hear any of these instrumental tracks anyplace other than during the movie or on this album.  There are no chart-climbers here.  Even so, I am extremely glad that I purchased this album.  It is enjoyable, listenable, and makes me look forward to the theatrical release of TRON:LEGACY even more.  5 stars for fans of electronica (e.g, APP) and TRON 4 stars for most everyone else  BTW - my teenaged sons and I plan to watch&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Tron-20th-Anniversary-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B00005OCMR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Tron (20th Anniversary Collector's Edition)</a>&nbsp;immediately before we head to the theater to see TRON:LEGACY later this month.  I'm counting the days!	1
This is a really nice soundtrack effort by Daft punk. I have listened to some electronica albums by them and thought I would give this album a try. After a couple of listens I really like this fast paced soundtrack. Can't wait to watch with with the full movie in 3D. Thanks Amazon for a wonderful deal.	1
When the word got out that Daft Punk would be scoring the sequel to TRON it generated something of a phenomenon- where fans were more excited for a soundtrack than a movie itself.  Unlike the original TRON soundtrack, there's no silliness or cheesy comedy on display here; the ridiculous scherzo is replaced with both a poignant adagio and a nocturne to underscore the higher stakes in this upgrade to the TRON saga. Orchestrations mixed with techno beats might put off those looking for a pure Daft Punk release, but remember this is a movie score and tracks will be scene-specific and somewhat repetitive in their themes. Plotlines and emotional arcs are being explored here; the symphony lends gravitas to the proceedings and it all comes out pretty good. The only real negatives here are that most tracks are pretty short, clocking in between 1  to 2  minutes. The other is that this isn't a complete release- a few tracks are held back for the deluxe version and one is only available directly from iTunes. How typically Disney...  Wendy Carlos' semi-iconic 24-note TRON theme is used both sparingly and excessively; you get heavy doses of it, but only in the tracks at the beginning, middle and end of the cd. There's also a couple of secondary themes at work here, notably a cello rush and sub-tonal pulsing rhythm that are very effective at setting the mood. The rest of the cuts are peppered with soundscapes that are strikingly similar to Hans Zimmer, Brad Fiedel, and a couple others. But after having seen the flick, I can say it does all fit very well.  Some Highlights: *Potential Spoilers*  Overture- Begins with a single extended synth note underscored by cello until a solo trombone breaks in at the 0:25 mark with a couple of solemn two-noters before it blossoms into a reprise of the TRON theme at 0:52. At 1:35 the synths, string and brass come together (in a pretty rough edit) for another reprise. A very nice build up, but it doesn't appear in the film.  The Grid- Used for the movie's opening sequence, it starts with a brief plot exposition delivered by Jeff Bridges, supported by a pulsing percussion and the debut of one of the secondary themes- an 8-note pulsing reverb- accompanied by a string version of the theme before ending with a TRON reprise in synth.  Recognizer- Named for the police program that sends Sam Flynn and other captured programs to the arena games.  Built upon the second major theme- the 8-note cello rush- accompanied by some Zimmer-style bottom and driving sub-tones, it also incorporates an alternate TRON keyboard motif to flesh things out. Very reminiscent of the themes from 'The Dark Knight'.  Rinzler- 8-note sub-tonal intro highlighted by a couple of 4-note crashing percussion sets. Some eerie synth notes blend into a pulsed rhythm supported by cello. Synths and rhythm rise in full with a new set of dystopian percussion before falling into a fade out.  A nice intro for C.L.U.'s enigmatic enforcer.  The Game Has Changed- Plays during this film's version of the iconic- and very well done- lightcycle battle, it's also the track used in the initial teaser footage and first trailers. Starts with the 8-note sub-tonal pulse used in 'Rinzler', it only takes ten seconds for the dystopic drums to appear. At :20 seconds they crash head on with a violin rush behind them. Switches to strings and synths until the sub-tones return at 1:13 and the string emerge again, followed by more synth. This sequence repeats a couple times with some alternate synths and filtering thrown in making for a dark, intriguing mix before ending with the crashing drums.  End of Line- Welcome to the most exclusive club in The Grid.  Shades of Thomas Dolby with the snare and kick synth combo. Leads into high and mid layered keyboards before adding a couple layers of 7-note synths to carry it. Add in some flutter and warbling effects and it's not bad.  Derezzed- Used for the smackdown fight scene inside the End of Line Club between the heroes and some goons- it's 100% Daft Punk! Fast, frenzied and completely schizoid- and I love the ending when it goes all off-kilter and spastic... in a good way! Only thing wrong with it is it's over way too soon at only 1:44.  TRON Legacy End Credits- Built upon repeating layers of 5-note synths over a 4-note looped drum track. At 1:18 the TRON theme comes in on keyboard. The third time through the theme it gets fleshed out with part of the orchestra as the synths drop underneath. Makes for a nice denouement.  Though I'm not a big fan of the franchise this soundtrack had me pumped up to see this flick and it's a flawless complement to the movie. An excellent piece of work.	1

I have loved all of Tank's albums, but wow, this one is pretty amazin.  This is what R & B should sound like.  Get it...	1
Thanks	1
This was nice album. People slept on it in my opinion.  Tank has always made pretty good music, and it didn't change with this album at all.	1
I got this album because I liked Tank.  He didn't disappoint me.  His album is inspiring and recommend it to everyone.	1
Money well spent. This item came in a timely manor and performed as expected. I am satisfied and would recommend to a friend.	1
My favorite song is Emergency but that's about it.  It lacks something and I can't put my finger on what.	-1
There was not many soulful singers left in the music industry that stuck to r&b melodies. I am so pleased with this cd, it offers everything the music industry was losing. My favorite track is Amazing. I have not had a cd that I can listen to from the beginning to the end until now. Every track on this cd is really really good.	1
This album was such a very good album. I loved ALL the tracks. All of them. This is real R&B right here. I LOVE LOVE LOVE it.	1
It took me a little while to warm up to Tank. I had not listened closely to the lyrics of "Maybe I Deserve" until recently and now I know just how powerful the song is lyrically. Unfortunately, it was featured on a terrible album he released entitled "Force of Nature." That is simply one of the worse albums I have ever listened to. Fast forward. I recently saw Tank at the 2011 Essence Music Festival and I liked him. He is a confident and sexy guy, so I decided to give him another try. I am delighted that I did because "Now or Never" was a sensational listening experience!  "Now or Never" is heavy on the ballads, but that is always fine with a sap such as myself. The ballads are quite touching. Yes, indeed, the songwriting here is something else! He's a fine songwriter. "Emergency" is one of my favorite songs. I listened to it over and over again. I like the hook and the emotion he sang with. "Amazing" is another highlight where Tank gives us his best falsetto. Here, Tank is telling his woman how amazing and incredible she is. It's a true love song. "I Can't Make You Love Me" has a nice melody, but sad words. Ironically, the most sub-par song here is one that he joins forces with Chris Brown on: "Foreplay." I'm sorry, but this song is simply average. With all that talent on a track, I feel that these fellers could have done something better.  Overall, this album is certainly a winner. I recommend it to lovers of R&B music. I enjoyed just about every moment.  Mikeisha's Top 5 1. "Can I" 2. "I Can't Make You Love Me" 3. "Emergency" 4. "Amazing" 5. "Sex Music"	1
To me, this album, while being a good disc, didn't totally deliver as far as I was concerned. I wouldn't totally dismiss it either, cause it came with some great songs that will put you in the mood emotionally and physically.  Tank is good for breaking thru the barriers with his talent and he definitely knows how to choose the material that suits his voice and his persona.  The problem for me was that outside of AMAZING, nothing else stood out at attention.  Again, don't dismiss, cause it will still be worth it, especially during those quite moments in your life.	1
I expected more from Tank, I enjoyed 1 or 2 songs and that is it. Maybe more to others liking.	-1
Loved his last album but this just wan't the same... Amazing is a good song but it seems like he was trying to be Atlantic's top selling artist instead of tank.	-1
From day 1 I knew that Durrell"Tank"Babbs was and is an artist that i would proudly invest my money in and he hasn't disappointed me yet.  I have all his albums but "One Man" Is still my all time favorite , However i have to admit that some of the songs from "Now Or Never" are starting to grow on me.  "Can I" "Celebration" and Of course the Remake Of "I Cant Make You Love Me"( a song that i have always loved and identified with that in Tanks hands made me love it even more.. and its creepy because i always wished that he would lend his vocal talents to cover songs and this is one of the songs i had picked out for him.  Im so crazy about Tank that i made a CD of all his songs that i love .. when it came down to the songs "Can I" - "Heartbreaker" and "One Man" i used my studio program to merge the Intro's together with the actual song to make it flow as if it was all 1 track.  In the beginning he would upset me because as a Vocalist myself i could hear so much potential in his voice that he wasn't using but i am happy to report that he has tapped into that potential full force and it is paying off.  I have watched him evolve as a Vocalist - Writer - Producer and overall Artist.  It saddens me that he like Frankie Beverly & Calvin Richardson(Among Many Others) has not recieved his credit in the industry.. but at the end of the day he still has the people's love and appreciation for his work and contributions to the world of music.  I HIGLY RECOMMEND THIS ALBUM  SUPPORT REAL MUSIC MAKING A COME BACK  WE THE TROOPS NEED TO HELP OUR R&B GENERAL BY USING OUR "FORCES OF NATURE" TO HELP THIS "ONE MAN" FIGHT AN UPHILL BATTLE SO THAT HE CAN PLANT HIS FLAG OF "SEX LOVE AND PAIN" ON THE TOP OF THAT HILL AND GO DOWN IN HISTORY AS ONE OF R&B'S FINEST  ITS NOW OR NEVER!!!!!!!!	1
I love this album sooo much. Real R&B. I listen to it over & over & over again. I love it.	1
In 2001, a slow jam (Maybe I Deserve) about heartbreak by an upcoming  artist named Tank was all over the radio. The song didn't really impress me, however his second single Slowly blew and I decided to give his debut album Forces Of Nature a chance. Needless to say the album wasn't that good and his follow up release One Man didn't fare much better for me either. Tank was M.I.A. for five years before his next release the worthy follow up Sex, Love & Pain which featured the huge hit Please Don't GO. Now with his fourth album Now or Never, Tank has not only delivered his best album but one of the best R&B albums of 2010. From the opening  interlude Showtime to the triple punch of the singles Sex Music, Celebration & Emergency there isn't one song on this CD that needs to be skipped over. This is an album for people who appericate real R&B and it's a testament to an artist's talent to have an album with all slow jams which never becomes boring. The central theme of this CD is sex which is evident in the songs Sex Music, Foreplay, Can I and Emergency. However Tank does touch on relationships with Keep it 100 and his excellent cover of I Can't Make You Love Me. All this is a fine album overall and I'm glad that Tank finally found his voice in R&B.	1
I don't know. Maybe my ears been starving for some music like this I dunno. I've been a Tank fan since Force of Nature. I have to say throughout his career he's kept up the consistency. He's always made songs to me that can not only be radio hits or something to dance to in a club, but something you can lay back and unwind to. Music is becoming so, how do i put this, manufactured maybe? Where good artists aren't sticking to what made fans gravitate to them. They're trying to be like the next artist because that artist is currently getting all the radio play, etc. I'm happy to see this guy stick to his guns and continuosly put out a good album. And did i mention no Auto-Tune? I know I say that in all my reviews. Believe me I have nothing against auto-tune. I just think its slowly starting to play out. You know where you sit down and listen to an album and you can't tell the difference from track 1 to 12 because they all sound the same? Yea that kind of played out.	1
At first , I felt like the CD was more of the same with alot of the songs sounding the same, until I listened again. Tank likes to keep it in the bedroom often and he has a few standouts here so I will give it 4 stars. I really wanted to give it 3.5 but the Chris Brown and Drake cameos pushed it over the to 4	1
I listen to this cd 2 times.  I can not find one song that I like.  This guy can not sing and the music is bad.  I could have wrote better songs.	-1
Tank has always been one of the most overlooked and underrated R&B singers since the 2000's. Though he is an exceptional contemporary R&B singer that has had a small handful of solo hits and modest record sales, he is probably more know for his excellent songwriting and production of other major R&B artists. In a lot of ways, I like to think Tank is kind of like a very very poor man's R. Kelly (Just Speaking in terms of chart success, not Poor Man in terms of talent). Much like R. Kelly, Tank normally writes, produces, plays and sings his own music along with the music he contributes to other artists. He has worked with a extensively long list of grade A R&B singers over the past five years, like Jamie Foxx, Omarion, Donell Jones, Joe, Keith Sweat, Marques Houston, Pleasure P, Fantasia, Keri Hilson, Toni Braxton, Chris Brown, Monica and Day 26 just to name a few... And while Tank has never been a truly standout artist/producer/songwriter, he should be a lot more popular as he makes some of the best modern day R&B music out, weather its his music or someone elses. And while I do think he is very underrated, he has managed to have 4 successful singles, 900,000 records sold amongst his first three solo albums, and he's gotten nominated for four grammy's, two of those nominations were for his own solo music. But even with that very impressive resume, he still tends to get overlooked quite often, and unfortunately I think that trend will continue on this long awaited Now Or Never album...While I'm sure he will have a decent first week sales (His last album, 2007's Sex, Love & Pain managed to move 100,000 in the first week surprisingly), Now Or Never will most likely fall off very fast much like his last album. But never the less, that doesnt detract from his super talent.  Like I stated above, Tank has never really had that "Breakthrough" success in terms of his solo career. He's one of those artists who has a hit here and there and sells a decent amount of records (Enough to keep him afloat), but never truly breaks into the mainstream for good. The first time people really remember hearing Tank, was probably with his first solo hit, the slow jam ballad "Maybe I Deserve", which ended up being his first and only top 40 hit and probably his biggest hit to date. The single was lifted from his 2001 debut album, Force Of Nature, which managed to go gold, probably due to the success of that hit. Now though, Force of Nature has slipped out of print, and is considered a rare collectors item if you can manage to get your hands on a copy. Force of Nature itself though, was honestly a pretty miserable album, which is probably why it only had one hit. It was very awkward and it sounded like Tank didn't really know what he was trying to accomplish with the record. The production was bad, the songwriting was sub-par at best, and the songs were just kind of boring, which is why I'm kind of surprised people are willing to pay upwards of 50 dollars for the album. Besides the two singles and maybe one other track on the album, the rest of the album was very bland. So when it came time for round two from Tank in late 2002, people were definitely skeptical. His second album, 2002's One Man, was unfortunately much to similar to his debut. Again besides the singles (the title track and a party track titled "Let Me Live"), there wasn't a whole to offer on the album. Although I will admit, it was a step forward from his last album, as there were at least a few tracks on the album that were worth listening to more than once. But overall, One Man still wasn't up to par with other contemporary R&B albums being released at the time, not even close really. Not to mention the album failed to have even one single achieve chart success, causing the album to flop even harder than his debut. So after his first to albums failed to meet expectations (Critically and Commercially), Tank disappeared for quite a lengthy period of time, although he was still producing and writing for other artists, but he wasn't getting a whole lot of attention for it. Tank didn't resurface in the music industry as a singer again until 2005 when he released a promotional single titled "I Love Them Girls", which also went unnoticed, though it was a fantastic stripper anthem lol So in early 2007, when he finally started to make his official comeback as a solo artist with his first single from his third studio album, Sex, Love & Pain, it had felt like he was gone for more than five years, especially since a lot of people didn't even know he released an album back 2002. So needless to say, the anticipation for Sex, Love & Pain was high. Especially since he finally started to get more recognition for his production credits on other artists records, most noteworthy his work on Jamie Foxx's Unpredictable album which ended up being one of the best and most successful albums of 2005/2006. So like I said, expectations were sky high (Including mine). The Sex, Love & Pain album ended up being a pretty successful album for him, especially since the first single "Please Don't Go" ended up being one of the more popular R&B singles of the year, and serving as the true comeback record for him earning him two grammy nominations. All in all, Sex, Love & Pain was by far his best album at the time, mostly because his production and songwriting had gotten sooooo much better over that five year gap between albums, probably due to how in demand he was during that time as a producer for other big name R&B artists. Not to mention he was taken in as part of one of the best R&B production teams of the past 10 years, The Underdogs. But with that said, and even though SL&P was his best album, I still can't deny that it was disappointing somewhat. It could have been the sky high expectations, or it could have been the fact that the album itself just wasn't that great still. Don't get me wrong, it definitely wasn't nearly as bad as his first two albums, it wasn't bad at all, but it still felt like it was missing something that made it a truly good or great standout R&B album...  So now, three and a half years later, we are in kind of the same spot with his newest album, 2010's Now Or Never. Tank has had a tendency to take his sweet time with his albums, especially his two most recent albums. So if Tank has perfected anything in his 10 year run in the music business, its that he has learned how to form very high anticipation for his albums. Just like Sex, Love & Pain, Now Or Never's expectations and anticipation was sky high after a three and a half year wait for the album, and over two years worth of push backs and leaks. This album has gone through it's fair share of modifications, in fact, its probably nothing like what the first original tracklisting suggested it to be. Now Or Never's original title was Sex, Love & Pain II: The All Night Experience, and it was intended to be released on his original label Blackground Records. But with almost the entire album leaked to the net before there was even a single released for the album, and a decreasing album budget with an already sinking label in Blackground, in early 2009 Tank decided to jump ship and take his talents to the SUPER label Atlantic Records, which i fully supported seeing it as he would probably finally get some good promotion and a good album budget (I mean have any of you seen the music video for his huge 2007 single "Pleas Don't Go" from Blackground records??? Talk about a low budget video). So he scrapped the entire Sex, Love & Pain II album in summer of 09, and started working on a totally new record, to be titled...you guessed it, Now Or Never. So in summer of 2010 when the rare up tempo banger/baby maker "Sex Music" was released as the first single to lukewarm ratings and chartings, the album was again pushed back from it's September 21st release date, to a November 2nd release, making the anticipation grow even more. And I honestly don't understand how "Sex Music" was such a flop on the charts, because it had everything Tank would have needed to have a radio smash...it had banging club beat, seductive lyrics, and instantly catchy hook, not to mention the song was just flat out great and super addictive. So honestly I was glad that the single floppped, because I just didn't want it to get over played on the radio, and "Sex Music" ended up serving more as a promo single than an actual single. But then unfortunately, the album got pushed back yet again, this time to a December 14th release date. The second single released was a typical Tank ballad about heartbreak in "Emergency", which was another great classic Tank track, that reminded a lot of fans and critics alike of Pleasure P's baby maker "Under", which coincidentally was also produced by Tank. And again, similar to "Sex Music", "Emergency" never really gained any steam on the charts, so far peaking at number 47 on the R&B charts, which signifies another failed single for Tank's Now Or Never album...But at least it didn't get pushed back this time, and now the album has finally arrived. And after just one listen I could immediately tell that it was by far Tank's best album. What seperates Now Or Never from Tank's previous albums, is the production and the vibe of the album. On Tank's previous records, like I stated earlier, the production and songwriting had a tendency to be bland at times (Actually more often than not), causing his previous albums to drag in some parts. But on Now Or Never he steps up not only his production, but his contributors also bring their A game. Like on "Scream", the Jim Jonsin produced piano tinged ballad about screaming, and not just sexually, is definitely a standout. And on the smooth babymaker "Amazing", Tank uses his soft falsetto to caress the gentle beat, and what Tank claims to be his favorite track on the album "Can I", is also another extremely steamy baby maker and probably the best song on the album, which if played at the right moment it's promised someone will become pregnant. And the mid tempo acoustic driven "Keep It 100" is another standout heartbreak ballad, produced by Tank and his production team Song Dynasty, who dominates the production on the record. And the Drake assisted mid tempo club banger "Celebration", produced by R&B duo The Stereotypes, is probably Tank's last hope for a hit single on this Now Or Never album, as its probably one of the more catchy songs on the album. The cover of Bonnie Rait's love ballad "I Can't Make You Love Me" is also surprisingly another standout, as Tank makes the track his own with his amazing vocals on the track. Thats another thing I want to point out about this record, is that vocally Tank has never sounded better than he does on this album. His smooth vocals just glide across all of these tracks almost effortlessly, making it very clear as to why I have always thought Tank has one of the best most mature contemporary R&B voices among the rather large group of modern day R&B singers. All in all, Now Or Never isn't going to be the best album of the year by any means, nor will it have any sort of tremendous chart success either, but it's the first Tank album that there isn't an ounce of disappointment in me about the record. It's the first Tank album to truly meet and exceed my expectations, which i was honestly starting to become skeptical if he would ever be able to give us a truly great or even a solidly good contemporary R&B album, after his first three records were mediocre at best. But it's finally happended, and Now Or Never proves that Tank is more than just a excellent producer/songwriter, he is also an excellent solo R&B artist.  Grade: B	1

This is a great & fantastic CD release by the talented, prolific singer-songwriter & King of R n' B, Robert Kelly, titled, "Love Letter". This Great CD opens with "Love Letter (Prelude)", a beautiful & soulful 'al cappella' track, voicing being greatful for the support he received during his recent troubles with the law & as well as more about the great music in this CD. "Love Letter" is the next great track : great drum kit sound, laid-back track with great vocals (title track). "Love Letter Christmas" is great remix of the title track. "Number One Hit" is another great track (electro-R n' B track, great bass/drums combination & great clear vocals). Other great tracks include "Just Can't Get Enough" (soul sound & soulful vocals), "Radio Message" (Great vocals & very persuasive lyrics, singer pleading very convincingly, "Baby come back"), "Love Is" (great vocals & harmonies, featuring K. Michelle) & "You Are Not Alone" (a hidden track on my CD, great effort & interpretation by Robert Kelly of the classic song he wrote for Michael Jackson, a well fitting tribute to the great fallen musician. His vocals don't fully match Michael Jackson's, but is nevertheless a great effort, tribute & his own interpretation of the this great song). Good tracks include "Not Feelin' The Love", "Taxi Cab", "Just Like That" (great guitar intro & bass/drum combination) & "Music Must Be A Lady" (great orchestral intro, the track starts quite greatly but does fail to keep its greatness as it goes on). "Lost In Your Love" is a solid track/gem : a beautiful grand piano sound, fantastic melody, wonderful bass/drum combination, great chorus, harmonies & lyrics. He declares "Baby tonight I wanna be lost in your love", very convincingly. "When  A Women Loves" is another solid track/gem : probably inspired by Percy Sledge's classic, "When A Man Loves A Woman". The song has a beautiful melody, great high pitched vocals & persuasive lyrics. He proclaims a woman, "She loves for real... She fills my soul". "How Do I Tell Her?" is a masterpiece of a song : beautiful orchestral background/base track, very melodical, 'heartbreaking' lyrics & vocals. The song also has well matched rhythm guitar, grand piano & a nice saxophone near the end. The singer fading singing, "Bye bye baby...bye bye baby...", what a gem of a song! This is my favourite track from this fantastic CD & hence the title of my review. This great CD has no weak track to really talk of. On overall, this is a great & fantastic CD release by the talented, Chicago (IL) born, Robert Kelly, a highly recommended listening. The King of R n' B is back with a bang! A great early Christmas gift to his loyal fans!	1
I love this CD..."Number One Hit" is my favorite because my boyfriend plays it and sings it to me all the time and we have a long distance relationship so I am always getting videos of him playing R. Kelly songs in the background!  R. Kelly sings beautifully on this Love Letter CD; not too many artists can actually sing a love song as good as R. Kelly....awesome CD!	1
I am very satisfied with my purchase.	1
LOVE IT	1
There is no other.	1
Great CD.	1
Thanks	1
Purchased this cd because of When A Woman Loves.....and I must say that I'm truly enjoying the full cd. What a talent!	1
thanks a lot	1
OK... it's R. Kelly.  You know what you're getting when you pop his CD in the player.  Great production, vocals and overall good lyrics.  The kid from Chi-town does it again.  A must to complete a collection.	1
Great music	1
I have seen R.Kelly romantic side from this CD,and I have to admit I love it. I can't wait until he has a new CD out. I will buy it.	1
Heard this song in a nightclub, fell in love and surprised that it was R. Kelly sing it.  Very beautitul song.	1
Let me say first off- I love Redman and still do. 'Dare iz a Darkside' is one of my fav hip-hip lps ever......but seriously.  'Reggie' is horrid. It's sounds nothing like past RM albums, it's plain bubblegum radio station Hip-Pop. C'mon, audio-tune? I hate to sound this way but this is bad. I know he'll make it up for us but I have nuthing more to say except, do NOT purchase this album. Sorry Red.	-1
Worst album he has ever made. honestly, I am a Redman fan and I have all of his  cds.  I hate to do this to Mr Reggie but this cd is a joke.  This album is like a collection of throw away tracks that never made any albums or mixtapes.  Only two songs are good and the rest are just horrible. What is with the slow R&B tracks and the auto tune?  Most of the guest emcees aren't worthy and add nothing to the failure called an album.  I just can't see Redman giving the okay to drop this cd.  Something tells me this was an album owed to the record label and wanted out of his contract.  Not sure, the artist must still realize that his reputation and name is still on it.  Again, I am huge Redman fan and I really hated to do this to my boy.  But, if he is going to have the audacity to release this album, then why can't I tell him and others the truth?  Stay away from this album.  or buy the two songs that are actually okay.  Redman, you owe me for this turd.	-1
It's a totally different version of the song than what was played in the mainstream media, which was the one I wanted. I found the one I wanted in their greatest hits.	-1
I have never heard of this singer and the version I downloaded was not the one I was looking for. I am probably looking for a needle in a haystack. The one I think I am looking for is by Joe stampley.	-1
It was ok.	-1
i downloaded this song because it was free and have regreted it . . . but free is free so you get what you get	-1
I chose this for relaxation into sleep. So for that it's fine. But if you stay awake long enough some where through it are these annoying sounds. Guess it's supposed to be whales???? sounded more like squeaky hinges. So for that I couldn't give it any higher ratings.	-1
The short preview they give for this seems relaxing and easy going, but once I paid and downloaded I realized the rest of it is not so much like the preview.  The random high pitched "ding" noises are distracting and don't allow you to reach any sort of relaxed feeling before the next disturbance comes along and ruins the experience.  I tried to turn the volume down low enough that the ding didn't disturb me, but then I really couldn't hear the rest of it and only heard random dings.  I don't recommend this one.	-1
I love The Birthday Massacre. I have been a fan for a few years now since I first heard of the band on a Cleopatra records compilation. Their song "Video Kid" was what got me hooked on the band. 4 or 5 years later, I find myself not saying that about the band's latest effort Pins & Needles. I never have been so disappointed in a band until now. Pins & Needles lacks the addictive pop hooks or originality that made me fall in love with them to begin with. I also found a few songs on the new album to be regurgitation of songs like "Red Stars" and "Looking Glass" from their previous full length album. Not very original IMO. I really did want to like Pins & Needles but sadly I did not nor can I recommend it either. I'll take the new Cylab and Unter Null cds over the new TBM cd any day.	-1
The intriguingly poignant combination of melodies, beats,.. the bass, guitar,.. drums, produces a melancholic sound.  It literally pulls the listener in.  When the singer's .."nothing.." first occurs and breaks and falls is my favorite part, and that's just "Nothing."  It's on my playlist loving it.  Another great song on this particular album is "For the first time."	-1
Didn't like	-1
normally I like the BBC National Orchestra of Wales, normally I like TV music. I love Dr Who as a series. I figured what could possibly go wrong, I listened to the quick demo, I paid for it...ugh. this is NOT what aired at the Proms, and its not what plays in the show, they've edited and as the Brits would say, bolluxed it all up. delete the middle, that'll make it all better.	-1
Not worth the price: this digital download was free!	-1

Is there ever a good day to be in a fight?  Song is a lament of the hardships (relative, of course) we experience daily. I'd give the band another try despite not being too crazy about this particular tune.	-1
Not a fan of the new sound. They used to be the second coming of the Pogues, now they sound like many bands.	-1
I am only slightly aware of Justin Bieber's trajectory, but his recent comments on various social issues caught my attention. On several issues he seemed to have somewhat confused takes on things, leaving people to wonder what he meant. But on the matter of a woman being raped and then becoming pregnant which she then sought to terminate, he was unequivocal. Justin Bieber stated: "Everything happens for a reason." This was his way of explaining why he thought it was wrong for the woman to seek termination. Well, the bizarre theology which apparently this kid has been raised with is not the first issue. Even though it sounds more like pagan fatalism than any sort of Christianity. But that begs the question, which is closely related to the only point that really matters here: Are we now even beyond the idiot culture? Have we moved even a step further into the quicksand. Is our cultural vacancy now to be assumed  as pregnant with potential philosophy???  This can be shown phenomenologically by the fact that comparable stars of the past  like Leif Garret were not asked for their philosophical reflection. But now the modern equivalent, Justin Bieber, is. I think Justin Bieber should quit philosophizing  and reflect rather on practical maters like  whether he will be wearing a bandana on his head in future as faded star Leif Garret does now: Vanitas vanitatum!	-1

It's a cute song, sung by a 15 year old with a catchy hook, "baby, baby, baby..." The beats and instrumentals are extremely catchy.	-1
I think i'd rather have some homeless bum defecate on my face if faced with the alternative of sitting in a padded room listening to this song in an endless loop. people apparently are exposed to this torture in department stores across America, where Baby is played frequently to the desensitized shoppers.	-1
I only bought this because my middle school students needed it for a project.  I hate his music and I hate how he treats people.	-1
This song by Justin Beiber was so sugar pop sweet, I got a cavity from it. And Luda in the middle was odd for such a goofy song.	-1
I don't have any idea about this. I don't even know who this is. so I cant rate it. sorry.	-1
Sorry, but this song is not my taste.  It has too much dissonance (clashing notes and chords on the guitar) and the tempo drags. The singer's voice lacks emotion and is difficult to understand in places.  It's not terrible, I just don't like it.  But if you like heavy metal, you might like it.	-1
There is no question that Jennifer Lopez hasn't been in the best of shapes musically. While people have finally discovered her more than just a singer with being one of the new judges for American Idol this year, she sadly hasn't been able to deliver strongly with her music. Her latest single On The Floor, isn't really a driven dance song. It actually felt less than stellar compared to her On The 6 days when she became a songstress whom had crossed beyond the boundaries. Following her dissapointing singles Louboutons & Fresh Out The Oven from her cancelled Love record which was suppose to be released last year but fell through the cracks with being dropped with Sony, she really has lost her shine in great music. I think Jennifer needs to try a different rout with her voice. Hopefully, she can come back with a better single to call her own the next time around. Anyway, Jenny form the block, good luck with American Idol. You're gonna need it!  Song: D	-1
The song has a great beat and I like listening to the lyrics.  The lyrics has a nice meaning to them.	-1
This is an average song. I basically like most of it except for the chorus (dance the night away... etc...). The beginning is pretty catchy and I like Pitbull's parts.	-1
Stop already.	-1
i didn't purchase this	-1
Initially sounds great,  then goes bad quickly.	-1
THIS IS A OK SONG IT WAS EASY TO DOWNLOAD WITH NO PROBLEMS AT ALL  THE ALBUM MIGHT BE OK I DONT LIKE ADELE	-1
I love music by Adele - she is so talented.  I am enjoying listening to it as background music on my Kindle as I play the games!	-1
I initially loved this song. But it got way too over-played on the radio and I believe has become over-rated entirely. She's a great artist and has an amazing voice but is beginning to annoy me with each of her singles being way too over-played.	-1
When all have failed you or shown true love which is God, remember they can't give what they don't have. NOt great and powerful	-1
never received it!! had previous review for other songs but only noticed 17 at that time. now I see all these. just copy and paste the other review for everything cuz same comments apply :-(-  had forgotten I even ordered this until I started writing reviews for other purchases!! ugghhhh!!!  other songs this same comment. damn! since I don't remember them I most likely don't have a copy of the original order, where it was supposed to come from and too late to get the item or be refunded!! ugghhhh!!!  close to $100 worth of music never received!!	-1
Small Source of Comfort is the worst Bruce Cockburn music ever!  Bruce Cockburn has not done it for me over the last several years.  His early work (up through "Circles In The Stream") has a sort of innocence to it.  It was filled with spiritual wonder and well crafted lyrics - poetic and insightful.  I lost interest from "Circles" until "Stealing fire" and "World of Wonders".  The CD "Big Circumstance" seemed to go back into his heavy political activism views.  His live CD was okay, but nothing like his first live CD "Circles in the Stream".  Then a jewel came along reviving Bruce as fresh and insightful again with "Nothing but a burning light".  Then came along a nice Christmas CD filled with unique arrangements, and then "Dart to the Heart". "Nothing" and "Dart" were fantastic.  Bruce seemed to back away from his political BS and back into spiritual songs, insightful lyrics, and songs filled with real meaning.  Bruce was back.  Then came Charity.  A pretty good CD but lacking a bit from "Nothing" & "Dart".  Then it went downhill.  "Breakfast" and "You've never seen everything" were musically good, but lyrically lackluster.  Kind of dull.  Then it got worse.  "Life short" was a dissapointment and a CD rarely listend to at all.  I thought it could not get any worse until "Small source of comfort" came out.  This is the first CD that is total trash and worthless.  Bruce has lost his mind, is alienating most everyone and appealing to the liberal left to the maximum.  Sometime I did not agree with some of Bruce's songs but I could undersand was coming from, or his view point.  I am open to other opnions and with music, you certainly have to be.  However, with "Small source of comfort" instead of love, spiritual, and political; the listener gets ALL political mumbo jumbo.  Yuck.  The music is not as good, Bruce's voice is not as strong, and most disappointing is the lyrical content.  The songs have no passion or insightful meaning, just quotable hate and low tolerance for anything other than those who preach tolerance but are the least tolerant of all.  I used to really enjoy Bruce Cockburn.  Wonder if the spiritual side will reawaken sometime in the near future?  Who knows, but "Small Source of Comfort" is awful.  I really tried to give it a fair shake by using the test of time.  I could not even listen to it when I got it so I put it away for a year and tried it again.  No such luck, it is just as awful today as when I first recevied it.  Can Bruce produce something worthy of listening to again?  He is so far left now that I do not know if he can pull himself back into some sort of normalcy.  Then again, I guess that is the trouble with the normal and I will just be waiting on a miracle.  MAD	-1
Honestly for Chris Brown, he just really has had a harsh time in the spotlight, since the startling strife from the abuse with Rihanna. Unfortunately, it showed with the lackluster strength of Grafitti, and it is still showing right here on Deuces. His latest single is just not up to par on what it could be for him. He also had that not just in the song, but in his breaking down performance at the BET Awards suring his tribute to Michael Jackson on Man In The Mirror. I think honestly that Chris should really take a longer look into himself and then get back out there. He really hasn't shown that he is reallly ready for a full-length return, aces high but deuces low for Chris.  Song: D	-1

Please don't give me that "she's only 13" excuse. It's lame. Even some of Miley's songs are miles ahead of this. And JoJo when she was 13 blows this girl WAY out of the water. OMG. Can you say monotone? The only thing that kinda saves this song is the average dance beat that will get preteens and the like jumpin'. I can see the 5 and 6 year olds that my mom takes care of dancing to this. Nothing much more though.  I'm sorry but you can look every which way but this is not a good pop song. Check out Teardrops on My Guitar (Pop Version), Party In The USA, Get Out (Leave) or Over It by Taylor Swift, Miley Cyrus, JoJo and Katherine McPhee respectively. Yes, those songs are a bit older but they totally stomp on this girl's talent by far.  I hope her voice matures eventually. For the sake of humanity!  2 stars (or a 4/10).	-1
Sometimes I'm ashamed to have been born in America. The mainstream media turns talentless idiotis like this into "stars". What filth. I'd rather listen to Megadeth's Risk.	-1
I tend to avoid mainstream pop music, especially the stuff aimed at tweenagers (Miley Cyrus, Justin Bieber, etc).  But when I make an exception, it's for a very special song -- and one such song is Rebecca Black's "Friday."  Few songs in my life have touched me as deeply and powerfully as this one song. This stirring, symphonic melody rises with a chorus of "yeah-ah-ahs!", over a stretch of gritty synth and wild beats. Black's angelic, shimmering voice lulls you with her expansive vocal range until you barely notice the subtlety and brilliance of the lyrics.  Oh, the lyrics. In what other pop song could you hear dazzling symbolism like "I'm drivin', cruisin'/fast lanes, switching lanes"?  In what other could you hear evocative poetry like "Yesterday was Thursday/Today is Friday"? In what other could you hear such a searing, scathing glimpse into the psyche of American's youth, such as "Gotta make my mind up/which seat can I take?"  Indeed, young genius -- which seat should you take? Clearly she is debating whether to embrace the predictable safety of suburban life (back seat) or the wild unfettered life of a true artist (front seat). IN NO OTHER SONG will you find such unabashed genius. I get woozy just thinking about it.  ...  Okay, time to turn the sarcasm off. This song is every bit as bad as most people say it is -- a massive sonic hairball of ear-curling vocals, flaccid pop tunes and devastatingly vapid lyrics. Most tween pop is vapid, but this waves a banner with shining V-A-P-I-D letter emblazoned on it.  Honestly, Black's vocals are horrible -- flat and autotuned into a droning whine, until you just want to punch your speakers to make the yowls of "Fryyyyydaaaaayyy" stop coming out of them. And you cannot even be distracted by the music because we just get a thin glittery blanket of tepid techno  that doesn't really even have a tune.  And oh.... the lyrics. If you wanted to sing a song about partying on the weekend, don't bore us with descriptions of driving, eating cereal and being passed by schoolbuses. To make matters worse, Black bores us with descriptions of how Friday comes after Thursday and before Saturday, and how Saturday is right before Sunday. Is this song aimed at the Sesame Street crowd?  Rebecca Black's "Friday" is one of those transcendently horrible songs that achieves novelty status because it is JUST THAT BAD. Do not listen after eating.	-1
Did not like this remix. Deleted it.	-1
When it has came down to Britney Spears, musically she has lost her way in her music. After the dissapointing performance at Good Morning America this week, many people are starting to wonder whether she really is coming back strong. There is no question that she has lost it, with her latest single, Till The World Ends, the second single from Britney's album Femme Fetale. I really felt that she wasn't honestly drawn into the rhythm of the song. I absolutely wasn't even impressed with Britney's drive into the song. It really felt like it was weaker than auto-tune. All that I can honestly say about Britney Spears is that she needs to work herself out again, than come back into the world.  Song: F+	-1
All I can say is this album is kinda boring.  Not one songs jumps at me and makes me care.  I don't hate this album but I don't love it either...I am kinda like...oh okay I see but that's it.  It should've been so much better.  After all Plastic Beach was excellent and fun.  The Fall is boring and tiresome.  I will still pay attention to Gorillaz...but don't think I will be listening to this album very much.	-1
However the Melody is workable or doable but after a while the repeated word gravity get redundant and make me want to just say something silly about the whole song. I listen to it because it has lovely rhythm to it.	-1
this is just not the type of music i was looking for for Halloween at all super annoying and dumb	-1
I loved the first Sixx AM album, it blew me away.  The new album not so much.  Starts off good, first couple of tracks are hot but it quickly grows cold with tacky lyrics and songs that sound like something I have heard before.  Nothing worse than when you hear a song for the first time and you can finish the artist's lines in the song because they have no creativity to them.  "Cut with a knife", "Angel like you with Devil like Me"... etc.  It's been done before Nikki.  DJ Ashba, amazing.  His playing saves this album.  Can't wait to hear him on a GnR studio album.	-1
There is no qeustion that when an artist seems to be on fire with their music career, they seem to feel like they can do no wrong. Unfortunately for Rihanna, she has hit a massive mistake with her latest mistake, a remix of her song S&M with the auto-tuned Britney Spears. It is honestly a very sad situation. It was one thing for Rihanna to come out a lackluster song, but honestly Rihanna and Britney do not even have any chemistry together at all. It was one thing when Britney did Me Against The Music with Madonna 8 years ago and for Rihanna to score with What's My Name for casual fans, but this is definitely a step into the wrong direction. Should she have a made a better attempt, yes! Especially with someone who has a real voice, and not as a manufactured duet. Hopefully, Rihanna will learn from it, but I doubt she will.  Song: D	-1
I had not bought an album of Emmylou Harris music in years and I was in Barnes and Nobel the other day and was looking for something good to listen to.  I saw her name and thought yes, that is what I want.  They had several to pick from but I chose this one based on the cover, which I thougth was interesting.  BIG MISTAKE.  This is nothing like the Emmylou from years gone by.  I understand that you need to re-invent yourself sometimes to reach new and younger fans but you must remain true to yourself too.  This was not my cup of tea by any means and I found the songs boring, loud and her sweet voice covered up by the music.  I was very disappointed and wondered what had made her choose this route.  Well I hope she has not forgotten her older true fans who put her on top in the first place.  Wake up Emmylou.	-1
Ok this is the last Emmylou Harris CD I will ever buy!  5 clunkers in a row.  You can fool me once (with Mirror Ball), and you can fool me twice (with Red Dirt Girl), and you can fool me 3 times (with Stumble Into Grace), and you can fool me 4 times (with All I Intended To Be) and now you have fooled me FIVE times (with Hard Bargain) but I have finally caught on - Emmylou is will NEVER make another good album and I will NOT be fooled for a 6th time!  She continues with the very muddy production sound here which would be ok with great songs, but here once again the songs are just B-O-R-I-N-G and repetitive. They all sond the exactly same! zzzzzzzzzzzz Avoid.	-1
From the sample, I had high expectations of the song but hearing the full version was not a great experience. Overall, when I listen to a slow song one thing I don't have is patience. So in order to circumvent this desire of mine to skip it in my mp3 player it must have several key elements to stop me from pushing that button. The first is innovative lyrics, then a soul that resonates, and a story in the sound (and I don't mean musicals). The song's lyrics are not impressive. They are somewhat repetitive and lack imagery and metaphors that make it stand out or relate to me. The soul in the song is...quiet. She has a lovely voice but because the song's lyrics lack power, her voice is underutilized and they make me think of...a calm stream in the mountains. Very lovely, but no something that will keep your interest for long unless you want to meditate. And then comes the story of the sound. This is where it gets tricky. The story of the sound only has two arcs. Most great songs have three places in the song that will keep you hooked. The climax of the song is the middle part after the introduction that will pull the song and finally cement it into your brain. The climax of this song started great but ended prematurely with more soothing tones that reminded me of the introduction of the song. I wish the best for this artist, but would suggest more variety and structure within the music.	-1
This album would've been so much better with live instrumentation. I hope his next one will be 100% great like he is on the road with his band....	-1
Were it not for the Hell Yeah CD by Black 'N Blue that I purchased at the same time as Rockaholic, I would criticize this more but after listening to how a terrible a CD can actually be, I will say that at least I didn't frisbee this into the trash. Instead, I kep the case and dropped the CD in the trash.	-1
2.5 stars  Warrant is back with their seventh studio album, their second to feature the original lineup, sans singer Jani Lane. The band's new singer is Robert Mason, replacing Black N' Blue singer Jamie St. James, who sang on 2006's "Born Again."  Warrant is a guilty pleasure of mine. The band might have written some cheesy songs that sounded dated very shortly after their release, as they fell into obscurity in the 90s, but they had a gifted songwriter in original singer Jani Lane. Songs like "Cherry Pie" and "Down Boys," as corn-ball as they might be, were a cut above most of the butt-rock sludge that was being churned out in the late 80s and early 90s. His songs sometimes even had a touch of melancholy, which gave Warrant a genuine sense humanity, something that bands like Winger or Slaughter lacked.  It was Jani Lane that made Warrant an above-average band in the first place, so without his presence, how do Warrant sound? This question was first answered with "Born Again," which wasn't bad. It sounded more like Black N' Blue than Warrant, but it was a good record. It's a shame that that lineup didn't continue. "Rockaholic," while not bad, isn't as good. The band and the production sound good, but the songs are sort of just by-the-numbers 80s rockers and ballads. Mason is a competent singer, but nothing special. The lyrics, which are nothing but cliches about getting laid and heart-break, don't help much.  Warrant are smart enough to know that they aren't going to sell more records by trying to sound relevant, so they wisely stick to making an album that old-school Warrant fans might dig. The problem is that there isn't anything all that memorable. Still, if you like 80s pop-metal, "Rockaholic" might be worth checking out.	-1
After loving most of the tracks from the last Warrant album, "Born Again (2006)" I was stunned that on that album the band had (and thankfully) gone back to playing hard rock music then that dumb idea they had to go in a grunge direction... the new warrant sound amazed me that it sounded so great, a bit of AC/DC rawness and a few newer sounds to make it great for both new and old rockers. However, on this album, there seems to be little of that new spark they had on the previous album, it seems to have gone much softer, yet somehow 80's metal. So, with that said, keep in mind, I did like the last album, and I am not one of those fans who say this band is not the same without Jani Lane, because Jaime St. James may not have had the vocal range of Jani, but for that album, I think he did a fantastic job... but with that said, St. James has parted ways with the band and Robert Mason has stepped up to the mic to try and fill some rather big shoes. But quite frankly, I was not very impressed with his vocals, nor the lyrics to this entire album.  It seems that the same song has been recorded 3 or 4 times on this album, mostly they where a balled, but it just seemed, like the rock music of this album is very generic. I'm not saying the music is bad, I'm just saying that everything seemed to sound like something you had either heard before, or it just sounded like standard way of recording something you can stand from start to finish, while not being memorable. I found nothing here that stands out above everything else.  When I first heard "Born Again" there where riffs and lyrics I liked from the very first moment I heard it, but on this album, I think I heard one thing that sounded a little creative, and all that was, was two guitars playing scales together, but the band seemed to be jamming away rather nicely, but even now when I try to remember what track that was, and after a few listens, it's just not standing out as something more then "it's the best track on this album" (which isn't much) rather then "that's an incredible unforgettable song" if you know what I mean?  It sounded to me a lot of the time like Aerosmith fillers... it sounds like Aerosmith, but just not a hit song or a fan favorite sort of thing, if you follow what I am saying about this album... it surely isn't a bad album, but then again, it's far from ever going to be great, nor get any attention. I can't see any of these songs being played on the radio in future as some sort of "classic" that anyone will remember anything from this album, and I certainly did not hear anything here that someone could convince me would be welcomed into the listings of Warrants greatest hits. By the looks of things, it looks like the band is pushing for "Life's a Song" to become a hit single, but I really don't think it's good enough, especially when Warrant have created just such a thing in the past.  I was really disappointed that "Born Again" didn't do much better for this band then it did, but this album here, I can fully understand why it will not chart, be memorable to really anyone but die-hard warrant fans, and I definitely can't see this album generating new fans or welcoming back forgotten fans to take an interest in this band again.  The overall sound of this album doesn't sound like it's something new, it sounds rather 80's metal... which I am not saying is a bad thing, I do love 80's metal, however I just could not help but compare them to Warrants 80's metal hits, and they just don't feel like they should be standing side by side against any of them. There was only a couple of times I heard that hint of the sound the band had on the last album, but for the most part, the songs here felt very empty, and no attitude or emotion was felt, neither love or hate. There was no great musical direction, great lyric writing, a melody that stood out, there just was not really much at all in the way of anything being memorable. There might have been 2 songs on here I thought where OK, but like I said, far from their best efforts, and very far from anything to be considered part of the greatest hits.  I'm sorry to say this, especially since Warrant is one of my all time favorite bands, but this album has been a disappointing 5 year wait. I'm not sure if I would go as far and say this band need a new singer, because I am not too sure who wrote what in the lyrics department for this one, but if it was Robert Mason handling most of the lyric writing for this album, then the rest of the band should really try seeking other more creative writers to help with the lyric writing side of Warrant, because the ones here just seemed to keep repeating themselves, there was nothing at all special about them, and the phrase "I love you" was used way too many times overall. I kept rolling my eyes when hearing it, and thinking, "Why bother to try and compete with 'Heaven'"? If you have a masterpeice, why try to paint it again, especially trying to paint it this time with no colors?  Well thats what I thought about this album, but I still have my hopes up that Warrant will bounce back soon with a great tune, great riffs, and great lyrics once again.	-1
There is no question that Jennifer Lopez has had a lot of highs and lows with her career and her personal life. With her personally though, her love life has been destroyed again with her breakup with Marc Anthony, but her work on American Idol has been supreme with a new decade of fans. Musically though, it has been a lackluster thrive in her songs. Papi, the third single from her lackluster Love? album. I really felt that the song was more like a throwback to the rhythms of her 2000 J. Lo  record, and not really as strong as she could've brought it out to be. I think she needs to find better from her own voice, and hopefully come back singing with something absolutely amazing.  Song: D	-1
There is no question that Jennifer Lopez has been a lot of the news lately, and not for her music. It has been for her work with American Idol, and for her marriage to Marc Anthony ending in a sour split. But for her latest single, she wants to try and recapture whom she was a singer before, and fails to do it on Papi, the third single from her album Love? The song isn't really as driven as some of her other dance songs from before in her career. In fact, hearing it now, feels like a weak kitten than a striking and strong tiger. Good luck to Jennifer on her other projects, but Love? wasn't really feeling the love at all, with the exception of On The Floor.  Song: D	-1
Things personally haven't been going Jennifer Lopez's way, musically and soulfully. With the not so surprising breakup of her and Marc Anthony, many people have wondered if Jennifer could bounce back from this. While she has with her role of being a judge on American Idol, musically she has not been as strong as she could be. After the dissapointments of Brave and her prior singles set for Love?, Fresh Out The Oven & Louboutons fizzled, she has a lot of ground to renew. Her latest single from Love?, I'm Into You isn't really as rhythmic or as driven as she sincerely could've made it. I absolutely was not very impressed with the song, it just wasn't as strong enough as a dance ballad as she could've brought from her own voice. If you've loved On The Floor, don't get this as a addition to your MP3 library.  Song: D+	-1
When it has came down to Jennifer Lopez, musically, she really hasn't been able to thrive back to the top of the charts. After the dissapointing albums Brave and Rebirth, she needed to hit on the nail on the head with returning back into the mainstream. Sadly a few years ago, that didn't happen well when she failed with Loubotons and the poor Frsh Out The Oven, and a bad performance with her falling on her behind at the 2009 American Music Awards. It has been nearly 2 years since she made her plans with the long-awaited Love?. With also a shift of labels, being dropped from Sony and moving to Island Def Jam, she needed to make a new splash musically to work. That was a minor splash with On The Floor, and a weak follow-up with I'm Into You, the second single from the long-awaited Love? The song is a tried and not so true attempt to get back to square one musically to the way she was as a entertainer. I really wasn't feeling the song at all. It really was not anything that felt organic to what she should've been able to do. Hopefully, Jennifer will keep trying to do better as a judge on American Idol. She still continues to show that she doesn't have the strength as a singer anymore.  Song: D	-1

Unfortunately, I never received my download of this song though i was charged for it. I was disappointed to say the least about the situation.  I am not sure why this occurs	-1
This track wasn't worth the price paid: It was free!	-1
I got a lot of songs off of Amazon that were free and I didn't like any of them, including this song.  I guess it was worth the price.	-1
i downloaded this song because it was free and have regretted it . . . but free is free so you get what you get	-1
This is actually just a boring 2 star album, but I just placed it as 1-star because it is a complete copycat of The Band Perry's first record (album cover). If you actually look at The Band Perry's first album cover and this, they look EXACTLY the same, which often makes the album boring and very hard to like. The Band Perry may not be so bright with "If I Die Young", but at least they actually have what it takes to make redeeming songs. This is a complete copycat. If that doesn't make you think "WHY IS THIS EVEN A CD", listen to the music. It's all just crummy bluegrass-influenced country and NO interesting country pop like songs, and actually (like i said) copys the descent bluegrass of The Band Perry. So, it's not that hard to say that the Janedear Girls aren't the only ones to pull this copycat and ripoff nonsense. This is a warning to PREFER THE BAND PERRY OVER THIS.	-1
I did not think too highly of this one, I am not too keen on slow music. Good listening though.	-1
This is such a retread that Madame Gaga who i like,has me dumbfounded. Madonna approves of this song apparently. It must be because she is vain  enough to want a copy kat of Express Yourself. No costume  can cover up this fact. The woman does not sing that well on this either,even though she boasts about her chops. A big seller already,and not original .	-1
The feeling of what Lady Gaga has made into music being all her own, well there is no question that she is not someone whom is delivering her own music. She has shown to take too much from other artists and copy their style. That is the case with her latest single Born My Way. The song takes on too much of the feeling of Madonna's Express Yourself, with a pinch of Vogue. I really wasn't even impressed with the song at all. It really feels like she is trying too hard to be into the sexual appeal Madonna had shown for over 25 years, than being herself. I really think she needs to come up with something better for her music when her sophmore album comes up soon. If it sounds too much like what Born This Way had shown, than I will definitely say no to the record.  Song: D+	-1
This is not old school, It is for the young and energy driven. Good dance music not just for listening.	-1
I liked her previous singles but this has to be one of her worst that she's put out. I hear it constantly on the radio and it's making me like it even less. In my opinion, her best songs are Alejandro, Telephone, Poker Face and LoveGame.	-1
It's the same story with the rest...I tried to download to my ipod, and it acted like it did. but when i went to play it, every song was erased, plus i never received all of these great artist....I was Maddddd!!!	-1
not good	-1
I like Shania. I like "Today Is Your Day". But I liked it better the FIRST time I heard it when it was called "Bubbly" by Colbie Caillat.	-1
I am a true blue Shania fan, but this is just not a great song.  I used to love all of what she did, and I hope she puts out more new music that is better than this.	-1
This free album has various artists & some songs seem like a cross between Country & Rock. Of the 13 songs kept: "Dirty mouth Flo" is sort of comical , "Gather" is thoughtful & slow , "Gotta Get Back To Forgetting You" good song & good singer , & almost kept "Merseyside" . Most songs seemed to loud & fast for my liking. Though some people may like a lot more or even less...The whole album is free so make your own decision.	-1
i downloaded this song because it was free and have regretted it . . . but free is free so you get what you get	-1
If this song gets played at almost every single wedding well that's just pathetic. At last is overrated wake up people! There's better love songs out there.	-1
Spiderman-Turn Off The Sound. Spiderman-Turn Off The Orchestra, Spiderman-Turn Off The Mics,...I could go on and on..Astonishingly bad!..The music for this mess is not good Bono, can't even hold a candle to any of U2's albums. The show doesn't belong on Broadway, but a better fit would be at Universal Studios theme park. Yes, it is a techno spectacle, but not worth $100+ to see. Has no heart, no great songs, lousy book,  and nothing wonderful to recommend. The out of town tourists will keep it running.	-1
wow, this song is embarrassing. i believe the lyricists were chimps who take residency at miami's metrozoo. to add insult, to the injury of my ears when this dung heap plays on the radio, stations in south florida just keep playing it and playing it....PLEASE STOP! i cannot control what da missus wants to hear in da car!	-1
horrible a$$ song. I don't know what's more annoying Afrojack's crappy beats/music, ne-YO whining, or Pitbull's no talent a$$ clown rapping...take your pick	-1
Anybody who put their name on this piece of dung should be banned from ever recording music again. The three a$$ clowns who did this song: Pitbull, Neyo, and Afrojack have little or no talent. The lion's share of the blame for this travesty of a song goes to Afrojack, who is responsible for the whack a$$ production and music, then second most annoying, is Neyo's whining. Although Pitbull is culpable of being involved in a lot of bad (as in terrible) music lately, the final nails in the coffin is the generic/bland production/instrumentation/arrangements.	-1
don't like most of songs in this record. just saw this is on sale and buy. wasting my money. bad	-1
More cookie-cutter FM radio friendly Adult-Oriented Alternative?? I am not saying these guys aren't proficient musicians, nor that they are bottom of the mainstream musical dung-pile. I am simply stating that these guys sound like Coldplay sounding like U2. So that makes them pale imitators of pale imitators.	-1
OneRepublic hit it big when their song Apologize became the biggest song of the year; the track still gets prominent airplay even today, four years later. No followup single ignited quite the way that one did, with Stop and Stare being the only real success on Billboard. This time around, the band doesn't even try to replicate Apologize, which is a good thing. The beats are a bit harder and deeper, but not altogether dissimilar to Dreaming Out Loud. What results is an album that peaks high and doesn't so much dip low as just fade into facelessness.  Made For You: The opening track is solid, though not all that memorable. The hook is catchy, but the added outro is unnecessary and doesn't add much. C+  All The Right Moves: The lead single sounds like nothing from Dreaming Out Loud, making it a great song to introduce this album. The vocals are urgent and the beat is great, but it's not particularly epic. B  Secrets: The second single, and the best song on the album. The subtle beginning sparks and then ignites with the chorus, which is as catchy as anything OneRepublic has ever released. This should've been more successful. B+  Everybody Loves Me: A very odd song for this band to record, but very welcome. The beat is different, focusing on more percussion, and the whole thing is just fun with the ego in overdrive. A-  Missing Persons 1 & 2: Just as some momentum was forming, this stops the hooks dead. This isn't a bad song, but there's absolutely nothing exciting about it. C-  Good Life: A great song to recover with. The third song on the album to eclipse anything the band has done thus far, with a quiet melody that is very pleasant. B+  All This Time: While too similar in rhythm to the previous song, the hook saves this track from obscurity. Not too great, but not bad either. C+  Fear: Another song that recycles the beats of the previous song. The vocals are pretty strong, but this just isn't original enough. C  Waking Up: The same thing can be said for this track. This could have been merged with the previous two tracks without much hassle. C  Marchin On: Barely different from the previous two, and the same in nature lyrically to the previous. This is getting a bit ridiculous. C  Lullaby: This song was written to be sleep-inducing, and it does the job. I'm just not sure what the purpose that has on an album. D  Mercy (Bonus): Previously on the first album, this is a much better end to the album than the previous song is on the regular edition. This deserved more success as a single. B  This album is incredibly frustrating, due to how much potential was wasted. The first half is solid for the most part, but it seems like Ryan Tedder loves the beat on Good Life and decided to replicate it in very similar ways on the four songs that followed. Lullaby refuses to put a flailing album out of its misery, and this all equates to a 'singles' album. Combine four of these songs with the singles from Dreaming Out Loud, and that will get you a lean, solid OneRepublic release. As for this, it should be skipped.  Recommended: All the Right Moves, Secrets, Everybody Loves Me, Good Life	-1

To think I sold my old cd to get the "better" sounding "remastered" version with extra tracks!  2 stars because even without the bonus tracks which in this case doesn't help the cd at all, this is actually quite a good album; I also got the cassette when this came out and quite frankly, even the cassette sounded better than this!  The sound quality is very, very poor so I'd recommend if you haven't already got this, to wait for another better remastered version or even get the original untouched cd if you can still find it as there is really no noticeable difference.  Perhaps if there is a well produced "Best of" compilation, that may be a good idea to get too especially to get "Do You Believe In Love" as well which I still think is their greatest hit ever.  I wonder if I can sell this cd too. Hmm......	-1
This is essentially a Foreigner tribute band re-recording the classic songs.  I don't know of anyone who would rather hear a karaoke singer over the great Lou Gramm.  It's too bad that Lou Gramm didn't get the name Foreigner instead of Mick Jones.  Jones has run this band into the ground, playing casinos and county fairs night after night (and sometimes Jones himself doesn't even show up to these gigs!)  It's pretty sad, actually.  This was one of my favorite bands in the 80's, and now they've been replaced by a bunch of faceless musicians trying to ride the wave of a once great group.	-1
Sorry but......STUPID !! Song	-1
My son likes this sone, I can't stand it or the video!  Wouldn't recommend to anyone...jthat is ust my opinion.	-1
I bought this because I thought it would be a cool song... not so much.  It's ok, and funny if you pay attention/watch the video; otherwise, it's just a strange song.	-1
This follow-up to the sublime Powerslave is rather weak. Part of the problem is the new sound they are using. The compositions themselves are obviously in the tradition of Iron Maiden but they come off sounding very flat compared to other Maiden discs. Sounds more like prog rock than straight heavy metal. The best part of this disc is the superb lead guitar work by Dave Murray and Adrian Smith. They really play with a lot of feel. The solos are fast in the tradition of good metal but also melodic. The worst part of the disc is Bruce's vocals and some of the lyrics. Bruce is trying to sound operatic on some of the songs and he is just not up to the task. Sometimes he sounds like a howling old lady. Some of the lyrics take a stab at being deep but come across as just silly - Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner being the main culprit. Alexander the Great was an attempt at doing another Rime of the Ancient Mariner. The Rime, adapted from Samual Taylor Coleridge (sp?), is a piece of epic metal genius. Alexander the Great sounds like Bruce is reading the lyrics out of a high school text book on European History. Simply foolish. To sum up, the approach here is obviously similar to Powerslave but the results do not even compare. Somewhere in Time is one of Maiden's weakest.	-1
It is okay, but not crazy about it.	-1
It seems that The Cure is making a comeback in the form of all these new acts that sound old.  You can thrust Washed Out in that equation.  It's interesting that they chose such a name for their group, considering the fact that their musical direction leaves them sounding a bit, well, washed out.  It's not that I can't appreciate this breed of music; it's just that the synth heavy beat becomes rather stagnant over the running time because there is no real change in the musicality.  It just remains redundant from start to finish.  I would have liked some swells here and there to differentiate key moments in the song.  Instead, `Amor Fati' seems to go nowhere.  I'm sure there will be some who really enjoy this, and I will admit that in parts this song (and apparently this group) shines.  Vocally, I see a lot of potential, but the flow of the song itself is so monotone that the vocals take on a similar shading.  And yet, despite my apparent dissatisfaction with this particular song, I ultimately hear something that has me intrigued and wanting to hear more.  I know, strange right?  Well, I am interested in hearing more from them to see how well rounded they are as a group.  If the balance of their album is in this same vein then I'll be staying far away, but if they can use their talented parts to create something a little more unique and interesting than I can see them becoming something I thoroughly enjoy.  So, I personally kind of hate this song but I am interested in hearing what else this group can do.	-1
I did not purchase this someone else must of under my account	-1
No complaints about the content, the music is great. The only issue, and a BIG issue, is how MAKES everyone go through the Amazon Music player just to download the music THAT SHOULD OF BEEN DOWNLOADED TO YOUR COMPUTER IN THE FISRT PLACECAUSE AFTER ALL THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE PAYING FOR!!! IT DOES NOT MAKE SENSE why in the world they feel the need to make you jump through all kinds of hoops simply to get WHAT YOU BOUGHT!!! *People simply want to download it to their computer no strings attached!!* ***This is the most useless hassle I have ever come across in dealing with WHAT SHOULD BE A REALLY SIMPLE and straight forward task such as downloading the music you just bought*** I have NEVER met anyone that goes out of their wallet to buy music and prefers it to keep it on a stream player app on their computer-_-  If it was like that they would just keep listening to it on youtube. Its like the most ANNOYING, USELESS "middle man" there could possibly be. If anyone is PAYING for ANYTHING digital it should be a really BASIC-COMMON SENSE LOGIC that they want it on their computer.and not have it rely on a stupid music stream application where they have to change a bunch of settings JUST TO GET WHAT THEY PAID FOR IN THE FIRST PLACE!!!  The MOST idiotic thing is that they don't even give you a choice to download it straight to your computer after you buy itit HAS to go through this useless process.  The thing doesn't even allow you to select to open the folder the music is stored in!  AND on top of that you have to deal with TONS of annoying bugs and glitches, some of which makes you completely stuck, even after re-opening the app, and often makes you have to just completely re-install the it. ***It should be a given that if you purchase a song and select it to download that you *DO_NOT* want it to go directly to some pain in the butt software that for 1, is ALWAYS has some type of super annoying bug and 2, is purely a unnecessary and just a straight up hassle.***  For the pathetic amazon music player I give it 1 star, if I could I would give it a -5 score rating.  I couldn't find anywhere where I can review the music player so Im leaving it here.	-1
not like	-1
I don't see what his thinking is here. OK like everyone else make a record with another artist. In his case Female. But wherever he got this song has me believing the singer might be from the program he was on. Either that or he is on (something).	-1
Not what i expected at all. it was not my top ten dancehall or reggae songs one bit. happy it was not expensive.	-1
This is not the original lineup. Kelly Hanson has replaced the original lead singer Lou Gramm and sadly it shows. I'm the first to admit that I'm not a hugh fan of the group but do enjoy some of the hits that were played on the radio during the 80's...that said I was looking to add these "hits" to my music collection and mix them into my playlists. I also admit I bought this disk because of the $5.00 price tag. I thought I would get in cheap and plug the hole in my library for a song...sometimes you get what you pay for...The minute I heard the vocal on "Feels Like The First Time" I knew something was wrong. The band was right but the vocal mix was off to where I finally looked at the cd case and and found the small print...Brand New Recordings Of Foreigner's Greatest Hits...sadly it's just off enough to make it unlistenable...I have to agree with other reviewers who like me are a little confused as to why they would release this record...Journey replaced their lead singer and only play the hits in concert...if Foreigner wants to remain a working band they need to write new songs and sell them as such...bands like Deep Purple, The Allman Brothers & Lynyrd Skynyrd (to name a few) have all had personnel changes yet they moved forward and made new music to the enjoyment of old & new fans alike...sorry Foreigner but this cd will be traded in at Rasputin Records and that money will go toward "Foreigner:Complete Greatest Hits" issued by Rhino Records at least I'll know I'm getting what I payed for...	-1
Guess I should have taken more time to listen to this before I downloaded suprised me and I don't care to listen to it	-1
This track wasn't worth the price paid: It was free!	-1
I don't know why but this album won't play on my device so I can't really give it a rating.  Obviously I liked the sample well enough to purchase it but I can't say any more about it.  So the one star isn't the true rating but at least one is required to leave a review.	-1
When it has came down to Rihanna's last album Rated R, she just really didn't have the songs to shine upon and deliver, in the ways that Good Girl Gone Bad had delivered. That unfortunately wasn't a very strong record, yet she is about to try it again later this year with Loud, her 5th album. Her debut single from that album, Only Girl (In The World) isn't a driven song, in fact it feels less than strong. She tries to bring out more of an electronica sound to her voice, but the feeling of the song, doesn't score a home run. I really wasn't very impressed with the song, in fact it felt like the wind didn't even take my breath away. I really think Rihanna should take her time, rather than rushing her music out there. Hopefully, when Long comes up in November, she can deliver better songs than this one did. Only Girl (In The World) wasn't one of them.  Song: D+	-1
this is the music you'd probably wanna play if you put me in a torture chamber. the aural equivalent of eating a feces sandwich	-1
people must have fecal excrement in their ears (the ones giving this horrible song 4 and 5 stars) all I hear is more crap...	-1
The song has a great beat and I like listening to the lyrics.  The lyrics has a nice meaning to them.	-1
A lot of Rihanna's music has just not been very appealing to me.  The `look at me, I'm edgy and need attention' antics of songs like "Hard", "S&M", and "Rude Boy" just undermine a voice that, under the right circumstances with the right lyrics and music, can be quite good (such as "Umbrella" or "Love the Way You Lie").    This latest release by her, "Cheers (Drink to that)" doesn't even have the negative attention grabbing aspects of those other songs.  It's just really dull and boring.  It uses the "yeah a yeah" sample from Avril Lavigne's "I'm With You" and plays it over a really droning beat along with Rihanna's disinterested vocals.  In addition, the lyrics tap into such clich&eacute;d `hip' phrases such as `hella good'.  Then it has this really odd interlude where the music cuts out and it sounds like a group of drunks at a bar trying to sing along to the lyrics.    All in all, this is a very forgettable song.  However, given RiRi's fan base, it will still probably make some noise on the charts.	-1
When it has came down to Rihanna, she has honestly made some of the worst music in the modern era. But it isn't just that, she also has been severly overexposed that it is more annoying than appealing. Her sixth single from the poorly showcased Loud, Cheers (Drink To That,) isn't really as appealing as is with other reggae and carribean mixes in pop. I thought that the song was just than stellar to what she had shown musically when she did A Girl Gone Bad. Now, she has gotten too cocky that her songs are just cheap. I think Rihanna should wind down and not oversaturate herself with releasing bad music. Than maybe I would drink to that.  Song: D-	-1

another generic top 40 crap song by rihanna. have you ever seen the movie 'idiocracy'? it's about the 'dumbing down' of society. the fact that a crap song like this moves so many units (or downloads in today's world) is indicative of how "dumbed down" the average radio listener demographic has become.	-1
Here's the deal...The lyrics are good and the song ain't bad (check out Youtube sensation Christina Grimmie's stripped down version on Youtube). What I hate is the production and arrangement. Record producers for these major record labels are pressured to make everything in the style of all the other top 40 songs. It makes the song sound like another Lady Gaga wanna be, which is a shame because it's not a bad song at all.	-1
It gets annoying quickly. Granddaughter gets bored with it. I think it's the voice that's annoying. I still have it on kindle, we just don't play it as often anymore.	-1
some seemed to be low quality recordings. Many Strauss works are available in better quality in the Big Waltz Box.	-1
If your music budget is basically zero, by all means take advantage of this music-by-the yard offer.  But if you actually end up liking this music you owe it to yourself to hear some good performances, especially by the better German/Austrian orchestras.  These performances are completely lacking in the spirit of dance that is the inspiration for these pieces.  It's performances like this that make people think classical music is boring.	-1
too expensive	-1
it was free	-1
I love the Hunger Games and really enjoy the music from the movie. At first I though this was going to include a few tracks or sounds from the movie, but came to realize it only one :06 sound byte. Okay if you are looking for a short ringtone, but nothing to hum too all day long.	-1
Six seconds of a four-note whistle- this is what you people are wetting yourselves over?  I could get my neighbor's kid to whistle into my laptop mic and no one would be the wiser.  You'd think they'd need to release an actual track or even a cue to work with, but given the gushing fanboi/gurl reactions to this little bit of nothing with a logo attached Barnum still has it right: there's one born every minute.	-1
The additional material is nice, but the remaster is absolute trash. I never bothered to listen to this remaster until this evening. Other reviewers fo this version here are spot-on. It's near ruined and unlistenable in comparison to the original. Punch-you-in-the-face, loudness. The mix is totally flat, the cymbals and hat are trashed. Just garbage. The only thing this has going for it is that is sound like what the album would have if Kurt has destroyed it along with his on-stage guitars... fitting maybe.	-1
I listened to Nevermind twice--that's all I could stand.  I can't find a single good song on the CD.  The lyrics are ill-pronounced, there's little sense of melody, and there's too much incoherent yelling.  On most of the songs the chord introductions are too long, and often the drums are too manic (aka noisy).	-1
There's no denying that "Nevermind" remains an essentIal, important album by Nirvana.  This latest CD master isn't the one to buy.  It sounds horrible--a loud, compressed, distorted mess.  I'm not clear who approved this master but I would avoid it. Pick up the earlier CD  version or find a decent vinyl copy but don't buy this as it is shoddy.  Nirvana deserve better.	-1
DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!!!  This is a remastered version of "Nevermind" and it is HORRIBLE.  The sound of Nirvana that was on the original "Nevermind" album that was perfectly mastered and perfectly produced by Butch Vig and recorded at Sound City DOES NOT exist on this recording.  All of the songs are missing the original sound that made this album great.  Remastering this album is just like someone going back and remastering the original Rage Against the Machine album that was also recorded at Sound City.  If it is PERFECT, don't screw with it!  You can't beat PERFECTION!!  Music recorded at Sound City on the very rare NEVE console using tape and actual talent are VERY FEW.  Please, Please, Please, SAVOR them as they are supposed to be savored.  Don't support a crappy remaster that is nothing like the original recording.  BUY THE ORIGINAL ALBUM!  You will not be disappointed.	-1
I RECENTLY POSTED A REVIEW ON NEVERMIND AND GOT SEVERAL SCOLDING MESSAGES FROM APPARENT DIE HARD NIRVANA FANS ACCUSING ME OF BEING VINCE NEIL. IM STILL LAUGHING. SO I PULLED IT AND WENT AND LISTEN TO NEVERMIND ONCE AGAIN FOR THE FIRST TIME IN YEARS IM SORRY BUT BY OPINION HASNT CHANGED.    WHILE THE PRICE OF CLASSIC 80S AND 90 ROCK BAND CDS ARE INCREASING AND BECOMING MORE AND MORE COLLECTABLE AND DESIREABLE BY EVEN TODAYS YOUTH ( WHO BELIEVE IT OR NOT KNOW TALENT WHEN THEY HEAR IT ) NEVERMIND CAN NOW BE BOUGHT BY PENNIES. ANYONE SEE MY POINT HERE?    THERE WAS NO TALENT IN THIS BAND WITH THE EXCEPTION OF DAVE GROHL AND HE HAD TO GET OUT OF NIRVANA TO ACHIEVE THAT. THE UNPLUGGED MTV NIRVANA THINGIE WAS A SHAM AND PROVES MY POINT NO TALENT HERE. KURT WAS ALL ABOUT HEY IM DIFFERENT DONT YOU WANT TO BE DIFFERENT TOO. APPARENTLY MANY DID.    BEFORE I GET KNOCKED ON THIS BEING A OPINION RATHER THAN A REVIEW LIKE LAST TIME OPINIONS OF NIRVANA FANS ARE BASICALLY ALL THAT THERE ARE ON HERE. MY REVIEW IS THAT THIS CD SUCKS. AND PLEASE STOP TRYING TO ASSOCIATE KOBAINS DEATH IN RELATION WITH ROCK LEGENDS SUCH AS JANIS JOPLIN JIMMY HENDRIX AND JIM MORRISON THAT IS ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS AS YOU CAN GET. AND FOR THOSE REVIEWS THAT STATED THAT THIS CD IS ONE YOU WOULD WANT ON A DESERTED ISLAND I DONT HESITATE TO SAY THAT WE PROBABLY WOULDNT FIND YOU SANE UPON YOUR RESCUE. MY PERSONAL CD COLLECTION IS NOW OVER 1000 STRONG AND IF I CHOSE TO LISTEN TO THEM ALL THIS WOULD BE MY 1000 TH CD PLAYED. OH WITH SOME HESITATION I MIGHT ADD.  AND NO I AM NOT VINCE NEIL . LONG LIVE ROCK TIME TO GO LISTEN TO SOME MOTORHEAD OR TORA TORA OR YEAH MAYBE SOME CRUE .	-1
When Nirvana released their second album Nevermind in September of 1991, thankfully it was ignored in its first few months as heavy metal bands like Guns and Roses and Metallica ruled the rock and roll mainstream with their Use Your Illusion 1 and 2 and Black Albums respectively plus Anthrax, Judas Priest and Megadeth released great albums amidst the hair metal trash. Then, around either December of 1991 or January of 1992, MTV started playing the video for Nirvana (or as I called them NERDVANA)'s "Smells Like Teen Spirit" and I said to myself, exact words and this was not a made up story and I quote "I see the lead singer (Kurt Cobain) is a left handed guitarist like Jimi Hendrix and I predict he will die in three years" end quote. In 1994 (almost three years after this album was released), my prophecy came true as he offed himself like a yellow dog. Cobain, unlike Hendrix, was a deplorable guitarist and un-revolutionary IMHO! Nirvana were not revolutionary despite what those fools at Rolling Stone and Spin magazine claim, Nirvana were basically a safe version of The Sex Pistols and The Clash (despite the fact that Dave Grohl was the only true talent in Nirvana as he is a great drummer, singer and rhythm guitarist). It irks me to see people compare this album to real classics like Dark Side of the Moon, Who's Next, Sticky Fingers, Hotel California and Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Nevermind is overrated. Aside Teen Spirit, other lousy songs were "In Bloom", "Come As You Are" (should have been titled "Don't Have a Gun") and "Lithium" (who would write a song about a sedative to combat hyperactivity). "Territorial P*ssings" sounds like he was writing about a pack of wolves marking their territory. "Endless Nameless" was annoying. "Drain You" was silly. Whom in the blue Hell came up with naming a generation "X", last time I checked Generation X was a punk band that Billy Idol was in back in the late 1970s. I get down on my knees and seriously thank God I dove heavily into Queen's music when Nirvana were at their peak. Also, people comparing a real rock legend like John Lennon to, what "The Motor City Madman" Ted Nugent aptly called a "weenie", Kurt Cobain was like comparing solid gold to tin foil. Lennon was about happiness and wanting peace in the face of all negativity and horror in the world we live in whilst Cobain just whined, complained, p*ssed and moaned and cried about how bad his life was and wanting to die and sounded like a three year old who had his toy taken from him. Avoid this and any Nirvana album!	-1
If you know me I listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and (yes) even a few tunes now and then from Soundgarden ("Black Hole Sun" anybody?) and I LOVE some classic punk (The Clash are one of my favorite bands)but THIS!!!!!Okay for starters I remember when this record came out-I was still in the days of acid wash jeans,perms and U2 and stuff and along comes 'Nevermind'.What do I LIKE about this album?Well I LOVE the album cover-it's one of my favorites and it makes a great anti  establishment statement. But the music?????O-H M-Y G-O-O-D-N-E-S-S!!!!!!!Who.....made this stuff,since I could hardly call written. Sometimes I wonder what goes through rock critics (of all ages) minds when they reviewed albums and put the moniker 'classic' on it. Okay first off Kurt Cobain is a rather pittiable figure-depressed and a drug addict he wrote songs and sung in a way that would get him locked into the mental hospital where I come from-I feel sorry for him. And his band (sorry) are so ametaurish it isn't even fresh or funny. Bands like U2 or The Clash were inexperienced at first but still made great,lively and powerful music from the beginning. But all this ends up is as an aural heroin 'daze'-the guitars are cloudy,Cobain's already ruined voice is barely audible and the only recognizable pop song here "Something In The Way" still has no vital spark. To me it makes me angry that an obviously sad and suisidal man such as Cobain wasted his talented (which may in fact exist) on forcing us to endure his inaudible,drug crazed 'wailing' of rants like "Terrestrail Pissings".And the acoustic "Polly"?Sounds like the worst garage band in the world. So why is 'Nevermind' called a masterpiece?Simple-Nirvana,despite fancying themselves anti establishment were (and still are)the recipiants of one of the most wide spread and carefully crafted PR campaign since the days of The Beatles. But there (again despite critics) is where the comparasin between Nirvana and The Beatles ends-for one "Smells Like Teen Spirit" is NOT a modern day "More Then A Feeling" and nothing Grohl,Cobain or the others do is anywhere close to Beatle-esque. Not only that (even if it's not Cobains fault) his music set a new record for rock n' roll underachievment unpresidented in all these years and from which the music world has barely recovered from-to this day alternative rock radio tends to be more or less grunge in disguise and ALL of these records sound like 'Nevermind'.Also Cobains cynical and sad outlook,although baught on my his mental problems inadverantly caused a whole generation of youth to simply.....stop caring and deny and even mock the more positive elements of their past. So this began the 'grunge generation' in earnest and even if it was all spin doctored is this a lousy record?Technically very much?Should it be stripped from the market?NEVER,and that's the only reason why this should exist. Every artist has the right to express themselves however they want as long as no one is getting hurt-it's in the constitution. But also everyone has the right to their opinion so I felt compelled to get one. So if you subscribe to the grunge culture and don't have this you probably should,you'll love it. But if you like me are one of those people who are looking for something more then drugged out babble,lack of melody and nothing but minor chords then you like me should probably steer clear. But I had to hear it to have an opinion. My main point is not every rock critic should hail this as a masterpiece because they want to go along with joneses-I know others feel as I do. If Nirvana could make a recording like this and become geniouses for it then everyone has the right to a different opinion and like mine it doesn't always have to be a picture perfect one.	-1
Nirvana's Nevermind really kicked things off for the early 90's Seatle Grunge movement. A new sound for a new decade, Nirvana and other grunge groups put an end to the popularity of the 80s pop/metal movement. While, Nirvana is an alright band, but I don't consider Kurt Cobain the musical genious that many people claim he his. Kurt wrote some really good songs, but Nevermind isn't really a masterpiece by any means. Smells Like Teen Spirit, and Come as You Are are very good songs, and Nevermind is an enjoyable listen every once in awhile, many of the songs don't leave a lasting impression. If you're a teenager you'll probably want Nevermind, but since they have a greatest hits album I'd recommend that as a starting point to new fans.	-1
This may be Nirvana's most famous album but it is also thier most commercial. Instead of the sludgy heavy production that greeted thier muisic with Bleach, this was lighter, crisper, cleaner and generally more radio-friendly. Some of the songs are excellent, but if this album had the production of Bleach, it would have been amazing. Many people rave about this album, whilst some people (even hardened Nirvana fans) moan about how it is thier least favourite album. At first I loved it. Now I can't even remember the last time I listened to it. Just listen to the live version of Smell Like Teen Spirit - it's a million times better and contained all the angst, aggression and sheer energy that this album should've had. At the end of the day, this "classic rock album" fails to stike a chord with the people it REALLY should, and those people are a large amount of true Nirvana fans worldwide. Lastly Cobain was not a genius.... Almost all of his songs had the same structures and the lryics don't mean anything most of the time (something else HE said in an interview).  If Nirvana didn't have so much commercial appeal and he didn't kill himself then they wouldn't be anymore popular than most other grunge bands. Oh, and Nirvana didn't invent grunge, neither do they define it.	-1
I just found this album to be very hoakey and unoriginal. I was not a fan of it at all. I was not very familiar with this artist and just bought the album based on the positive reviews....won't be doing that again any time soon...	-1
another corny ass dance song for the Hialeah Soccer Mom crowd and the little Miami Teenybopper crowd. The singer, Havana Brown, i am assuming she's called, sounds like a low rent Rihanna. In other words, an un-unique, pedestrian dance pop singer that sounds like every other dance pop singer on the radio. Not the absolute worst song out there, but pretty awful neverthelesss.	-1
Did not like at all.  A family member asked me to purchase this.  REally didn't want to because it was so bad.	-1

As Snoop Dogg & Wiz Khalifa team up for an album/soundtrack, they released the first single YOung Wild & Free.  People like to make fun of Drake for making soft songs but this one right here is one of the softest songs of the year.  The beat has no thump whatsoever and sounds like that Cee Lo Green Coca Cola commercial from a few years back.  Very happy sounding.  The entire vibe of the song reminds me of cuddling under rainbows eating marshmallows and sipping Moscato with Natasha Bedingfield singing Pocketful of Sunshine.  Surely these guys can do better than this.	-1

Tired theme, annoying as hell, horrid ear gouging vocals and vomit inducing twillight propaganda. Complete gutter polish trash!  Avoid if you have any taste in music whatsoever!!!	-1

Peace On Earth - Brian Wilson version not good and in fact I deleted it from my music collection.  Its a shame to hear how much Brian Wilson has lost in vocal talent over the years. He is a brilliant musician / composer whose vocal talents have gone to 'Musicians' Heaven.'	-1
this is EXACTLY what's wrong with America today (as in the good ol' U.S. of A.): dumbing it down to the most basic, stupidest, duh-factor possible and people just eat it up (or should I say drink it up).  even the performance is about as rudimentary as teaching pre-schoolers a nursery rhyme on a toy piano.  plink plink plink.  DUH! = $$$  proof once again that money/success has no meaning what-so-ever.  it doesn't point to talent or taste or anything that actually means anything.  this is the same reason the morons on Jersey Snore are rich "stars" too.  And this song is proof that idiots will buy absolutely anything.  easily lead around like sheep much?	-1
One of the stupidest songs ever.  You would have to be drunk or high to enjoy this brain fart of a song.  This song is an example of the human population getting dumber.	-1
I hate people who have an aloof view to music that is not meant to be taken seriously. I understand that there is a time and place for almost everything, and that people who consider themselves music snobs are quick to discount this type of music.  Now, Mr. Keith has presented us with a song that, from almost any way you slice it, is just downright awful. I am not a country elitist. I don't need to scour the Earth for the most meaningful lyrics and inspiration message. But this song is just downright garbage.	-1
'Rise of the Masters' commences with a piece that makes you stop all you are doing, listen, and begin to sway from side to side. Then the peace of God descends into your heart followed by a smile that rises from your heart to your face. You start praising God for such gifted composers whose composition and performance bring joy to your heart and changes the atmosphere all around you. On and on it goes --raptured peace and joy, piece after piece. You pray for others to be blessed by 'Supreme Classical Masterpieces'' a gift to all who can appreciate it.	-1
that the kids downloaded with some of my free downloads that I got when I ordered good music. I'm sure this sucks as it's Coldplay.	-1
The voices are too low and not as clear as I would like. It's like they were too far from the microphones. I have 3 or 4 copies of this song and they all are the same.	-1
I love that we can download music so fast and it is available online for free storage and great service.	-1
A great freebie from our friends at Amazon.  This is one of the best ways to try out new stuff.	-1

This was free and I didn't even download it. I'm not a big fan of the harpsichord and this is not my style.	-1

Wow...this must be their first CD even before America's Got Talent.  I am very musical and have to say that the harmony's were just off.  Did buy their most recent CD though and it was great.  Seems like they finally got their act together.  Sent this back as it was getting on my last nerve after the 3rd song.  Do not recommend.	-1
When it has came down to the cast of Glee, they have shown to be just wannabe singers, who've made songs that are strong into weak little heartstrings that were not meant to be broken. Their renditions of some classics from Whitney Houston, to Bon Jovi, all the way to Madonna have shown that they are just not as brilliant as what they were. For their rendition of Adele's Rumour Has It & Someone Like You, feels absolutely awful. Yet when it has came down to Adele, she has really brought out a absolutely strong vibe from her rhythms with Someone Like You and the definitive song of the year, Rolling In The Deep. Even if you're a fan of Glee, I would definitely recommend that you pass this one up, and just stick with Adele's originals instead.  Song: D	-1

I like the song, so maybe this is unfair. However, the MP3 I downloaded started with the first line in English and then it switched to Spanish. I didn't see anything in the description to indicate that this MP3 was bilingual or I wouldn't have purchased it. I like Chris Tomlin and I like his voice. It is the MP3 bilingual version that I didn't ask for or want that I object to.	-1
Out of all of the singers to chose from, Jeff May was the best. That's not to say that I'm pleased to have a male singer to preform "Mary Did You Know", but I needed for my students to hear the melody. It's strange to me why Amazon failed to search for a female singer with a good voice and with a better delivery than Jeff May sing this song. As a top company like Amazon, surly can do a better job than the one they did on this one. "Mary Did You Know" is a sweet song and should be done softly with feeling. I have students that can put Jeff May to shame on this song. I do not mean to down play Jeff May. The song is just not made for a hard voice delivery.	-1
I rely did not like the way that he sings this song. He did not seem to have enough power in his voice to sing it. I think the best person I have heard sing this song is Clay Aiken.	-1
It sounds like she is saying "We found love in a homeless place" Cannot believe garbage gets airplay (but then again, 98 percent of what is getting mad airplay is just complete caca)	-1
When it has came down to what Rihanna had shown musically, it honestly has been too tongue and cheek, not even close to enough of her voice. Sadly, it has also drowned out her talent she had in her, and made her one of the most overexposed artists of the past several years. Her latest song We Found Love from her album Talk That Talk, feels like it is a weak mouse, that lacks in the polish she brought in when she came out in 2005 with Pon De Replay. I really felt it showed poorly just like the songs from her Loud and Rated R records had shown. I think personally for Rihanna, she should take a long break and find herself all over again. Then, she could fins a way to talk that talk for her fans, and for herself.  Song: D+	-1
There is no doubt that Rihanna has really been suffering musically with lackluster songs and overexposure. Her music has taken a turn for the worse, and that overexposure is really gotten to her voice. Where Have You Been, the 3rd single from her lackluster record Talk That Talk, is really not at the par she could make in her voice. She feels very robotic, and not really in tune with trying to set herself apart from her past songs like Umbrella and Only Girl In The World. I really was not very impressed with the song, and I feel Rihanna has a lot more to prove in her voice, than repeating herself in beats. Honestly, she should take a break from singing, and find a different tune and then she will know where she has been.  Song: D-	-1
When it has came right down to Rihanna, she has honestly been one of the most overexposed artists of the past several years, whom has honestly made some of the most corny songs to have ever came out of the industry. I was honestly not even close to thrilled with the songs she did from both Rated R and Loud. For her latest single, You Da One, the second song from her lackluster record Talk That Talk, she tries to bring in a bit more reggae in her voice. Yet, she has honestly weakened it with each note she tries to sing, drowned out by the dance beats of the song. I think Rihanna should just take a very long break, and try not to make anymore cornball music.  Song: D-	-1
When it has came down to Rihanna, she has been one of the most cornball artists of the past several years. Yet, her songs have made her very annoying, and not really a strong singer. She really has became so oversaturated after Umbrella, and now it has became more tiring hearing her music than a blessing. Her latest single from her album Talk That Talk, You Da One is absolutely poor. She really doesn't have the strike in her voice that she once had awhile ago. I honestly think Rihanna needs to definitely take a very long break from singing and find herself as a growing woman all over again. After what went through with Chris Brown over 2 years ago, she really has let her songs go to thin, and now she is not da one.  Song: D-	-1

When it has came down to Rihanna, musically she has made some of the worst song out there for the past several years. She has been so overexposed, and yet she still needs to really find her voice. Her latest song, Birthday Cake from Talk That Talk was really short absolutely disgraceful from start to finish. Not only is it terrible and short, but what really gets me angry is the remix of her song, as she collaborates with the man whom had assaulted her and abused her at The Grammy awards 3 years ago, Chris Brown. It definitely has wasted Rihanna's credibility away as a performer by a lot, and when I said she really needs to find her voice, she definitely doesn't feel like she has one anymore. Maybe, Rihanna should just go away for a long while, then come back as a real singer.  Song: F	-1
Too short.	-1
I thought this was the song, but I didn't see where it said interlude! Who would buy an interlude to a song?	-1
As other reviewers have stated, this is only about a munute long, and rated a severe pg to r if unedited. The full length version as played on the radio is NOT this version or on the present album/CD. They remixed it and started playing on the radio, but I have not seen it yet here. When buying, I learned that you should review it first(listen to it here) and look on the far right as to the minutes of the song itself. Regardless, paying the full price for a "commercial" is just plain wrong. It amazon looks at the results, they loose more in customer goodwill and business then worrying about someone copying it then "returning" it. They wouldn't for this truncated short!!!  The song itself worries me, because on this album she has gotten, well, pornographic on many songs. Plus a song with the guy who quote "beat her" sends the wrong message. I hope this talented artist is not moving to the fringe. I Love her work.	-1
When it has been down to the case with Rihanna, she has honestly been known for her partying ways right now, than really taking seriously the drive of really making good music to call her own. Sadly, instead of taking her time and finding the right notes, she has rushed herself into making another mediocre set of songs with Talk That Talk, and her latest single Where Have You Been, hasn't really been as driven or inspiring as she could've made it out to be in her voice. I really didn't feel very driven into the song at all. Personally, I think Rihanna should take a breather and then come back with a better voice to match the rhythms.  Song: D	-1
thought this song was some thing else but it was free so i guess its okay to listen to but wouldn't pay for it	-1
Someone that loves nothing but piano music might think about this, but to me it was too much of the same thing. I got bored with it quickly.	-1
I liked this song fine on the radio but man it has been OVER PLAYED so much. If I never hear it again it will be too soon!	-1
Unfortunately i cannot review this song because i cannot find song on my phone, but amazon took the money out of my account! I take back the horrible review. Amazon was amazing wiyh helping me navigate the soft ware.they get five stars!	-1
I don't want this	-1
I was a huge fan of the Killers' first disc, HOT FUSS. It has a good vibe to it, and a new brand of New Wave. However, I was MAJOR dissapointed with the new disc Sam's Town. Instead of original songwriting, this album sounds like they took the song "Smile like you mean it" and decided to make an entire album out of it. There are only two listenable songs on the disc, "Bones" and the last song. Otherwise, AVOID.	-1
This isn't the bottom of the barrel as far as the mediocre sounds currently on the radio. If it doesn't grate my nerves that much and doesn't make me feel like i am enduring chinese water torture (like those godawful j-lo/pitbull collaborations), i suppose 2 stars is what i rate this. There's really nothing special here. Average, forgetful top 40 dance pop which will not be remembered by anybody in about five minutes.	-1
It is weird when you think you are going to hear a particular song and it starts playing a different one. For example, "I feel like travelin' on" does not play but instead an instrumental of another song. I think the instrumental playing is "I will hasten to Him" or whatever the actual name of the song but you are not hearing "I feel like travelin' on".You will actually hear that song,"I feel like travelin' on" when you click on the song, "I shall not be moved". Most of the songs play under the right title but these are two examples of wrong titles to some songs.	-1
I just don't enjoy listening to this song. I have been trying to delete it but haven't succeeded.	-1

Do yourself a favor and download Jeff Beck's version instead. It is an amazing song but this version is brutal.	-1
This song was not what I was looking for in Christmas music. It sounded more like a Catholic stuck in a well! I can't figure out how to get it off my device, but I no longer have it on a playlist.	-1

stupid pop rap flo rida song with the same beat as good feeling this song is aweful this wannabe rapper is one of the worst	-1
Love this club song.  Came out around Thanksgiving 2011.  Heard it on Y100 every minute.  Love Sia, she sounds like Pink.  Video is also wild.  Flo rida made his mark in my book as a top notch lyricist.  Great rap & song combo.  Obviously, great sports bar and club tune.	-1
Predicable run of the mill singing with the usual predictable no talent, out of tune rapper cutting in in the middle likehe wandered onto the wrong song.  Horrid garbage.  This isn't even worth of the title of music.	-1
I don't know what you want me to say about this music but it not worth having. its not good.	-1
I look for a little more umph in my music then this album has, if you like slow you will like this.	-1
Dierks career continues to be highjacked by subpar songs.  The guy is incredibly talented but the song selection continues to lag.  At least my kids know what the popo is now.	-1
One Direction is clearly one of the worst boybands to ever exist on this planet. I am so tired of this song being confirmed as a love ballad. On American Idol, two groups chose this song. I am bothered by this band. Whenever I hear the names of any person in this band or the bands name, it hurts. I really don't like this song or this band what-so-ever. Of course you knew I didn't. It's obvious that I dont.	-1
I honestly prefer Tower Of Power or Frankie Beverly and Maze, but this just okay. I saw a video of them on Teenick and said 'hmm this isn't too bad" but when i heard the rest of the album i was not impressed. Teenagers like this better,  and would find artists i named or Ronnie Laws or Raydio (w ray parker jr) to be quite whack. Be tht as it may, 1D is not enough to make me vomit, but there is a better chance of my left foot falling off than going to see them, or putting one of their songs on my iPod.	-1

Kajagoogoo's lead singer Limahl scored his lone top 40 hit with the theme song to the forgettable film "The NeverEnding Story".  The song, like the film, is equally forgettable.  Set over a swirling Giorgio Moroder synth beat, Limahl and Beth Anderson trade lines about fantasy, reaching for the stars and rainbows.  The song is trying to convey a soaring,fantasy world and just comes across as overwrought and bland.  The song peaked at number 17 in mid 1985 and luckily for Limahl most people only associate him with "Too Shy".	-1
Quality is good, and sound can be amped to pretty good. The selection is wide and pleasent, too many popular selections, so the whole album might have been as good or better with quite a few less songs. I want more focus of a type, and message, possibly a slant toward Lutherans.	-1
too expensive	-1
why did he have to drop the F$%* word??	-1
I did not realize this was different than the one I hear on the radio - don't know why thay bothered when they had a great song and this version took the power out of the regular version just so he could cuss. It will be a while before I would get another of their songs - it would really have to be something special. I will erase it from my library because the music was ruined, not by the words but the terrible music quality.	-1
It was good then the radio wouldn't stop playing it. Now I regret buying it. Song makes no sense. And listening to it hurts your head.	-1
Disney has now started to just push people out there and sing songs that just about anyone could sing. The song is not bad, it just has no identifying quality that can make it stand out. If you look at Selena Gomez, Miley Cyrus, or Victoria Justice, they at least put stuff out there that people listen to, with great production and lyrics attuned for todays audience. This one sounds like she is trying to be a rated G Kesha or Katy Perry cross. I do not blame her, its the production. If she has a voice let her use it. This is what we get when merchandising is more important then expanding the artist.	-1
This song is catchy, and gets in my head, BUT the lyrics!!!!!  My daughters love the song, but I end up just laughing!	-1

If you are looking for a good song to download, you might as well X out of this and look for something else. Seriously, They could've been one of those electro-pop bands I listen to, and this is the best they could do? This song was fun to listen to during the olympics, so I say I would give it two stars. After all, there's better songs than this.	-1

When it has came down to Katy Perry, she just hasn't had a universal song that has delivered from the voice alone. Her music has gotten to be cheap, and not of tone from the heart. She expanded her 2010 album Teenage Dream which sold very well, and added some songs that really cheapened the drive of the album. Wide Awake is honestly one of the songs, and honestly the song is not really exciting or driven. I was not very impressed with the song. It was not as appealing as her earlier songs showed to everyone like California Gurls did. I think Katy should take more time and find better in her voice, than just rushing music out that cheapens her style. That can make you fall asleep faster.  Song: D	-1
This song is just meh...it's ok...but the vocals are bad...the lyrics aren't nearly as bad as other Ms Perry songs but they are still not particularly good. If the vocals are better this song could be good...but it just hurts the ears since the voice singing it just cracks far too often...even with all the digital effects added to the song.	-1
This is awful. I'm so sick of hearing this song. Someone put her to sleep and ban her from radio indefinitely.	-1
What can i say other than THIS SONG SUCKS. Sounds like everything else on the radio. But isn't that what Katy Perry does? She's a professional copyist another top 40 puppet in the music business entertainment machine. Her puppet strings pulled by her handlers, producers, and label bosses. Who says Derek Zoolander types are fictitious? There's a bunch of em in da music business! In da top 40 radio! that's where! She is cute though and has a nice set of titillators. But that's it, no substance, just eye candy.	-1

This song is terrible!  It's a below average song that actually gets worse the more you listen to it.  After a couple of times, it actually gets painful! I HATE this song with a passion!	-1
This song never came through. I tried several times to download. I love the music of Luke Bryan. I will have to buy the whole cd.	-1
There is no question that Jennifer Lopez just hasn't been able to shimmer in her music lately. She has focused too much on the dance pop music, that she hasn't really stretched her voice, and it has made her incredibly weak. Her latest song Dance Again isn't actually anything that really feels invigorating from Jennifer Lopez. Her new collaboration with Pitbull just doesn't show they have the chemistry to click, like they did with On The Floor. I think Jennifer should take a break from singing for a long while, and just focus on American Idol as a judge. Perhaps, it is time for her to hang up her pipes for awhile, and find a better rhythm for her voice.  Song: D+	-1

DO NOT listen to this version of coming home. It TOTALLY defeats the Coming Home song, and just makes you want to yell at this person for ruining the song.	-1

I know we all grow and I know with singers so do their styles and what not but this is just garbage. I do wish her the best on her new album but if this and that song with Monica are what's in store, I won't be buying.	-1

There is a lot of buzz at the moment (Mid 2012) about a singer called 'Regina Spektor' and this is her latest album 'What we saw from the cheap seats'.  I believe, from what I have read, that back in 2008 or thereabouts she won an award for best female singer. However, listening to this album, I can't see what the fuss is about. Regina is hardly a great singer, her songs are generally average and her piano playing is very good.  This is generally very simple music, with vocals and piano, and some songs have a bit more built up arrangements. Spektor's vocals are sometimes too soft, sometimes too fast, and, occasionally, good, but rarely impressive. Very few of the songs are notable. The third one, 'Don't Leave Me' is a nice reggae song, the last song, 'Jessica', is a nice ditty and the best song, the one where you feel more effort and passion was put into it, is 'Ballad of a politician' a song about the dirty deals. Some of the lyrics are really silly, especially 'All the rowboats', not that that's a bad thing.  The again, this album starts off really badly; Regina sings 'Small town moon' really fast and it's hard to understand the words, and things take a turn for the worse on 'Oh Marcello', which keeps interchanging between a cover of the Animals 'Don't let me be misunderstood' and some rapping - a terrible song!  All in all, there's very hardly any memorable songs, although there  are good moments, especially when she gets emotional at the piano. This isn't bad music, just unmemorable, treads already well worn ground, and when it does try to be original the results aren't very good. 2 / 5	-1
Here is how I feel about Regina Spektor: when I first heard her 4 or 5 years ago, I thought, "wow! she is really unique and awesome!"... then came her next record and I thought.... "hmmm sounds pretty much like the one before it...." She has managed to continue this cycle for 5 straight records... I think that's a record or something (pun intended). I just want to tell her, "yea, we've got it, you like kick drum and rubato piano playing and repeating 1 word a million times for effect..."	-1
It's a decent album, the best song is Don't Leave Me.  Most of the album is way too similar to Tori Amos, if you have Tori's albums, not much point to buying this one.  And yes, admittedly, there are some elements of bad singing in small doses in some parts of some songs, nothing too overwhelming though.  Cool album cover.	-1
I was not into it, you might be, but I was not. Not in my library any more. I like some thing a little different then this.	-1

Boring. Boring. Even more Boring.  All the songs sound exactly the same.  I don't know what he was thinking with this one, but this one stinks.  The whole 70's vibe is so out of place and sounds dated and tired.  There isn't even one stand out track on this one, it sounds like one slow boring song...the kind that you would change the radio station 10 seconds in. I have liked mostly all of John's albums...but this one is even more boring than all his past efforts.  You should pick this one up if you like to listen to the same song for 55 min, then it may be an enjoyable ride for you. If you like an album to have ups and downs and twists and turns than this is not for you...skip it.  If you like this sound...there is a band that does it 100% better called "Mother Hips" and the lead singer of that band has a couple of solo albums that are very good too his name is Tim Bluhm check them out instead.	-1
You can add this track to the list of songs that sits around on my harddrive and never gets listened to. Wait, maybe I actually deleted it... Someday I'll learn to be more careful around free samples.	-1
Downloaded just fine.  Not sure what else to say about an mp3 purchase other than I didn't like the song and it works just fine.	-1
"No one can tell you how, tonight you're on the loose!"  Yeah, that's right, bitch. This was a great anthem to the early 80's pop/rock scene which was just about to explode. Ok, so you had Loverboy, Foreigner, and Billy Squier. But Saga was different. No smart-ass lyrics like Loverboy, no sad boo-hoo songs like Foreigner. Just feel good rock that sounded great on your boom-box or car radio. I still like to listen to this track while driving in L.A. It brings you above all those spoiled kids in their BMW's and huge SUV's. (Even if the douche just tailgated you for the last 15 exits).	-1
I ran the versions being sold on Amazon through a digital audio workstation and have concluded that they are all subsantially compressed and loudened to compete with so-called modern songs.  If Amazon does decide to offer the un-remastered ORIGINAL tracks from Graceland I will actually buy them.  Until then, look "elsewhere", or hold on to your original Graceland CDs.	-1
Spark Seeker's slick computer driven pop production loses the earthy realism of Matisyahu's earlier and much better albums. Just like his look which went from warm, holy Jew to cold, sunglasses over sad eyes, bleach blond corporate "pop star", his music has sadly followed in the same artificial flavor path. Spark Seeker is over-produced laptop created techno pop for people with short attention spans and hands on their cellphones 24 hrs a day. The music has about as much spark and depth as a Michael Jackson album. If you have nothing better to do you might dance a little to it but then you realize that your really not being moved and you flip channels. For some strange reason that seems like either a bad acid trip or some kind of serious case of bi polar disorder, Matis seems to be riding the plastic train of superficiality full speed ahead.  To go from a cool sincere Jew, proudly committed to the Jewish faith to a Hollywood type prancing around like a stoned effeminate factory made pop star wearing more scarves than Elton John is about as spiritual as a good Saturday Night Live skit. Its good comedy but certainly not real art or real life(living). There is nothing spiritual going on here except worship of the EGO-that false god that claims the lives and vitality of many good people. The whole "spiritual journey" thing is a total scam as the journey here is all about ME--not Him.  Jews don't have spiritual journey's on facebook and twitter and with constant photo shoots celebrating new haircuts. After 3500 years their path to the One above is much, much deeper. They have spiritual journeys when they are true to their Torah and their identity. Everything else is just Hollywood. Matis himself sang this in the song "Jerusalem" --"Change your name and your identity, don't you know that's not the way to be". His fans need to be given a little more credit. Does he really think that they would fall for this sad display of holy Jewish soul that lost its way? No one wants to see the Jews act like everyone else. The world wants the Jews to be role models to teach the great wisdom about life that they have. Those who understand will understand and pray for all the impressionable children soiled by this irresponsible use of popularity and influence. Let's hope and pray that Matisyahu finds his way back to his soul and this is just a short detour in his life's journey.	-1
Bought this for a work function, not for me. I am sorry that I could not give a more in-depth review.	-1
Ok, let me get one thing straight, this song is catchy. But, I didn't buy this song. It was gifted by a friend who thought it would be funny to buy me this song for my birthday gift. Hah hah....	-1
Don't get me wrong, I am a big fan of Jackyly and Jessie James Dupree, but I don't giving 4 or 5 stars just because I like the group or artist. This album here is one of the weakest albums I have heard from Jackyl. No, I am not one of those fans who say the first album was the only good album, far from it, but this album here to me failed to produce those stand out songs that are worthy of being inducted into Jackyls live set, or best of considerations. I consider their last album, "When moonshine and dynamite collide" to have much better stand out tracks than this one here.  To try and prove I'm not just giving this album a low rating because i'm not much into Jackyl, than i'll include previous review ratings.  Jackyl (1992)  - ***** (5) Push Comes to Shove - ****  (4) Cut The Crap  - ****  (4) Relentless  - ****  (4) When Moonshine and..- ****  (4) Stayin' Alive  - ***  (3.5)  So, I'm not someone who gives Jackyl low scores... even some of those albums fans have rated much lower, but I enjoyed quite a few of the tracks. However this album failed to produce much at all that stood out and would be a memorable enough song to consider Jackyl adding to live shows and best of's..  1. Best In Show  - Not a great song. ** 2. Encore  - I get where they're going with this, but it could have been better instead of feeling generic. ** 3. Screwdriver  - Probably the best song on the album, but not worthy of much more than 3 stars. *** 4. Horns Up  - Are they trying anymore? ** 5. Golden Spookytooth  - Easily forgettable. 6. Cover Of The Rolling Stone - ** 7. Walk My Mile  - ** 8. Favorite Sin  - ** 9. Better Than Chicken  - Weird, but kinda catchy, but still weird. *** 10. Don't Lay Down On Me  - ** 11. Eleven  - ** Some of the songs I even felt like Jessie wasn't singing in key, and it made it hard to listen to anymore of those songs. Bonus Track 12. It's Tricky  - They could have done a much better job of covering this than they have. **  Overall score. ** (2.5) the lowest score I have given a Jackyl album so far. Like I said, some songs sounded like Jessie was singing out of key. A few songs sounded like they where forced out, aka Fillers, and the best of the songs was just enjoying listening to Jackly sing their signature backing vocals loudly to make even some of the weirdest lyrics sound cool. But where is the super stand out songs? This album feels like it is missing the big single, and the 2 extra awesome rocking tracks, and instead give a few left overs and a sore attempt at recreating "Secret of the bottle".  Sorry, but this album to me is the worst effort from Jackyl so far... well, worst overall album unless you discard the live versions and cover songs from "Stayin' Alive" then that would be the worst effort... but this one here only contained one cover song, and it didn't sound like they nailed it enough to make it their very own.  But, a swing and miss here won't make me say the band have struck out, I'm sure they will come out swinging and hit harder on the next album. So here's to the next album being more fired up than this one.	-1
WOW. Adam Levine needs to seriously take some singing lessons. He just cant sing. And why does EVERY song they make sound EXACTLY THE SAME?? they need to put more thought into the words and try and sound like a dude	-1
overated. I don't know why I bought it.. I feel stupid... but what can I do now right? lol so yea...	-1
You could loop their entire catalog into one song and i wouldn't know the difference. This is the by product when your music is made for the sole purpose of being played on mainstream radio.	-1
Ditch the voices too, I bet a group with this kind of talent would sound great in a post-rock structure.  GET WITH IT!	-1
I don't like it cause it's not for me. If someone like this song, I will tell them about this song,so they can download it for them else.	-1
Just a bunch of crumby muzak, and in my opinion, does not accomplish its intended purpose. I guess each individual really needs to listen to a good sample before getting this type of relaxation music.	-1
I imagine that this would be nice if it was a whole cd,but from what I heard I just thought it was okay.	-1
"CSN", "Deja Vu", "After The Gold Rush". These were the albums that helped to define an era for some of us. "CSN" never supassed that first album, either collectively or individually though they did have some good songs on some albums. Neil Young was able to transcend the era, that is why he still is a vital recording artist. Nostalgia makes me sad. I don't need it.	-1
ok	-1
i  was  curious  about them  after hearing there first couple of records  and i didn't know they morphed into Jimmy Buffett?  i'm  hearing this album and it has polished production  and some slick arrangements  however  the songs  don't really  go anywhere.i  was  thinking how this band is puling a rascal flats and other accessible country acts  with pop cross over movements.  slick record  with not alot of memorable material.	-1
Lightweight Jordin Sparkes is lacking soul. Maybe she'll grown into a soulful voice. I was glad to hear a gospel gem done by the late Whitney Houston. It showed  that she still had a sizeable vocal ability of her former range. After listening to the remakes on this CD for the re-make movie of "Sparkle", I went back to play good old Aretha's 1976 studio joint. Miss Franklin really put it down. She had the advantage from being from the '60s era depicted in the 1976 film. Rather than use the vocals of the actors (Irene Cara, Lonette McKee) in that film, music producer, Curtis Mayfield  collaborated with "ReeRee" and put it out to chart and sell records. The record they did still holds up against this half-baked attempt. I hope the upcoming film re-make fairs better. NOT!	-1
The original soundtrack to the 70s movie featured the voices of Irene Cara and Lonette McKee. Even though audiences obviously liked their versions, for some reason, probably commercial, Aretha was hired to reinterpret the songs. I think the market could have bore both the original soundtrack AND Aretha's. Aretha's would have probably triumph but audiences were not trusted enough to make their own choices. But if Lonette McKee and Irene Cara weren't marketable, Carmen Ejogo is even less so. Jordin Sparks sounds even more tentative especially on original song "Look into Your Heart". (For a further reality check on how Whitney's voice has changed, listen to her version of that song on the 1994 tribute album to Curtis Mayfield....she was in a different zone entirely). Goapele's "Running" is probably the best thing on here. Cee-lo is not quite as charming as on "F-You", but, the music on "I'm a Man" is hot. Jordin sounds a little better on "One Wing" and "Love Will", but, that's only comparatively speaking.. I am trying to like "Celebrate", but, should I really have to try? The song is just not very strong. Whitney's performance in the trailer looks sweet and sensitive and encouraging. Maybe that is where we'll find the "Sparkle" because it is most assuredly NOT in this soundtrack.	-1
This is an artist meant to be seen/heard live, not to listen to his albuns.  They are difficult, strange. Ok, one can come with the old cliche "it is outside the box", but Vai's song writing was lacking.  Anyway, this is such a gifted, talented, fast, precise guitar player, that playing anything even remotely close to usual structures and tap footing is an idea that will never appear in his head.  I bought Story Of a Light in the merchandise stand right after being mesmerized by Vai's show. The disappointment was so great, that's when I saw the HUGE difference between seeing him live and listening to his albums.	-1
In the world of guitarists you have many types, people who are virtuosos (Vai, Satriani, Eddie Van Halen) use no book, throw it completely out the window and play even by ear. You have people with very unique recognizable styles (Eric Clapton, Slash, BB King, Stevie Ray Vaught etc), who aren't "super guitarists" but good in their own right. And strictly by the book guitar players (Tony McAlpine, John Petrucci, Jeff Loomis, Chris Broderick), Berkley school of music by the book perfectionists. Which can become boring quick. The two super "solo" guitarists who started all this without a doubt were Vai and Satch, with Hendrix and Halen paving the path before them. While Satriani has enjoyed huge success through the years and given lessons to countless people, and many great albums, Vai has remained "around" as i would say with some notable and not so notable albums. Vai has the very trippy, unique, 70's Frank Zappa style guitar playing, and out of key, odd chord progressions, along with various effects to boot. This can be very cool, but also very annoying. The best album Vai has/had ever done was definitely Passion And Warfare IMO, and hasn't done much since that you can listen all the way through and say wow that's just a great album to put in from beginning to end. While Satch on the other hand makes albums you can listen to, hum along to, and just listen to again and again. And his song writing ability, and creativity far surpasses Vai.  I think Vai is an excellent, technically proficient guitarist with some wild ideas, and super creativity. But as i said that doesn't always make it an enjoyable listen, as much as a lot of out of key noise. There are some slightly enjoyable tracks including Velorum, The Moon and I, and Chasing the world. And they are much more simplistic than the rest of the album. Other artists who do this type of, what i call over dramatic, quirky crazy playing are "animals as leaders", "Devin Townsend" (mostly his singing and song writing), and even someone like Tony McAlpine with his strange combinations of Jazz and whatever you want to call it. So this is just another album much like the ones he's done over the last 15 years or more. Most songs have no direction for a straight through "calm enjoyable listen". And this music is without a doubt an acquired taste. All these guitar players are good in their own ways but Vai just isn't one that i can tolerate anymore. I like the more straight forward, hum along, tab your foot to guitar playing. And the only band i've really heard do this type of music right and make it great is Mastodon (along with their brilliant song writing skills and singing). Get rid of all the wild sound effects Steve, and just make some good guitar music, we all know you can.	-1
I only got this because it was free without previewing. Leason learned. Shortly after downloading, I deleted it. I enjoy a wide range of "good" music including oldies, R&B, blues, rock, pop, metal, and some country. But this one doesn't make the cut. Intrumentals and performance were barely OK, writing was bad and amaturish. I do not recommend to any music lover.	-1
This was a free track, but I haven't listened to it more than once. Guess it just isn't my thing.	-1
Downloaded just fine.  Not sure what else to say about an mp3 purchase other than I didn't like the song and it works just fine.	-1
I really can't put my finger on it but this album did not have the same feel as his others.  As an artist I love his style, love his nice flowing slow songs but I couldn't find any on this one that grabbed me like his previous albums.  Even his mixtapes had awesome tracks on them that I loved.  I will give the album another listen, then go back to his other classic albums.  I guess you could say I am a little dissapointed cause he had set the bar so high in his previous outings.	-1
Broke R.Kelly still doing a Broke Karoke take and no musical growth. now the  cat can sing and has moments where his voice saves otherwise paint by the numbers material which leaves alot to be desired. still waiting for a signature song by him and hopefully one of these days his music will expand and go beyond the same ole same. his albums never show the same promise as his mix tapes and  hook work do and its time he swtiched things up.	-1
Trey Songz can be considered the most successful "baby making" R&B singer as of right now and you cannot deny the man's worth ethic. I loved his previous works especially "Ready" and "Passion, Pain & Pleasure" which showed a drastic evolution of Trey's artistry. Ready (Trey's greatest work) was Trey mastering his sound as a pure sex driven man as well as an allure variety of slow jams. Passion, Pain & Pleasure amassed a more pop-crossover sound and probably Trey's most experimental album to date. And now we come to his latest project Chapter V, a long 18 track album. Now, right off the back the album title Chapter V is already unoriginal, this is his 5th album and every album before this one was (in theory) like a chapter in his life which is already a disjointed idea because at least 70% of all his albums contained no real themes besides his latest 2 releases. The dissapointing thing about this album is that it tries to repeat the magic he created from the last 2 albums filling itself with interludes and an array set of songs. The problem with this album is that unlike Ready or PPP, the concepts don't tie in very smoothly and the interludes serve no purpose when they transition into the next songs. The sequencing of the album is very sloppy and Trey's song writing seems to have gotten worse than his latest attempts. Chapter V has no real focus, just an album full of singles.  Sadly I only happened to enjoy 5 tracks and thats it. There are 18 freakin tracks and I only liked 5 whereas the last 2 albums I can pretty much listen to the entire albums all the way through. Tracks like "Panty Wetter" is a prime example of a slow jam being done correctly. Songs about sex is how Trey Songz established himself and this is where he works the best, this is the lane where Trey can lap any other R&B artist even Usher and Frank Ocean at the moment. "Dive In" and "Fumble" are ballads that are very reminicent of his previous songs like "Neighbors Know My Name" and "Love Faces". But I can feel that Trey is more comfortable with these type of songs in contrast to the other songs which I will elaborate later on. The last 2 songs I did happen to enjoy happen to be "Without A Woman" and "Pretty Girls Lie" which contain a lot more substance compared to the the majority of the album. Now with R&B music, it is really difficult to think of concepts about love that hasn't been done before, and Trey still hasn't accomplished that yet but at least he does try to have a little variety.  Now the negatives of the album are present all over the place. Every song on the album that featured a guest rapper (and there are actually a lot) all suck in my opinion. Each feature was neither memorable nor necessarily needed and they lacked the chemistry that Trey has had in the past with rappers like Nicki Minaj, Drake or Fabolous. The horrendous track "2 Reasons" with T.I. was a down graded version of "Say Ahh" and "Bottoms Up". The track with Young Jeezy and Lil Wayne uses Football as a metaphor to connect with girls, but fails miserably. I completely hated the track "Check Me Out" featuring the overrated Meek Mill and the always annoying Diddy which should not have been added to the tracklist nontheless should have never been chosen to end the album before the outro. The song with Rick Ross wasn't actually bad but Rick Ross didn't add anything spectacular to the song and could've easily been done without him on the song. The MAIN problem I have with this album is that this is Trey just doing the same old thing, just a different year. Nothing on the album was very memorable nor groundbreaking compared to the other songs he has created in the past. Nothing on the album is really any different than his previous albums and I think the main thing that bothers me is that now he really is trying to do pop tracks, as opposed to experimenting with pop sounds, which is sad because I do not think his voice appeals to pop music, his voice is way to sensual. Now I may sound like a hater but it is what is, this album just didn't do anything for me, and half the time Trey's voice may have sounded good, but his god awful corny songwriting just killed it for me. As of now I don't think I will ever buy another Trey Songz album from here on out because I just realized that his talent really peaked with his 3rd album Ready, and I have a strong feeling that he is just going to continue to make albums that are just more and more similar each time.	-1
While I usually enjoy his music, to me regardless of the message, were it pro DEM or GOP it is just plain bad music.  I so wished it was better, I really was looking for new good music!	-1
Too loud	-1
Icona Pop's "I Love It" is a textbook example of lazy song-making.  It uses a catchy hook and the same few lyrics and just repeats them over and over and over again.  Sure, the beat is entertaining and energetic, but it gets old very quickly.  There is no attempt at any type of creativity here.  It's just a mass-produced money grab.    Some people will say "It's a dance song, what did you expect?  Lighten up".  Well, as has been proven by Krewella with "Alive", Demi Lovato with "Heart Attack" and Foxes with "Clarity", you can have catchy energetic dance beats, as well as varied lyrics and musical elements that make the song more worthy of repeated listenings.  "I Love It" just doesn't have that.	-1
the Dj put a fly beat to an aight song but honestly the song aint wheezy's best but I bught it thining it would fly at the party but neigh so oh whoa iz me research before U purchase	-1
This album would've been so much better with live instrumental. I hope his next one will be 100% great like the other albums....	-1
Nice song	-1
Actually I let her go and I couldn't be happier. I'm really not sure what he is whining about. Next!	-1
"Let Her Go" is a typical sappy ballad by a singer comes across as trying to hard to be a 'super sensitive' man trying to woo the ladies' hearts.  There's nothing particularly bad about this song.  It just happens to be too slow, even for the type of song it is, and not very interesting to listen to.	-1
Not a bad song. This isn't as "new" as everyone thinks. It's been out for while. I believe it came out a year or two ago.	-1
Passenger's "Let Her Go" has some deep and meaningful lyrics, but I just couldn't get past the singer's voice.  I'm all for quirky vocalists that don't fit the tradional mold, but I just couldn't get into the guy's voice.	-1
Bad vocals.	-1
She's receiving a lot of love on this album,but I can't front,I'm not feeling it. Only songs that has a nice vibe on here are "Don't Wake Me Up","Elusive","Everything","Gone"{o.k},"Tease Me"{o.k} & "They Could Be Wrong"{o.k}.	-1
If one has listened to and understood the brilliance of drummers like Art Blakey and Elvin Jones, it is hard to get excited by a drum machine, and although there are great musicians out there that sometimes use them successfully  (Beck and the Eels immediately spring to mind) most times they just sound synthetic.  Chan Marshall has an amazingly rich, soulful,and dare I say organic voice and is a great songwriter, she has worked with some of the best musicians this country has to offer including some of Al Greens backup band, why on earth would she opt this time for a synthetic, cheesy, euro-disco/trip-hop sounding record?   The Albums Moon Pix and You Are Free are masterfully spare, soulful and creative gems and although I would not want to stifle an artist's need to explore, this album seems to defy her very nature. Her voice and lyrics, her strengths, seem to get lost in the mix, the synthetic music does not support those strengths but overwhelms them. Perhaps she can opt for a costume of raw meat and make the transformation complete and get an interview on 60 minutes.   To me this is, tragically, a 2 star effort by a 5 star artist, but it is a 5 star disappointment.	-1
Nope.	-1
Could not get this to download.  Kept getting error saying download failed.  This is a waste of money.  Don't buy if you want to download to your computer.	-1
I've always hated music criticism. So don't let my review discourage you from liking this album, listen to it and form your own opinion.  But this is one of those rare times I dislike an album so much I feel compelled to get on my computer and give it a one-star review.  Sometimes albums with great art have equally great music. With Imagine Dragons, this is not the case.  I'd recommend against impulse-buying, and I'd say you should definitely listen to this album before purchasing.	-1
song	-1
Love album but sound is terrible can't believe the record company dropped the ball on such a good album	-1
not as good as a song as i thought it would be so im sorry but is was not worth purchasin	-1
The recording is scratchy and hard to listen to.  Will have to go find another place to buy it if I want to listen, doesn't sound good.	-1
It is pretty pathetic that what most 'kids' want to hear is a bunch of lousy music which will not be remembered much after the pop stations stop playing it.  The music on this is meant to be highly accessible and easily forgotten.  Personally, when it comes to today's music, I have to go with Arcade Fire or bands which have been around for awhile.  I consider this to be instant gratification music for those . . . . and then it's gone!  Thank goodness for the latter.	-1
Wow.  Don't know what happened here.  Usually I have no problems with Amazon downloads, but this one sucks.  Not crisp.  Instead it's got a fuzzy, dull quality.  Does terrible justice to this Excellent tune.	-1
I purchased the CD because i really enjoyed the song Radiationactive. The song was and still is an excellent song, but the rest of the album does not come close to this one hit wonder. I am feeling very duped or taken advantaged of; i should have just purchased the song as a single and saved money.	-1
This tune is okay but it isn't destined to be a classic. I got this one during a buying spree and use it as a filler for burning discs, I could have been more selective but its okay.	-1
Another victim of the loudness war.  Compression & distortion ruin what would otherwise be a fine CD.  Here's a suggestion: Deaf recording engineers are really baaaaad for the end product.  If I wanted to listen to compressed & distorted, --I could always turn on the radio. OverCompression puts a turd in the proverbial punchbowl of fine art.	-1
i personlly think this song sucks not really country either	-1
This group basically performs the same song with different lyrics. Listen to Tornado and Pontoon...same melody, different bad lyrics. What has happened to country music when this garbage is popular?	-1
I was looking so forward to this coming out and ordering it. The quality of the sound was very poor, not clear. I just love their song Pontoon which I saw on one of the award shows which is why I bought this. I would have sent it back if I could. I've never received a new album cd with such poor quality of sound. It's really a shame because I really like Little Big Town.	-1
This is terrible! As my dad use to say: Just a bunch of noise. Deleted it quickly after downloading to use the space for better things.	-1
I've always thought that the best of Bon Jovi was Richie Sambora as he show us in his two previous jobs. But on this album I see the worst of the songs of  Bon Jovi's last albums. On the other hand, the sound of this CD is very noisy, like the style of some albums of the 70's . In short, and for not doing more blood, this cd can be summarized as a couple of good songs from a handful of bad and noisy songs.	-1
After his first solo album ... the superb " Stranger In This Town" ... I was firmly convinced that Sambora was the creatively superior one in the Bon Jovi / Sambora writing team ... now in 2012, I'm not so sure ...  Sambora's 2nd, and this, his 3rd solo record are quite forgettable ( as are all of Bon Jovi's albums since "Crush" , except for maybe "Lost Highway" )... in my opinion, that could be attributed to the idea that he has lost sight of the type of songs & sound that made his 1st solo record so good ...quality songwriting, catchy riffs, solid vocals & harmonies, and NOT over produced ...  One can only hope that at some point going forward Sambora recaptures the formula that he had when he did his best work ... but few artists ever do, because it is my feeling that an artist has only a certain number of good / great songs in them.  But I'll take mediocre Sambora music over just about anything else being released these days ...	-1
Hearing this mess I am so unmoved that I can't even find the inspiration to write a review that will put them down properly. The sludge is in their uncreative process. These people have no inspiration or imagination anymore, and I'm not surprised in the least that they took five years to deliver anything. Ofcourse it might go down well with many fans, given the sad reality that nearly the entire population of earth has reached new heights of being numb, senseless, lifeless and a subset of that get by on this kind of music. Music today, from new bands and veterans is the soundtrack of people that instinctively know that we're in an increasing spiral of destruction, and we're not having much fun with the music that used to work before. Artists have hit the dregs in its search for inspiration. I feel like I ought to say, "wash away us all and take us with the flood..."	-1
Just a Horrible album the guy singing sounds like a f'n girl and the f'n guitars are horrible along with everything else don't buy or download this album or band.	-1
I can't review this. I can't stand opera. Only listened long enough to identify it as opera then deleted. When the description said "crooner," I envisioned the style fo Frank Sinatra or Dean Martin. Not Opera!! Deleted it quickly.	-1
Nice song	-1
Thought it was a cute song... that only lasted about a week before I could not stand it any longer	-1
The lyrics to this so called "song" are absolutely awful. The lyrics are definitely the worse part...if you actually listen to the lyrics and comprehend them you will know just how little effort and thought was put into this song. Seriously just understand the lyrics, but most people who listen to this song would not even care about lyrics in a song...what do lyrics matter in a song? This song is made for people with no music taste whatsoever. It is simply one of the most annoying, worst excuses for a song created in the year it was released.  How this singer was even on a singing competition and got past the first round makes no sense. She cannot sing. And whoever she hires to write most of her lyrics obviously can't do their job either. Why anyone would listen to this song is beyond me, they must seriously have no music taste whatsoever. If you like this song you have just proved to the world you have no taste at all...not even remotely. This song is an utter embarrassment, and most people who listen to it are kids and kids should not even listen to this song but it has very suggestive lyrics for no reason.  The song is trying to be cute but it's actually rather nasty. If you listen to the lyrics it's about a woman who is extremely easy to get into her pants, meeting a random guy and agreeing to put out just about is what the song is about, she says that she just met this guy and gives her number and this is crazy...yes, it is crazy. What kind of s word gives her phone number out to the most random guy who doesn't even ask for it? She goes up right to him and gives her number to any guy she thinks she might have a chance of having intercourse with. It's pathetic.	-1
Video is better than the song is. Personally I think she is better with Owl City. This is a stupid song and what is with the album cover straight from the 80s?	-1
Best album since Dog & Butterfly, 5 stars, best since 1980s Bebe Le Strange, Harks back to the old classics, etc.  Give me a break!  Had this album been released in the 70's, it would have been reviled!  Remember when that happened to Magazine and in spite of the disappointments, Magazine is a FAR greater album than Fanatic. There are some good songs on the new CD but a lot of it is bland, experimental, and just plain average. You have to go all the way back to Brigade in 1990 if you wan't to talk a truly great Heart CD! This is NOTTTTT a great Heart CD, raving fans on here are WAYYYY to easy to please giving reviews like this for this album.  Like what are you even hearing?  Go back and listen to their 70's and 80's albums before the long layoff.  Heart since that decade long layoff has NEVER been the same!	-1
This album would've been so much better with live instrumentation. I hope her next one will be 100% great like she is on the road with her band....	-1
Son likes son ... I hate it.	-1
Downloaded for my girlfriend to use at a function on my iPod...did not realize this guy preaches Anti-Americanism, yet expects us to buy his music. Will never buy music from this artist ever again....you will not be allowed to talk bad about about my country and still reap monetary rewards from bad music!	-1
What's even sadder is that it has spawned a bunch of ripoff version. it's like caca begat caca. It's quite possibly the most annoying song I've heard in a while	-1
Tired of this song. Hate it! Why do we Americans support artists who sing about hating our soldiers and killing them. Why?	-1
It's a very repetitive song. It's just not my type of music. I can appreciate it though for what it is. I just don't recommend this song to anyone. It's not in English. The singing is mediocre at best. He's a better dancer	-1
NEVER RECIEVED THIS.  what else can I say............I paid and it NEVER showed up.... SCREWED and no  flippin cares... but someone got my cash, that was what is important I guess	-1
Totally misses the mark.	-1
I honestly can't stand this song - I just bought it for my dad.  The singing is fine,  I just recall the era when it was over saturated on the radio. *sigh*	-1
Not worth the price: this digital download was free!	-1
Kreayshawn became an internet sensation in the summer of 2011 with her hit song "Gucci Gucci" and has since been known perhaps for her controversies than for her music. The rare white female rapper will typically be known as a novelty act (anyone remember Sarai??) even if she is able to deliver strong beats, witty raps, and clever hooks. Lady Sovereign is one exception.  And several songs do deliver. "Go Hard" and "K234ys0nixz" (pronounced "Kreay-sonic" as if it really makes a difference) are two examples of this. But there are a number of wretched tracks too, such as "Luv Haus" which closes the album on a poor note. Bottom line, this album was released way too late, and it only sold 3900 copies in its first week, and it contains far too little interesting material for the mainstream listener. Unlike Lady Sovereign, the only white female rapper who has not completely faded from public consciousness after one song or album, Kreayshawn just does not deliver enough good stuff here to be taken seriously. 2.5 stars.	-1
Kreayshawn releases her debut album "Somethin Bout Kreay", shes known for her hit "Gucci Gucci" which blew up last year earning her a million dollar deal with Columbia Records. Things weren't all good though as she was in some controversy about a member from the White Girl Mobb named V-Nasty using the "N" word left and right. Thats just some stuff I wanted to let y'all know but anyway lets into this album...I'm going to do this review a little different and just let you know the good and the bad.. I listened to the album multiple times, and I had to force myself not to turn it off. Seriously I could go on all day about how bad this album is from the horrible hooks, to the uninspired verses, to getting outshined by the guest appearances, to the limited subject matter (Swag, Haters). Kreay did not deliver on this album and seems if though she didn't even try. I would not recommend this album, just check out the songs I labeled as good. I noticed she's at her best when she makes catchy songs, but when she tries other things it fails so bad. Ima be completely honest with y'all, this album is only for hipsters and people who only listen to Hip-hop because its a cool thing to do.	-1
This album would've been so much better with live instrumentation. I hope her next one will be 100% great like she is on the road with her band....	-1
There's a reason why this old dark soul has remained in obscurity........her talents, that of a dime store washerwoman, come a dime a dozen. Marlena Shaw said it best years ago, "Who is this bitch anyway?" Her gravelly, alcoholic-laced groans for a voice is like a cold sore you accidentally pour salt on. It makes you wanna holla and not in a good way. Lavette honey.......pack it in and go back to the oldest profession where you once triumphed greatly!	-1
Downloaded just fine.  Not sure what else to say about an mp3 purchase other than I didn't like the song and it works just fine.	-1
I bought this because they were on Steven Colbert and got the Colbert bump.  There is only 1 good song on this CD.  Buy the single!!	-1
got this for .99 cents. about right for the quality of the music. album gets old fast. it was worth a chance for .99 cents, would not pay full price	-1
I am not happy with this purchase at all.  I have really been into this type of music but this album left me high and dry.  Not happy at all with the songs.	-1
i've heard there  stuff and its a  cool mixture of the folkys  sounding  stuff which at times can lead to a hybrid of other things, however  they fall into a phrase called  "Sleepy time Music" which works well with Coffee and  rainy  days,  however it doesn't do much for me wide awake and there material sounds like one long song which has some nice moments here and there, however  nothing that to  me  merits the hype they are getting.  they  have talent,  however they have found a formula early on and they  seem content on it, which will work  for folks who accept that from them, however others it feels played out before it had a fully good chance at developing.	-1
Millions of people adore Mumford & Sons, finding their sound to be much more than pleasant folksy tunes but rather something like a revelatory, deeply meaningful expression of passion.  When I first heard M&S, I, too, found them revelatory. It was intensely refreshing to hear popular music that has soul--so much soul that they couldn't help but to project it at the tops of their lungs. It was a desperately needed reply to the current "I don't care / we do what we want" irreverent dance-pop glitz ethos.  Many listens later, I see M&S differently. The music reliably invokes excitement but, in doing so, it finds no space for subtlety or understatement. Their roots are in Back Country bluegrass and folk -- genres that are all about stories -- but in M&S's music there are no stories. Rather, this album is a lot like U2's City of Blinding Light: Biblical imagery expressed in generic terms. A flailing attempt to capture spirituality. Or maybe just to prevent boredom. Instead of stories intended to shake and inspire, we get posturing and shouting intended to excite. After a while, all the excitement becomes exhausting and empty, not unlike the dance-pop glitz they oppose.  I believe people are starved for deeper rewards than Maroon 5 and their dance-pop contemporaries offer, and I believe that's why M&S are the top-selling musicians in the country (and by a wide margin), because they give the instant impression of heartfelt folky soulfulness. But the truth, revealed after enough listens, is that they are closer to stadium rock. To find deeper rewards, you have to look to the folk / bluegrass / celtic roots that have inspired them: Bob Dylan or Van Morrison, or even more recent acts like Ray LaMontagne or Amos Lee. Their music may not be as instantly pleasurable or exciting as M&S's, but if you give it your patience and attention, you just might find rewards that are far more precious than excitement.	-1
Steve decides too late that he needs an answer to Maiden member's solo projects and Bruce Dickinson's Skunkworks album, and so he goes from the Maiden "prog" to 90s alternative. The path to this is simple. Get "inspiration" from any numerous average bands pretending to be fresh floating around today, get an average typical sounding singer of today to sing the same post grunge meets Disney/r&b melodies. Write the average songs. Then spend many years polishing the average songs to try and play it as if it hasn't been done before. For the finishing touch, sprinkle a few of your trademarks on the top and put your household name on it.  On an interesting note, there's only two songs over 6 minutes, truly a feat, not easily accomplished, for Mr. Harris! The final song The Lesson is a well written song.  It's nice to see Harris do things out of the normal Maiden mold, but apparently he has no good ideas either inside or outside of Maiden. Given that reality, maybe the next bright step might be to write a biography.	-1
I love Iron Maiden obviously and Steve Harris has been the driving force of that band since its inception, more than anyone else Maiden is Steve's baby. Steve Harris IS Iron Maiden let's get that out of the way. When Harris announced a solo project I thought it was great for him, it was an opportunity to flex his musical muscle outside of the beast that is Iron Maiden and that he could do whatever else he wanted with this one record. In fact I was kind of surprised that he hadn't done this sooner like Bruce Dickinson and Adrian Smith had, but at the same time Maiden was his reason to live all along. It took long for him to decide to do a solo album and in 2012 we have Steve Harris' first solo album, British Lion. Actually it's more of a side project than a solo record really. The origins of British Lion for further than we'd think. Harris mentored the band of the same name in the early 1990's and nothing happened, stayed in touch with some of the musicians and years later they worked out some music and release this.  At first I thought the title was a little bland, but I didn't care much it's about the music. Then it hit me that music is very much like the title, bland. It's generic and doesn't really go anywhere, yet doesn't exactly play it safe either and it ends up being quite honestly boring and blank at times. One thing that Maiden brought in the music was power, here there is no power at all it seems to be the exact opposite. It sounds more like a mainstream and commercial rock album than anything else, and I think outside of hardcore Iron Maiden fans supporting Harris there isn't much of a market at all for it.  "This Is My God" opens the album and from the start you get a sense that it's going to be different than Steve Harris' usual work and it indicates much of the sound of the album and the direction they were going with. I just find this first song inconclusive, it doesn't do a great job at putting the listener in any mood and it's not effective and a little disappointing to start British Lion with. "Lost Words" is much better and paints a nice imagery and feature strong lyrics it picks up the pace a little. "Karma Killer" isn't bad and it's almost catchy and I say almost because the vocals just don't go to that next level to bring out the catchiness of the song although it has a nice chorus and feel. "Us Again The World" is one of the songs that works, it's one that I could almost picture Bruce singing and Iron Maiden performing, but again the vocals aren't there to take it places, they don't soar, they don't do anything and aren't pleasant, remarkable or passionate.. etc and the list goes on. It's a big problem on the album and it fails to excite the listener. "The Chosen Ones" and "A World Without Heaven" are to me the best tracks on British Lion and they're side by side incidentally. Those are the songs that got me thinking "well this is interesting, maybe it's not so bad..." and after listening back found myself thinking that the rest of the album should have sounded a little more like that. Musically they go farther than the rest of album (except perhaps the closing piece "The Lesson" which could fit just below that category) and they're catchy and got me rocking and kept my hopes up for the rest of the album.  "Judas" is one of the better songs here it has a two minute slow breakdown piece and shows traces of prog and is overall a good song and one that I found myself listening to more often. "Eyes of the Young" is boring generic radio rock and doesn't go anywhere really, it's just a very plain song with no feel musically or otherwise I nominate that one the worst track on BL. "These Are The Hands" doesn't do it for me, it lacks in the chorus and as a result never arrives or get started.  "The Lesson" is not a ballad, but it's definitely a soft song and it features strings and piano and while I actually find myself enjoying it, it just seems out of place on this album as a closing piece especially (but then again it doesn't really fit between any two songs so where else to put it?).  I'm obviously a fan of Steve Harris for his bass playing and Iron Maiden, but I won't bow down to everything that he releases with or without Maiden. I don't think British Lion is close to be an outstanding album that's all. I think most of the problem is the vocals aren't quite up to par. They're not strong but they're not weak yet they hardly do anything even if they don't sound bad, which I realize may be an odd description but it's exactly what they sound like to me. There's very little energy in the songs too, as I said it sounds very blank at times music is playing but it's just... empty. Is it utterly unlistenable? No. There are even some good tracks like "The Chosen Ones" but the album and ultimately this whole project falls flat unfortunately and we're left with an album where not much stands out unfortunately. Again not dissing on anyone, they tried but it just doesn't seem to work. I wonder what Dickinson could have brought to some of those songs because some of the lyrics and themes that they had here had more potential than the final product shows.  To me British Lion was Harris doing a side project and not a solo album it was great for him that for the first time he did something besides Iron Maiden. It was a way for him to do stuff more akin to that of bands he idolized in the 1970's like Thin Lizzy and although it doesn't sound much like his influences it sounds more like 70's and particularly 80's rock than Heavy Metal (even the songs are considerably shorter than some of what Maiden has being doing with their last four albums. I don't hate British Lion, but I don't love it. The album could have benefited greatly from better production too. To me it's not totally a throwaway and it's not gold either but I'm definitely on the fence about this one and I will remember it as more of a novelty, an experiment, something outside of Maiden for Harris than a good, rock album. The main problem is the vocals aren't strong enough nor do they stand out to bring out the music and make it stand, in fact it's the opposite it brings it down. I'm sorry but I tried it's just not an album that's for me I'm afraid 2 1/2*.	-1
I will no longer purchase downloadable music from Amazon or its associated vendors. Even on a brand spanking new computer they won't download, or on the opposite end, download 3 or 5 times. If I can't count on getting what I want, what's the use in trying to purchase it here?	-1
It feels slightly weird reviewing a single song. Many times tracks make sense in the context of the entire album even if they do not work as a song. But as singles are now the prevelant form of digesting popular music these days, so it goes, I s'ppose. Anywho, "Oh Love", the first single from Green Day's upcoming album "!Uno!" (to be followed by "!Dos!" and "!Tre!" in a succession of a few months) is the audio equivilant of mediocrity. There is no compelling hook to bring you back and the lyrics seem to have been written in about two and a half minutes with zero thought put into them. And the production is colorless, giving the already bland rocker a lack of flavor or style that should make the song popular for about a week on the radio but zero lasting value. Following "21st Century Breakdown", a record that certainly didn't grow on me as the years passed, this is an even greater disappointment. I can't imagine anyone wanting to hear this song once or twice outside of a cursory listen to see what Green Day has been up to for the past few years. You'd be better off saving your money and buying a Buzzcocks single or something. Even at a low price this is pretty much a rip off.	-1
This song is atrocious and beyond boring as can be.  Green Day, what on earth are you thinking?  This is the worst direction imaginable that you could go.  You have become a sell out band, but please DO NOT make it official.  You are among the most popular non-sell-out bands around, I'd hate to see you claim the title of a sell out like Metallica did with Load.  Please Billie Jo, I am begging you as a long time fan, please, please go back to your earlier days or your American Idiot days.  Something, anything, just not this!!!	-1
I must say that I only liked a couple of the songs (and that's almost pushing it!). "Tears Of Joy", "Soon As I Get Home" (Live In LA) (which is an old 90's hit anyway) and "Jesus Loves" with Kelly Price are the main songs that I enjoyed. I guess the song for the show is OK but really? The rest of the material isn't what you would hear from any of these ladies (except possibly Monifah -- love her voice but I heard her first album too and some of her material is very middle of the road also). I like all of the singers here. Some of them are top of the crop R&B females. But the material is really drab. Very plain.  All in all I wouldn't recommend this collection as a whole to anyone. You can spend your 8 bucks on something else worthwhile like one of the artist's old albums or something. Seriously...  2 stars.	-1
This has to be the worst song of the year if it weren't for Call Me Maybe and Gangnam Style. Incredibly annoying and it keeps repeating itself over and over again. Pitbull is a complete joke in the music industry and that's saying a lot.	-1
The arrogance of young people, especially really young people always amazes me!  The tune is catchy but the lyrics are just a bunch of young guys mentally masturbating!  Buy REO Speedwagon for some good music that has lyrics that actually mean something.	-1
Even with the different instruments and style changing, this band still sounds exactly the same as they did in the beginning!  This is the main reason why this type of alternative music didn't last as most of the other bands in this same category have shown. It's a monotonousness sound, these 90's and 2000's alt bands good for a few albums and some hits but than everything from than on could be the same songs with different names! This genre of music has proven to be one of the disposable in music history!	-1
Alison Sudol, aka A Fine Frenzy, has always gone for lyrical depth with her music, but she takes it to another level on Pines.  I won't repeat what you can read here on the product page, but she lost me this time.  In part because the concept is a bit obtuse, but the music does little to support her narrative.  No, it further obfuscates the story with long instrumental interludes that are all over the place in style.  The first two songs place heavy emphasis on acoustic guitar and folk style to the extent that they sound more like they belong on Lisa Hannigan's (Note: There's nothing wrong with Lisa Hannigan.  However, if I want that sound, I'll queue up Lisa Hannigan instead.) first album than something from A Fine Frenzy.  It's not just the instrumentation on these songs, but it is also Sudol's vocal delivery.  It goes between whisper/spoken and grating falsetto with too much vibrato.  It's not until "Avalanches (Culla's Song)" that longtime fans will find something that sounds like what they are expecting.  The only other songs that resemble A Fine Frenzy's sound are "Sailingsong" and "Now Is The Start".  However, it would be inaccurate to say that this is all there is to Pines - but not necessarily in a good way.  If you fancy generic dance pop, then look no further than "It's Alive".  That is an ironic way to arrive at saying that Pines is the musical equivalent of Frankenstein's monster.  While it was intended to be high concept, it comes off as a collection of ill-fitting random parts.  If you want good music from A Fine Frenzy, grab One Cell in the Sea and Bomb in a Birdcage if you don't have them.  If you are curious about the folk songs, try Lisa Hannigan's See Sew.  But whatever you do, pass on Pines.	-1
I heard this song on the radio and in the movie Pain and Gain and it sounded so catchy and fun, I had to download it. After hearing it for the third time in my playlist, it always gets skipped because it is annoying. This is one of those songs you come across in a few years and wonder why you ever downloaded it in the first place. Sure, it gets its fair share of shouts when you play it at a party (now) but it will be like Sisco's Song Thong or Snow's Informer in a few years. Obsolete.	-1
Like the concept, don't like the song	-1
MACKLEMORE SUCKS!	-1
Being FORCED to listen to 101.1 Fox FM everyday at work by a manager who THINKS he is a DJ, and THINKS EVERYONE LOVES the top 40, I have to hear the same ten top 10 songs EVERY SINGLE DAY, and they are driving me insane at how horrible each and every one of them are. Man the top 40 is the biggest joke EVER. Especially when it comes to these top 40 playing stations, who avoid the good music that reaches the charts once in a blue moon, and just plays this sort of rubbish, just because they are all paid to.  This particular song here is not a song. I don't care what kind of message it is portraying, a million other songs out there have messages and meanings too, so don't even for one second try to tell me this is unique or special. Just about every other artist out there writes lyrics from the heart, and have a soulful meaning, so quit thinking this one here is the only song that has ever been written to do so. Did I say song? I meant, this guy talking his lyrics out. There is no melody, no soul, no fun, and definitely no talent. At least artists who do these kind of things in the past added a rhythm, or a beat to it to keep it from sounding like a E-book with background sounds. Beck didn't bore you to death like this when they spoke out the lyrics, and at least they added a melodic chorus and showed they where musicians, unlike this guy who if he read this so called "inspirational" poem out without the trickery that it is a song, he would be booed off stage for someone else to come on and wake the rest of the audience up.  The vocals are just irritating, but who knows, maybe I could stand this song had it not been preformed by these untalented artists. They knew the song was so damn boring and they can't add melody because they can't sing, so they got Mary Lambert to come in and throw down whatever POS she could come up with to disguise this spoke words as a song. Hat's off to her for not using an auto-tuner, otherwise I would slam her down too, who ever she is, but even her lyrics and actual melody in this horrible song is not enough to make it worthy of 1 star.	-1
Liked it; but now I'm kinda sick of hearing it.	-1
This is an amazing song with amazing originality and wonderful, upbeat music. However, I chose the 'explicit' version in error, and found it to have bad language. I would prefer the version that omits bad language, as the content of the 'explicit' destroys the song, in my opinion. I feel the same way about movies that repeat bad language over and over. It totally destroys the whole point of the movie. That's my story and I'm sticking to it.	-1
I would rather smoke a piece of horse dung in a vaporizer rather than sit through this mediocre bs. sounds like a katy perry ripoff song (and i think her music is dookier than a Portalet Port-a-potty at a construction site)	-1
This isn't a rating of how much I like the song... If you are looking for the full "You're A Mean One, Mr. Grinch" song from the cartoon, this isn't it.  That song is 2:59 in length. This 'song' is 5:15 long and isn't really a song.  It plays first couple verses of the song (about 1 min) and then plays 4 min. 15 seconds of dialog from the cartoon.  Thurl Ravenscroft is the original singer of the cartoon version of this song but it appears the full song is only available if you buy the whole soundtrack which is on a different album.  The link to that album is below.  <a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Youre-Mean-One-Mr-Grinch/dp/B000W0COL6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Youre Mean One Mr Grinch</a>	-1
After eight long years Dead Prez is back with their third studio album and I must say this was not worth the wait. The content is still there, but the execution on this album is terrible. It feels like they were forced to change their sound on this just to try and attract some attention from people who wouldn't normally listen to them.  Interludes aside, the first half of the album sounds like they used the same beat for every song only slightly altering the tempo. That wouldn't be a problem if the production was dope, but it's not. It sounds like some Justin Bieber/Flo Rida/Lady Gaga music. The first half of the album is literally Dead Prez rapping about normal Dead Prez topics, but they're doing it over dance music. Why? What were they trying to accomplish by doing that?  The second half of the album provides a little more diversity sonically, but it still isn't anything spectacular. What baffles me is that the two best beats on here are used for the two "GHN" interludes. When I heard the first one come on I got all excited because it actually sounded like a Dead Prez beat, but neither of these gentlemen capitalized on the opportunity.  The production isn't the only issue I have with this album. Both stic.man and M-1 sound dead on this. They lack any genuine energy and they both feel very uncomfortable on these songs. Plus, there's times where it seems like they're just trying to throw as many rhymes together as possible, regardless of whether it makes sense or not.  Standout Songs: "Learning Growing Changing" & "Download (Expand Beyond)"  Overall Score: 4/10 - The moment I heard "A New Beginning" back in September I knew there was no hope for this album. I read someone say that if you don't like this then you're close minded, that's kind of ignorant. It's called an opinion. Dead Prez have set standards for themselves and this didn't live up to them. Hopefully we can hear them return to their Hip Hop roots on their fourth album.	-1
like most of the songs i download i heard it on a commercial on tv and thought it was good after downloading it the song got on my nerves could have used my dollar on something much better!	-1
Based on the reviews, I bought this album with high hopes of having another good Christmas album.  I should have known better.  What I got is a supposed "Christmas" album that really has nothing to do with Christmas other than the lyrics and the traditions of the song.  This sounds like a competent garage band just messing around with arrangements, but not really doing anything new, different, or exciting to any of the songs.  Musically, this sounds like just another Contemporary Christian album, but not a Christmas album.  In many ways, it sounds like the CCM response to Trans-Siberian Orchestra, but with much less of a Christmas feel to it.  While TSO maintained the reverence and ambience of the season, this set degrades far too often into a "look what I can do with my guitar" feel, the kind of adolescent muscle-flexing that turns out to be more annoying than gratifying.  And while TSO uses various vocalists to complement their guitar-driven pieces, Lincoln's voice grows thin by the third song--there are hardly even any strong backing vocals to complement him.  While others seem to think that "Miraculum" is a high point, it's by far the most TSO-influenced track here, and by far the least successful--it's more annoying than anything with the guitars that seem to be played more to impress than express.  All in all, there's so much good Christmas music out there that this one will never be played again in our house, I'm sure.  There's nothing that reminds me of Christmas at all, nothing that puts me in the holiday spirit.  Give me the Matthew West or the Casting Crowns or the Sarah McLachlan or the TSO (except the third) or the Amy Grant (also except the third) Christmas albums any day--they capture the spirit of the season.	-1
I did not care for this version at all.....very "boppy"...dancing type of version. It absolutely ruins the feel of the song. :-(	-1
Free download..  kinda blah, but can't resist free...  lol	-1
OK	-1
Didn't care for the lyrics	-1
Don't think much of Bruno Mars think	-1
This song has a nice beat to it but when I listen to the words that are sung, it becomes sexual. I am not a fan of songs that influence the minds of any sexual behavior.	-1
I hate Adele, but it's for my wife. Skyfall is by far her best song because she didn't write it and it actually has a melody. Her own stuff is like torture.  Yes, I know everyone else feels opposite of me... haha	-1
Yeah,  yeah.  Boring.	-1
Confession - I sort of bought this by mistake. Was hoping it would turn out to be a good mistake but I was mistaken. Not her best.	-1
Adele has a very strong voice. She's an incredible talent but this song doesn't have a distinctive sound and it sounds Like every other Adele song	-1
lyrics are a total ripoff of the Beatles Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds. Pure pop pablum-more disposable poopy by rihanna	-1
When it has came down to Rihanna in music, she has honestly been sadly looked more like a product than a real singer. Not only that, but the quality of her songs have easily made her just as poor as the overexposed Beyonce' and sadly her voice has withered in the process. Her latest record Unapologetic has shown some absolutely poor songs like the weak, Stay. But the song that also started the tracks for Unapologetic, Diamonds, is absolutely not one of her better songs either. She definitely doesn't deliver in voice and heart. I really found this to be one of her weaker ballads, just as much as Unfaithful was on A Girl Like Me. The song has been so overplayed, her voice has died. She might be a diamond in the rough, but Rihanna has lost her own voice into glass. Perhaps she should find better in her own heart than a diamond.  Song: D	-1
This is the first and only Rihanna song I have ever purchased.  I'm pretty sure it will be my last.	-1
I can't express how much I absolutely hate this song and beleive it should be a contender for the #1 most irritating song of 2012. Most people would just say, "Don't listen to it" and I wish I could, but being stuck in retail all day, the managers have the radio going all day, stuck on 101.9 Fox FM or Nova 100. These two radio stations are your typical morons who spin the same 5 songs on repeat ALL DAY. It drives me nuts.  The first time I heard this song it gave me a headache at how bad I thought it was, it sounded like a stupid child whining the chorus out. Everyday I have worked since then, this damn song come on every hour, and it has brought me to my knees begging the managers to please change the damn radio station so none of us have to hear this god awful p.o.s again. Today when begging the manager, he was extremely busy on the phones and said it's the least of his worries right now, so I had to hear this garbage 6 times in an 8 hour shift. Thank god I missed the first hours one and the one they probably played during my lunch break, but I was cursed into hearing it again 3 times after that, it became so bad I wished we sold guns so I could shoot myself. However, we do sell fishing harpoon guns, and I was tempted 3 times to grab the damn thing and harpoon it through my head having to be forced to listen to this overrated, overplayed, sung by a no good, no talent artist who fans say "she writes from the heart"... OH, FOR F SAKES, SHUT UP ALREADY!!! so does every other friggen artist on the planet.   What makes her so special? That she wrote it into an annoying tune and called it music? BAN THIS SONG FROM EVERY BEING PLAYED ON RADIO EVER AGAIN, SOMEONE, PLEASE! Everyone who comes into the store agree that they can't stand this song, it's like child's music where anyone who doesn't understand what real music is, and most likely thinks adding a beat to a cross walk signal is the greatest songs ever written. Gimmie a break, this song is HORRIBLE, if you can even call it a song.	-1
When it has came down to Rihanna, she honestly has been the most overexposed artist of the past several years, where her voice has lost its luster, and she really hasn't stopped for herself. Musically, she has also wasted her spirit as well in her songs. Her latest song, Diamonds feels very choppy and her voice sounds a bit too course. I really did not find the song to deliver, as some of her earlier songs had. I really didn't find it to drive into the soul of the voice. I definitely think Rihanna needs to take more time into her songs, and not rush into making album after album, year after year. It really has put a strain on her talent. Talk That Talk was awful, and Unapologetic is the same way.  Song: D-	-1
I just downloaded this and it is not the same song. It is a tribute by a band called "The Dream Team". Amazon has it labeled wrong.	-1
This is not my type of music to begin with and I got it because its free. ZZ Wards voice isn't too bad, but it could be better used in other contexts such as the blues.	-1
its alright for what it was back in the time that it was recorded but skips a little yup it	-1
This is too busy, not true Country and disappointing.  Just another wanna be artist trying to meet Nashiville's misguided expectations.	-1
Sorry, Brian Tichy.  You should have stuck with Whitesnake.	-1
Meek Mill, is also known as the rising prince of Rick Ross's Maybach Music Group reigning from Philidelphia. Philidelphia is home to some of Hip Hop's legends such as Will Smith, Eve and of course The Roots. Meek Mill is considered the new generation of Hip Hop and to be perfectly honest, he's not doing anything to help it. Meek Mill is known for his brash and in your face personality but thats because he practically yells and shouts in just about every damn track on this album. Now before I start to offend all Meek Mill fans all around, I will admit that the dude is a very aggressive spitter which I can appreciate because I don't think a person can fall asleep while Meek Mill's voice is playing; and he does surprisingly have rhymes scattered throughout the album, but at the end of the day there is nothing substantial here. All that I got from Meek Mill throughout the album is how unnecessarily braggadocios he is as a person. Every track is about rags to riches, getting women, and how much better (he thinks) he is compared to your favorite rapper to an extent. This kind of theme has been done a hundred times over and I am really sick and tired of it, there is nothing inspiring about this guy whatsoever. What he lacks that is important for any rapper is storytelling, and the poor excusese for storylines that are hidden within the album are dry. The sad thing is that Meek Mill trys to tie in his more conceptual tracks, but they just fail to connect.  The beats on this album are no different than what was on Rick Ross's album or his latest MMG compilation that came out not too long ago. The beats literally sounded like one guy produced the entire project, which is sad because when I saw the production credits, every track was produced by a different person, which is preposterous because just about every song had the same bass line and drum samples that Lex Luger would've done (ironically Lex Luger didn't produce anything on this album). "Believe It" feat. Rick Ross is literaly the same beat from BMF (Blowin Money Fast), The first 2 tracks are way too similar in lyrics and beat to even count as 2 different songs and like I said earlier Meek Mill sticks with the same generic flow in every song; his volume, his tone, his range rarely ever changes whether it be a slow or mid-tempo song, and I'm just listening being appalled of how repetitive it is.  If I looked at the lyrics for a Meek Mill song online, than I would expect the lyrics to be in ALL CAPITAL LETTERS and EXLAMATION POINTS for all his verses because thats what I feel I am listening to when Meek Mill raps  By the time I'm finished with track 3, I just comepletely clock out and start skipping tracks quickly until the mood starts to shift into the slower songs like "Amen" feat Drake. When you compare Hip Hop albums by the end of the year with other artists, you will quickly realize that this album is mediocre at best and lacks originality or even a genuwine personality. I haven't heard an album thats this shallow in quite some time. The amazing thing is I was really trying to listen to the album and find songs where Meek Mill raps more introspectively so at least I can get a grasp of what kind of person he was growing up, but ultimately I just found that this guy is 100% boring as a person. The impression I got from Meek Mill is that he is rapping solely for money, not to inspire any of his listeners, not to put out any positive messages, but just putting on a front of being a tough guy or a ladies man 24/7. The only reason why I didn't give this album 1 star is because some of the beats (although extremely similar) do occasionally entertain me when I am driving blasting my speakers. I will never pay any mind to any of Meek Mill's albums again and I know that after a 2 weeks this album will undoubtedly be forgotten. If you want a project from the new generation of Hip Hop that has good storytelling, contains substance, and sounds cohesive? Than check out Kendrick Lamar's "good kid, m. A.A.d city" album or Ab-Soul's "Control System" which are easy contenders for Rap albums of the year.	-1
OK	-1
See above review.  Another trite ablum of Christmas music that I am forced to play each Holiday season.  What else can I say.	-1
Glad it was free. I would not have paid for this. He was better at pop songs rather then Christmas songs.	-1
I was searching for some more christmas music to add to my collection each year I want somethjng to play other than our Chipmunks christmas and Soulful Christmas albums. So this works. Thanks for the free music, free is always good, so no complaints.	-1
Bought it fore my wife ... not my generation of music!!!	-1
Predictable, overproduced, generic, boring and made for the express purpose of getting played on boring-a$$ country pop radio. the aural equivalent of walking into a very small booth where somebody just defecated on the floor. I won't give it one star cos at least Taylor writes her own songs, which is more than I can say for the average pop act getting radio air play.	-1
Not Taylor's best work; I only bought it because it was cheap, and I wish I hadn't.  Not a song on it I really like.	-1
Excerpt taken from "New Business Science Times":  "It has been a long and hard journey for the fledgling sound systems corporation, Weyland Sonics. Industry insiders were shocked by the fatalities and property damage created by their first offering "Taylor 1.2". Most considered this line as a complete write-off.    The cost of repairing Houston's infrastructure alone was enough to make most corporations file for bankruptcy. Undaunted, the new CEO of W.S., Charles Bleaufeldt, revamped their entire Research division. "Youth, Youth, Youth!" was the mantra for the new CEO. "We need sounds younger than Juice Newton, more strident than Ga-Ga 2.0 and lets keep the bio-covering as flat as possible!"    His staff did complain and many resigned. One researcher, a Mr. Arno Stark, left to create his own tech company. Mr Stark told me: "Horrible, just horrible! By the time I left, I was drinking every day. The sound that thing made! There is no ear protection made that can save you. Three techs were made permanently deaf! There is no controlling this thing!"    Earlier this year, Mr. Bleaufeldt did unveil his new creation at the Branson Sound Technologies Expo. He decided to change the name, from "Taylor 3.4.5.2" to the more appealing "Taylor RED". Industry leaders were shocked by its ultra-thin bio-covering but were amazed by its speech emulation capacity. Here is a sample: 'Hi, I'm Taylor. I love the number 13. *whirrrrr-click-click-click*  I like imagining what life was like hundreds of years ago. *whirrrrr-click-click-click* I have blurry eyesight. I'm easily excited, thrilled, scared, and shocked. *whirrrrr-click-click-click* I live in Nashville, *whirrrrr-click-click-click*'    Simply amazing! During Taylor-Red's debut it proved its effectiveness as a sonic weapon by disintegrating a 5 ton block of granite from 20 feet away. Needless to say, the military was very impressed and rumors abound about the many orders they are placing. Bleaufeldt is now considering building a miniature version of Taylor-Red for the European market."	-1
True country music fans will see RED but not this type of red.  This is a perfect example of why there is almost no country music anymore.  It's also a good example of why this marketing approach has contributed to the progession of digital format so fans can get the one good song (if they can find even one) and ditch the rest of the album.  Real country music is hanging on by a thread, and about all that's keeping it alive is Dwight Yoakam standing by the side of the road holding a sign that says, "Anywhere But Nashville".	-1
as  i  listen  to  taylor  Swift  she  reminds  me  of a  broke  Juice  Newton  an artist  who  had  one  cute  major  hit  and  then  was forever  in the 3rd and 4th tier territory  as a  artist  and  this  is  how  i feel  about  Swift,  though  i  give  her  credit for  keeping product  out and  her  name.  however  she  pulled a  Jewel  in putting out  a  pop  album  while  she  was well established  with a  sound.  Jewel  made a  forgettable  pop  album  and  so  has  Swift.  songwriting is  weak  and  the  production  and  songs do  nothing  for  her  voice. she  is already  overrated  to  me  and  this  album  keeps  that  sentiment  in full  effect.	-1
There are some artists I just don't get - this is certainly one of them. I don't recommend this at all.	-1
I was searching for some more christmas music to add to my collection each year I want somethjng to play other than our Chipmunks christmas and Soulful Christmas albums. So this works. Thanks for the free music, free is always good, so no complaints.	-1
I absolutely hated this song and I deleted it after listening to it once!! I wouldn't recommend it to anyone 8o(	-1
Ease down & have a taste of the soothing sound of music,sometimes slow is better,enjoy the sweet mood your in.	-1
I've listened to all three tracks in their entirety.  They are worse than disappointing.  These are entirely instrumental versions, no vocals.  But the only "instrument" seems to be a synthesizer, using various [artificial] sounds that sometimes sound like some sort of flute/whistle, and sometimes very slightly like a harp.  Everything is buried in a very deep layer of electronic reverb, entirely unnatural.  Even that is badly done:  in each given medley, when one song ends, the reverb fades out abruptly, instead of dying out "naturally," before the next song starts.  Finally, the "performance" -- if you can call it that -- is very mechanical, with little or no expression.  There's no variation in tempo or in volume.  Me-cha-ni-cal.  Ro-bo-tic.  I have no idea why this is called "Celtic."  It's just cheap synthesizer music, period.  I guess this might be acceptable in an elevator, where you listen for less than a minute before getting out.  But I certainly wouldn't want to sit down and listen to this stuff intentionally.  At least it's not punk or rap.  So in the spirit of Christmas I'll give it two stars instead of one.  If you are expecting real music (played by humans on real instruments), or something that is really Celtic, then skip this collection.  Doesn't Amazon preview this stuff before they unleash it on the public?	-1
Again with the Christmas music.  Please know I did NOT order this.  Please reverse.  I will not pay for items I do not want.	-1
I do not like this singer	-1
I loved his EP , but this is too much country sounding.	-1
Aaron Lewis is a phony! Plain and simple! He tries to fool all of us country music fans with his false redneck image,when the truth is,this guy is not even from the south. Wasn't even born down there. Lewis wouldn't know what REAL country music was if it bit him in the a**. If you wanna listen to a REAL Country music CD,then get one of Hank III's albums. Hank III tells the truth and exposes country-wanna be's like Lewis and Kid Rock in his music.	-1
I love this song , but not a fan of this singing style, or this guy's voice.	-1
Not worth the price: this digital download was free!	-1
I've been following Chris since his first album with Passion (1997 or so). I have loved him since then and have seen him live a number of times - about once a year since then! But dare I say that I don't like this album by Chris? I ran out to buy it at Target on its release date but just couldn't love it. It's too much "more of the same." It seems like Ed Cash insists on keeping all Chris's songs structured the same - an 8 measure intro, an 8 measure verse, an  8 measure chorus, a 4 measure verse or the first half of the first verse, the chorus, a bridge, repeat chorus, end. The drums, bass and guitars are dull and unimaginative as well.  I LOVED "Awake My Soul" with Lecrae and that's the only song that made my iPod from the album. Download this song. It's one of the only songs worth owning.  "Whom Shall I Fear" is just boring. Four on the floor throughout it, boring music. Yawn.  "Lay Me Down" is lyrically weak, some phrases making no sense. "Hand on my heart, this much is true, there's no life apart from you" is a perfect example of that. It's another 4 on the floor song that sounds like a knock off of the sound on Mumford and Sons song "I Will Wait." You can lay this song's lyrics right over that song's music.  "God's Great Dance Floor" is an OK song. I do like the mariachi trumpet but the 4 on the floor beat gets monotonous. I also don't like the build going into the bridge. It sounds messy and chaotic.  "White Flag" is a down tempo anthem type song. While I like most of the lyrics, the music is suspiciously similar to Jesus Messiah from his 2008 album. Another 4 on the floor song with a snare cadence.  "Crown Him" is likable. Chris enjoys taking hymns and adding a new chorus or bridge. It breathes fresh life into an old song. This is a good one to download too.  "Jesus Son of God" is another 4 on the floor slow ballad type of song.  "Sovereign" is the only song I love on the album besides "Awake."  "Countless Wonders" recycles phrases and lyrics from earlier songs on his first albums.  "Thank you for saving me" is yet another 4 on the floor song with cliche's throughout.  Basically if you like every song where the kick drum is playing on every beat (called 4 on the floor), then this is your album. Personally when all 12 songs are like that, I get bored with it. It pains me to say this is Tomlin's weakest album but it is.	-1
after i got it i really didn't like it . the preview didn't play enough of the song to make a good decition	-1
on  the  for real, for  real it seems like Prince musically got kidnapped musically after the late 80's and lost what once made him a force back in the day. this song is boring and bland. vocally he sounds tired and lyrically while that was never one of his strengths,this is song's lyrical content is about as deep as a Jerry Springer final  thought.  this song is a 3rd tier reject of stuff he did it seemed in his sleep back in the 80's. the remix to this is better but then again it ain't saying much. good thing i saw this cat in his prime and peak back in the 80's or he might be seen and heard as one of the 10 most overrated acts ever. because to me from the studio side of things, its been about 25 years since he made anything that even sorta moved me.	-1
I first heard the song "Rock and Roll Love Affair" when Prince performed it on Jimmy Kimmel Live. I hated it. How could THIS be the new Prince single? That's what I remembered thinking. Then again, I wasn't terribly surprised given the wildly uneven quality of Prince's release over the last decade or so.  Hearing the original single mix (or the original extended mix, whatever - it's track one here), the tune grew on me a bit. It's just a harmless little pop rocker. It has an oddly "clean" sound - reminds me a lot of "The One U Wanna C" from Planet Earth (though not as fun).  The remixes though are kind of a waste of time. For the price of the maxi-single download, I say might as well. You're not saving much money by just getting the Original Extended Mix. The Original Radio Edit is okay too, but I stick with the longer version if I'm going to listen to it. The Jamie Lewis mixes try to turn this into some kind of a club banger, but the mild pop production of the original song doesn't lend itself well to this approach.	-1
I grew up with Prince and adore 1980-88. this has nothing to do with that.this is embarrassing. honestly,since Lovesexy it's gotten worse and worse,and now this? an all time low just when I thought it couldn't get any worse(20ten). religion cut Prince's balls and this blood less,sugary nothingness is left. I almost feel personally betrayed by Prince. sorry for the rant,I have noone that really understand my disappointment in my childhood hero. gonna put on Dirty MInd again,then Around the world in a day.masterpieces. we need remasters!!! thank you.	-1
I liked the movie... Always Alright is Alabama Shakes best song. It is a shame that the greedy corporate suits feel the need to hold this song hostage. The only way you can get it is to buy the entire movie soundtrack. :-(	-1
Which is great if you like classic music. If not, you won't find much here. I'd really expected to here the classics i grew up on, but didn't like much of this.	-1
The good ones just took too long to sift through. If you are looking for a nice X-mas or holiday box I suggest elsewhere	-1
For the few songs ypu are going to recognize there are over a hundred that are not known.  Too much junk for just the couple that I was looking for.  Mostly just music not actual Christmas songs :(	-1
You look at it thinking....wow...what a lot of songs for so little, even if seasonal, still.  But after about 12 the one's I'd rather not of had, it stopped.  I contacted the technicians at Amazon and after two people and many tries I gave up.  So...I've still not gotten to ever get them.  Not a bargain after all.	-1
I have been forced to hear this travesty a number of times, so I definitely think that qualifies me for a review.  Seriously, this guy not only has to have a guest appearance from a talent like Christina Aguilera, but also has to rip off the main melody of an 80s classic like A-Ha's "Take On Me" in order to make a hit? This just proves how little of Pitbull is actually in this track (not song), and just how unoriginal and unimaginative today's top hits can be.  What further disturbs me is that people can actually admit that a track like this copies the melody of an earlier (and far superior quality) song, and yet they say things like, "yeah, but it gets the club hoppin!"  ***FACEPALM***  Seriously, since when does being able to "get down" have to be the only thing that matters? I guess some people are too brainwashed to even care. Sad sad sad.	-1
Would not purchase this album again. With the exception of "Girl on Fire", the remaining tracks are o.k. but not exciting. Should have purchased the single download!	-1
Downloaded  by mistake. I really don't  care for it.  I meant Girl on Fire. I need to pay more attention	-1
When it has came down to Rihanna, musically she has one of the worst ego's in voice and absolute heart. She definitely thinks she can sing, but honestly to soul she sounds like a neurotic robot in rap. Pour It Up, the latest song from Rihanna's Unapolgetic record is definitely that proof in the song. She really didn't deliver a very strong song. AT times, she felt more like she was tired and not enticing. She wanted to try and be a hard core rapper as was the case with Lil' Kim and Beyonce', but instead she ruined her voice. I really do think Rihanna needs to take more time making music, and not rushing herself out there like she is a product. Hopefully, well not really then she will pour it up.  Song: D+	-1
I didn't like this song, it is worth buying and spending the money on.  Instrumentals and the vocals are poor.  Bad lyrics, says the same thing over and over and seems like a MAN should have did this song.. "strip clubs and dollar bills?".	-1
When it has came down to the songs from Rihanna's latest album Unapologetic, they honestly are the absolute low points in her life and her career. When I heard she even went back to the man who abused her before the Grammys, Chris Brown dating again, I must honestly say she has made a absolute low in her life. That has also shown in her music as well. Pour It Up, the second single from her Unapologetic album is absolutely one of the most mediocre songs she has ever made. It really didn't drive her voice, instead it just was a attempt to drive into her vice. I really found this to be worse than mostly all of the ballads she had done, with the exception of Hate That I Love You. Her rifts seemed soft, but not striking here. In fact, it made more like the purr of a cat, than a growl from a tigress. She really needs a hard look at her voice, before she makes another poor song.  Song: D-	-1
When it has came down to Rihanna, she has clearly shown that she has made some very poor choices with her life. Not just with her music, but going back to the man who physically abused her right before the Grammys in 2009, Chris Brown, has made her even worse as a person, and a singer as well. Her latest song, Pour It Up, the second single from her lackluster Unaplogetic record, feels less than strong, and feels like it is a waste on the ears. I found it to be tiring, and shows a lack of real heart from her voice. I really found it to poor and more irritating than her last single Diamonds. I think Rihanna should take a break from her music, and find herself all over again, before she makes a new song.  Song: D	-1
I bought it to use as a ring tone. That is one way to make you actually hate a song. This one seems to just drag on. After about 45 seconds you want to kill yourself.	-1
When it has honestly came down to Rihanna, she musically has been one the worst singers to have ever came out the past decade. When I heard she had went back to the man who physically abused her before the Grammy Awards, Chris Brown, I think she made herself a much easier target of abuse and unhappiness. That sadly has also had hurt her in her music as well with poor songs as well. That continues to show her weakness with Stay from her Unapologetic album. She has lost herself in her voice, and weakness in her strength. I found the song to be not as striking as her earlier songs were. I think Rihanna should take a very long break, and find herself as a woman, which she has not even grown herself in being yet.  Song: D+	-1
Rihanna is really 'hit or miss' with her songs.  She either makes songs that are very catchy (in a good way), like "Umbrella" or she makes some unlistenable dreck like "Cheers (Drink to that)".  She seldom has songs you would be ambivalent about.  However, "Stay" (with Mikky Ekko) is just such a song.    "Stay" is meant to be an emotional ballad of loving and longing, but it's turgid music and Rihanna's whiny vocals (a problem she has in to many of her songs), don't make this a particularly enjoyable song.	-1
Deleted from my files.	-1
A freebie from our friends at Amazon.  I always enjoy a good freebie, it is a great way to try things.	-1
I don't care if it is free-I don't want Christmas music in March.  Please reverse this order!  I am frustrated!	-1
Love the artists presentation.  Very relaxing to sit and listen or hum too.  Would listen to all winter if possible.	-1
I liked it beacuse it was christmas cd but I didn't like it becuse it hade less tracks unstead of a full cd for free.	-1
I'll probably go to Country Hell for buying this album, but my wife really like this bland crap.  Seriously, what happened to "real" Country?  I grew up on classic 50s Country and actually like lots of modern Country, but this is so bland as to be pre-packaged elevator music.  Mindless drinking songs have been done to death in this genre, don't you think?	-1
Before I get into the critical aspects of this album, let me say this: this is NOT country music.  This is rock music.  There is NOTHING on this CD that is in any way connected to country music.  Calling this country music shows a lack of both knowledge of and respect for country music and its rich history.  Like a lot of music that is put out and marketed as "country" (I'm looking at you Taylor Swift), this is what I like to call turkey bacon.  I'm sure everyone's had turkey bacon.  It's turkey flavored, cut, and cooked like bacon.  And turkey is great! I love turkey.  But cutting it and cooking it differently doesn't change the fact that it is turkey, not bacon.  Bacon is pork.  And this album is rock...not country.  The marketers and industry executives have tried to tell people differently, but there are those of us who love and respect country music enough not to fall for it.  None of this is to say rock is a bad thing.  Just like turkey, I like rock music.  Country is my favorite, but there's a lot of good rock music out there.  But FGL isn't even good rock music.  By all accounts, it's just terrible music altogether.  It's boring, unoriginal, unimaginative.  Honestly, take a good hard listen to the lyrics of "Cruise." And "Get Your Shine On"?  Honestly?  This is the best this group has to offer.  It's things like this that have basically made listening to country radio unbearable.  While these two are busy making hits by singing about nothing, a duo that actually makes quality music (Halfway to Hazard) falls by the wayside.  I bet most FGL fans have never even heard of Jason Isbell.  This album is just more mass-produced garbage.  And the public eats it up and turns it into hits, guaranteeing that these two guys aren't going away anytime soon.  George Jones must be rolling over in his grave.	-1
Downloaded just fine.  Not sure what else to say about an mp3 purchase other than I didn't like the song and it works just fine.	-1
You can add this track to the list of songs that sits around on my harddrive and never gets listened to. Wait, maybe I actually deleted it... Someday I'll learn to be more careful around free samples.	-1
I purchased this to listen too. Not all the songs are my favorite but I just got it for the heck of it. I seen him on television and wanted to hear more of his music.	-1
This is one of those songs that make you wonder if you like it or not, it grows on you, and you learn to like it, but your not sure why. I would say that the sound is like a mix of folk music meets modern on a good day. Try it	-1
Everything great thanks much	-1
PRODUCTION: 4/8 LYRICS: 4/8 CONTENT: 4/8 ENJOYMENT: 4/8  O.N.I.F.C. is a boring album with a repetitive sound and irrelevant content, Wiz Khalifa does nothing to heighten the enjoyment as his flow and delivery is lazy and uninteresting.  The production consists of a laid back and chill vibe with a slow bpm.  The sound is very cohesive and it transitions well but the tracks come off repetitive and not attention grabbing; only the Neptune's track catches the ear.  Wiz Khalifa delivers a decent but rather lazy performance, literally talking about that same ol' jazz: marijuana, money, lavish living.  There is a little bit of meaning but that is essentially muffled by the excessive irrelevance.  Boring and uninteresting.	-1
Wiz Khalifa's latest album is nothing more than a huge dissapointment. With NUMEROUS pushbacks in the late 2012 you would think it was to make the product much better. But that didn't seem to be the case here. It's not anything but the lyrics that seems to be the problem here. If you wanna know how much money Wiz has and how much weed he smokes, just listen to this album. He makes more than an obvious point here in about 90% of the songs. I called&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Rolling-Papers-Explicit/dp/B004TP6O8O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Rolling Papers [Explicit</a>] a dissapointment because of the obvious attempts at mainstream pop status, but still a worthwile listen. His colab with Snoop Dogg on&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Mac-Devin-Go-to-High-School/dp/B005PV1THC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Mac & Devin Go to High School</a>&nbsp;was a slight step in the right direction. O.N.I.F.C. (Only N**** In First Class/One Night In First Class) is the worst of all. And one would expect this to be good after the mixtape Taylor Allerdice, which was good as well.  Production heren is good. You can tell that Wiz picked the beats that have the nice long vibing sounds, which is heard all over this album. The best songs on here are the ones he colabs with other artists. "Let It Go" has Akon singing the chorus around Wiz' braggadocious lyrics. "The Bluff" has Cam'ron spitting a good verse. Even 2 Chainz sounds refreshing on "Its Nothin". And his Taylor Gang crew members sound better than him on "The Plan" and "Medicated". The single "Remember You" with The Weeknd sounds good, but having Abel lead off the song and sing the chorus and has Wiz rhyme about something totally different makes the song almost a waste. There are a small number of solo songs that Wiz has that he can hold his own, but don't expect much from those.  O.N.I.F.C. had the potential to be a good album. I for one is very dissapointed after all the pushbacks and delays, this is the best we as fans can get. I think I am done with buying Wiz Khalifa's materal, unless its Taylor Gang or any colaboration albums (*hint, hint* "How Fly 2"). Anything else will be downloaded. Peace	-1

Initation 5. It's Nothin other songs like paperbond, work hard play hard, and the track featuring akon are the worst	-1
Downloaded just fine.  Not sure what else to say about an mp3 purchase other than I didn't like the song and it works just fine.	-1
purchased the 3 album set, didn't even bother opening this one, the other 2 were not good	-1
This album sounds like Greenday running out of ideas and just decided to throw their leftover songs from the first two albums of the trilogy onto a third disc.  Not impressed at all.  Guitars are too mellow sounding, weak distortion, and not one Song I can say is memorable.	-1
