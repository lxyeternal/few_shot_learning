This is an extreemly powerful chemical....unfortunately it killed all 6 of my small koi in a 20 gallon aquarium. I probably used too much....be careful to use EXACTLY as directed if you have fish. The quote " Will not harm aquatic pond plants, koi or goldfish" is on the front of the label. This is a dangerous statement.	-1
This is very effective but also not good for fish despite what the bottle label may claim. They should also have warnings for exact doses or else you risk losing fishes. There is a lot of discussion surrounding this product and one should read up on it before using.  Here is a good source:  [...]	-1
Soaking up the debris - as promised - works very well to clean pond water - nice and clear now	1
Didn't really notice they did anything, the powder did work though.	-1
Kept the majority of the algae out of my pond all summer.	1
Helps alot to clean up and keep clean our small fountain pool that has water plants.	1

I have used this product in the past and it works well at removing suspended algae as well as string algae from my pond.  Takes a few days to see results, but the product doesn't seem to bother my snails (about 50 very small trapdoor snails and 3 large apple snails).  This same product cost me nearly $20 in a retail store for the 16 oz bottle.  Doing the math, it would cost me $160.00 for a gallon's worth of Algaefix. During the summer, it's likely that I'll need to treat my pond weekly to prevent subsequent blooms, so this would cost me an arm and a leg in a retail store.  I paid 25% of that price here on Amazon.  Price was excellent and shipping was extremely fast.	1
Nice product...	1
The first two I bought, one floated and the other sunk. I hope that the sunken one still is effective.	1
To be honest, I never thought these would actually work.  We have a small water feature in our backyard that was constantly full of algae and we didn't want to use chemicals since we had fish in there.  I threw one of these bales in and after only a few days the water started to clear up and after a week or two it was completely clear again.  You have to keep an eye on the bales though because they don't work if they get fully submerged.  Once submerged you can just dry them out and throw them back in and they seem to do the job still.  We'll be getting more of these next summer.	1
good	1
Did not work in my pond	-1
I use these in the warmer months and replace them monthly. I've never had an algae problem and think that the barley bales contribute to that. I don't use chemicals in my pond so the barley bales are a great natural cleaner.	1
does what it is supposed to do	1
Got these last year for my 850 gal outdoor fish pond.  Placed in a bio-filter with circulating water they did a good job at keeping the "string algae" at bay.  I can't say the same for the snails and fish which let the algae get out of control in the first place.	1
Good stuff to use in the spring when the ponds start warming up, but you don't have any lilies up yet for shade	1
Had some heavy string algae in our waterfall/pond in spite of a cold winter.  Three applications seem to have cleared it up, so will now go on a maintenance program as recommended.  A year and a half later...still using 2+ oz. per week and have no problem with the algae.	1
Great addition to the pond every year.	1
Fundamentally, this just didn't work to reduce or control algae.	-1
The barley straw bales really do work. I'm always fearful of adding the harsh chemicals to my pond both for the fish and the plants. It takes a while but definitely makes a difference. Also clears up "green water". Only draw back, raccoons seem to love them too.	1
Not Working	-1
Natural is always better!	1
Somehow my pond water have no algae build up, now is 6 months since I drop this bale straw  in my 400g fish pond.	1
Worked very well in fountain.  Will keep second one for next year and warm weather.	1
I seen no difference in my pond water	-1
I'm still shocked this works. I have a large fountain in the front of the house that would turn green in 2-3 days. Been a few months now with this in it... water is crystal clear, if you don't look at the bird feathers & other birdy funk. :-)	1
I put these in two different outdoor fountains but both sank underwater after a few days.  As I understand it, they need to float on the surface to work properly.  I saw no benefit from using them after a couple of months.	-1
These do a great job in my water pond - totally prevents algae.	1
I got these for our pond, but I don't think they didn't do anything, other than float there.  Did not provide any type of clearing and eventually became slimy and covered in algae themselves while not helping with pond issues.	-1
Works great follow instructions. Came well packaged.  I recommend this item	1
Works as advertised	1
It worked very well getting rid of the algae in our pond.  I would use it again.	1
I have to admit... these little bales of barley straw have worked like a charm. My little fish pond holds about 500 gals and the string algae had always been a hassle. I dropped one of these little bales into my filter box in early spring and haven't had even one algae bloom this summer. The water stays crystal clear and the pond has never looked so good without use of chemicals. I would definitely vouch for this product.	1
They are working in a 2000 gallon pond that was full of  string algae and now is not. I use a UV filter for the overall algae but it couldn't kill the string algae and these work well on controlling that problem. I will keep these in stock to replace as needed as the sun in the Arizona desert grows algae in just a few hours. This is a great price too. They came fast and the package was in good shape. I will keep purchasing these in the future. I put more in in the bright summer light and less in the winter with a less harsh sunlight.	1
Fast delivery item as described	1
Have in pond and seems to be working, good deal.	1
New 2800 gallon pond, two fresh bales. GREEN Water every where. These are failures. Used as instructed. Don't waste your money.	-1
ok	1
I attach these to the top of my filter in each of my ponds and within a few weeks the ponds are crystal clear.	1
Arrived in good order. Well packed, easy to use. Tied them to one of our plastic ducks that are weighted to stay in place-so the pond skimmer doesn't draw them into its maw. We did find that we have aggressive little creatures that like the little bales. The plastic duck was pulled out of the pond, the bales pulled off the edge and ripped open. So, we don't really have experience with the efficacy of the bales, other than their ability to attract perhaps a raccoon.	1
Did not work at all. As a matter of fact it created a lot of string algae all over the top of the pond.	-1
works great	1
average	1
I have had it in my pond for 3 days...I know I need to wait 30 to make sure it works. I was shocked at how big it is and I only have a 250 gallon pond - these got up to 1000 gallons each. I looked and there are no smaller ones. That being said I am anxious to see if it helps keep the algea problem under control.	1
as described	1
I found these fill with the algae and sink to the bottom too quickly.	-1
Great for planting plants you need to move around in your pond.  The are a good size to sit on the edges if needed.	1
I bought 3 of these baskets and one round one along with the floatation rings to make a floating planter for my pond.  When planted I tied them together with the round one in the center and it made a gorgeous floating planter (at a fraction of the cost of the floating planters in the pond supply books) for my beloved backyard pond.  However, some of my plants grew so aggressively, during spring clean-up I had to cut the basket apart to free the roots for plant division.  BUT, I reordered the baskets again and will continue to do so until I find something better and as economical, which I doubt.	1
Save your money and read the info on http://www.clean-flo.com about barley straw there is no proof straw does anything for your water. Wish I had same my money and put it towards more clean-flo bacteria.	-1
These are good but I think they would have worked better for smaller pond than mine.  My pond is approximately 15' x 25'.	1
Works great	1
Waste, half to attach to the area of the water flow back into the pond without submerging into the pond. A pain to use with minimal results.	-1
I have a large 1600 gallon 10' x 17' pond which is 3' deep. It is in full sun, and I was spending a lot of money trying to clear up the pond of algae with algaecides and ph reducer. I've read some reviews where people claim this product doesn't work, and they're completely wrong, but they probably didn't have their pond prepared properly in the first place. My pond is crystal clear and I haven't added chemicals in over a month! First you have to stabilize your pond. That means getting the ph, nitrogen, and ammonia levels correct. You also need to put in helpful bacteria to get your pond in order and create a biofilter. You need plants and fish in the right balance to create an ecosystem - THEN YOU PUT IN THE BARLEY BALES! If you missed those first important steps these will not work. The only other thing you need to know is when you put the bales in you need to wait at least 2 weeks to start seeing the effect, and also you should keep the pump running 24/7 especially during the hot summer months.	1
Too small.	-1
Nice size	1
Love these but they are not quite as large as they look. Plants rapidly outgrew them.	1
very good for koi ponds so that they don't eat plant roots	1
The size allows for three good size plants in  my pond. Filled with small river rock it's very sturdy and looks like it's going to hold up for a long time. I like the way the curve  follows  the curve at one end  of my pond. Going to purchase another one or two in the spring.	1
Not sure if my pond too small - but these things absorbed TOO much water - thought I had a leak until I realized and removed the bale.  Also - um - water was NOT clear while using these.  May work for you, but research before you buy.	-1
Helped to clear the pond water to crystal clear. I was dubious at first but they really work!	1
Received these quickly. I added them and some beneficial bacteria to my pond and have noticed a large reduction in the amount of algae that must be removed by my pond filters.	1
It is now about 4 weeks and my pond is virtually free of algie-I am actually amazed at how good a job this stuff did. I put two of the small straw bundles in my waterfall filter(I clean the other filter material every 2 or 3 days) and presto no more algie. This has been a major problem for me as I have a 1000 gallon koi pond that I even put a tent over in the summer to cut down on the  algie. This seems to have done the trick.	1
I have not had these in the water long enough to determine if they are providing benefit to the water quality of my pond, but they are neat and do not visually distract from the fish or water plants.  I feel confident enough that I have ordered additional bales for replacement.  If these bales provide the benefits they claim, they will be a wonderful discovery on my part.  It is simply too soon to give these an accurate rating.	1
algae is barely visible thanks to this product, works great without having to add chemicals weekly to maintain clear pond water	1
too expensive and did not work for my fish pond.  may work for some one who has a very small one.  It is not cost effective for me tho.	-1
I February I had bought one from Tractor Supply for 4.99....worked great. Then decided to order these for my 80 gallon water trough, which was filled with clean and fresh tab water! Within 10-14 days it was greenish cloudy...cleaned the trough again and put it back in- 10 days later same result. Not worth the money. These are supposedly for 6 months Each! Nope not possible.	-1
It takes awhile but these do make a significant difference in my still water pond. i will buy them again when needed.	1
I must say I was a little skeptical. Ornamental pond was full of string algae. I have a UV filter box but it was getting out of control. Put 2 of these bales in, and within a week I can see the bottom of the pond and all the algae is GONE!!	1
Great for clearing the pnd and keeping the algae down. My pond in sun and use to get a lot of algae this helps.	1
The fish store manager told me not to use chemicals in my pond unless I really had an algae problem.  The chemicals reduce the oxygen in the water and stress the fish.  He said Barley Straw has no effect on the fish.	1
I was having algae problems that made my pond very cloudy, all I had to do way put one of these in the pond and let it float around. This product just absorbs the algae and when it gets full you just pull it out and let it dry, then toss it back in. It makes a huge difference. I would highly recommend this product. Just toss it and forget it.	1
These do exactly what they say they will do for your pond, no complaints.  They are much less expensive here than a lot of places I checked out.  I would recommend these to everyone.	1
I use these in my wife's pond and they seem to keep algae down. She can see her fish we're happy	1
These little bundles work wonders in my pond.  This is my second year of using, do to my excellent experience last year, proving that sometimes, the simple natural solution trumps all, in our chemically laden/dependent  lifestyle today.	1
I've used this product before and it works great in the pond. Saves me time and worry with trying to measure the liquid water-clear products.	1
I purchased this product to resolve my back yard pond issues.  Too much algae in the pond and I didn't want to use chemicals.  It's too soon to know how it works.  It's only been in the pond for a couple of weeks!	1
It works, I don't know why it works but it does. Something happens where heavy scum becomes lightweight foam that can just be squirted off of the pond with a garden hose. I don't need to know why it works once I know that it does. Five years experience tells me that it does work and that works for me.	1
I tried to use these as a natural solution to an algae problem in my outdoor 100 gallon pond and the algae only needed got worse.  I tried to leave these in the pond as much as possible but they kept taking on water and starting to sink.  I would dry them out and right back to the same problem.  I ended up just dumping chemicals in the pond and they didn't hurt the fish and cleared the algae up in a couple of days and only required minimal maintenance to keep up.	-1
Everything came as expected.	1
Was having trouble clearing my back yard pond (has a three tier water fall). These did the trick! It isn't an over night fix, it took about two weeks for my pond to clear, but from that point forward keeping one of these active in the pond (used only 2 over a 9 month period) kept the water crystal clear. Good solution for me that should work for any backyard pond.	1
Would not recommend this unit, having problems after just 2.5 months	-1
My wife used it for our pond but it didn't last more than 2 weeks	-1
waited all summer for this to improve my water..Had no effect. Finally gave up and took the plunge to a UV light.	-1
I was not impressed with the item it didn.t help control the algae  I had to get them out of the pond every day and let them dry as they were water logged all the time.  I will not purchase any m ore of them	-1
This worked great for about six months and then the pump just stopped working.  I contacted customer service and have had no response.  I'll continue to try and contact them, but what good is a warranty if the company will not even respond?  So its a good pump, but this company does not seem to stand behind their products when something goes wrong.	-1
Great filter!	1
Bales neatly packed in individual netting. Have had one in my green-water pond for a few days along with a DIY bio filter and the hair algae is already dying and green water clearing up a bit. Had to replace my UV ballast so don't know how much of the clearing up is due to the barley or UV clarifier, but am hoping to have clear water in 2-3 weeks.	1
This stuff has been working in my 2000 gal pond and it is keeping it real clear. I need to replace it soon but I thought I would wait for warmer weather. Its been in my pond for over 6 months and I had forgot I put them in my top water fall, but ever since I haven't had to add anything else to keep my pond clear. I do get some green slime as I call it but not like I use too. A little is a whole lot better then a lot. I'll report latter when I have to remove them.	1
We have a pond with mainly gold fish.  These seem to do no good at all in keeping the water clear.	-1
I placed one of these bales in my pond nearly 5 months ago and it still floating. The water is crystal  clear with some Algae only around the rocks as it should be.  It is important to note that these bales will not get rid of the present algae but will prevent string algae from forming and from what I can see it does a great job. I have a 1000 gallon pond containing 6 koi fish and two turtles and one bale  seems to be enough for this size pond.	1
Works great. Have to learn how to clean the motor regularly.	1
clear water	1
Works  well only had it in the water for a few days.  So far very good	1
Who would think this sstuff Works !!! It is amazing. Our pond cleared up and the algae growth has been much less. The water, plants and fish all seem healthier.	1
Seems to be helping to clear the pond, I need more time to be sure but so far so good!  I hope to be able to see my fish again soon!	1
Bought to replace an identical pump that had worn out.	1
Today is June 10. The window for return closed on June 1. Pump failed on June 9. Would never purchase this again. Have had ponds for the past 30 years and know all about cleaning filters, never running pump out of water, and so forth. Vwery disappointed with this waster of almost $70.  June 14 update. Contacted Pondmaster, the company that built the filter pump and they were very helpful. Priscilla, who answered the phone gave me a trick to try before sending it back, then emailed me instructions and a return form. Don't know about the machine itself, but it was wonderful to speak immediately  with some knowledgeable and ready to help.  Based on my experience so far, i correct my earlier negative review.	1
In the past I have used barley balls, big plastic balls that are not attractive. this is a nice size "barrel" that floats all by itself. Started with a clean pond and it seems to be keeping it very nice.  Pond is in heavy use by birds and small critters, so no chemicals can be used.  The barley bale is doing all the work.	1
I bought this to clean up a 100 gallon garden pond. I cleaned all the solids out of the pond, but the water was murky and disgusting.  This cleaned the water up in about 24 hours.  It is not crystal clear, but no garden pond can be really...  Due to my pond isn't very wide the actual fountain piece was spraying water on the patio (it's spray radius is about 3 feet...), so I removed it. If the fountain piece is off it basically just circulates the water at the bottom, instead of spraying out above the water, which works great.  Since the pond was so dirty after the water cleared I took out the filter and rinsed it off, and it is working great.  Overall a nice pump/filter system.	1
I had to replace my old pump/filter that finally wore out.  Didn't do enough research I guess.  This is tiny and lightweight.  It's a joke!  I had to put a large rock on it just to keep it from tipping over and floating!  WOW!	-1
We have one of these in our small goldfish pond in the back yard. Although it lasts less than one year, it works well while it works. Once the motor gots it's pretty much useless. We clean it about every two weeks, as it gets pretty gunked up with all the fish. It's easy to clean. Fountain top is nice. I'll buy another one when this one dies.	1
Bought these for my outdoor pond where I have always had an algae problem no matter what I have tried. This has made a good dent in the problem and I will continue to use to supplement my other efforts.	1
I already wrote a review for the larger bale ( 5000 gallons) and the same hold true for this nifty set.  I used one of these bales in my very small fish pond. Within days, the algae bloom was gone.  It did not hurt my fish in any way and is a fabulous alternative to chemical treatments.  I was surprised and delighted to know that I could order it from Amazon.  I have been looking for it for years and not able to find it.  If you have racoons, though, expect them to take the bale apart.  It still works, it is just messy.	1
Thought this would be just what I needed. Didn't work.........actually pond water is worse. Looking  to get my $$ back	-1
Hi Folks! I just got my barley from Amazon and it looks just like the stuff I got from our local feed store. I haven't compared the prices. I was in a hurry to get it here and couldn't run out to the feed store for a couple days so I jumped on the Prime deal to get it here quickly because my last 2 little bales cleared the string algae that I had been dealing with for over 2 years!! It takes about a month, depending on the size of your pond but it did a NICE job. My pond is more clear than it's been in a long time and we're in FL!!  My pond is a very established one, we've had it in for about 8-10 years. Tip for new pond owners: Start with these little barley bales while your pond is new, you want your pond to become established and start to get all kinds of creatures in it to find an eco balance but once it starts that it will get algae unless you start these little bales before it does.  Important Note: These are SMALL (maybe 1'long x 5" thick), they are for SMALL ponds (mine is 4'x 3' and maybe 2' deep. If you have a little lake in your yard then you want to buy large bales the size of a barnyard hay bale. Please don't expect these small bales to clean your pool sized pond. I'm pretty sure there is a more economical way to buy barley straw for large pool sized ponds. :-)	1
The filter was not packed in any additional box and it was rather battered when I received it. All parts and filter arrived undamaged. I plugged it in on Monday afternoon as soon as I received it and had read the instructions. I have a small 86 gallon pond with about 7 gold fish and 2 koi and plants in full sun. I have been using two solar pump and filters which could not keep up. The water was so green and I was constantly putting in chemicals, barley straw and changing the water but could not keep the water clear for more than a day. When I plugged it in the water was so green you could barely see an inch below the water surface. It is now Friday morning and the water is almost crystal clear. It had not been this clear since I initially set up the pond. I have read many reviews and I don't know how long this pump and filter will last. I will just have to be optimistic, but for now I am truly a believer in this filter. I also like the bell shaped fountain head and the different adjustments and spherical pattern that it makes. It will tip over which I had read that it would do but I weighted it down with a cave that does not distract from the overall theme of the pond.	1
I really haven't noticed any difference after I put this in the pond. I will reserve my final opinion until Fall when the weather cools down some.	-1
They float then sink full of algae. I dry them out and place them back in the pond. The price is the best.	1
Plugged it in and nothing. Motor didn't make a sound. Big bummer!	-1
Definitely not going to keep 190gal pond clean. I got this thinking it would be a good filter for my new 75 gal pond but it did not keep water clean.  Also the filter kept wanting to float so I had to put a rock on it.  It was a powerful little pump but the filter attachment was junk. I removed it from the filter housing and tried to construct some sort of other barrier to use as a filter but something got sucked into the pump and it broke. the design of the pump I could only pull the front off to clean the propeller but something was sucked into the motor.  I would not recommend this item since it couldn't keep the 75 gal pond clear but I do think the pump would have kept working (probably for a long time) if I had not remove the filter housing.	-1
Would have been great if it had come with all the parts.	-1
This works awesome, I had to put a rock on it to hold it down. The pump wanted to tip over when it was running so I set a 2 inch diameter rock on it and now it works fine. In the picture it is sitting in a 100 gallon Rubbermaid container and it running on lowest setting for water flow.	1
I put 2 of these in a running creek.  I was hoping to avoid putting in chemicals and decided to try these since they are natural and I have animals drinking out of the creek.  These helped a little bit but not enough to prevent algae from growing every week.  The creek does refill itself after the level goes down because of usage, so maybe that is why these don't work.  They may do better with a pond that does not replenish itself and is stagnant.	-1
Works well.	1
After a month of use, the sprayer will no longer work. Very disappointing.	-1
We have used barley straw in our garden pond for several years.  Its kind of hard to get really excited about straw, but it does help with water clarity.  I would recommend it to anyone with a pond.	1
Only worked for a couple months -- just long enough for the warranty to expire.	-1
Great value	1
I haven't tried these before so I am waiting to see how good they work.  Easy to use, fast shipping, very hopeful that they clear my pond of algae so I don't have to use chemicals.	1
A couple months in the pond and the water was still green. I bought a UV sterilizer, which finally took care of the problem. For what good these did, they might as well have been grass clippings. They add a bit of ugly as they float on the surface of the water and the payback, if there is any, is not noticeable enough to make worthwhile.	-1
About 3-weeks and the pond was clear. Have to clean regularly; about twice a week but it does great.	1
Stops working after a few weeks, have returned twice and haven't had any luck so far.  Just purchased the Danner brand will see how that does, though after purchasing realized motor is made by same brand, so not optimistic.	-1
We experienced murky water that the barley straw helped clear. It takes a while for the effects to be seen but once it's working it clears the water.	1
They didn't last but about 30 days and they stopped working I had exchanged 1 in that time but it has stopped working again as well.	-1
Great pump and filter for a small pond.  I have a 50 gallon pond and use this on it's side without the spout connected to it.  It not only filters well, but by removing the spout it does a really great job of circulating the water.	1
Very disappointed.  The "bonus fountain head" did not fit.  When I called to inquire, I was told they were aware of the problem, I should "just use some tape".  After 6 weeks the pump stopped working altogether.	-1
I needed a small pump and filter for a 100 gallon quarantine setup. This works great, because for one low price it has everything I needed, including a fountain head to aerate the water.	1
works great in the pond and very easy to clean,ty	1
Really a great small pump and pre-filter.  Took 30 days before I had to clean the filter.	1
It can take up to a month(!) for these to decay enough to start releasing the chemical compounds that work magic on ponds, but it's well worth the wait! Buy extras and throw one in after the first one's been in for 5 months or so, then repeat.  It'll make a huge difference in your pond!	1
I haven't been using these very long and don't really know what the long term effect will be.  They are recommended by pond experts so I am hoping to get the maximum "natural" benefit from them.  Delivery was quick and the package arrived in very good condition.	1
As long as you have a system in your pond or stock tank that moves the water around this will work in helping clear your water	1
Barley straw only works if you are willing to keep buying it every 2 months to ensure that you have it rotting in your pond on a constant basis.  I tried this stuff for a couple of years and saw very little (if any) progress against combating string algae.  I have always had a problem with string algae in my pond every spring.  It was very bad. Nothing seemed to help and barley straw did not seem to do anything.  Since this little experiment, I have talked to a professional company that maintains and cleans ponds for companies and other larger and more business like ponds.  All stated that they do NOT use barley straw to deal with algae.  All stated that they used chemicals to keep algae under control.  Since that time I have stopped buying barley straw and have moved on to chemicals.  For my 1500 gallon pond I now use MICROBE LIFT PBL (Professional Blend Liquid).  This stuff really works.  I have not had any string algae in my pond for over a year now.  NONE.  This is the stuff to use if you have problems with algae.  Always talk to the professionals and see what they use because their goal is always "minimal" maintenance and cost to provide the highest quality result.  They were right.	-1
Barley helps keep the pond clear and these are a good size and price.  It is part of keeping our pond/stream clear.	1
Did not work at all.  The barley straw sank so i let it dry and tied a string to my bricks so it would stay above water. Algae grew all over it and my pond got greener. Very dissappointed. Used it for my 1000 gallon pond and even later on put both barley straws in there. It doesnt work. I have tried everything, and now im trying Algaefix.  Got my fingers crossed.	-1
This pond filter works great. UNTIL it doesn't. The motor on the pump gives out after 60 days or so. Bought the first one and I thought the clacking motor happened because we were gone during the day and it might have run clogged up. My hubby cleans it EVERY day (our pond is under a tree) so I know it wasn't due to neglect. The filter system on it is awesome but the pump is inferior. We're going to buy a different pump and see if we can make it work. I wish other reviewers would update their experiences after a bit of time. $60 is too much to spend on a 60 day pump.	-1
I will not bore you with a long review.  Look no further.....this cleared up my 1000 gallon pond in a matter of days.  I am a believer!	1
I have a 450 gallon pond and I put both bales in there to help, within 3 days both bales sunk to the bottom. The instructions say if they sink to pull them out and air dry for a couple of days. That means that every three days I will have to pull them out again. Like I really have time for that? NO WAY,Going in the trash	-1
These did nothing to help keep my pond clear. They have barley plants growing out of them and only seem to collect dirt,causing more mud in the pond. I will use what I have, but will go back to liquid barley straw extract along with beneficial bacteria.	-1
When we first moved into our home we discovered the pond filter had been unplugged and the pond was simply gross!  Algae, mud, and debris cluttered it.  Did some research and came across these.  While fixing the filter and learning about cleaning and maintaining ponds, I threw these in the water.  I was shocked when a week later I went to change out the water and do some serious cleaning.  I found these things had really done their job.  They had already begun absorbing the algae.  These are now a permanent fixture hidden at the bottom of our little pond.	1
A natural way to keep your pond water cleaner and free of harmful substances that cloud the water and wear out the filter and pump.	1
unable determine if the product is working or not will have to try again because my pond was so bad i used the bales along with algae fix and the bales were always covered with algae. Have used barley straw before and have read what it is supposed to do so another order is required.	1
We bought this last year, and it's still working, beautifully. Good for a small pond. Ours is about 60 gallons.	1
This pump moves some water.. I had to not use the fountain head due to my pond being to small for it. It just wanted to empty my pond by shooting the water out of it!! I am guessing if your pond is larger then mine you will be ok. Yes I tried to adjust the fountain head with no luck.	1
I did not think these things worked at all in my front yard water feature.  The algae grew ON them.  But after a long time, when the straw looked alomst rotten, the water was clear!.  I'll try another pack this year, but will put them in the water earlier in the year.	1
This is our first year with a pond and the Barley seemed to help. Unfortunately, ours sunk and we are having trouble getting it out of the pond to rinse it out and dry but we'll get it when the rain stops. Seller was fast and the product is worth it.	1
Had it only about 6 months and even after cleaning and removing all filter pads, it won't push enough water to make it to the top.  Probably have to get a new impeller already, and 6 months is way too early.	-1
good quality	1
Works great.	1
I thought...how can a bundle of straw floating in my pond help make it clear?  Well, let me tell you it really works.  I can't believe how clear my pond is today, it has never been so clear.	1
After I built my pond I used this product thinking it would prevent or slow the growth of algae in my new pond. However, at least for me it did not work. While this bale was floating around my pond the pond water got greener and greener and hair algae started covering every thing. The barley was decaying at the time so I know it should have been working. The algae was getting so bad my pond started to smell like a sewer. I thought I may have done something wrong. So I drained the pond and cleaned it out. When I refiled it I decided to try the other bale in the new water and after 1 week I saw the algae beginning to grow again. I ended up buying&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/PondCare-Algae-Destroyer-Advanced-16-Ounce/dp/B000YIWMYU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">PondCare Algae Destroyer Advanced, 16-Ounce</a>&nbsp;and in less than 24 hours my pond was crystal clear. I no longer use the barley. If you are looking for a fish safe product to keep algae in check I would recommend the Algae destroyer product.	-1
How many of thes things do you need for a "real pond"? Where I come from we measure our ponds in "acre feet" not gallons.	-1
I have a 2000 gal fish pond.  When I saw this product had no effect after 2 months I called my man at the pet shop, he knows his stuff about ponds, what he said is this is just a bunch of hooey and I am just wasting my money.  He said the most effective bio filter is to put 3" of the pea size gravel at bottom of pond and also get a big tub put the gravel in it run a water fall through the tub and also put some floating plants in.  this is not so much for algae but to control  the ammonia level produced by the fish.	-1
This is a great natural product to kill algae in your koi or fish pond.  So far it is doing a great job and, being a natural product, is not harmful to the fish.  Neither do they seem to mind it being in the pond.  We are having to clean our filter and fountain a lot more frequently as the algae is dying off and clogging both.  Still it's a good thing as the warm weather was starting to grow string algae at an alarming rate.  We are using this product in conjunction with the barley extract.	1
We have a fountain that is in a concrete lined pond. The fountain has its own pump, but the pond water was getting algae and dirt. This pump is operating to clean up the pond and is doing a marvelous job so far. It has a large removable and 'cleanable' filter. So far so good. Time is now 16 months later. Pump stopped working about three weeks ago. The motor appears to work and the impeller turns freely  but there does not seem to be a 'connection' between the two. Called Danner and was advised that if cord is cut which we had to do to wire it in with the fountain motor that warranty is voided. So much for a 'warranty'. There is a store here in CA that apparently sells this product but have not been able to catch them open. So will be looking for either a new pump for the whole unit or hope to locate another that will be more dependable.	-1
Worked well	1
I can't really stand behind this product. I just have not been able to see the results really and there's no real way of testing(on your own) the effectiveness of this product without using this product alone as a control. I'd recommend Microbe Lift PL(beneficial bacteria) and a few of there barley based products.	-1
We have a small farm pond with an algae problem. We put 4 of these in the pond and waited...no change...ever. Buy an algaecide.  2 stars only because the item was exactly as described and it may work for different types of algae. Who knows.	-1
We put barley straw bales in our ponds to control algae and it's working wonderfully!	1
I have been using barley straw for 3 years now, ever since I had a bad case of string algae. It truly works, but you have to give it time to establish itself in the pond, and then keep it in always. I place mine in the waterfall weir where the water runs through it always. No more string algae, or any other algae for that matter. And Summit Chemical shipped ultra fast and has the best price that I could find.	1
Put it in the pond started to sputter, looked out dead.. this thing has never worked properly, works for a day then off, took it apart for the hundreth time to figure out what is wrong, and the rubber ring is split.. We have had many pond filters over the years and this is by far the biggest waste of money and effort. I wish I had just sent it back..a total waste	-1
Work just as expected!	1
Great little pump/filter combination! The bell wall fountain feature is a very attractive addition to the little pond a our pediatric practice.	1
This is my go to pump for the small pond in my back yard.  I had one that lasted for years but it finally stopped.  Took it apart, cleaned it out, and still nothing so I purchased a new one in June 2014.  It stopped working in the beginning of August 2014 and when I contacted Pondmaster they directed me to the manufacturer.  Their tech gal was great.  Said it was probably the impeller, got my address, and said she would ship out immediately.  That was Friday.  It arrived Monday.  Reassembled everything, plugged in, and voila ....all works again.  I am hoping this is not an ongoing problem with the impeller.  I know keeping the filter clean is essential and I have been religious about that but when you only use something 6 months out of a year it should work longer than most items.  If it stops again I will be revisiting my review.	1
I like this product and do maintain my little pond (2 ft x 3 ft oval), BUT...it seems to be one of those things that have planed obsolescence. The first one I bought lasted 3 years and then something happened with the product (pond is still the same). I proceeded to get one every year after that as they seemed to last only one summer.  I usually "open" the pond in May and "close" it in October.  The pump does run 24/7 but still I would hope it would last longer than 6 months.  I do store it over winter in the garage.	1
Perfect filtration system!!! cleared my 2 ponds in 2 days!	1
Helps keep the floaters out of my pond.	1
Pondmaster pumps by Danner used to be near indestructible workhorses but that doesn't seem to be true anymore. Perhaps I got a lemon but I have contacted Danner 3 times - 4 if you count the unanswered email - and gotten a replacement impeller which lasted no longer than the 2 weeks the first one did and then paid over $10 to send the whole pump back to them to figure out why the impellers look fine but don't work only to get my pump back with yet another impeller dropped in, no explaination, not even a note. Surprise, it lasted 2 weeks. Too late to get a refund from amazon so I'll make one more not toll-free call to Danner to try to get something out of them but I need to find another small pond filter. Too bad as the first one like this lasted years with no trouble but there won't be another. It too frustrating.	-1
This is my 2nd of this exact pump and filter. One went into a 65 gallon pond, kept pond mostly clean if I cleaned it twice a week in summer, once  a week in other seasons, also using water conditioners, fountain just good enough to spray out of pond and keep water moving. The other is in barrel pond, seem appropriate size for filtering and fountain, but since it's not deeply submerged I hear the pump if within 10 feet of pond. It's good for the price.	1
Works well. I have a very small pond and it is working as expected!	1
What's not to like?  Finally a pump with a real filter and some power. Note that the pump is powerful enough to move the unit on the bottom of your  fountain, so be prepared to weight it down.	1
I have this in a 50 gallon trough with a few goldfish in it, I clean it once a week and is VERY easy to clean, I love it!	1
I am very pleased with this pump/filter.  The fountain effect is very pleasing and it is very easy to clean.  It takes me about 15 minutes to clean it.  My only complaint is that so far I am having to clean it about twice a week.  It is slowly lasting longer so the problem may be that it is still stabilizing my 175 gallon pond or it may be that it would have been better designed with the addition of a third filter for coarse pre-filtering.  In any case, it has been in the pond for a month and I would buy it again.	1
Well, I picked this because of the price and the ratings it got as an inexpensive replacement for a dead pump in a pond at the house we are renting atm, but maybe this is a case of you get what you pay for. The nozzle head never really worked - it randomly picked which directions / pattern it sprayed out of and then this morning I came out and the pump had started spraying at a much higher rate and was over-spraying the pond edges and had emptied a significant portion of the water out of it. I pulled it out and checked the flow setting, but it was still set on low, not sure if the motor is dieing already or what. I have cleaned the filters - for now I am using it as a single flow fountain w/ no head, but I may just return it to Amazon (not sure how they want to handle that - a stinky, muddy, wet package :-)	-1
It has a broad filtering surface and efficient filtering, i have crystal clear waters in my pond. And also very easy to clean it once you take it out of water; open the cover, take the filter out and spray water onto it. However, you need to replace your impeller (cost you around 12 USD) every year or 2; magnet and impeller are engaged by plastic locks which are worn out by usage.	1

Sturdy , thick filter layer , and something new on them.  The  pump , a control valve , to adjust the flow.  Very nice!  Check to make sure you don't get one from old stock,  this is on new models only.  This pump/filter can be used for up to 200 gallon ponds.  I use it on a  small 150 gallon indoor pond so to have the adjustable flow on the pump is great.  You can never have over kill on any pumps or filters.  Been using Pondmaster for years and will stay loyal to them.  MADE TWO MORE PONDS ,A 70 GALLON IN MY FRONT GARDEN AND 300 GALLON IN THE BREEZEWAY OUTSIDE.  ALL HAVE A PONDMASTER PMK190 AND WORKS GREAT !!!  Be careful some are sold as a PMK 190  around $54 for a 200 gallon pond  and some are sold as  a PM190  around $80 and state for a 400 gallon pond.  [advertisement only]  DON'T BE FOOLED  BOTH ARE THE SAME PUMP and IMPELLER!!!  SAME PART NUMBERS.  I fell for the PM years ago , when cleaning it I found out it was the same motor and impellor as the PMK !!!  I have a another pond now that's 480 gallons and use a PMK190.  I don't use the fountain head but use a flex 1/2 inch hose , just open , on the end and get a great flow.  Filter on one end and open 1/2 hose on the other.  I tried a jet head on the end and was too much a flow for goldfish.  Very , very much !  The open end of the 1/2 inch hose at water level goes over nine feet across my pond.  I angle it down wards about half way and you can see the plants moving around pretty dam good.  Save some money and get the PMK190.	1
It is working very well, hooked it to a spitter instead of the spray it came with. We recommend it.	1
I have a small pond. This pump works great and is so easy to clean and use. GREAT purchase and price.  I am very happy with this pump and the speed and packaging in which it arrived.	1
Need a pump? This is a dandy little one!!!! I love the pump being connected to the filter. Great feature. Well worth the money.	1
I bought mine just under a week ago from my local pond store. I paid $ 120.00 which was way too much I now know. But so it is....  But I'm not going to complain. My little less than 200 gallon pond was a mess. We were going nuts with water changes & the water still being horrible. Within 24 hrs the pond looked so much better. It's now been about five days & the pond looks a wonder. It's a joy & delight yet again & I'm sure my fish appreciate it a lot. I sure hope the pump keeps on trucking cause I love how beautiful my pond is yet again. We've also installed a larger pond as my husband in less than a week decided the small pond was too small. We now have a 12 x 12 foot pond about 2,5 feet deep. I've bought a heavy duty filtration system for it, but will by a small unite like this for the Bell Fountain kit alone. We love it.  So so far so good - we love it.	1
I have a small pond and this unit does a good job keeping it clean. It is easy to clean and put right back in service. I read other reviews about breaking the clips and you just gently lift off top without any problem. It's plastic so use a little finesse and you'll have no problem.	1
Works nicely for my small pond. So far it has kept the pond clean and I have not had to clean it out, but only a month old. The process for cleaning it is not very easy having to pull the whole thing out of the pond vs. just removing a small filter off like the other kinds of filter fountains.	1
I ordered this pump on June 11th.  it was received and used for three weeks.  It stopped working. I applied for and received another pump from Amazon.  I have  had it since July 13th and again it stopped working.  The directions say that the impella section should be cleaned by taking it apart if it clogs up.  However, one needs special tools to remove it for cleaning, tools which even my Ace Hardware store does not have.  I did back flush it which did no good.  Since the refund time has passed, I am stuck with a pump that I have had for less than two months and it doesn't work.	-1
Update: this pump requires cleaning, other than that it does what it says.  The pump is a bit small, but the filter is rather large.  If it isn't producing a water bell *or other spray pattern* it is likely the filter is clogged.  Original post: this pump quit working after around 30 days.  the device was cleaned regularly, and am disappointed with the product.  steer clear!!!	1
So far this pump/filter setup has worked for me. My pond is 8x10 and 2 1/2 feet at its deepest and 1 foot at the lowest. The pump has been running none stop for 2 weeks now and I have not experienced any issues. The filter that came with it is good, it does the job of filtering and it is also easy to clean.  Edit: I have now changed my review to 2 stars. After just a little over 2 months of off and on use the pump has stopped working. I thought it might have been clogged but when I took it out of my pond it was clean and no excessive debris was in the filter. If you are look for a pump to run continuously then stay away from this one.	-1
The impeller shaft  breaks. I have had 2 of these (I will not buy another) and both failed because the shaft is so cheap. I am so tired of Chinese made crap that breaks. The first one lasted 4 years and the 2nd one broke before the year was up.	-1
The pump is exactly what I needed for my small pond.  Works great and the fountain has great eye appeal.	1
I bought this for our small outdoor fish pond.  I don't know the exact size or volume, but it's about 3' x 4'.  Our previous pump/filter had given out partly because it was too powerful for a tiny pond.  This seems to be just right.  It makes a nice little fountain & filters the water really well. (We used the fountain nozzle from our other pump/filter because we wanted a more traditional tiered fountain, but this kit includes the basic bubble and waterbell type water pattern.)  We had clear water again after just one day.  It has been a little over a month since we installed, and no problems.  It's easy to clean, and at this price is such a great value. UPDATE: It has now been a year and this pump is still working great.  We kept it running all winter without the fountain part attached and it provided enough movement that our little pond didn't freeze solid and it kept our comets happy and healthy during this unbelievable winter!  Now that it's warm out, it continues to keep the water crystal clear, doesn't clog over-easily and is easy to clean. I have not had the problem that others spoke of with the tab of the cover breaking off, but I also don't just try and rip it off. Very satisfied with this product! SECOND UPDATE: It has now been almost 2 years (and a very rough winter in the northeast!) and this pump is still working beautifully! My fish survived the winter as this kept the water moving even in the deep freezes we had. Great product!	1
My UV clarifier is probably 10 or 11 months old and it's already dead.  The bulb burned out about 6 weeks ago, well short of its 1 year expected life, and was replaced.  Last weekend I noticed the light was dead.  I replaced the $80 bulb, plugged it back in, and nothing.  The UV clarifier is dead.  Typical.  Can't anyone many anything that actually works anymore?  It's also annoying that the input and output tubes have such a tiny diameter.  I think they went out of their way to find a size that was difficult to convert to more standard sized tubes.  EDIT: I was very mad when I wrote the above.  The next day I contacted Pondmaster to complain, but they quickly began to resolve my problem.  They sent out a new ballast which arrived in a few days and a complimentary bulb.  The new ballast works fine.  They made this process extremely easy for me and they didn't need to.  This was an example of how a company can turn a bad situation into a favorable one because after this experience I wouldn't think twice about purchasing another Pondmaster product.  I have the product a 1 because it broke when it shouldn't have, but after seeing their customer service in action I'd like to change it to a 4 but I can't.  I won't change it to a 5 because I still find the UV's tiny in/out pipes annoying ;)	-1
I've had this UV sterilizer installed for 1 year.  I've had to replace the transformer, the sleeve 2x, and the bulb 4x....and the brand new one doesn't even work.  The interior design is horrible!  The bulb rattles around even with the rubber grommets.  I've contacted the seller to absolutely no avail except their automated response.  If I could give zero stars, that would be more appropriate.  Run!  Run Away from this one!	-1
great	1
Awesome! Cleared my pond up and is nice and clear water!!	1
love it	1
The package came poorly insulated ... the quartz shield and the uv bulb are broken ... the metal cap on the end of the bulb has some rust on it ... I am wondering if it was used before ? The external housing is really sturdy and as of right now I have a big paperweight.	-1
this takes a few days to start working but when it does?  wow.  Make sure you get the right size for your pond.  Otherwise it just won't get the job done.  Our pond is HUGE so I didn't want to take any chances.  Great item!	1
This replaced an older UV light that worked well for many years, The old one had a replacement bulb that cost as much as this one and this one has better specs. Easy to install...standard plumbing parts used to connect to the tubing and pump. I love the blue UV strips on the outside. They not only tell you that the unit is on, they also look groovy. These lights come in several different models depending on the GPH of your pump and the size of your pond. Be sure to size the device correctly. Too small and it won't work properly, too big and you are wasting money. Err on the side of slightly too big.	1
Seems to be working.  We broke a smaller, older version.  Since our pond is over 2000 gallons, we decided we needed more watts.  Has been keeping the pond clear since it was put in 2 weeks ago.	1
Do not waste your money. When the unit works the water is nice and clear but you cannot count on it. I have had two units within 11 months the first malfunctioned within two weeks and was returned to the store where I bought it for a replacement. The second unit malfunctioned two days ago after only being used since May. I contacted customer service of PondMaster (Danner Manufacturing, Inc) requesting they stand behind their product by replacing the unit. They told me to box it up send it to them using FedEx or UPS at my cost and they would inspect and test it and maybe then they would repair or replace the unit. I asked how long this process would take seeing how my pond would be going untreated. No answer, no concerns about their customers. After the failure of two units within 11 months (5 months of use) one would think they would offer better customer support. Their product is junk as well as their customer support.	-1
EXCRLLENT PLUS I SAVED SOME 56 BUCKS OVER THE LOCAL POND STORE	1
UPDATE: original review below.  BALLAST FAILURES.  I own three of theses and with in a year, two ballasts failed.  Pondmaster was good in covering one under warranty, but I could not find receipt for the second, so no warranty.  I am very disappointed in what could be an excellent product, but ends up being a piece of expensive junk.  I have $600 invested in these, and now it is either keep buying ballasts at $90 a piece, or scrap them and move onto a new brand.  Too bad.  As you see below, I was very excited about the design....  Original review (originally 5 stars) I have 3 of these installed as follows.  240 gal display overflows into 10 gallon pre-filter, which then overflows into a 10 gallon bio-media tank.  The bio-media tank then overflows into a 40 gallon sump, where it is the returned to the display.  I use these sterilizers as the overflow "tubes" that feed water from the bio-media tank to the sump.  They are mounted in bulkheads drilled into the side of the bio-media tank (the sterilizer's in/out are NPT threaded, that thread perfectly into threaded bulkheads).  The three units are mounted in "parallel" (i.e., 3 bulkheads, at the same level in the sides of the bio-tank).  The water fills up the bio tank, reaches the bulkheads and overflows, flowing through the sterilizers into the sump directly below.  Thus I have a very high flow rate (total measured at 1900 gal per hour), split across 3 sterilizers, each handling about 630 gph.  This assures that 100% of the water goes through a sterilizer at a low flow (assuring adequate dwell time, which is essential for UV to do its thing).  If I were to use only one sterilizer, the full 1900 gph could NOT flow through a single unit because there would not be enough dwell time to sterilize the water; it would only clarify (i.e. kill free floating algae).  Algae is not my problem--I want sterilization capacity to kill potentially free floating organisms (e.g., ick or other parasites).  The only other option for sterilization in my set up would be to bypass only some of the water through the sterilizer (this is the most common technique), but then I am not getting 100% of the flow sterilized.  So I opted for the 3 units in parallel.  Very pricey, but accomplished what I wanted.  Finally, the reason I chose the Pondmaster Units:  because they are submersible--the only ones as far as I know.  They hang off the side of my bio tank, and hang, vertically, INTO the sump; they are thus submerged in the sump water (I have added some plumbing and elbows routing the flow to assure the UV units are never without water in them, even if the sump drains).  No other unit can be used in this manner.  I would have used AQUA UV's but they are not submersible, and must be mounted horizontally, thus they cannot be used as I have designed this system.  Given the versatility of the Pondmaster's they get my high praise.  Whether UV in general actually does what it claims is another discussion...	-1
I have a 5000 gallon pond with 18 fish (mostly koi) and about 50% plant coverage. It is in full sun all day in southern California. Without plants the visibility was only 6 inches. With plants and bio filter and so on I still could not get the visibility beyond 18 inches. I had tried chemical algae killers but with all the sun we get and the warm water they can't clear the pond and also the algae comes right back in a week or so. Also I did not want to become dependent on expensive chemicals (nor kill my fish!). When I installed the Pondmaster UV light I noticed small improvements in visibility within 24 hours. Within a week I could see down about 3 feet. It took just a bit over two weeks until I could see the bottom (at 5 feet). Since that time the clarity has improved further so I cannot only see the bottom but I can see it very clearly.	1
It cleaned up the pond and maintains it well.  The only problem that I have with the design is that the socket gets corroded if you don't clean it before winter and keek it clear	1
So far, so good.  I have not seen the bottom of my little pond for two years.  After cleaning the pond and putting this light in, the pond has been clear.  I hope this continues throughout the summer.	1
Purchased in May and by August the UV light had burned out.  Worked good but didn't last.  Added remark: After replacing the light tube the ballast failed at 140 days of use.	-1
Bought mine a year ago and the ballast gave out after about 3 months. Pondmaster does not sell any replacement parts except for the bulbs (now have 2 good ones). Pondmaster website contact wouldn't return emails. Ballast is sealed and cannot be removed to be replaced.  Warranty was void because I had to add an extension to the cord (this is no way affected the ballast -I extensively bench-tested the unit). Expensive piece of tubing at this point. It did work fairly well while it worked.	-1
Works great and easy to put together.	1
Great addition to my garage, and easy to put together!!	1
Very easy to assemble and holds all my kids sports equipment.  Just what I needed and nice to have everything organized in one spot.	1
Perfect! Thank you!	1
Great for organzing.	1
The sports storage station is fine, but four of the post are missing to put it together.  I have ordered this item twice and both times the item arrived with four missing post.  There is no way to use the basket with out the four other post.  Since I am unable to get the post I have returned both items and will have to order something else.  Not happy.	1
I was a bit hesitant to buy this after reading some of the reviews - a lot talk about it being flimsy.  I found the top doesn't stay attached to the 4 posts if you lift it up.  Its a shame they didn't make a better locking mechanism - its just round holes and a pole that goes in - it doesn't snap in tight.  But for the most part - this will be in your garage, full of sports equipment so you won't be moving it much.  If you do have to move it, grab the posts, not the top and move it that way.... the bottom seems to stay well attached.  When the net is full of balls, it does bulge out a few inches - I noticed a few reviewers replaced that netting with a bin - there is plenty of room to do that if you need to.  The thing is quite a bit bigger than I expected which is great.  It holds a ton of stuff, and rather than hiding all your kid's sports equipment in a cabinet, it is right there and easy to get to.  The top is high enough that my boxer and golden retriever can't get to it very easily, so I think it will protect our equipment fine.  I do recommend this - for the price it seems to be the best option out there.  The plastic on the bottom and top is thick enough that it feels sturdy too.  My comment about it being flimsy is simply because of the way the top doesn't stay attached.	1
This is simple and works very well in a garage or basement.  We were thinking of getting a second one.	1
Perfect for the sports balls, skate board and safety equipment, water guns, nerf guns, baseball gloves, etc that seem to breed and multiply on their own in my garage.  I bought this as a mate to the black plastic  rolling Rubbermaid tool caddy, to help keep the garage area clean and organized.  We keep this toy caddy in its space against the back wall; there's been no real need yet to move it around, as the kIds run in and out to get what they need or put it back. If we do feel we need to move it out to the driveway or yard daily, we'd probably look into getting casters for the legs to make that easier. The caddy gets heavy with all this stuff we filled it up with:  Skateboard, helmet, pads; two nerf guns and Filled "ammo" belts; air pump & adaptors; official size football and 2 basketballs; nerf footballs; whiffle balls and baseballs; whiffle and metal baseball bats; 2 leather baseball gloves, bike helmet; water guns/blasters; bubbles and bubble makers; sidewalk chalk & bucket; badminton set; several frisbees.	1
This is a really good value for the money.  There are a variety of places on the top deck that can store tennis racquets, bats and other gear, and the net/basket below can hold any variety of basketballs, soccer balls etc. and make it easy to get to them.  I am concerned that the legs are not as sturdy as you might like them to be, but if you don't need to slide the unit around much it shouldn't be a problem.  I may reinforce the connection between the legs and the base with something to make it a little more secure.  But overall it is not bad.	1
Good product	1
After using these spikes for several years, the results have been consistent and positive. Unlike tab fertilizer needing once a month application, these spikes are slow release once a year application.	1
My water lilys are growing like crazy! My fish aren't hurt by it either!	1
Works like a charm....I utilized these fertilizer sticks for my potted pond plants, and my water Lilly's are pushing up more flowers that ever before.  Easy solution, as you don't have to deal with tablets, as these are in the form of a hollow tube filled with fertilizer.  Simply push them into the soil of your plants and watch the plants flourish	1
i started using these in my pond lillies last year and the difference in the number of pads and flowers produced is staggering.	1
I have not seen any difference this makes to my plants.	-1
So far they've worked like a charm. Plants are healthier and and taller than ever.	1
What a great gift for my neighbors 8 year old daughter, I gave it to her for her birthday and she loved it,it is hanging in her yard with birds going in and out, she is so proud.	1
although they are SMALL - they really are adorable and look like they will be easy to clean and maintain. I'm working on using penny's for roof 'tiles' and then painting them in a distressed but cute look! GREAT price for such a well made bird house!	1
Not very big. I don't think birds will nest in it.	-1
Fun project to do with the kids over Christmas break.  Well made and everything you need is there.	1
I purchased this as a gift for a 3 year old. It's cute, appears well made and a fun project. The only problem is that there isn't much paint included for the size of the house. As others have commented, I think you'll need to use some other paints to supplement what comes with this birdhouse.	1
Expensive.	-1
Built well, smaller than I thought.  No birds yet....!	1
We bought this for my dad for Xmas and everyone drew a bird and signed their name.  My niece wrote "Papa's crazy birds" on it.  He loved it!  #dottiedixon	1
pretty and beautiful.	1
Great gift for a child or even preteen fun project for a father & daughter or son. Grandparents & Grandkids. Recommended unless you & your kids are of the non educational gamer type generation. In that case this is not for you it won't keep them busy for you as long as the games do. Also all I could say to that last statement I just made is ditch the games. Get out & get into nature with em build something get involved. This thing requires very little skill you just paint it & hang it put stickers on it so on if you like make it yours & theirs own it. Then you both can feel the pride and rewards that come with it when birds move into it.... Hope this helps with your decision. Recommended! ++ on Price.	1
was defective. returned.	-1
My 7 year old granddaughter loved working on this project.  The paints are easy to use.  Needs little adult supervision.	1
My 4 year old nephew had so much painting this!!! Highly recommend.	1
Nice birdhouses (although the birds near our house don't want to use it). I'd highly recommend getting more paint though. It doesn't come with nearly enough.	1
i bought this for my 2 year old to paint for our tree in the front yar.  its very cute, looks like it would fit a small bird which is nice.  some people say there wasn't enough paint but my 2 year old painted the whole thing with the colors you get.  i let her use one of the paint brushes we had at home cause the one that comes with it is very tiny.  no she didn't make any desings on it just covered the thing in paint, but hay shes a 2 year old	1
Decent kit of this kind, bought it as a present and the recipient loved it!  Seemed sturdy.  I had to remove parts of the packaging that mentioned kids since it was for an adult.	1
A great little hobby craft for any age.  And when you get it done you can hang it up to display.  Top comes off so you can keep it cleaned out if you wish to place it outdoors.	1
I am in my 50s and I had au h a good time painting these birdhousrs for my backyard..4 different ones..one pinkwhite candyland..one barn red with bright sunflowers..a blue one with stars and flags..one orange with yellow flowers. I even mixed colors to make green ..purple and pink. Now I am not crafty but I enjoyed using my imagination. I can see this asa perfect birthday activity or cubscout craft. I took another readers word for it and bought..red box 4 color paint set..smart move..as the brushes that come with this kit are awful..and there os no where near enough paint OH by the way all 4 of my houses have birds in them nesting.	1
Perfect!  Seems to be keeping vine borers at bay.	1
Good quality Food Grade Diatomaceous Earth, I use it to mix it with my own mix of tooth paste	1
Good quality product.	1
EXCELLENT PRODUCT, USE IT FOR THE DOG THE CAT THE GARDEN AN FOR ME. DOES WONDERS FOR YOUR HEALTH , MIX A TABLESPOON IN A GLASS OF WATER AN DRINK IT UP ITS LOADED WITH SILICA AN GOOD FOR YOU AN WHAT ALES YOU TOO.	1
What can I say.  Diatomaceous Earth - that's what it is.  You get a whole lot of it.	1
Wow. I am so impressed with this incredible discovery I cannot believe I just only recently stumbled upon. I ordered this for use in my garden. I personally have not used it internally, but I would do so if I needed to.  The aphids, the ants farming the aphids, the grub cutworms, etc etc were absolutely preventing any seedlings to grow!!! I was very, very frustrated because sowing a batch of seeds and watching them prosper is something I thoroughly love! The insects' doing would also allow the weakened seedlings to succumb to damping off ( I am adamant about NOT over watering)  Okay anyway, I also am a bit ashamed to admit I was so desperate that I resorted to using se7in dust- which temporarily helped tiny bit. I also tried using my dad's spray style insecticide.  Before resorting to these, I had gone and purchased neem oil, it helped on a tiny scale, the neem spray would be helpful on a way smaller problem.  **Diatomaceous earth is a white ish powder composed of fossilized 'diatoms' AKA phytoplankton. The particles are sharp like shards of glass, on a  microscopic level. When crawling insects with an exoskeleton walk through it, it compromises their exoskeleton and dehydrates their insides.  The most important,  noteworthy , UNIQUE characteristic that separates Diatomaceous Earth from all of pesticides, is the fact that it's action is MECHANICAL!! NOT chemical!!!! that, in my opinion, is why I consider this to be the most effective AND safest product for my purpose, as well as other purposes.  There is no build up of toxins, nothing builds immunity,  it's not harmful to pets or humans if walked on. I can dust my garden during the daytime and not worry about the foliage scorching like the chemical type. I don't coat the foliage very heavy though, just incase it could possibly interrupt the plant sunlight action. A little goes a LONG way.  Immediately after the first sprinkle, next day I saw improvement. This literally saved an almost dead & deformed pumpkin vine, although it is severely stunted still, it went from the vine being all dried up and chewed up and yellow grey leaves, to GREEN green green! I doubt it will actually end up producing a pumpkin,  but I still like the possibility. This has also eliminated the intense fungi damping off , blight diseases,  simply because the opportunity for the pathogenic fungi is not occuring without damaged and weakened plants.  I could have bought the non food grade label kind, however, I decided why not get the best quality, esp since price is not that high in my opinion.  I also would love to mention, I am NOT a know it all, I could be a bit wrong on a few detailed descriptions mentioned, however, I am 100 percent confident to shout from the rooftops THIS IS THE ANSWER! referring to garden and home pests even bedbugs, fleas, fungus gnat larvae. I honestly can't comment on the internal uses, but I am absolutely certain this is quality and could be the answer to anyone needing internal cleansing of parasites.  I will ALWAYS have a bag of this product in my stash, it is a staple now and I want to pass along my experience hopefully it will help! I'm not even affiliated with any company btw, and i paid regular price, I AM THIS HAPPY ABOUT IT! I get very enthusiastic about the things I'm beyond impressed with.	1
Only use Food Grade. This stuff works for bugs, you can sprinkle on window seals. Also kills fleas, can use to take internally. There are many uses for this stuff.  The only thing I thought was weird was the bag didn't have a seal and the packaging didn't look like the picture at all. It was probably purchased in bulk and just sold in smaller quantities at the cheaper price. Because when I got this a while back it was in a plastic bag with a twisty tie. I'm almost done with this bag. It's like a clear zip lock bag with a white address label that says the product name on it. It works because I've taken it and so has my pets and we are all still here!! Also it it great for mites on the face or bacteria,etc.	1
sure has worked to keep ants from making my home theirs	1
I wanted to use this for detox. When I received the package, it was not labeled as seen in the picture. There was actually no label. I didn't feel comfortable taking this so I returned it.	-1
As expected	1
Certified for organic farm use - food grade DE only. Due to mild winter, grasshoppers literally stripped my fruit trees of leaves and were eating small branches on newly planted trees. DE (food grade) use stopped the damage of trees - not before I lost 98% of new trees - but the grasshoppers now avoid the trees treated even though the DE has washed away. No explanation of that phenom. Next year I'll treat as soon as my pollinators have stopped coming to the trees. This pesticide free product will harm bees and likely other pollinators, so won't use until after flowers have dropped. DE is also great for other hard body bugs and spiders - have used in my homes for decades with 100% satisfaction for spiders, ants, silverfish and the like. Never thought of protecting trees and garden until this year. See you tube for how others use food grade DE	1
Best DE deal out there. Worked to kill off a yellow jacket nest living in my chimney!!!!!	1
Using to deter/kill numerous pests around a newly constructed country home.  I don't think it bothers the Texas Striped Bark Scorpions too much but it does dramatically reduce the other insects that attracts these scorpions.  I wish that I had spread this stuff around the slab and yard before the framing went up. It would have been a lot better to start the battle early and under the sill plate too.  I use it in the yard and attic.	1
Good stuff. Good price. Quick delivery. As advertised.	1
Great product, great price!	1
Product is great!  However, there are issues you should be aware of before buying.  First, I bought "20 lbs" of this from Amazon last spring. When I reordered it in late summer, I became aware of the fact that Amazon had only sent me 1/2 of my order the previous spring. Obviously an error on my part - and by the time I realized I'd only received 10 lbs the first time, it was too late to do anything about it. So if you have a scale, weigh what you receive, and make sure that you got what you paid for.  Second, the other reviewers are correct about a "bait and switch" going on. I wanted the product that I got the first time, from DE dot com. My order details showed that I reordered the same product. But as soon as the order shipped, my order info changed to a different brand. I was sent 20 lbs of a different product. It was not off white and chalky like the first one, but a darker color that I would describe as tan. And it was in a plastic bag only sealed with a twisty, that had a label slapped on it. But the label was not the product I ordered, and the product wasn't the same either - even though I had clicked "reorder" on my original order!  (Note: Amazon has since covered themselves by adding "packaging may vary" on the product title.  After discussions with Amazon and trying to reorder through them, the bait and switch thing kept happening. So I finally abandoned the idea, sent the wrong product back to them, and ordered directly from the manufacturer. Finally got the product that I wanted!  The concerns reviewers expressed here about consuming products that are not packaged, sealed, and labeled correctly is a valid concern. I have had this issue with other food products bought on Amazon - safety seals broken, etc.  Why is Amazon not listening to its longtime customers?  Products intended for consumption need to be properly sealed!!  I will say this - after puffing this around the foundation of my house, inside and out, I found a whole bunch of dead bugs in my cellar. Spiders, house millipedes, and many, many gnats (fungus gnats or biting midges, I think).  Ants outside also bit the dust (pun intended), and I'm hoping to have no more deer ticks in my yard next year as well.  I purchased a book on Amazon about the many other uses for DE.  If what other reviewers are saying proves to be true, this stuff has the potential to change my life in 2015 - for the better!	1
One of God's gifts with more uses than you can imagine. There are several very good You Tube videos you should watch explaining all the benefits of DE. I use a baby powder container to shake DE on my tomato plants to keep bugs away. I also add a tablespoon to my protein shake every morning.	1
have used this before for destroying pests in the yard.  i have dogs and can't use poison products.  this does the job and is pet and childproof.	1
I live in Florida: home of many bugs.  This is safe for my pets and does a decent job of convincing ants to either go away or die...	1
Works on killing ants quickly.	1
This is the good stuff! Food grade, sourced from freshwater diatoms. So useful in many ways. Glad I ordered.	1
Too expensive.  There is another vendor on here that sells you 5 pounds for the same price.	-1
the quality and timely service,I am satisfied and would gladly buy it all again!	1
It is what it says  it is.	1
I have been using Diatomaceous Earth for many years during the summer months when my house becomes home for ants, spiders and various other unmentionable insects.  I sprinkle it across door jams or an ant trail when necessary.  I have a cat and do not worry if she gets any on her paws.  It is completely non toxic.  The only thing I caution is to never use this where it can blow around.  Sprinkle it carefully and don't inhale it.  It works by drying out the insect and it will do the same to your lungs.  Use it according to package directions and you will be fine.	1
Critters just disappear after using it!	1
Waiting to see results	1
Nice size package. Good value.	1
Excellent quality.  I love not needing to worry about how much I use!  I bought this to fight off the roach and bed bugs in my house.  It seems my neighborhood has gotten very ghetto-esque in that respect and suddenly I have roaches and bedbugs.  I laid down a fine mist of this in my laundry room, kitchen corners, all along the bedroom floor, all over the metal bed frame, and let nature take it's course.  After a day or two, I saw roaches laying in random places of the laundry room and kitchen area all dried up.  Now, yes... it's not the cleanest way to handle it since it's a light dust and sticks to things.  It's cleaner than the alternative of chemicals all over, however.  Especially since I have 3 kittens/cats in the house.  I was impressed in that respect since it's food grade and the worst it can do is make them drink more water if they eat any.  It's also a good silica based dietary supplement.  I've had 2 glasses so far, and I'm starting to make it into a regimen since it helps.  Just know that this bag doesn't do a good job of holding it in once it's opened.  It comes with a plastic bag around it, and I kept that on which helps.  What I did is filled the container that came with it and closed the bag, then from there I fill the duster i purchased, along with sprinkling the carpets from the container directly.	1
Use this product as part of my pest control and find it helpful!	1
Victoria T  I Highly recommend.. Its great for personal use and around the house , garden and animals.. Great for fleas and critters and helps with flowers and plants. I will always keep it in stock Read up on it and add it to your life and diet.. Might suprise you how an old old item is coming back around.	1
I won't be without this again. Mixed with stall dust freshener it is amazing fly and odor control for my horse. If you need diatomaceous earth, this is a good buy.	1
Great buy for a product that you will need for years to come. The only sure way to take care of insect and parasite problems anywhere - house, yard, pets, humans. You really don't know how good this stuff is until you use it and see the results right before your eyes. It also takes care a internal parasites in your digestive tract as well as your pets. You wouldn't believe what we and our pets carry around with us. Best flea killer that I have ever tried. Once applied, it works from then on. It doesn't melt or evaporate, but you may need to apply yearly. Check it out!	1
I use this in the garden and in the coop.  Great product.	1
My daughter ordered this product to combat noxious pests in her garden.  She also applies this product in various areas throughout the house to combat fleas.	1
Good stuff and a ton of uses. I know I won't need to order this for a while.	1
Wow! Who knew this stuff works for keeping away insects such as ants and roaches!	1
My animals thrive on, but don't crave for it because they can't smell it or taste it. Keeps their tummies free of internal parasites and my plants like it too! Has too many good uses to put here. Do a search online and find all its benefits.	1
Great product and really takes out the fleas.  However, 50 is a lot more of this stuff than I realized as it goes a long way.  Also you should use a dust mask when sweeping it into the carpet as it really dusts up.	1
So glad I found this.  We live in an area that doesn't have this available, anywhere.  It comes in a huge paper bag, which is delivered in a huge box.  The shaker thingy is not important for us since we have other items on hand that we can use.  Diatomaceous earth is non-toxic and versatile:  add it to livestock/chicken feed, use it for worming cats and dogs, dust it into their fur for flea control.  Food grade is not--contrary to popular belief--dangerous to inhale.  Only the pool grade stuff is, not this.  So don't freak out if a little gets onto your skin or into the air you breathe; it's a fine powder so it does go everywhere if you're not careful.  For crops it's an absolute Godsend.  We sprinkle it around the herb beds, beans, tomatoes, squash, peas and other plants that are important to us.  The dust makes exo-skeleton insects die while leaving your plants completely unharmed.  Ants!  I have destroyed numerous ant colonies by sprinkling this over their holes, raking it a little, then waiting a day.	1
good stuff.	1
I have actually sprinkled this product over my entire front and back yards, and especially around the perimeter of my house. I have NO roaches, fire ants, beetles, termites, fleas, mites, silverfish, earwigs, etc. . . anywhere, but I did notice two small dead lizards (inconclusive dried out bodies).  NO dead birds or harmful effects on my dogs or me (I was careful not to breathe the dust, as that is harmful).  I have actually eaten small amounts of this product with no ill effects. AND even though it has rained considerably since I purchased and spread out this product, it had remained on the ground (yet effective and on guard) and is not very noticeable at all.	1
Great product,takes a couple of dry days to work well on lawn but will do the trick.	1
works well	1
How can you not like Diatomaceous Earth?  Works well with ants and other insects.  Great for the soil.  With this size, this will last me for a long time.  I use it for plant starts as well.  Well worth the price.	1
I use this most everyday,  for my dogs and cat too.	1
Just started this as a wormer for my horses.  I will know if it is working after 3 or 4 months and fecal testing.	1
great price. have used this for years	1
Good stuff.	1
We use this for fleas. Add it under furniture and fleas die off. but in the summer months our neighbors have fleas and the fleas wash over to our yard. It helps in the yard but washes away. So if you get fleas in the summer but not the winter, blame the neighbors.	1
This is one of my favorite things I use one the farm.	1
Love this stuff, use it in the garden, on the animals, and occasionally in a shake.	1
I dust the coop with this after cleaning it out & just before I add fresh shavings.  I add it to the chickens 'dust bath' area, and very, very lightly to their feed.  Very good at keeping pests at bay.	1
I put it in the dust bath for the chickens.  It is food grade.	1
I absolutely LOVE this stuff.  I use it to rid my home of pests like dust mites, ants, cockroaches and more.  Sprinkling some behind the shelves in my garage has eliminated cockroaches that find their way into the garage.  Sprinkling it liberally around the perimeter of my house about twice a year keeps ants from getting inside.  For dust mites, I sprinkle it into the carpet and work it in, then let it remain for a week before vacuuming.  This has helped my allergies immensely, and the allergies of my granddaughter as well.  Note that this stuff is millions of years old, and never goes bad.  It's totally nontoxic to animals, birds, and fish; such as humans, children, pets.  Exterminators don't like this stuff because it works so well and is so inexpensive, safe, and easy to use.  Oh, I almost forgot to mention...  I sprinkled it in my attic to kill off an infestation of silverfish which were eating the paper backing on the insulation there.	1
Great product. Really stops those cutworms, that's why I got it.	1
all these people complaining obviously have no clue as to what it's for or how it's to be used.  use a sifter or strainer to get a thin layer.  read about it to know how much to put in your animals feed to prevent fleas and other parasites.  i used it in my garden, the deer feed, for us, etc.  i run an organic gardening blog and have lots of experience with this stuff.  you can call the company with questions.  also, if it rains and you have a thin layer, you'll have to put it on again.  it prevents ants from coming inside, etc.  i could go on and on and i've been buying it for years. sent 50 lbs to my mom who swears by it as well.  those of you who  are complaining about the mess etc aren't using it properly.  a little goes a long way.  hang it in a burlap bag and let your livestock rub against it to de-flea themselves.  everything takes time. it kills any bug that gets into it by drying up their exoskeleton.  i only use organic stuff  and when we first bought our land, my dogs and cats got deer ticks. once i started spreading a thin layer of DE and putting in the feed of everything, ticks began to disappear. now we haven't seen any, even after 21 inches of rain. i just got out my sifter and spread it again.  easy fix if you're not gonna freak out by having to wait a few weeks to see results or freak out because there is white powder on your bushes, etc.  for more accurate info, read this page and read it well.  http://wolfcreekranch1.tripod.com/defaq.html	1
Perfect to use around house for critters and I use it in my vegetable garden for those pesky critters.	1
good product	1
Worked well I think I order too large of bag	1
This stuff is great! Kills bugs and you can use it around birds, pets, food and kids! I highly recommend rather than using the poison!	1
I bought this to kill bugs on my ranch and so when I received it and saw "anti-caking agent' printed on the bag, I was worried I got the wrong kind. Perusing the mfr website, there is verbiage to suggest that they don't label it as an insecticide because of all the federal regulations that would come with carrying that label. I then emailed the company and they said it indeed is effective at killing bugs and that a light dusting is all that is needed.  Being the skeptical type, I wanted to see for myself. I got 2 small tupperware boxes. I put a small amount of this DE inside one. Just enough to dust the inside and form a small mound the size of a BB in one corner. I then collected some ants by letting them crawl on a stick and tapping it on the tupperware to drop them inside. I did this to both boxes so that there were ~ 10 ants in each.  Almost immediately you saw a difference. I was expecting that it would take much longer. After ~ 1 minute, the ants in the DE box were noticeably less mobile. All the ants were moving, but slowly and none climbed the walls. In the clean box all ants were rapidly scurrying all over, on the walls and the lid. After 4 hrs, ~30% of the ants in the DE box had died and curled up. The ones alive were moving slowly still. After 10 hrs they all were dead and curled up. In the clean box after 10 hrs, 80% were alive and well. A couple died, not sure why.  Bottom line: This is a great non toxic solution to your bug problem. It works on just about all bugs. Is so safe you can eat it (just try to avoid inhaling it). Plus if you spray it in crevices, it lasts forever unlike chemicals.  Tip: A great way to apply it is to put it in a clear ketchup bottle. Walmart has them for $1. I put a clear hose on the nozzle to act as an extended precision applicator. It works great. Shake the bottle to create a cloud, squeeze it for light dusting. Turn it upside down for heavy applications.  UPDATE:  Tried it on silverfish by putting them in a container with the DE, didn't seem to have any effect as it lived for over a week.  Was very effective on ants though.	1
thanks	1
THIS IS FOOD GRADE FOR HUMAN DETOXIFICATION AS WELL AS FOR MY ANIMALS THANKS I'LL BE ORDERING AGAIN SOON. SMOOTHIES!!	1
I have use the product for years and it has many natural uses. It is safe and is very effective.	1
This stuff kills anything that walks on it, I mean bugs and that makes me happy because I live in Florida the Capital for all kinds of bugs.  I also feed it to my dog and I take a tablespoon in the morning in my smoothie or juice.  I might have more to tell you about this product after I have taken it for a longer time.	1
I read all the reviews on this product before my purchase, and some of them stated "it does not work", others said it took too long and their whole house was white. My response to all of them is: Be patient, if you have dogs with fleas, it took them awhile to multiply, and they are multiplying every minute, and it's going to take a long time to really get rid of them. Sure, the pesticide full pills, injections, rub-ons work faster, but they also have a great potential of shortening your dogs lives, or making them very sick. So going naturally is soooo much better for your pets. Some of these comments show that people are not using this product correctly. Here's the way I did it! I put about a 6 to 8 inch wide strip (about as thick as a piece of paper)of this diatamaceous earth around every wall in every room in the house, so that those fleas that were hiding behind furniture or other things counld not easily get away from the wall, moved all of the furniture in the house and treated the floor under the furniture, then moved it back over the powder, so we would not walk in it or even see it. Then I treated the places where our dogs usually are, their beds, our beds (our Yorkies sleep with us) by putting this product under, over, and on their bedding and ours. Each layer of bedding, mattress, mattress cover, bottom sheet, top sheet, blanket, pillow inside it's case, and outside. Every evening I would add a little powder to the beds and the dogs beds. That's all! So our house was not covered in white powder. Every 2nd day I would vacuum the floor, where there was no powder only,  and leave the original powder in place. After 4 days, we noticed the dogs were not scratching as much, and after a week and a half, they were not scratching at all. But we left the powder in place until the end of the third week. Vacuumed it all up, and Walla, flea free. Remember, this powder will kill fleas, but only the live ones, not the eggs or the Larvae, so you have to keep working on it until all the eggs have hatched, and the fleas starting their new life are dead, then wait longer, in case some of the fleas managed to lay more eggs before they died. For every flea you see, 20 more are still unseen, so be patient, wait for this to work, and don't just put it on everything in the house unless you want to have a white house.	1
Wow, I'm convinced. I had a raised planter bed infested with ants and gnats. I watered and then laid down the diatomaceous earth and the infestation was clear the next day. Incredible results. Next I ordered a "pest pistol" that allows you to spray a fine misting on your dog and the results were almost as fast. It took a couple of days but the fleas dissappeared. A little goes a long way and this is by far the best deal you'll find, delivered for $4. You've got to keep this product dry or it's no good.	1
This is a great product!! It has so many uses the great part is that it works and is eco friendly. My order was delivered on time in perfect condition. Will reorder more when this bag runs out.	1
This is a good cover for the Q100 grill.  The vinyl is heavy grade and has a drawstring around the bottom to clamp it to the grill body.  I think the fit could be a little better as I cannot get a tight closure around my grill. But, it does what it's supposed to, stays in place in moderate winds, is easily put on taken off, and keeps most of the assorted wind blown trash out of the grill.  And, for $6 you can't beat the price.	1
This review will be short: if you own a Baby Q, you need this cover.  It is ample in size and it seems to be fairly heavy duty.  I have used this cover for about 8 months and I am completely satisfied with it.  It is sturdy and it keeps the smells of the grill contained when the grill is being stored.  Well worth the investment.	1
This is a high-quality, durable cover that fits nicely over the Baby Q. An essential product if you own a Baby Q.	1
Great Cover, fits well, covers the entire Grill. Has cord to keep it snug on the Grill.	1
I don't like sticking my arms into frigid water in early spring to pull out a filter unit for cleaning. This makes the job of filter maintenance so much easier. I also had a UV version. Easy to set up and work with. Highly recommended!	1
I use this external filter on a very small fish (300 gal) fish pond. It is a mechanical filter with bio media in one side. It does a very nice job keeping the pond clean when used with a UV clarifier.	1
If you want a cheap filter for your small pond then this is your guy.  Only drawback is the lack of hosing which is more expensive then you might think.  Also remember that it must be mounted above the waterline as you need gravity for the outflow.  And don't forget that your pump has to pump the water up to that spot so be sure it can handle it.	1
We purchased two of these filters and accompanying bubblers when they were on sale.  There was no way we could find them at a store for the price we paid, even with shipping.  We installed both of them in our pond at different levels, and both are functioning well.  Good buy!	1
I've been using this clock/thermometer for several months without any problem at all. It's very handy to know the absolutely correct time without ever having to set the clock, and to know the temperature outside before I even get out of bed.  I thought I might have problems because the clock/display unit is on my bedside table, while the ideal location for the outdoor temperature sensor is about 80 feet away at the other end of the house, with five outside walls between, but the signal came through right away. Occasionally (once a week or so) I'll look and the outside temperature is blank, but it always recovers in a few minutes.  Other people have complained about not receiving the atomic clock signal from Colorado in the Northeast, but I'm in Rochester NY and it comes through fine here.  I only use the alarm to wake me up from naps, and it's fine for that. If this were my primary alarm clock I'd need a snooze button, which this doesn't have.  I'm still on the original batteries (2 AAs in the outside sensor, 2 AAAs in the clock), even through the winter when battery performance should have been at its worst.  Based on reviews of other Oregon Scientific products with similar functions, I half expected this to be an unreliable piece of junk, but so far I couldn't be happier.	1
I have a few different types of these.  For the price, go for this one.  Works fine.	1
very nice pump, very pleased with output for my pond, a little powerful but works great	1
Love these pumps! They last a long time, and are energy efficient. They don't clog easily and are forgiving of plant material; strong enough to just grind up much of it and spit it out without damaging parts. (yes I know one shouldn't have that situation, however with storms, trees, rummaging Koy, and caretakers who refuse to touch pond water when I'm gone, debris happens)...And this pump will keep on sucking, doing its best to maintain water flow! I will say though, don't bother trying to replace the impeller if that starts wearing; they are expensive, hard to get out (hefty magnet!!) and mine broke instanly upon installation. I think they may be making a slightly less sturdy impeller; my first Pondmaster lasted nearly seven years with continuous use/abuse.   I also use this unit to drain my pond quickly when I need to do a water change (I rigged a harness around it with zip ties and rope). I use the harness in the winter to suspend the pump from a log - so I can retrieve it easier if ice forms; wish it had a handle molded into it).  One "feature" I've wondered about is the female threaded inlet, and the manufacturer says "inline use" so I tried to attach a short hose to it to reach into the deepest part of the pond, but it absolutely would not suck water?   Overall, still an excellent, American made pump! Oh, and if you have a question or problem - there is a REAL PERSON, and NICE, who will answer the phone!! (sorry manufacturer if this increases calls,  but I glow with joy at this rare service)!!!	1
I bought this product in June of 2015. I turned it off in December and started it back in April of 2016. It quit working in September 2016. It sells with a three year warranty. After only 10 months of operation, the impellar broke  rendering it useless. Warranty is also useless as they would not fix or repair it.	-1
Exactly ONE WEEK after the return period ended this $250 pump trips the breaker - it is internally shorted.  This is the third 2400 gph pump of this style and all three have shorted/tripped the breaker after light-duty usage.  Up to 1800 gph I'd recommend without hesitation.  But the 2400 gph models are just not reliable enough to recommend.	-1
Super pump high volume	1
Works great	1
Pump works as described and is quite powerful. I could not get it run by just filling hose with water. I put my house  hose in and turned on the water while it was running. After about 3 minutes, the pump kicked in and pumps water through a skimmer and 26 feet, through an ultraviolet filter and up to a 3 foot water fall. It looks awesome as water pours heartily down.	1
Have been using Pondmaster/Danner pumps for years without single problem.	1
Probably the best designed pond-pump around, with one moving part!  Mine stopped working after being in the pond 6 yrs.  I bought new pump, then decided to replace the armature on the old one (easy to do)...it now it works fine, so I have a backup.	1
Great pump, when it clogs, we just clean and it keeps on ticking...lol  Made well and will last a long time if taken care of.	1
I have used Pondmaster 1800 they are easy to clean and to repair.  One main reason is because the impeller turns on the shaft.  There is a major problem with the Pondmaster pump 2400 impeller because the shaft is part of the impeller.  Since the pump is powerful it breaks the bottom part of the shaft. You have to replace the impeller. I only had this pump working three days  The end results is the impeller is scored and so is the walls of the pump that the impeller fits into. Thank God! I always keep extra impellers. I would change the design of the impeller and have it rotate on the shaft.	-1
This baby really puts out. Had to creat head pressure in aquaponic system because system could not handle output. Better to have too much than not enough. Specs check out and others' feedback.	1
Great pump. Moves a lot of water for its size.	1
With the inlet on top, there is less maintenance as do the pumps with the inlet on the bottom. Only worry is that it is a magnetic pump.	1
We've used these for years in the AP system. It is always good policy to have a spare impeller and cover in case it eats something. There are newer ones that are more frugal in their power usage I believe, but these are way better than the mechanical pumps.	1
I'm on my third one of these pumps in five years. I start my waterfall up in late April and shut it down around Halloween.  The pump over-winters in my heated laundry room. All three pumps have failed during their second summer.  The third and current pump just went Tango Uniform this week (Mid June 2012).  In other words, this means that I get about 9 months of duty time out of the pump before a failure that costs me one-third of the price of a new one.  The failure is always the same, the bottom (PLASTIC!) shaft on the impeller shears off, which releases the high-RPM magnet to rattle around inside the windings. In two of my three failures, including the most recent one (three days ago), the impeller trashed the (PLASTIC!) upper bushing mount in the cover. It had *less* than nine months duty time.  The company is virtually impossible to contact, and when you do manage to get someone (via email), they are dismissive, rude, and (duh!) unhelpful.  My plan is fix this pump, then purchase a much less expensive 2000gph pump that has a three-year unconditional warranty.  06/25/2012:  This just in:  Today I received the repair parts for the PM24 pump: $50 for the impeller (outrageous), $13 (outrageous) for the cover, and TWENTY DOLLARS in shipping costs from New York to Virginia (unconscionable).  06/25/2012: Discovered new impeller was missing the lower bushing.  Luckily the old one is serviceable.	-1
I have e-mailed this co. 3 times over 2 weeks for teck help .I have heard nothing . WORST service ever !	-1
This gadget does what I wanted it to do. It's the replacement for an older thermometer/clock that was starting to misbehave. It was a bit of a nusance to set up. It took a reset of the main unit to do its "thing." However, it's been perfect ever since. The remote functions are great! The weather forecaster is as funky as this kind of gadget tends to be.  I heartily recommend this gadget for the gadget hound.	1
I have now bought 4 of these. I started by buying one for my husband who loves checking weather reports. He now has his own weather station and I have since bought an extra sensor so he can check the temperatures in other areas.  My dad saw it and became intrigued, so I bought him one and now have ordered two more for future gifts.  Great gift for anyone interested in the weather, temperatures in different areas of your house, yard, RV, etc. Easy to use too!	1
My unit often fails to receive any signal at all from remote units (even when they are a few inches away, and with fresh batteries in everything) or from the atomic clock. Occasionally it works as advertised. Buyer beware....	-1
I love these things as they tell you the out side Temp and pressure. You can be your own weatherman.	1
Very easy to set-up. The main unit uses 3 AA batteries, the sensor uses 2 AAA batteries. Buy them before your station arrives. For some reason, rechargeable batteries are NOT recommended. Maybe they get too hot, I have no clue.  We put the remote sensor on our porch picnic table. The LCD display let's you know how hot it really is out there!  The main unit can sit or hang anywhere. They include a nice table stand, or you can hang it from the wall.  The Atomic Clock normally updates sometime in the middle of the night. Keep your main unit close to a window and it should update fine.  The unit can also "trend" the humidity and barometer, giving you and accurate forecast. It's never been wrong when it says Rain. Grab your umbrella and be dry!  This is a nifty unit, easy to set-up, and a decent price.	1
I use it at home and also on trips in my motorhome. I keep it by my bed and check it every morning after wakening and before going outside. Recommend very highly,	1
This unit works well and the remote temp seems accurate compared to local condition reports. The forecast function is a silly gimmick. I don't know what others have experienced when they say the clock does not update to DST.. mine does here in PA. Works like any other atomic clock. Recommended.	1
This was a great purchase, I use it for correct weather and also my alarm clock, very easy to use.	1
Bought this for my husband.  We both enjoy it so much it has become our standard housewarming gift.  Gave it for new baby so they can check the temp in the baby's room without disturbing the baby.	1
I bought these for Christmas presents; everyone was quite happy.  I have had one for several years and use it daily/  Obviously I am fond of it!  Batteries last for years!  Another unit by Sharp needs batteries 2-3 times a year.  Even the Minnesota winters can't kill the batteries!	1
Great guy gift for Christmas or birthdays. Nice remote transmitter of outside temperature.  Nice size, very large numbers.	1
I purchased this unit to track the weather indoors and out.  It does this well, although I did have some reception issues at first, that was resolved by moving the receiver a few inches.  After I had this for a few months my wife wanted to be able to see what was the temperature in our baby's room.  So without having to run any wires or buy a new main remote sensing thermometer, I purchased another remote sensor.  With one in my son's room and the one that comes with this main unit, I've got all the information I wanted.  While this unit seems to have the most features for the price, there are a few "bugs" in the system.  Getting the atomic clock to receive took a bit of effort, but it does eventually work in San Diego.  The weather predictor's success has been mixed, but mostly acceptable.  The appearance of the base unit is not inspiring.  The range on the remote unit doesn't appear quite as far as stated.  That being said, it's operating reliably at 35' and through a wall, the price is great, and the expandability is nice.  Weather prediction has over a 50% success rate, and it doesn't stand out like a sore thumb.	1
Easy to read great item	1
great quality, looks good in the garden. easy to read	1
This is definitely the world's coolest rain gauge.  I have owned it for at least 6 years.  It is easy to read from inside.  The only maintenance I do is bring it in during the winter. The blue tube finally lost it's buoyancy recently.  A replacement tube took 2 min to order on Amazon and ships for free.  I have bought this as a gift for several people and they all love it, too.	1
i just thought we weren't getting rain, knew we got a lot last night and found out that the seam on the bottom leaks it showed maybe 1/32 of an inch.  i had this a couple of years now.  so disappointed.  i really liked it  back to the drawing board.	-1
Works good and looks nice.  It rains a pop ups.  Very simple to use.  I was tired of the glass rain gauge always breaking.	1
I love this because it stands above vegetation in my flower garden, and because I can read it as a glance.  It's actually my second; the first, which served me well for years, apparently got lost when I had some landscaping done.  I hope I don't lose this one.	1
my husband has broken every rain gauge he has ever had. this one is fantastic. very sturdy and east to read. it truly is the coolest rain gauge	1
Ok, ok, copper is expensive, and noncorrosive to the general weather and the elements,  Good points.  But this is a curly copper holder, with a copper tube that has a weighted plastic tube in it.  I bought this as a gife, but from what I have seen, it is too pricey fro what you get.	1
This looks just as pictured, has a sweet pleasant sound, looks cool alongside my Japanese carp windsocks. Highly recommended.	1
I have received many admiring comments, and love the beautiful sound!	1
very nice	1
Like this chime alot, very sturdy, well made, just needs high wind for sound	1
Gotta love it, this is my second one.  the customers just think they need it too.	1
Pretty, but doesn't catch much wind. Therefore, not much sound. Better as decoration.	1
I bought this through my hubbys account. I love this it is a great addition to my other wind chimes on my balcony. Don't catch the wind and chime as much as the others but is very whimsical.	1
Makes a nice addition to our nautical themed gardens and it makes a unique sound compared to other wind chimes; a very gentle, soft sound but does require a pretty stiff breeze to operate. The color of finish was nice when it arrived but is after only several months starting to rust so you may want to spray with a sealer when you first receive it; wished I had.	1
This walkway is very beautiful. It's sturdy and showed up on time. I'm planning to order a second one. I would recommend this product.	1
Just as was written. We love it.	1
nice ring to it	1
So  nice, I love it..	1
Cool lil fishie that provides ballast to my bird feeder	1
Bought for a muddy area... at least in spring... that leads from side of yard into the wooded area behind my house.  It provided a path to keep less wet... and eventually sunk into the mid to where it is covered with dirt.  It stills provides stability to the path and seems to be together even into the ground.  I may put a more firm footbridge using treated lumber, but this served its purpose for me.  I can't see it being a solution for more than a couple of years.	1
Nice walkway for a beach house	1
very cute... doen't really make any noise but looks good... ;-)	1
Very unique wind chime, picture is accurate. I left mine outside all summer and fall in the elements and it still looks great, nothing broke, chipped or rusted. The only reason I am giving this 4 stars and not 5 is that since it is pretty heavy it takes a good first of wind for it to chime. I would like to hear it a little more, but it sounds great when it chimes.	1
Nice heavy	1
love it it was a great product	1
It's a  gift for my fishing son.  He'll laugh!  Then he'll hang it.	1
Very cool	1
The wood is rustic so you need to factor that in when you order the walk.  The walk really helped pull our side yard together.  We made several changes and the walk helped make everything standout and look put together.	1
Just what I needed.  Ordered 2 more.  For those who want to know if it curves, the answer is yes!	1
the description says: *fully assembled with flexible nylon cord* well, this is a simple string stapled to the bottom of the slabs... extremely fragile... and visually horrible. the finish of the wood could not be less appealing with sharp borders (no sanding) or rounding of the borders, neither the cuts that show old / aged faces of the wood while in storage.	-1
Love the product but have not yet installed it. Great quality!	1
these are beautiful chimes These were perfect for the person that received them	1
Can help create a semi formal garden.	1
these are easy and look great!	1
Very good product1 Kurt E.	1
Using under outdoor rug to improve drainage as on the lawn.  I did have a little problem with splinters, but overall working well.	1
These were great.  The sound was relaxing and calm and the color was beautiful and had a weathered look.  I was very pleased with my purchase.	1
Very nice...	1
Awesome. Not very chimy, but looks great!	1
I love it. Sounds great, looks great on the front porch. Reasonably priced.  Now how do I keep it from being stolen?	1
Very heavy and solid, a real conversation piece.  It does make a nice sound in wind but if you are looking for a real wind chime you might want to purchase a Woodstock chime instead of this one.  The colour is brass (it is not made of brass) with a lovely teal green patina.	1
Nice light chimes and great conversation piece!	1
Cool metal chime for the price	1
looks great holding up will arrived on time	1
Haven't put them out yet.  They have to be finished and weathersealed since we have carpenter bees and they would love to chew through these.  I plan on getting a few more to make a natural deck.	1
This is absolutely adorable! It looks exactly as it does in the picture and is made better than I expected. The color is great and it makes a very nice classic wind chime sound. I can't wait to hang it out side of my French doors! Very nice product.	1
Great product for the price	1
This thing is cute! Sure it takes a good gust to make it chime, but it's well made and a nice size.	1
I love simple effective solutions like this.  Laid it over my gravel and it's perfect.	1
These are lovely. They are shorter than you see in your mind's eye, so I bought 4. (I think they came in sets of 2.) You need the metal pins to keep them in place. The cedar is strong but looks delicate; the connecting "rope" (which runs through drilled holes) is weather-proof. I use them so I can carry things on my hand truck from the garage to the shed. WELL! My helpful neighbor shredded - tore, twisted, cut! - 2 of them with his regular lawn mower. And so he turned around and ran over it again, and tore off another plank! You cannot replace individual planks because the rope runs through. You can't buy cedar planks that size here, anyway. But the price is decent, and so I'll probably get another set. The cons are they really show the mud and dirt, but I think a hose may wash them off. Or using a protective coating of some kind of wood protectant may be advised. And they are narrower than they appear in the photo. They still do a GREAT job of keeping me from dragging dirt into the house, and the hand truck fits right on them. My lawn is very bumpy, but it fits just fine. I love them! The neighbor is fired! (I use a small push ion-battery-powered mower, it rides low, and it's blade is not so powerful.) I'm not sure why his gas guzzler tore them up this year and not last year ... But we have had an extremely rainy season.	1
The walkway is flexible and exactly as expected.  It is more flexible than another purchased a few years ago, and fits perfectly in the area where it was needed.	1
Was a gift my dad had to do a small repair with wire but they liked it	1
This is a neat wind chime.  A little on the cheep side of quality materials it's made of but over all it sounds & looks nice	1
I am so pleased with this walkway. I have it lying over the mulch in my patio area and leading to the gate which opens onto my front yard. It looks just perfect and I am so pleased I bought it. It came a day early too, what a bonus.	1
Love it! I cannot say enough about this product. I've bought several for my garden and use them in areas that need a path!	1
I used 5 of these cedar walkways, giving me a whole plank look along the side of my house. They look great. Sturdy to walk on, on a daily basis. I would highly recommend this walkway!  Although, 4 stars, since I had to paint them in order to protect them. They come untreated, with cedar wood, I'm sure they'd rot quickly. 4 stars for the extra work...  UPDATE 10/23/15 They held up great after another season. This year they were in full sun all day. They are a noce walkway	1
Nice addition to my collection. Great looking verdigris treated steel, nice chimes when the wind hits it. And the coolness factor is a plus.	1
This was just the kind of conversation piece our boathouse needed. Too cute!	1
Hanging in my man cave with assorted fishing lures.	1
Kinda small but very nice. It takes a good wind to hear it chime.	1
Very cute and puts out a nice light sound when the wind is blowing.	1
Just cut pieces of wood with twine stapled to the backs to hold them together.  Didn't even smooth the edges so it looks unfinished.  Bad purchase.	-1
This is not big enough for an adult to  walk on, period. It may be nice for a walkway leading to a small child's outdoor playhouse, but it is to narrow for an adult.	-1
The color is somewhat more blue than the picture here.  The chime seems made fairly well, I do wonder about the longevity of the nylon cord for the 'hanger' but I think it can be easily remedied with a metal hook or some other replacement when it becomes necessary.  The sound is quiet and soft, which is what I needed - our property lost its wind breaks due to a tornado a couple of years ago, so most metal chimes get destroyed quickly or make so much clanging noise they aren't pleasant to hear, you can't even talk over them. :(  I think this particular chime will hold up to the wind and not be overwhelmingly noisy.  Will be buying another for my dad's Pimp My Back Porch project.  Update: It's finally lost enough of it's tail and gotten rusty enough it's time to get a new one!  Will be ordering again. Contrary to a lot of reviews, it does NOT take a lot of wind at all for this to chime.  The nylon cord was the first thing to go - and I just used a black zip tie when it finally came apart.	1
The walkway is a very nice construction and looks great. Seems like good quality, but time will tell. Holding up well in the rain so far.	1
I ordered three of them at different times. They are so easy to install and instantly look beautiful. Hopefully, they will wear well.	1
Love everything about this great chime, color, texture , sound and all. Perfect length as well. For the price, a nice little peice of yard art.	1
I have five of these as my home is my cabin away from my real cabin.  These Brass chimes are well built and look very nice however it really takes a good wind to make them chime.	-1
Plant spikes have been around for just about as long as house plants have.  They are one of the oldest ways of fertilizing potted plants as there is going. (Someone with roots in their blood once told me that solid fertilizer preceded the liquid variety by quite a respectable amount of time.  The liquid variety being easier, but not necessarily better).  A lot of folks don't seem to use them anymore since liquid fertilizers mixed with your regular watering are so much easier.  My own experience with both is that the solid, slow dissolving spikes last longer, feed the plant the nutrients more efficiently over the longer amount of time, and genuinely do a better job of giving your plants the extra boost of good stuff all house plants can use. I am not a horticulturist and certainly do not claim to know this is a fact over a reasonable theory.  What I do know is I have some of the biggest, healthiest house plants I have witnessed among my many peers that dabble in the home spun gardening trade as well.  I stopped using liquid fertilizers years ago and have had excellent results with these spikes.  You thumb them down just under the surface every couple of months and watch your house plants love you for it.  I highly recommend the Jobe fertilizer spikes, and, I also recommend that if you can't or don't care to locate them locally, that you buy them in bulk here on Amazon and make the shipping worth it.  Made them part of a bundle package with something else and they ship for free at the time of this writing.  Try them for just one or two of your plants and see if they don't make you smile...	1
Had my doubts, but no more. This device keeps rabbits out of the yard and works as advertised. I would recommend anytime.	1
I bought a few of these units to scare away racoons from my pond. They suck! The racoons are laughing at me for wasting my hard earned cash!  I wish I would have spent the money on beer so I could at least be drunk when the racoons are killling my exspensive Koi!	-1
Houseplants have turned healthy and deep green.	1
I used these for out indoor plants to keep them alive and healthy...and I think it is working.	1
Excellent item. Repeat customer.	1
My plants have been erect for a month on this crack.	1
lOVE!	1
A++++++	1
Simple and easy to use on my house plants - great product!	1
excellent, easy to us,...	1
Work great	1
I used 1-3 sticks per each of my house plant, depending on the size of the pot). My cats were curious about the sticks and I had a hard time getting them away from them. So, eventually I had to push the stick all the way into the soil to prevent my cats from  digging and licking them. I have not noticed the changes in my plants' growth yet, but I have a high hope since the other Job's fertilizer worked so well. I guess it is too early to write a review, but I gave them 5 stars for ease of use and affordable price.	1
These fertilizer sticks absolutely send my plants into overdrive and produce so much new growth. My go-to fertilizer, and one box lasts so long! Definitely recommend these.	1
I am using this to keep my roommates dog off the couch. He is sneaky, After catching him by leaving and going around the back way to catch him, he knows he is not supposed to be there. Everytime I come home to sit down there is drule and hair everywhere. After leaving the animal away on the coffee table facing the couch, he will go nowhere near it. I have tried stay away sprays and physical blocks but he always got around them. This is a much better solution.	1
I ordered them with another item, so it took a while. While waiting, the local store got their spring stock in and my wife picked some up. Now we have stakes to last for years.	1
These spikes seem to really help my large house plants	1
Good product	1
Not sure if they are to blame but I water my plants and give them artificial light but when I fed them these,,, they died	-1
Just assume they are working.  Hope so anyway. Sure a lot easier than using the usual fertilizer.	1
These are very strong fertilizer spikes. I initially bought these when they were two dollars a pack and they were worth it.  You get fifty spikes! That may sound like a lot, but if you have a lot of plants, this can be used up relatively quickly. There are instructions on the back that tell you how many to use in each pot, depending on how big the planter is. For your reference:  4", two spikes  6", three spikes  8", four spikes  10", five spikes  12", six spikes  I wouldn't put these in terrariums as you want those plants to stay tiny for a long time.  It's suggested to use new spikes every two months. As a gardener, I advise to use them during your plants' growing season. These are very strong spikes, and will give your plants the nutrients they need to grow big and fast. Recommended.	1
Simplest way to feed the plants...  no muss, no fuss, no burnt foliage.  I will continue to use these.	1
Good fertilizer	1
Not sure if this has made a difference on any of my plants...	-1
These really do make a huge difference. Easy to use. I just stick them in the soils. Usually 2-3 per plant (1 for the little ones). I only do it in the spring and the plants that have had this are markedly healthier. I think I'll keep using them. Great deal on Amazon.	1
As far as I can tell it may be working. No significant change in my plants.	1
I always used liquid fertilizer, but tried these on a few plants as a test. Compared to the plants without and just on the liquid, the plants with the spikes had amazing boost in growth and color.	1
Happy plants, happy me!	1
I love these handy fertilizer sticks	1
Convenient! If you follow the instructions to the letter, these work well... I personally think they ell you to use 10% more per plant, and maybe 20% too often, but I could be wrong.  Overdoing it can cause as many issues as none at all!	1
This is the simplest way to keep my houseplants healthy and blooming. I love the ease of using it! I think I will order more with the extra special pricing with this packaging.	1
Maybe cats are very light on their feet, but Animal Away does nothing to keep them away from my fish pond area. The warning light doesn't even go on when the cats enter the "protected" area and one of them weights 22lbs. The only time I've seen the device activate is when I step into the area. Since I don't stay up all night watching for raccoons, I don't know if it keeps them away, but I doubt it does. I would say this product is a waste of money unless you're using it to scare off something bigger than a 22lb. cat.	-1
Great deal for the price. Plants like them.	1
My wife witnessed one of the neighbor's cats walk into the coverage area. The cat stopped and shrieked (as cats do) and RAN through the rest of the yard. One of the other cats saw this, became frightened, and ran back to the safety of the neighbors house. The device seems to work, but since the audio frequency is beyond human perception, I don't really know. I paid about $45 for this at a hardware store. I'm glad Amazon has it cheaper. If this works, even for a limited time, I'll be pleased.	1
My plants love it	1
I use these regularly, especially on big ol indoor potted plants that otherwise require a lot of fertilizer.  These are inexpensive enough to not feel crazy using the proper suggested amount on each pot.  My plants are all happy, and while I don't know if this is the magic bullet, it certainly is a key ingredient.	1
nice	1
Been using this for awhile on all kinds of house plants and it does wonders. Can't beat the price. Don't worry about overpriced fertilizers dedicated to certain plant types. This is all you need.	1
So far happy.  Testing them out.  Walmart currently has same item 0.97	1
Order and use these every three months. Easy to use.	1
functional	1
Easy to use. No mess.	1
feeds and fertilizes indoor plants.	1
Haven't tried them yet but they look good.	1
Good. .	1
does as says	1
This fertilizer seems to make my plants happy.  They are all growing beautifully.  These spikes are so easy to use.	1
You honestly can not go wrong with Jobe's products.  The funny thing is the dogs love the smell and taste of it and I find them standing on the plants sometimes.  Dumb dogs!!  I have gotten some great yields out of the product with high flowers and fruiting.	1
house plants love them!	1
These are very handy to have and easy to use.	1
Great price (add on) and works good for my indoor plants	1
I decided to use this on one of my houseplants and was impressed.  I decided to put about half of the spikes into the soil around 5" from my house plant.  After three days I didn't see anything different.  On the fourth day I noticed something.  A second plant was coming out of the soil.  The second plan continued to grow for about a month.  The flower were amazing and I decided to prune and cut one off to put in a vase.  As soon as I cut it off I heard a "ouch" sound come from the soil.  I must have been seeing things.  I put on my glasses and looked for carefully and didn't see anything unusual.  The next day the plant wasn't in the same place.  At first I thought that my house cleaner moved the plant to another location.  It could have been the case.  I didn't really think much of it and then went to water the plant the next day and one of the plants looked all shriveled.  So, me and my not-so-much green thumb decided to clear away the shriveled plant.  As I reached down to prune the plant one of the leaves sliced against my arm.  I looked down and saw a small cut and a little bit of blood.  I went to the medicine closet and found a Band-Aid and put it on.  I went back to the plant and it was gone.  What?  Where did it go?  When I turned around I felt something grab onto my ankles.  Oh no ...  I looked around and the plant was on the ground.  The stem was slowly climbing my legs and increasing it's pressure.  My leg went numb.  I tried to get away when all of a sudden I fell to the ground.  Just when I turned my head I saw the plant.  It started to move out of the pot and started to walk on it's roots towards me.  I couldn't get up and felt helpless.  I screamed.  I tried to move my arms but they were trapped by the plant's lengthly vines.  I had no options.  This was going to be my last breath.  I was breathing so heavy and sweat was pouring our of my pores.  The plant attached itself to my face like an octopus.  It first struck my eyes and then went into my ears.  I was able to free one of my hands and dug deep into my pocket.  In my pocket was one Jobe's houseplant fertilizer spike.  I took the spike and thrusted it right into the plant.  During this time everything was turning black.  I felt like I was losing consciousness.  When all of a sudden ... I heard a noise.  The plant started to retract and move slowly back into the pot.  I stood up, shook my head and brushed the sweat out of my eyes.  I cautiously leaned in to the soil and heard something.  It was a mumbling.  I leaned in close and I heard an audible "thank you."  I said you're welcome decided to order another set of Jobe's houseplant fertilizer spikes.	1
Can't be any easier. Plant size determines how many plant spiked each plant gets!  Just insert them in the ground, then water.	1
My plants love these... and they bring my plants to life. Easy to use!	1
excellent	1
My houseplants in my office LOVE this stuff.  They grow much faster with it.	1
happy with purchase	1
Just what the plants needed. Not much more to say. I will update if anything special happens.	1
This is convenient as it gets: shove the recommended number of spikes into your plant's soil so they're level with the soil's surface, water, and forget about it. Maybe now I can actually have luscious houseplants!	1
My plants does really well with this product. Thank you!	1
I've used these in the past and they worked great.  I think the ones I bought from here were, shall we say....stale.	-1
These are so very convenient and my houseplants are thriving!	1
Absolutely no benefit to any of the plants I used these liberally in.  Would not waste my money again on this product.	-1
Thanks for the name brand fertilizer spikes.  Easy to use and makes for beautiful plants.	1
Great value. I have been using them in one of my potted plants for over a year now and they work great.	1
Great Product!!!	1
I have been using fertilizer spikes for a long time for my houseplants, and they work very well.  They are easy to use and promote good growth.  I would recommend them. They are an easy alternate to liquid plant food.	1
Good value and packaging. My plants haven't said if they liked them or not, but they are still alive.	1
Quick arrival and easy to use. I've had them a relatively short period of time so I can't say how beneficial they've been but I'll update accordingly. Good value for the amount you get.	1
PLANTS HAPPY	1
So easy to use	1
Excellent product.  I really like it.  Recommend it highly	1
Goes with all my plants and they are very great for the plants.	1
I like the spikes. It makes keeping my plants in good shape so much easier than mixing a fluid mix. Just pop it in and you're good to go!	1
Great price, and you get a great amount. Seem to work great at feeding my plants. Not much else to say!	1
I love these fertilizer spikes!  I'm not one for gardening, really, and don't have much of a green thumb, but I received several houseplants from my mother as an apartment warming gift after I moved.  I tried very diligently to take care of the plants that she gave me, and, while they didn't die, they didn't really seem to thrive, either.  I never thought of myself as someone who likes plants, but, as it turns out, once you have some in your care, feelings of responsibility soon turn into feelings of affection.  My determination to keep the plants from dying grew into a desire to see them thrive, so I began to try different kinds of soils and fertilizers and planters.  I've tried liquid fertilizer and I've tried the pellet kind, but these spikes have so far proven to be the best hit with my plants.  Not to knock the liquid stuff, they're probably the reason the plants survived for so long, but these spikes are the reason they are now green and full and flourishing.  It hasn't even been that long since I've inserted these spikes into all my planters, but every single one of my plants are doing so much better, there is a visible improvement that makes me really happy to see.  I'll definitely be getting more of these!	1
These spikes make fertilizing indoor plants very easy without having to lift bags of pellets or granules..  They are long lasting with slow release so longer periods between feeding of plants.	1
The spikes work well for plants which are non-flowering.  I used them on the green plants and those that bloom infrequently.  THEy all seem quite happy.	1
Be careful when using these sticks.  Use fewer than the recommended per each planter or you may kill your plants. Using fewer than recommended, my plants are thriving. Used the recommended and my plants are dead.	1
Nice easy, and safe for all house plants...Will not burn the plants and is simple to use...I got a bunch to have on hand...One stick last three months	1
i keep buying these over and over. my house plants are doing great.  and her outside plants we keep in...  all winter..  are doing great.	1
These seem to do the trick for my green indoor plants, they are doing quite well.  It was nice getting the free ones, too!	1
I got these to use with the plants I plan on planting for indoor use. I have not used them yet since I haven't planted anything yet. I have 8-inch planters, but I think I'll only use 1/2 of a spike for each planter. The directions say to use like 4 but I think that's way too much for a single plant. It's better to under-fertilize than to over-fertilize.	1
I know that many people are divided on using liquid plant food or food spikes. I have used these for many years in my african violets with a great deal of success. The plants  are in constant bloom and last many years.	1
My gardening over the past 20+ years is strictly self-taught.  What I do know is that for years I have used Jobes spikes when initially planting anything, whether in the ground or in pots, as an aid to help them thrive, and they do.  For potted plants, I usually put a couple more in every year.  For me this is an easy as well as effective way to fertilize.  At the current $1.97 for 50 spikes, they are very competitively priced.	1
This is the easiest way to fertilize house plants, with excellent results - my plants started growing and blooming within just a few weeks.	1
plants love them i am stocking up for the outside plants for summer house plants also like them  can't wait till the flowers come	1
economical, plenty in a packk for an entire household of plants, simple to use, made a noticeable difference in our house plant appearance within 3 weeks.	1
This prodykt vere good .I don't have a problem with this product. I recomed this product for my frends. Ivere happe. Thank you vere mach	1
They last pretty long, long then I expected... It also brings a lot of fertilizers, more then I expected... Thanks...	1
What a deal!  My house plants are flourishing with this easy to use plant food.  I would never have found it around here.  Thanks to Amazon, I have access to the best products at the click of a computer.	1
Applied fertilizer spikes per directions & after a month I can report that all of the house plants have "perked up."	1
My biggest challenge will be not losing these in the back of a drawer somewhere before I use them all up.	1
Put several according to directions in the pot and works great. My plant that i received today which is a mullberry bush/tree didn't even go into shock after recieveing it through the mail today. I planted it into a 12 inch planter and the plant was happy. I put him "Morus" under my grow light and according to directions it says to put in 6 sticks per pot. Well i did this to some of my other tiny plants and my cat bit off and spat out the excess stick sticking out, so highly recommend this product, but at the same tiem highly recommend shoving the stick all the way into the ground. Reasonalby priced, and i asked the customer service through the number about the household plant fertalizer being used on edible plants like tomatoes, and she said that except for the numbers of what it contains being different, she didn't think there was anything poisonous in the product that would keep a person from eating the edible plants fruit/vegitables. So from what i found out, it is okay to use on those plants and that you can eat after the plants produce and do what they need to do. Highly recommend and very affordable. I ordered 4 packages:-)	1
I've noticed that my indoor house plants are healthier and grow faster after using these, despite using not-so-great quality potting soil. Would buy again.	1
I'm a crazy houseplant lady (like with cats). I think I probably have 50 of them. I have always used Miraclegro with mixed results. The plants grew a little during growing season, sometimes, but sometimes they seemed unhappy for no apparent reason. I decided to give these a try because of how cheap they were and I am amazed. Within just a few weeks of using these my plants had already grown the entire amount they would normally grow during growing season. They were vividly green and absolutely thriving. It is fantastic. I guess it's the slow addition of fertilizer rather than the all at once, but my plants are so happy with these. No more liquid fertilizer for me! Plus they're so easy to use. I don't have to count drops and have dry dark storage or algae covered watering cans. If you need fertilizer for your houseplants, get these.	1
wow! I just may have green thumb, brought jobes and I'm already seeing improvements!!!! especially with potho's, will continue to use every 60 days!!!! hope they continue to grow all 26 of them!!!	1
These fertilizer sticks are easy to use. Just stick them into the soil around the potted plants. They fertilize the plants for several months.	1
Cream always rises to the top. Bahco have a reputation for a reason and this is another reason. Well made and balanced and retains sharpness and alignment. The ergo part works and it is still comfortable after an hours hard pruning. Excellent product that you don't have to worry about spending a little more money on.	1
I can't stress enough how much I love this line of Bahco pruners. I have the non-rotating handled one, and gave up my previously-beloved Felcos in favor of the Orange Menace as I call it. The blade stays sharp a long time, and the ergonomic design really and truly cuts down on wrist pain, and also cuts down on trips to my truck to get my loppers, as it cuts very thick branches that no other handheld shear can touch.  I'm a pro, so a year of use is probably like ten years of home use.  Now to this model specifically: I thought that the rotating handle might help reduce pain for the upcoming pruning season, but I'd had problems gripping other brands of rotating handled-pruners in the past because they are so big and bulky, and the rotating handle makes it easy to drop them. Not a problem here. The handle is the slimmest I've ever seen and is easy to pick up and grip, and really is better designed for ergonomics.  Highly recommended. I'd get the stationary handle for regular garden work, and the rotating handle if you regularly hold the pruners in your hand for more than an hour at a time, like for serious fruit tree work or propagation.	1
Haven't tried this model yet but already have the PG-M2 and bought this one for larger material.  I've owned Bahco pruners for a few years now and they are comfortable in the hand, stay sharp longer than other well-known pruners and last through a good amount of use.	1
Work great! Reviews were right they are sharp and get the job done without crushing the plant.	1
I am a Master Gardner and spend countless hours in my yard. Returned 3 pairs of Corona before investing in these. One of the best gardening investments I have made. SUPER product!!!	1
I work as a vintner and have used both Felco and Corona sheers in the past. These pruners are in a league all their own. If you use pruners for 12+ hours a day like I do you will thank yourself after purchasing these. A must have in the vineyard.	1
In 20 years of home ownership, I have been through several pairs of pruners.  Mostly because I lose them in the yard waste bucket :-(  I started out with a nice pair of Corona and moved on to Fiskars with the rotating handle.  The lock button on the Fiskars had a tendency to lock while using which was irritating.  They cut pretty well and quality was decent as I had them for five years.  Upon shopping for a new set, it seemed like the heftier box store pruners were $25 minimum.  After reading all the great reviews for these I decided to put an additional $10 to take a chance on these and I am not disappointed!  These cut like butter!!!!!  I got them just in time to do spring yard cleaning and I have a lot of shrubs and bushes around the house.  They have a really nice heft to them and are comfortable to use for a couple of hours.  I appreciate the orange handle.  Since I paid a lot for these pruners, I invested $10 in a belt pouch to hold the pruners when they are not in use.  I recommend these high priced pruners if you spend a lot of time pruning.	1
If you are like me and will pay whatever you have to for quality and to experience what using the best really means, get these. These are not cheap, but nothing I want to use or own should be. I like things that are enjoyable to use. And cheap tools or cheap anything never seems to give me a good feeling. Buy and use these, then go buy a really good pair from Home Depot and compare. These make the best stuff seem as if there is something wrong and inferior with them. These things set the bar higher then any other company can reach.	1
Great tool.	1
I owed few pruners purchased @ amazon (felco #6 and felco #2, bahco px/r-m2, and bahco px/r-m3, ars hp-vs8z/r) best-worst comfort: ars, bahco, and felco best-worst cut quality: ars, bahco, felco I don't like felco rotate handle. ars rotate handle  is better fit me than bahco. I'm fine with non-rotate handle.  so go and get two if it's under $50, since it's cheaper than buy replacement parts later	1
Fits wife's hand well...she loves them.	1
Really good pruners.  My hand does not get as tired while using these during constant pruning work.  They really are sized for different hand sizes.  Nice that the pruners can be rebuilt so one worn part does not force you to buy a whole new pruner.	1
My Bahco secateurs were made to cut plants, not price.  Metallurgy is a science and craftsmanship is an art.  If one does not value those attributes, there are plenty of pretenders. Made In China comes to mind.	1
This fountain is one of the best I have purchased. Very easy to set up, and it creates a peaceful environment.	1
Item was used on arrival! very clearly scratches and crooked ... I decided to keep it since i had a wedding for my nice and she wanted it and it was to late to replace .... But Maaaan really people??? You really wanna sell stuff in that condition? I would absolutly have loved it if I had gotten a fresh out of the box item and not it this 20 year old condition ...that's sad :(	-1
Good quality, persnickety about it's water level. Don't overfill and do not underfill. I from time to time have to "tweak" the floating cups, but am happy and like the sound. I have found the less gushing water, the more current it makes and thus the chimes work better. Again, it's Good quality and I would reccomend.	1
My ONLY complaint is the motor is too hummy and loud. I swapped out a different motor from my previous fountain and now it's silent so you can actually hear the water. Fairly easy to adjust just read the trouble shooting sheet that comes with it. I may have to remove the floating bells at night to stop the sound but that's easy enough to do. Very attractive and a substantial size. I'll also be adding glass pebbles to the inside of the bowl just for aesthetic reasons.  UPDATE after a few months ...  I have removed the floating bells since all they did was get stuck and not move. I added the clear crystals to the water and it's a nice effect. There is a green water mark forming at the top which is unattractive to deal with. Overall at this point I would not buy again.	-1
Very please with the seller and the product	1
Chimes were never that great. I am very disappointed with this fountain. Stopped working after only a few months. I followed the instructions exactly and cleaned this unit once a month. Pump stopped producing enough flow to move the floating chimes. Didn't look very high quality for the price.	-1
I still love my Felco, made by Swiss, pruner.  It's a quick and easy pruner and I had it for years.  Tried the expensive Stihl, made in Japan pruners,  seemed ordinary but okay.  This PX-L13 Bahco is the best.  It is easier to use for cutting dried stubs and far easier for pruning live branches.  The angle and the handle length are a plus.  I have medium hands, but it would be a plus for small or large, because it give the options of hand placement, or two hand cuttin  Truly the Bahco slices easier and the metal is good,  for long lasting sharpness.  I sharpen mine using a flat stone, 1000 grit medium, Japanese made.  ONLY sharpen the beveled side, NOT the flat side.  Oil is a plus.  My pruning is a dozen palm trees,  and the shrubbery, and Crepe Myrtle.  Corona and Fiskers  are  not even a consideration. We are talking quality of metal and hardness,  that's why Corona and Fiskers  are cheaper in many ways. Bahco "appears" to be French made.	1
Design of product makes pruning easier. My wife has problems with her hands and these pruners are easy for her to use. They due gum up from time to time, but easy to clean.	1
While I have been thrilled with the wind chimes I purchased from Woodstock, I am very disappointed in the bell fountain. No matter what I set the water power to or the height of the water in the bowl, I never got chimes. I think the bowl is too large and the pump is not powerful enough to swirl the water (even when I blocked the top to create a more powerful stream underwater, it wasn't enough) It is pretty and if the water stream is set to high, it has a nice waterfall sound. UPDATE.... JAN 2ND 2016.... I am stubborn, so I took apart the small pump. It had a plastic sponge inside partially covering the intake opening. I don't know if that was added to try and quiet the noise from the pump, or I missed something in the prep instructions. Anyway, I removed the sponge and reassembled the pump, making sure the flow was lowered and the tubing was almost at a 45 degree angle to stir the water. Viola! I know have the sound of water and beautiful chimes. The pump is noisier, but I put the bowl on a folded towel and that helped a lot. I also placed it far enough away in the room, so that I am only hearing the chimes. NOW I am happy. Love it!	1
Got these as a Happy Day present for myself, in the summer.  They cut through anything I've ever used them on and I've tackled some pretty burly bushes with them.  They are comfortable and fit my hands (I wear size small leather work gloves).  Not too heavy, very easy to grip, and easy to lock/store in my pocket until I need them again.	1
My wife loves these for her gardening chores. They are very sharp and have good leverage. The handle is comfortable and they are light weight.	1
I have VERY large hands and these fit me perfectly!  They cut through thick branches quite easily with little pressure on my hands.  My wife has smaller hands and she can also use it, but not as comfortably as me. They have stayed sharp over the past few months and were worth the premium price.  Yes I could have bought 6 cheap ones for the price of this one, but the Bahco has saved me time and kept me safe by cutting cleanly and due to the sharpness it keeps the entire process of cutting stable. Overall, this is my first Bahco product and I look forward to being a long time customer.  ***4/7/2014 UPDATE***  We have used these extensively and they have held up and work as good as they did the first day we purchased them!  The secret is to be sure to lubricate them prior to use and to keep them clean.  If you do this they will not only stay clean by resisting the sticky sap and debris, but will also stay sharp.  I can see these lasting for many more years to come!  So far they are well worth the price!  ***8/7/2014 UPDATE***  Well, I left these things out for a few minutes while working in the garden the other day and they were stolen.  So I no longer own these and I hope someday I can afford to get another set, as they were awesome!  I am not having to settle for some Fiskars which are nowhere near as good as these were.  It really breaks my heart knowing they are gone, for good.  :(  So enjoy it while you have it folks as you don't know how good they are until they are gone! :(	1
I spend 3-4 hours a week in the garden, not counting lawn maintenance. These are perfect for that amount of use. They are fun to use, keep an edge well and get through surprisingly thick branches. I've had some rust issues, but that was likely due to me not cleaning them properly after use. Locking mechanism sticks a bit, but overall happy with these.	1
This damn thing is gorgeous. Unlike another review, I don't hear the pump at ALL! There are two things that I am not a huge fan of - the cord which you just can't hide - my work around is an ivy plant to cover it with! The other that I am not in love with are the two floating disks that serve as bells. The are little brass bowls that are connected to a bit of black foam - which looks super cheap. It's not attractive - I am working on trying to figure out how to make them not look like that.  NOW. The tranquility and zen this thing provides from a sound perspective - is AMAZING. I have it right next to my hammock, and it's just magnificent. I had a group of people over, and they all agreed that the sound was just damn beautiful. Very tranquil!  I give this a 4 stars for the amazing sound and the overall aesthetic - the things again that I am trying to make look better are the cord and the floating bowls. Those both could have been executed much better from a design standpoint.	1
find the chime annoying but that is not what i got it for.  easy to clean works great for adding moisture to the air.	1
Very relaxing fountain. This is perfect for my meditation room. I actually put a few tea light candles in the two moveable bells and a stationary one to add a little ambiance. My dog loves to sit in the room with me and she zones out staring at the fountain.	1
I tried these after reading a review by a professional landscaper.  He was a lifelong Felco pruner user who decided to switch to these on the recommendation of a fellow landscaper.  In his case, he really liked the Bahco and ended up using them as his first preference. After trying them, I am sticking with the Felco pruners.  They are just not as comfortable to use and feel a bit awkward compared to the Felco #2 that I use.  These pruners open wider than most and my hand barely kept hold of them on the last digit of my fingers. I ordered the a Medium hand size. I am 6ft and 190 pounds with what I thought was a medium size hand.  I would recommend ordering a smaller size if you are not sure of your hand size.  Overall, a good, sturdy and high quality pruner but not up to the quality of Felco.	1
You may want to try and get the "Large" size pruner instead of the medium. It's quite a bit smaller than the Fiskars that I also use. This is expensive so I hope it holds up over time.	1
Companies with good names usually produce a decent product and Bahco is one of them. Easy cutting action,with a sharp blade and a longer length on the handles makes it a very competent pruner. Way better than the lower priced ones which tend to cut roughly and damage the stalks of plants and also tend to rust and gum up easily. These pruners are well suited for everyday use and I have found them to maintain their sharpness and ease of use.	1
Bought this as a Christmas present for my boyfriend after I noticed him admiring one at the Botanic Gardens gift shop. Overall it is a great fountain. A little tricky to get all of the bells to strike just right, but once you do they make beautiful "zen" music, so no complaints here! If you don't use distilled water the copper will oxidize, but I personally think it is pretty.	1
For someone who just undergo a major surgery, this one is an  easy set up. Wish it has a light on it.	1
Very pretty.  Very soothing.  I have the Woodstock Water Bell Tabletop Water Fountian in my bedroom and enjoy it throughout the day and night.  The sound of water lightly gurgling and the gentle sound of the chimes is very relaxing.  Super easy to assemble.  You Tube assembly instructions are available as well as other customers showing you their fountain setup..	1
I placed this in my bedroom and can hear it through out my house. It helps with my stress level. Highly recommend!	1
my homemade root beer tastes more like sweet cough syrup mixed with dirt	-1
I love this product. Only wish it didn't cost so much. So many people are afraid to use this because research had been done and rats which were given high doses of this developed liver cancer. It was the equivalent of a person drinking 3 gallons of root beer every day. As someone else pointed out, the same group which gave this reason for not using sassafras, does not seem to be concerned about the use of pharmaceuticals, which are also harmful or life threatening to some people, even when used according to the directions. I like the taste of sassafras much more than the taste of sarsaparilla. The price of sarsaparilla is much lower than the price of sassafras. But sassafras tastes more like root beer than sarsaparilla. But it costs more than 2X the price of sarsaparilla.	1
We brew water kefir, and enjoy our homemade "ginger beer" by combining kefir "water" with ground and strained fresh ginger. However, I have pined for a real old fashion "root beer", and one of the essential ingredients from the family recipes that everyone used to make is sassafras root bark (although the bark from the tree works as well. The root bark is sweeter). This "cut and sifted" root bark is wonderfully fragrant right out of the pouch -- smells like rootbeer hasn't smelled (all chemicals and fake flavors these days) for a looooong time.  Recently we sampled the first gallon jug of rootbeer Sassafras kefir -- most excellent! Tastes as good as it smells, and leaves a lovely afterglow on the tongue. Since then, we've experimented with half-and-half with our ginger kefir beer -- and I like that even better. We'll go further and add wintergreen, licorice root, juniper berries and more.  Although there are less expensive versions, even on Amazon, this product is recommended!  By the way -- a word about the "sassafras controversy." As another reviewer pointed out about this product, and then gave it a one star, the info says "for external use only." Now, why is that? It's because someone once fed massive doses of sassafras to rats, and that caused liver issues. These are the same people who got apple seeds banned from health food stores, because massive doses of them can also make you ill. Of course, even normal doses of many prescription drugs and certainly, chemotherapy, will damage your organs or even kill you -- just watch the ads on TV and you'll probably never pop another pill.  We are not concerned about consuming small amounts of sassafras like this. Here's a quote from the blog site, The Nourished Kitchen:  "The primary flavor found in any old-fashioned homemade root beer recipe is sassafras, a deciduous tree native to North America.  The characteristic sweet flavor comes from the tree's roots, thus giving us the name root beer. Incidentally, the tree's leaves give us file powder which is the essential thickening agent in classic gumbo.  Now of course, the primary flavor we associate with root beer is that of wintergreen, not of sassafras.  "Homemade Root Beer & the Safrole Controversy:  "Wintergreen leaf, though almost always an ingredient in most traditional root beer recipes, replaced sassafras as the prominent flavor in root beer during the 1960s when a study conducted on lab animals implicated safrole, a naturally occurring polyphenol, in liver cancer.  Of course, the lab rats were fed massive quantities of safrole - the human equivalent of consuming about 32 twelve-ounce bottles of root beer a day. After the study was released, the FDA required commercial soft drink makers to remove sassafras from their brews. Of course, cinnamon, nutmeg and basil also contain safrole but this seemed to escape the attention of the FDA.  "Interestingly, while massive quantities of safrole caused liver cancer in lab animals, it seems that small doses may actually play a protective role for humans.  Some studies indicate that safrole may actually stimulate the death of cancer cells, particularly oral cancers, though it may also do so in lung and prostrate cancers....  "As for me, it seems that everything is a medicine and everything is a poison; it's all about dosage.  So when I make my root beer, I'll take my chances with a tiny amount of safrole in natural sassafras and avoid the propylene glycol in synthetic flavorings."  You can decide for yourself!	1
Good product , good heat	1
My husband and son use this to make beer. We chose it over others because of the high btu. Works great!	1
this thing kicks azz.	1
Works great. Only wish I had bought two for the price they were offered at.  I bought this as a brewing spare and sure enough I needed it when my primary cooker died after 4 years of heavy use. It was nice to open the box and find this already assembled with only the gas line to attach.	1
Missing parts so I returned it. Need more QA from Bayou Classic.	-1
I took a long time in researching propane cookers and finally decided on this one. For what I need to use it for (blanching veggies before freezing and boiling green peanuts) I've been very pleased. The others reviews for this jet cooker were very accurate. I can get a full pot of water boiling in my 44 quart pot quickly and get on with my cooking in short order. The jet is loud but you get over that pretty quickly. I think given my experiences with this cooker that I wouldn't hesitate to purchase this jet cooker again. Bayou Classic seems to be the best.	1
good one	1
Lots of black soot on the bottom of my pot.  Huge pain to clean the pot afterwards.	-1
I bought this from a different vendor, but it is a great burner! I use it under a 120 qt pot to boil peanuts, and it does a great job. Can't beat it for the price...	1
i decided to have a few boils this summer in california, and this burner works great. in my opinion, it was the best compromise between quality, BTU's, and price on amazon. i use a 60-quart pot and usually fill it halfway and do 20-30# of food; this burner can handle all that and probably more. make sure you read the instructions before using, there's a right way and wrong way to fire this burner up so make sure you are familiar with how to operate it.	1
Works great. I boiled a 40 quart pot of 75 chicken legs and 60 Italian sausages in less than an hour to over 200 degrees. That's all that needs to be said.	1
Great product but remember if its not on a prime membership list item Amazon will make wait till they ship it...	1
VERY GOOD	1
EWLL BUILT AT A GREAT PRICE!	1
Super hot works like a dream. I use it for boiling crabs on the OR coast. Sounds like a 747 well built and good components. Highly recommended !	1
I love my jet burner.  I use it for many reasons (any I can come up with) from to heat up water on large canning batches, making tamales and steaming apples for applesauce to using my disk skillet to flash saute something or fry anything and everything.  I find it easy to control and relatively safe to use considering it's a high pressure gas burner that gets up to high temperature really fast.  I like to light it using a large piece of wood and keep it held there until the burner is hot enough to sustain the flame. I am sure a stick lighter would work just as good.  It can be finicky to stay lit at times so I never leave it unattended (which I would recommend anyway even if it didn't need it) so I have always tried to keep the adjustments just right for the conditions I am using it with (cold, windy, etc) and have found this to be helpful when using it.  Which takes me to the point of the adjustments. I like the adjustment feature which spreads the flame over the pot bottom to give you some control over flame and also the controls for the amount of gas coming into the burner.  This gives great control over temperature and conditions (size of pot, weather, etc.)  I leave my burner outside most of the time and other than the tarnishing and slight oxidation, I am happy with the quality and design of the burner. It is heavy and workmanship seems to be top notch compared to other burners I have seen.  Be forewarned being a jet burner, it really does sound like a jet and can be really loud.	1
Hubby used it and is very pleased.	1
Sturdy. Easy set up. Worked like a charm at the family crab feast. Diffuser works to disperse jet nozzle flame. Finish a little silly, since it burns/flakes off with first use.	1
Works well.  A couple points to prevent a full five stars:  The first time we used it, the intense heat burned off the paint on the metal surfaces near the flame, causing a stinky funk that hung around for about ten minutes.  After that, no issues with performance.  I'm a bit surprised a more heat-resilient finish wasn't used.  Given the cost differential between this and competing products, though, I think it's good enough.  Just don't store it uncovered outside, as once the paint is gone, rust will probably eat this steel frame quickly if left to the elements.  It is *quite* loud at full gas flow.  Perhaps "jet cooker" is also a comment on what it sounds like.  Fortunately, partial flow is usually sufficient after getting your pot's contents up to temp.	1
This high powered single jet burner is just what the doctor ordered. I haven't used it yet but have burnt off the black painted finished as recommended by some of the other reviewers. This thing is loud but it puts off plenty of heat for wok cooking which is what I plan to use it for.	1
I owned one very similar for years, but accidents do happen, so I got this to replace it, it works great, does what I need, boils water, cooks eggs, makes coffee, etc.	1
Got this for the son-in-law. Love to cook out side. made his own chilly roaster and can use this for heat.	1
This is a great adjustable flame heater and really puts out a good flame. It was perfect for the 60 gallon stock pot I bought and brought the temperature up on a bitterly cold day outside.	1
Works great with the stockpot we use for our annual crawfish boil. No complaints. Purchased another one this last year because we needed more pots and burners. Party grows bigger every year.	1
Works great. I purchased the burner to go with the Bayou class 42qt pot and basket. Jet burner for boiling is the only was to go. I also have the Bayou classic double jet for my 80 qt.	1
I bought this primarily to do full 5 gallon wort boils, but just recently used it for a New England boil.  It brought the liquid (about three gal or so) to a boil in a hurry...I didn't time it but it wasn't more than a few minutes.  Very easy to use.  Flame control with the valve was a snap.  Like others have said, the paint will cook off the first time you use it, so don't be alarmed.  The design easily held my 35 quart pot and is sturdy enough to accommodate one much larger.  For bringing large quantities of liquid to boil very quickly AND safely, you will be pleased with this product.	1
I use it for homebrewing and it saves a lot of time getting the water up to temp.  Construction seems sturdy and simple. Like most of these burners, the valve is not great so I ordered a better valve (Bayou Classic 7850 0-30 PSI Adjustable High-Pressure Propane Regulator) which gives great control for low boil or simmering. Five stars with the added valve.	1
Just the right size for frying fish etc. Works like a champ, a great value.	1
I have only used this product once so far.  Performed as expected.	1
Enjoyed a family fish fry over the 4th with this fryer.  Worked great.	1
It good product	1
very good product is as described. I recommend	1
Great burner	1
it works fine; however, it would be better if the materials were a little more sturdy	1
Awesome product !!	1
working fine	1
You can cook more than a turkey with this hauss	1
JUNK, AND GUESS WHAT? MADE IN CHINA. AMAZON SERVICE IS FANTASTIC, THIS LATEST PIECE OF JUNK, ARRIVED A DAY EARLY, THATS A + THE BURNER NEEDS MORE SUPPORT, WHICH I WILL FABRICATE, BEFORE I USE THIS LITTLE JEWEL. BACK TO SQUARE ONE, YOU ONLY GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR.	-1
I've used this about 20 times.  Sometimes it creates a roaring flame and a ton of heat.  Other times the gas trickles out and barely warms anything.  I have multiple propane tanks and will always swap them out, adjust the valve and air intake, reattach the tanks, relight the burner, etc.  Nothing seems to help when it runs poorly.  But often, the next time I fire it up a week or two later it runs great.  Who knows what's going on, but it ain't good.	-1
Poor Quality I would not recommend this product Perhaps I got a defective unit Cons 1) bad Valve, Very hard to adjust, When you turn the valve it springs back, If you pull up or push down on the valve it changes the gas flow. 2) It doesn't get very hot, I was unable to boil 3 gallons of water as it maxed out at about 160 degrees 3) if you turn it up to get decent heat it goes out every couple of minutes  Basically this is a piece of junk	-1
Can not control the flame.  It will only work with the valve wide open and then the flame is dancing on the burner like maybe the burner is plugged.  The flame goes out if you try to lower it. Finally out of frustration I put some duct tape on the air controller holes and now I can semi regulate it to a lower flame.  Seems like the air controller air ports are too large.  The burner still acts like it is plugged as the flame does not light all around the burner. Took the burner apart and ground the burs around the gas outlet down and now I have flame all around the burner. Just a bad quality control on this burner.  I would send it back but another one would probably be the same.	-1
I bought this because I have a 14" dia. pot that won't fit on my other cookers (that are now repaired) because the pot sits down inside a ring that is smaller. The burner is about 6" below the bottom of the pot. For boiling Maple sap you need the flame on really high just to reach the pot let alone make it boil. It uses about  four times the propane as my other cookers that have the exact same burner at 2-1/2" from the pot. If I had nothing to compare to I would say it was great. I tried the Bayou Jet cooker SP1 but that was like a blow torch and would drain a propane tank in a few hours so I returned it (locally).  I will either move the burner up which requires some welding or give it away. I did steal the hose off it until I get the other one I need. There is nothing really wrong with it, Its just not for me.	-1
I'm a person who reads reviews before I buy. I especially read the negative ones to see what they have to say. This was rated very highly and honestly I can't even remember what all the negatives said. Maybe we had a defective cooker but here is my opinion.  First of all, this is not our first cooker. We needed this one for a vacation home and have some idea of how they should work.  The cord was already assembled so we didn't have to worry about that. All we had to do was attach it to the cord and the other end to the propane tank. Very easy. Our problem with it was that it would not stay lit on low or medium heat. We had to fry our turkey on high heat. It was a dry and hot morning with hardly any breeze. We did get our turkey done after an hour but felt that we didn't want to go through this every time we used the cooker. We really didn't know if we had a defective cooker or what but we returned it.  Amazon understood our concerns and sent UPS out the next day to pick it up. You gotta love Amazon for their return policies.	-1
Gave it 2 stars because it painted black and all the paint flaked off after two uses and is rusting.  They should have powder coated it. I also own a stainless steel model and made my own wind guard for it.	-1
I used this a few times to make chicken wings, then in less than a year it is rusted and the regulator won't let gas through because of some malfunction on the safety mechanism.  It ruined thanksgiving.  Nobody open.  Nowhere to get replacement.	-1
Package arrived intact and in good order. Upon opening I found an empty plastic bag with no parts in it. Tried to contact the mfg, but their instructions were to contact the seller. Got a smart reply in a chat session with them and no instruction to assemble. Used it one time and the paint is peeling off it. I would imagine rusting will occur shortly. Worst experience I have ever had with an Amazon vendor.	-1
~ I ordered 4, mine came from China, they were all shipped together without one bit of protection wrap in an envelope!  When I opened the envelope slivers of glass went everywhere!  All 4 are broken, chipped and dangerous!   It amazes me a seller would be so unkind to send this into someone's home! A 5 year old would know better! You don't ship 4 glass prisim balls all  together without protection thousands of miles. PATHETIC!  Also, they are not true Asfour crystal but I figured they would be generic at such a low price.	-1
the temperature gauge is perfect but the humidity gauge is way off. I'm very disappointed with my purchase and I would recomend that you look elsewhere for a similar product.	-1
would not purchase again not made well at all. cheap plastic	-1
Changed my rating because I've spent a lot of time and money getting this to work and hide it and it works fine for days on end until you shut it off and then restart the pump.  It seems to get clogged up so water doesn't run through the outflow tube and it overflows.  I would never leave it running while I'm gone or even overnight.  It clogged up one night and emptied my pond.  I'm going to look for something else but I'm very disappointed since I've spent so much time with this.  My only complaint about this is it's hard to hide.  I've had it on line about a week and my once dirty pond water almost looks clean enough to drink.  I have it at the end of the run, pump, UV filter and this.  It's then running into a waterfall.  I realized after I got it that my pump was too powerful.  It recommends no more than 550 GPH so I had to buy a regulator.  I also had to buy 1 1/4 tubing but I am using 1 inch right now and it's working ok with the regulator.  It's recommended to be higher than the waterfall which makes it a challenge to hide.  If you don't have a waterfall it can be placed practically anywhere.	-1
My finches and actually all my birds, cardinals, doves, blue jay, squirrels etc. Don't like Nyjer seed...Probably a good product, my birds just don't like the seed/	-1
USING ONLY A 400GPH PUMP , FILTER LEAKS LIKE A SIVE , NO MATTER HOW TIGHT THE LID IS.can imagine what would happen with a 500gph pump.  might work better if the lid had a rubber gasket....	-1
ordered and recieved when I finally had it all hooked up and ran water to it I found the lid cracked and water poured out. Absolutely worthless - 60 bucks dpown the drain. This was order to replace an exact model which also had a cracked lid. The first unit lasted one year and this new one was broke when recieved. done will not purchase one of these again	-1
if you expect $50 worth of filtration, forget it. Unit leaks, black filter is good for 1 cleaning and really does not do a good job all around. Replacement same situation, Amazon replaced by same situation.	-1
This filter kept my pond clean for 1.5 years but then after an algae bloom it never could recover. The water was green and I could barely see my kois. Worst of all, cleaning takes quite a bit of effort. You have to take everything out and rinse them clean of the sludge.  I would recommend looking at the Fish Mate X000, which has a sludge drain at the bottom. It also has a basket that holds all the filters and bioballs. For cleaning, you pull out the basket and rinse everything off. After replacing the TetraPond with the Fish Mate, my pond cleared up in 2 weeks.	-1
Doesnt work	-1
The wild Finches in my yard will not eat this. They fight over the Wagner brand.	-1
Worked for a day, my cat would jump over the spot I sprayed, but now it doesn't repel her at all, even after a fresh spray.	-1
Opened bag and smelled a musty stale smell. The birds actually wouldn't eat these seeds from the nijer sock. I threw the seeds away sndcpurchaed from store locally	-1
A WASTE OF MONEY ,MY CAT WALKS RIGHT OVER IT	-1
This was worthless. I sprayed it liberally every day where the neighbor's cats poop.  Went through the whole bottle.  The cats still poop every day in the same places.  It had no effect whatsoever.	-1
Arrived leaking and broken I had to buy another bottle	-1
IT  DOESN'T  WORK!!!!!!  DON'T  WASTE  YOUR  MONEY!!!!!!!	-1
did not help at all!	-1
DIDN"TWORK FOR MYCAT	-1
The bottle broke on the second use. Had to find another bottle. It stinks too.	-1
The product doesn't work at all! The cat completely ignores it! Absolutely useless cat repellent.	-1
This is a bottle of something that does absolutely no good whatsoever. All is not lost, though... just dump out the fluid (water???) and you have a swell spray bottle. Actually you can get several empty bottles at Wal-Mart for what you will pay for this stuff.	-1
We've had a koi pond for years and as our koi continue to grow ever-larger (over two feet long now), we've had to install additional mechanical and biological equipment to keep the pond clean and the fish healthy.  With two pumps, two biological filters, one mechanical filter, and one ultraviolet filter, it seems like something malfunctions and has to be replaced every year or so.  Sometimes it's possible to order the same model and then all we have to do is detach the broken piece of equipment and install the new working one.  However, occasionally models are discontinued or sometimes we choose to not reorder a model because of early malfunction.  Adding a new model of equipment can bring big headaches.  Sorry, this is a long explanation to get to the point that every time we buy a new model of pump or filter, we have to figure out again how to configure the hose connections.  Sometimes it's not a big deal; but our most recent purchase of a new ultraviolet filter still has us flummoxed.  We have to be able to connect a 2.5-inch hose to a 1.75-inch hose.  We spent an hour at Lowes with two plumbing department employees trying to find something that would work.  Nope.  Tried a local pool and landscaping business.  Nope.  Saw this adapter on Amazon and got our hopes up.  Almost worked...but not quite.  The design concept is wonderful in theory; but the problem is that each individual gradation of size is slightly tapered (slanted) itself...rather than remaining an exact measurement for that entire gradation.  Because of this, neither of the hoses can get a good enough seal.  And, since each section tapers, trying to give the hose ends a more snug fit by pulling it tight with a hose clamp doesn't work either...all because of the slanted tapering.	-1
As of August 1 2014 the photo of the product is still inaccurate.  What I received did not work for me and I had to return it.	-1
Works well but much too much trouble to take out of pond every few days to clean-Filters outsde pond(waterfall and canister)much more efficient and way easier to clean	-1
2.5 stars. this hammock is strong and probably durable, but:  1) it's VERY UNCOMFORTABLE, my wife stayed 1 minute in it. Especially uncomfortable without clothing or with light summer clothing. I bought it on purpose since I am blessed to live in Florida. the cords are very hard material, not cotton like at all. so it's more for wintery weather. At that point you buy a more comfortable tissue one. so I wish I didn't buy it. but I really need the outdoor durability so I had no choice, it's going to be outdoor 24h/7x364 days a year (1 day a year I might bring it in before running for shelter because a hurricane is arriving.). I'm considering buying some kind of pad, so far could not find one good enough :( I have to shift my weight every minute because how uncomfortable it is, which is irritating for someone who works hard and got a house with a nice backyard to enjoy the dream of comfortable induced drowsiness.  2) some of the bowline knots are cut too short (some less than 1/4 of a inch!) and going to unravel soon. I'm a fisherman so I can tie them upside down with oven gloves and my hands tied on my back, but I'm also lazy and when I spend such money I don't expect to have to fix bad assembled stuff.  3) the holes are too big. this net to be comfortable should me much more dense, in fact, if you sit crossing the hammock (who does that? too short for that) it's more comfortable. someone said you could fit a grapefruit, it's true. or more. dangerous for my 3yo kid who could break a leg/ankle being caught in the net	-1
Very disappointed that the DuraCord Rope started breaking in just two years, even though we only used it for 5 or 6 months each year and stored it indoors in the winter. Need to buy a replacement and will avoid DuraCord this time.	-1
I bought two of these hammocks, and after only 14 months, one of the spreader wooden bars broke. Only one person was on it and she is around 110 pounds. I then fixed the spreader bar with two pieces of metal support and the first time someone used it, another area of the spreader bar broke. Clearly the wood is defective because this is rated for over 400 pounds. I contacted Pawley's and they told me basically to go buy a spreader bar and I am sort of surprised that there was no other option as I also then have to untie a bunch of tight knots to install the spreader bar.  I guess I expect more from a company like Pawley's who claim to be about customer service and quality -- they did not even respond with any positive words like "sorry for the inconvenience" or "thank you for being a customer and explaining their warranty".	-1
I received a Pawley's Island hammock as a gift in July, 2009 (birthday). It was the new DuraCord version. It was comfortable but the rope deteriorated and broke by August of 2010, just one month past the one year warranty, and was not in a place where it could be retied. My previous hammocks made from the traditional cotton rope have lasted 4-6 years on average. I think they have some work to do on the duraCord product!	-1
I was so excited about this arch to put over a statue in my garden. It was great until the annual flower vines I planted began to climb and pulled it crooked and I could not straighten it out.  these vines were the small Firecracker vine mixed with some Black-eyed Susan vines but the structure is just too flimsy. Although attractive on its own, I want some life growing on them. I will be shopping for real steel.	-1
A little difficult to assemble and kind of flimsy. It was missing a screw hole so it is even more flimsy! Meh, it's cute, but not with the money spent.	-1
Not even a year and the screws are rusting and it is unstable.	-1
Poor workmanship.  Welds did not hold. Came apart before assembly was complete.  Hard to assemble.	-1
Don't bother with this piece of garbage.  It made cheaply and it was a nightmare to assemble.  The picture is deceiving as it shows a vertical piece on the top crown.  It didn't come with that piece.  When I called the 800 number, I got a recording.	-1
This tri-pod trellis is easy enough to put together but it is very flimsy and cheap. When I was assembling it, some of the screws stripped the holes and couldn't be tightened. Also the screws and nuts of the top piece won't tighten enough to keep the parts from twisting. I had my boyfriend who is very knowledgeable of assembling furniture and lawn items help me. Even with very expensive Snap On tools, and buying new quality screws and nuts it just isn't worth it. I will probably have him weld all the joints together, but even then that won't solve the akwardness of the three legs. There needs to be a brace or bottom part to connect the three legs. Without any bracing, the whole unit is very flimsy, even when the legs are planted in the ground. I suppose he can weld some sort of support for the bottom legs but for crying out loud, I expected more for my money than this!	-1
Ok, This tire will never go flat,Neither will a bowling ball!  A wheelbarrow has three supports, The wheel,Your left hand and arm, Your right hand and arm.  When you are rolling your wheelbarrow and hit a bump or go over a 2x4, The shock is sent to your hands and arms. If you are using a tubeless or tubed tire,even at proper inflation the tire will absorb some of the shock.  This solid tire hits hard and you can really feel shock in your hands and arms,I am a strong man but I certainly can feel the difference.  Also note; That with age this solid rubber tire will harden,as rubber does.   When I purchased this tire I was impressed with the idea,until I used it. Now I am so sorry I took the chance, This type of tire would be great on a 4-wheel cart or wagon. But when you are the other two supports on a wheelbarrow,I really suggest a tubeless or tubed tire, And you can put some green slime in your tire to prevent leaks and flats. Green slime is sold in bike shops and most hardware stores,They even make slime tubes for wheelbarrow tires.   Good luck and really give some thought to what you are buying.	-1
Not for 5 gal pail like for chicken waterer. Cord too short. Instead use C-50P it has a 5ft cord instead of about 6". Amazon was great handling the return, 5 stars for that. Problem could have been avoided if the description included the cord length.	-1
These feeders were awkward to hang. I ended up tying the cords around the wire where I hang my feeders. The finches are having difficulty using them--although seeds fell out all over the floor when I took them out of the box, the birds don't seem to be able to pull the seed out through the holes in the fabric. I will try another finch feeder.	-1
I will never buy this particular finch sack again! Thank God I had some thistle that I could use because these are only half full and not ready to hang. I find the cost of these is ridiculous for half full socks.	-1
Didn't make it through the winter. Stop working after 2 1/2 months. Very disappointed. I would suggest you look at a different brand. This one is going back.	-1
They don't hold up .  Fall apart very fast.	-1
I was extremely disappointed with these sock feeders as birds pecked holes in them in less than one week.	-1
I have two of these in different locations;  not ONE bird has come over to them.  Not happy.  Had it for several weeks.	-1
I had hoped that temporarily replacing the seed feeder with this nyjer sock would make the sparrows go elsewhere and draw more Goldfinches. Sad to report that while the sparrow numbers slightly decreased in the 3 days it was up, enough were still landing and hanging on the sock to chase away the finches. Just this morning I woke up to find 6 sparrows hanging on the sock. That was it for me. I mixed the nyjer into my regular seed and hung the old seed feeder back up. Within minutes the finches were back. This sock would probably work better with other types of feeders in the yard to draw the sparrows away from it. I just didn't have another place to hang it where the squirrels wouldn't get it.	-1
Not one single bird has visited these in the entire season since I bought them.	-1
I was impressed when I received this de-icer. It appeared well-made and was of a good size for my birdbath. It worked really well for the first week or so, even in zero-degree temperatures. However, a week or so later it got above 50 degrees outside and the birdbath dried up in a day or so. The next cold snap I refilled the birdbath and it promptly froze solid. I can only assume the thermostats failed, and either burned the unit out or simply didn't recognize that it had gotten cold again.  Returning for replacement. We'll see if the next one holds up.	-1
This one lasted barely a month and failed.  We have gone through many  MANY  MANY of Farm Innovators stock tank heaters, buck de-icers, heated pet bowls (ranging from 50 watt to 1500 watt heaters) over the years as that is the only brand the local farm supply stores sell around here.  We always considered ourselves lucky if they made it through the season as they rarely ever do.  The local farm supply stores were always good about exchanging them when they failed but that doesn't solve the problem of going out in the morning to find that the cattle tanks, dairy goat tanks, chicken waterers, dog bowl were frozen due to another failure.  Last year we had a couple of different brands shipped in for a couple of the tanks to see how they would work and lo and behold, they worked wonderfully and lasted all season and are starting their second season with no issues.  Save yourself a lot of headaches and avoid Farm Innovators.  They simply do not have the quality and/or quality control to supply a good product.  Stick with K&H for larger tank heaters and Allied for smaller water heaters.	-1
I figured 150 watts would heat water better and have a lower setting than it does.  I guess De-icer does not mean heater...	-1
its ok not one of my better buys.	-1
not a fan. wish i could return and get my money back. I tried to pull it to a shape and it's not even close. used it this fall, but will likely toss it and buy something else.	-1
This ugly piece of plastic will keep company to your Blue Herons while they eat your fish.... I decided to build a screen on top of my pond that does not block the view but avoid predators to get to the fish.	-1
Ha, Ha, Ha!  That's what the heron's will say when they see this. They are much too smart to be fooled. Don't waste your money.	-1
This is suppose to scare Blue Herons away.  Well first day it was installed my wife looks out back by the pond and the real Blue Heron is standing right next to this one still eating fish out of my pond.  Not worth the money.	-1
Don't use it for seed for cockateil	-1
This feeder is a great idea with a poor design. Firstly, it does not fit either of my parakeet cages. Secondly, it leaks seeds due to poor design. And thirdly, it fills with husks just as any other feeder with a tray does. So the advertising is false. I had to do several modifications for it to fit and then fill the gap where seeds fall through. It cannot be turned open fully as directed, since seeds spill out without restraint. But turning it mostly closed does work... with the gap filled in. It could be great but for people who are not handy with tools and do not have materials lying around to modify, it is a disaster.	-1
This was something out of a Cracker Jack Box.  I was extremely disappointed.  I purchased this to clean a child's small plastic pool.  I would NOT recommend this product, it was a waste of money.	-1
The bag kept falling off when I was using this vac, so all that got vac went right back into the water.	-1
Its not very sturdy and the bag falls off at times. I attempted to use this for a plastic pond that admittedly had quite a bit of dirt and leaves at the bottom.  The bag filled up after 5 seconds.	-1
It is a cheap design, not worth the money. The hose pops off the head if you leave it under-water very long and spills all the debris out back into the pond. Has little suction. Would not recommend.	-1
Sadly, it doesn't work that well, even with very high water pressure.	-1
This unit is too light duty for an above ground pool.  Maybe OK for a spa, I couldn't say.  The Velcro on the bag fails as the bag gets full and dirt is released back into the pool water.  Also, a shutoff valve at the hose end would help.	-1
The nozzle where the hose is connected broke the very first time I used it. Very poorly made, comes without a handle, and it very flimsy. Make it stronger and more sturdy and you will have a good product.	-1
I tried this gadget on my 12.5' circumference pond and am returning it for a refund.   The suction is only intermittent, perhaps because it needs to discharge clogs. The bag is too small, detaches from the base, and grit clogs the Velcro making it difficult to close. Dumping and cleaning the bag requires turning off the water.	-1
I purchased this product to do light cleaning of a goldfish pond (8x10) before winter set in. As others have mentioned (and is advertised) there is no pole to attach the vacuum, but I have several telescoping poles, so didn't order another. Problem is, the adapter is much larger than standard poles, so you will have to purchase a special size to fit. Secondly, the suction is very light, and didn't pick up much of the heavier debris (small pebbles, etc). It did pick up some "muck" but nothing substantial and the small bag to sift water/debris is so small it isn't practical to use (unless you don't mind emptying every few minutes). The suction power wasn't too impressive, but that could be because we have a well pump, and it may not generate enough water pressure. Of course, you won't know that until you try it. I would not suggest this product if you are looking for a small vacuum to do a light pond cleanup.	-1
The product is mostly corn, and the squirrels in my yard aren't eating the corn so it was a waste of money for me.	-1
It's cheaper to purchase Russian sunflower seed in the large 25 pound bags and cracked corn and mix your own, adding peanuts in the shell. There were only about 20 peanuts in the 10 pound bag of Kaytee that I bought. Very disappointing.	-1
THE SQUIRRELS DO NOT LIKE IT...THEY WILL EAT THE SUNFLOWER SEEDS BUT YOU CAN FORGET THE CORN..I ALSO BOUGHT WILD BIRD SEED FOR WILD BIRDS,SUNFLOWER SEEDS,MILLET, PEANUTS AND SUET...AND THEY DO NOT REALLY LIKE THE CRACKED CORN EITHER....SO THE BIRDS AND SQUIRREL'S ARE EATING ME OUT OF HOUSE AND HOME, AND THEY EAT TOGETHER..LOL..ALSO BOUGHT PEANUTS AND FRUIT FOR THE BIRDS....NOT KAYTEE(ONLY FOR MY PARAKEETS)..OTHERWISE NOT WORTH THE MONEY AT ALL.	-1
Critters - squirrels, chipmunks, large birds prefer the cracked corn that I buy at my local supermarket for about $2.99/3lb bag. This stuff lasts for days - the cracked corn is gone is a few hours.	-1
Ordered this and my squirrels love it... tbe bad part is bugs grow inside the bag.  Once out they multiply. .. for the past 5 months have been battling them. Horrible things they are. I used to love this product... but over time learned the hard way. Guess I will go to sunflower seeds. ..	-1
My husband laughed when I showed him what I ordered for our squirrels, as we raise corn on our farm. He also got the last laugh because this bag was old and the corn smelled musty. Our squirrels won't touch it :(	-1
The squirrels would not eat it and neither would the birds, I think the food was too big, and the squirrels prefer sunflower seeds.	-1
Birds won't touch it.	-1
I bought this hoping to get some red cardinal birds in my yard. but only got crows !!  Sure wish I had just bought a package of cheaper seeds. at the local store. !	-1
bag ripped open buy local	-1
When I was opening my bag, I noticed webs in the paper sealing the seams of the bag. I am familiar with this, because I have parrots (this was for the wild birds) and these are webs associated with moths. I thought I would clean those seams and that would be the end of it, but when I did, very little tiny beetle like bugs started falling out all over the floor!!! I have never encountered these before! Not only that, the seed had expired in March! I checked the seed and the little bugs are inside the bag also. Given the expiration date, I am not surprised.	-1
Should have known better than to buy this, but the finches, cardinals, sparrows and mourning doves that flocked to the no-waste seed in my feeders were eating me out of house and home, so I thought I'd try something cheaper, and let the spoiled brats work a bit harder for their dinner. Bad move. Within an hour of filling the feeders, the birds had flicked 3/4 of the seed out of the ports and onto the brick floor of my terrace. The doves have been walking around ankle-deep in the mess, pecking unhappily at the seeds. The smaller birds have not figured out a way to crack and eat the stuff, and have flown off to find other food sources. Even the occasional mockingbirds, bluejays and starlings have no interest in it. Adding insult to injury, there are instructions to keep the contents of the bag away from air. But the bag is just heat-sealed, without the re-sealable top that many brands feature. I'm off to order more of the pricey no-waste seed. I guess you get what you pay for.	-1
The birds don't like these.  I bought these because supposedly all types of birds preferred them, but that's not how it's working out.  They come to the feeder, wrinkle their beaks in distaste (metaphorically, at least), and then fly off...	-1
Old, brown and stale seeds. Bag appeared to have been sitting a shelf for quite some time, as well. Will not buy Kaytee again. Going back to the fresher Wagner's safflower seed, which also has the zip top closure.	-1
Birds would not touch this stuff.  Ended up buying regular bird seeds and mixing it up.	-1
This is a good product, but for vegetation I found it to be too expensive.  I've learned that the generic powdered products say from Ace Hardware are much less and do the same thing growth wise.  If you want your plants to yield better, research for the best products for bloom or flowering and save your money on the vegetative phase.	-1
Poor quality, owned by Miracle-Gro, subsidiary of Monsanto.	-1
Very hyped product! Spent $100 on grow, bloom, karma, silica blast, camg, hydroplex. Still no fruit on my pepper plant. Stems tend to break very easily. Also fed my outdoor hops plant with old solution. Only that plant got eaten up by Japanese beetles. May be coincidence. I recommend dynamic grow and bloom. Cheap and effective!	-1
Didn't find them useful for more cooked on food.	-1
Overpriced for what it does.	-1
Overpriced, and not that useful	-1
There is NOTHING this thing does that a wet paper towel doesn't. In fact, a wet paper towel works better! Turn it on after not cleaning from last time, let it heat up, wet a paper towel or two and run that towel up and down - crap comes right off.	-1
These are so soft they don't seem to be able clean anything with respect to a grill. The sponge part is too light to hold much liquid, and the scrubbing material on the bottom comes apart too easily.  All I can suggest is to use them up and move on to something useful.	-1
This looks like just the thing for your George Forman type grill.  I was excited to get it.  But it really isn't any better than a regular sponge with a scrubber.  After using it a few times I realized that when a push a little on a regular sponge it conforms to the shape of the grill.  So, even though this looks like a great idea, it's really no better than what you already have.	-1
I should have saved the money and purchased regular sponges.  These "special" sponges didn't last as long as I had hoped and they really didn't do a better job.	-1
This was a really good idea, but it just doesn't do the trick. The sponge is not sturdy enough to handle getting the stuck on food off the smooth places let alone the crevices. If Scrunge made this product then maybe it would work. I would not say this was cheaply made, but it just isn't a tough enough material to do the job it was engineered to do.	-1
These things are junk.  Very lightweight.  No internal bearings or bushings.  I smoked one in one mowing of the lawn.  I put it on a JD 445 with 54 inch deck.  The metal adaptor actually melted the wheels hole from friction. Wheel then fell off.  I took the adaptor and bolt from that melted wheel and placed it in my original equipment JD wheel (bolt and adaptor had failed in that one) and it works now.  Wheels are made of low quality plastic.  Might be fine on a small lawn mower with a small light deck.	-1
I'm a first-time rose grower, and it was a very rainy season.  Immediately my rose started showing signs of black spot.  I tried spraying aggressively with a natural concoction of soap that was NOT working, the black spot was threatening to take over.  I gave up on the organic route and found this All-In-One solution.  It stopped the black spot in its tracks, it really did.  I had been afraid I should also spray in addition to this, but I decided to sit it out and see what happened, and sure enough, my rose is happy.  I just hope I'm not killing any beneficial bugs by using this product.  Admittedly I'm a bit of a nature-gal and I hate doing anything that will harm the environment in any way, so I feel a bit guilty for using this product.  But the rose likes it!  EDIT:  I used this once for a rose bush that had black spot and it did work. But I never used it again after I looked up the ingredients and found that the pesticides in it are definitely a neurotoxin to bees, and prevent them from being able to navigate back to the hive, therefore contributing to colony collapse.  When I mentioned my guilt to a very green-thumbed and Green-minded friend of mine, she said "oh, just use sulphur, works great on black spot.  And you can try copper too."  So I just hadn't used the right organic method.  So, just FYI.  Because I'd like to think most consumers would really prefer to try to prevent colony collapse if at all possible, rather than contributing to it!  Or at least KNOW that they are contributing to it.	-1
returned	-1
I've tried this for 2 years now and don't think it keeps disease away like spraying.	-1
don't believe all these five star reviews, I've gone through two bottles of this product and have black spot still coming out on new growth.	-1
No result after 3 weeks.	-1
We did the bayer last year and this, last year I thought it worked well, so I reordered this spring, with 30 roses I thought this would be great, it really didn't work very well this year I have enough left over for 2 more treatments, but will not use it, it worked well on 8 of the 30 roses, The other 22 not good, I would not recommend this product on more than a couple of roses, and especially not hybrid tea roses. We have had to spray most of our roses and cut them way back, good idea doesn't work	-1
I had used this product successfully until I read that it killed bees. As a bee keeper I have to ask that every one try to find another way to keep your roses healthy.	-1
This is a systemic product.  The poison works its way into the blossoms, which is killing off the bee population.	-1
Did not notice any benefit from using it	-1
This product contains a nicotine based product which has been proved to kill wild and domestic BEES. Do not use it on any plant which has a flower that bees visit. Better yet don't buy or use it!	-1
Please do not buy this. It works, but it's suspected of killing whole colonies of bees. America's bees are being destroyed at the highest rates ever, The National Resources Defense Council reports 42% of bee colonies collapsed in 2015, and before that, since the mid 90's bee colonies have been in decline world wide. Is it just a coincidence that neonics are the most widely available pesticides in the world, and just happened to come into existence around the same time?  EPA research says it's not:  [...].  If interested, see also [...]  The bees are struggling to survive a deluge of next-generation pesticides called "neonics" unleashed by multinational chemical giants like Monsanto, Syngenta and the German aspirin company, Bayer  the world's largest manufacturer of these bee-killing chemicals. One out of every three bites of food we eat relies on bees for pollination. Neonics are also used to treat seeds, to make them less susceptible to rot, but the dust that is raised kills whole colonies of bees living near by. We must stop this. Honey bees provide honey but also pollinate coffee, blueberries, apples, oranges, lemons, cherries and many more, 1/3 of the food we eat, are at risk and will become much more expensive if they must be hand pollinated.	-1
I bought this and remembered someone mentioned there was some evidence this is harmful to bees. Guess what - it was true. Please don't buy this. I noticed very few bees on my roses. America's bees are dying at some of the highest rates ever, struggling to survive a deluge of next-generation pesticides called "neonics" unleashed by multinational chemical giants like Monsanto, Syngenta and Bayer  the world's largest manufacturer of these bee-killing chemicals. Why is this a problem? One out of every three bites of food we eat relies on bees for pollination. Tell the German company Bayer's CEO to save our bees and stop selling highly toxic neonic pesticides in the U.S	-1
I was really excited to use this all in one product,but totally disappointed to read the small print---NOT FOR CONTAINER PLANTS.	-1
it didn't work	-1
Does not do what it claims and does not kill insects.	-1
My 2 rose bushes (white Grandiflora) had a light case of powder mildew so I switched from the Bayer pellet to this. After 2 treatments in 3 months, I no longer had to worry about fungus because I no longer had leaves!!! All of them dried up and fell off, including my flowers. It's obvious this product burned my roses! I don't know why this happened but both roses started to die. The morning dew caused the fungus and of course, there's nothing I can do about it besides using a copper fungus control by Ortho. I wish I had never used this because my roses will take awhile, if ever, to recover. I followed directions exactly so it was not the user's fault. I watered the correct ratio of water to concentrate in at sundown. No one mentioned this but the label states that you can only use it 3 times a year. To (try to) revive them, both got a gallon of Miracle Gro for Roses (I think it's the very best!) and I added more mulch to help stop heat stress. Last year, they were so beautiful so this was sickening and I would NEVER recommend this product to anyone!	-1

But I never used it again after I looked up the ingredients and found that the pesticides in it are a neurotoxin to bees, and prevent them from being able to navigate back to the hive, therefore contributing to colony collapse.  I don't think consumers are aware enough of these issues, and that there are actually natural remedies, which are easy to google.  So, just FYI.	-1
Root burns, stunts growth, and makes leaves deformed. I tried it 2 years in a row and both times caused major problems.  Its better to amend soil and use red worms.	-1
If I could give this product a minus 10 stars, I would. There is now very strong evidence that chlothianidin which is in this product is one of the pesticides that is affecting honeybees and contributing to colony collapse disorder. This US has yet to ban this pesticide, but it has already been banned in other countries. Avoid this product and any others containing clothianidin.	-1

Since the trap is a waste of money, these pads are also a waste of money. Maybe you can glue them onto your wall and hope that a fly lands there.	-1
I ordered one for me and one for my son to go in are storage building because the feral cats slept there  neither of us caught the first flea  dj neilson 280 wheeler rd gray, ga31032	-1
This bend was not due to damage from shipping but its original packaging is too small for the pads.  They have change the packaging so it looks new and updated but the pads do not fit so when you take them out they are bowed. These need to go under a plastic grid so they now stick to that and will not lay flat! I have them currently under a large stack of books but really this lacks some basic common sense.	-1
I got the trap and refills for my daughter and hate it .If you really want one that works get the round one VICTOR I have both but I love the Victor one it really works.	-1
All this did was make the ice green.	-1
So disappointed in this product.  Spread the pellets two times a few hours apart and the snow didn't melt at all, not even where the pellets dropped.  What a waste of time and money.  Do not recommend.	-1
Doesn't melt ice in really cold weather, like -20. :(	-1
Safe for pets should be good, right? No. It doesn't melt ice very well -- it just drills little holes downwards wherever the granules fell, leaving the rest of the ice solid around it. And it DOES melt concrete. It's damaged my patio. I'm going back to Morton Saf T Plus, which costs a lot more but works much better.	-1
This product did not work very well on the ice.  I am trying to find a good direction of use from other people who are claiming this product is good	-1
I bought a big jug of this at Costco recently, and I have used it 3-4 times. There was virtually no difference after several hours (even overnight!)I just ended up with blue ice and en empty jug.  It should be noted that it was better than nothing, because the little blue balls seemed to improve traction on top of the ice, but I am pretty sure I could have gotten that with sand or kitty litter at a fraction of the price.  The most recent example was yesterday. when we had freezing rain all day, resulting in 1/8 - 1/4 inch of ice on everything. Beautiful but treacherous to walk on. I generously covered my front steps and walk, and there was no difference after 2, 4, 6, or even 8 hours!  Since several reviews noted that this product works by melting holes in the ice so it can be removed easily, I  tried using one of those ice choppers (straight flat blade on the end of a pole, like a hoe without a curve) after several hours and again this morning.  It was as if I was chopping ice with no treatment on it whatsoever.  Given the number of good reviews, I plan to contact the company to see if I somehow just got a bad batch of the product, because it makes no sense that my experience with this product is so drastically different from others that have reviewed it. .	-1
waste of money and not worth using. this product does not melt anything but a lil pin hole where the pellet goes, you have to use an entire bucket just to do a small area. it maybe safe for pets but not for the wallet.	-1
its ok, but doesnt really melt the ice. will not buy again	-1
While I like the concept, did not perform as well as others.	-1
Doesn't work as good as other ice melt	-1
Bought this at local pet shop and will never buy again. Does a horrible job actually melting ice! Not recommended.	-1
Super-expensive, sub-effective. Got this to melt ice on a north-exposed walkway while minimize tracking of salt into the home. Failed on both counts. About 6x the price of much better melters.	-1
Perhaps it is pet safe - but guess what? It's snow and ice safe, too!  Makes a charming pastel-dotted mess on your sidewalk and porch, right above the ice is has no effect on. None.  Tried this junk in St. Louis, MO - February 2014. Dreadful weather, just like most of the country. I don't usually use these products because they are so bad for the concrete. Based on the great reviews, I thought I would give it a try. (Even after shoveling, there's always a thin layer of ice or snow that's difficult to see and remove.)  Two hours later, the snow, ice and "Safe Paw" pellets are still there. Just waiting to break someone's ankle.  Don't waste your money.	-1
I bought a jug of this at Petsmart and hadn't used it much, but with a layer of ice from melted snow making the concrete patio slick I put it to work.  I applied at a rate that would be fairly heavy for most salt products.  The granules dissolved and had very little to no effect on the ice.  Today I applied it very heavily in 29 degree temperatures and an hour later it had a minimal effect.  Unless this stuff goes bad with age, I'd have to say it's worthless (still can't believe others say it works down to 2 degrees).	-1
You have to use a lot of the stuff to melt any ice, for the price I won't buy this again, if it was 10 dollar cheaper I'd give it more stars.  I used a handful on a tiny patch of ice and it only melted the exact spots the little pellets landed, it doesn't spread out like rock salt.	-1
Doesn't seem to have much effect on the ice and snow on my driveway, even though I applied it pretty generously, and temperature is in the 30's.  It's a little better than nothing, in that it breaks up the ice a little bit, and it contains a traction agent that makes the surface somewhat less slippery.  Incidentally, it attracted robins to my driveway to drink, a very unusual occurrence for us.  Maybe they like the taste.  I don't know if it's good for them.	-1
Well, I purchased this last week thinking it would be a just in case since I live in Texas.  Then two days ago we had an ice storm.  My driveway slants so bad that you can't get in or out.  I put this on the driveway and it did nothing.  I mean nothing.  I should have just taken a $20 bill, shredded it and put in on the driveway. Maybe it's good for light fluffy snow but I would say...buy something else.  I have time to write this review because I am still stuck in the house with an iced up driveway. :(	-1

Just chlorine and acid will fix any pool problem. Don't waste money on anything else.	-1
Tried to use to help clear up our cloudy pool. All the pool levels were perfect before adding it. We were told to use it to help clean up all the dead algae. Used the entire bottle over 3 days and some stuff settled to the bottom of the pool and then it became cloudy again. Added floc instead and vacuumed up the rest....	-1
I purchased the Big Bloom Liquid Concentrate for use in my patio garden. In past years,  I've been notoriously bad about fertilizing my plants. This year,  however,  I decided that because everything was being grown in pots,  I would make the effort to fertilize more often.  I don't know if I got a bad batch,  if the product is diluted down,  or what but I seriously have FEWER blossoms on my veggies than EVER!  I'm really at a loss as to how this can possibly happen. I've been using 2TBSP per 1/2 gallon jug & honestly can say my plants look worse than when I used the cheap blue stuff. I'm SO disappointed.	-1
Product came to me with an expiration date of 2009!	-1
This was a complete rip-off. It was very clear that someone emptied out half of this fertilizer and filled it with water and possibly sand to imitate the normal sediment this product typically contains. I don't know what the deal is this seller usually pretty solid but this was a complete and deliberate scam. The directions say 1/4. Cup for an extra strong feeding well that only tested at 500ppm when it clearly should be at least 1000ppm leading me to the conclusion that someone emptied the bottle out and filled it with water and sand. Total scam do not buy.	-1
it all leaked out on everything else.	-1
Hate to be the web blanket here but I am truly disappointed with this product.  I had previously read all of the glowing reviews about it which is why I bought it. I followed the directions carefully using just 1 oz per 2 galls of water, shook it up well and  made sure I only sprayed  in the evening when the sun had gone down to avoid leaf burning. I've been using it about  once a week and sprayed everything in my garden.  The only change in my plants have been one plant dead and various others showing signs of leaf burning or wilting.  I have stopped using it now and will hope that some of the plants will make a recovery with plenty of watering.	-1
Used this for 2 weeks at the recommended dose and it burned my plants. Checked the reviews  and found that others have had this problem too. Sounds like the recommended dose is way too high. Still waiting to see if the plants recover.	-1
good service but just buy yourself some worm casting and make a compost tea. Fox farms SUCKS and anything cleated is a joke.	-1
no pouring spout!	-1
I bought this tool hoping I could use it to adjust the carburetors on My Craftsman trimmer and Poulan Blower.(previous review) None of the bits fit. Don't buy it for this. I am returning Other than that, the tool is good quality.	-1
Did not fit the carburetor. So it is a paper weight and not very good at that either	-1
use people are listing the same stuff this is not for small carburetor,s  junk i cant even use this.	-1
Kind of flimsy and not terribly attractive. I was going to use it for a storage cabinet in my greenhouse, but didn't really like it. It's now in the garage where I don't have to look at it. The doors don't work easily, so I use it to store stuff I don't use very often. Would not purchase again, nor recommend this.	-1
These are absolutely beautiful cans and exceptionally functional.  Unfortunately, my first can was damaged in shipment and had to be returned.  After a few months of waiting for them to be back in stock I received my second watering can.  This item appears as if it were painted with a broom.  In a nutshell, if you want a functional watering can that will likely last forever this is for you.  If you are looking for something with excellent craftsmanship that reflects the one hundred bones you shelled out I recommend looking elsewhere or purchasing in person where you can inspect the quality personally.	-1
I purchased three of these bulbs at one time November 16, 2010.  One blew the first week of December and I discovered another blown this morning.  That is 2/3s of the bulbs wasted.  I have 8 lamps and all 8 burned Hortilux before buying this brand. It may cost more but in five years I've never had one blow. I replace based on age, not function.  Anyways, I strongly suggest not buying this product.	-1
Stop working in less then 24	-1
We tried a round with these.  Just buy Hortilux.	-1

bulb worked for 2 months and stopped working all of a sudden. Stay away from this seller invest in Ushio or other brands.	-1
Worked well for a couple of weeks and then water would not come out of the holes in the center of the spout.  It would trickle out from the outer holes.  I've checked for clogs but found none.	-1
This product works well for watering the planters on my patio.  Unfortunately, the little downspout adapter, which is what I mostly use for my planters, cracked where it slides onto the can after only two weeks.  The label states the product has a three year warranty.  The product is made in England by Haws and imported into the USA by Bosmere.  Neither company's website indicates a warranty or how one would get a replacement part.  So I decided to wrap the spout with plastic tape and keep it.  However I am disappointed by the quality, considering what I paid for it.	-1
This watering can was not a quality can.  It was made of the same cheap plastic that you would find at a dollar store .  Parts did not fit together well.  Don't waste your money on this..	-1
I must have gotten a defective one because it would not operate as advertised. I returned it and spent a little more for one of the Haws metal watering cans. Very happy now.	-1
This was a replacement for the original exterior sending unit for my weather station.  The original failed to report humidity after a couple of years so I bought one here. This one failed after one week - no humidity report.  Also, it recorded temps in Celsius and not Fahrenheit.	-1
Doesn't work with the La Crosse Technology 308-145B Black Wireless Color weather station.	-1
This rating is based on an apparent defective unit.  Though the LCD screen showed bit temperature and humidity, but my receiver could only pick up temperature transmissions.  Furthermore, I placed it about 40 ft away, well under the 80-ft advertised range, and the receiver could not pick it up until I moved it closer.	-1
I wanted to replace an older sensor that seemed to be malfunctioning after several years,  I purchased2 2 sensors.  Now I have  1 outside and 2 inside for each level of my house, Unfortunately the new sensors read in Celsius.  No luck finding help in the manual or online.  I have been waiting 2 weeks for technical support to respond to 2 different requests for assistance. Just received a response from La Crosse.  These sensors do not have the ability to be changed to Fahrenheit.  If you want Fahrenheit you better check before you buy.  The picture on the site shows 50 degrees and 40% humidity.  I assumed it was Fahrenheit because 50 degrees Celsius is 122 Fahrenheit!!!!	-1
Update  3/16/2017 This thing stopped working a couple of weeks ago.  It read 0FL.  It's never been outdoors.  We use it in the attached garage to keep tabs on plants we keep stored there during our South Carolina winters.  Our temps have been in the 60's-70's daytime, so no rush checking it out.  Then it got cold again.  I figured bad batteries, but not so.  Surprisingly, the unit was rusty inside.  But from what?  As I stated, it's never been outdoors, nor near any water source.  The batteries checked good at 1.55 volts.  I tried another set, same thing.  What is with this product?  I keep buying these things and they keep failing, this time while kept indoors.  Why rust?  New batteries, good batteries, rust inside the battery compartment.  The only thing I can figure is I was sent a previously owned unit that had been used outdoors.  Now that I'm past the return date it's another La Crosse Technology (???) unit in the trash.  Considering my base unit is still good but I've been through several of these outdoor sensors, I would not recommend this product to anyone.  The concept is certainly good, but the engineering and construction is poor...and expensive for the consumer.  It's a bad investment in the long run. 11/6/2016  Well, here we go again.  We ordered two last time so we had one at the ready.  The second of those has bitten the dust.  Battery compartment is okay.  Battery is okay.  It just doesn't work.  If we didn't have receiving units already we might try another brand.  So here we go again.  And I still wonder...what makes this thing cost $30?  It should be 10-12 at most.  12/7/2015  Another negative note: This thing reads 5 degrees lower than the actual temperature.  A mercury thermometer right next to it reads 33; this reads 28. Because we're avid gardeners, knowing when there's a hard freeze imminent is important.  This sensor is not a useful guide for that purpose.  Several nights we covered our plants and turned on sprinklers when there was no need. Previous units were of by a degree or two.  This one is really bad.  ANOTHER UPDATE 10/16/2015 Had to purchase yet another one.  The failure rate on these things is awfully high, especially considering it's supposed to be an outdoor device. On a positive note the new one reads in F instead of C. On a negative note the price has gone up.  There's about 5 bucks worth of parts in this thing, if that. I use it to send info to two weather monitor/clocks.  Setup took a few minutes and we're back in business. Kept the rating at three stars because it should last longer than it does, especially for $30.  UPDATE: It's a good thing I purchased 2 of them.  The first one failed after a few months. One star removed from my original rating...  Based on other reviews I've read here it seems I'm not the only one who received a unit that reads in Celsius.  It's no biggie.  I travel abroad occasionally and it's not totally foreign to me.  However, others should be aware.  In most cases this unit will be outside and so its own readings won't be of any consequence.  Both internal gauges read in F, so it's all good.  But I do have to knock off a star for a less than perfect product.  BTW, I purchased two of these to have a spare.  Both read in Celsius.	-1
There needs to be someway to decide if you get Celsius or Farhenheit.  I of course got Celsius.  I emailed La Crosse and there is no option to change it.  You get what is sent.  The temp does show up on my in house base as F, so it isn't a total loss, just can't have it outside with the unit.  Update 6/14/13 - Not much luck with this unit.  If temp is between 30-60 it seems to do ok, anything out of that range and it is sometimes way wrong.  I keep it on the side of the house that gets no sun and the other day when it was 78 degrees, it said 105.  This product has pretty much been useless as a replacement for original that came with the home base.	-1
This product has very little documentation and as returned immediately after I tried to configure it with the base station. The LCD screen is very small and the contrast is insufficient to easily read the numbers except when a few feet directly in front of the unit. The inability to synchronize with the base station and the poor readability were killers. The lack of documentation (i.e. what channels does this use, maximum distance, etc) with the product or online was horrible.  Something to be avoided unless you are a do-it-yourselfer with your own equipment to figure out what should have been in the manual.	-1
We recently had a BBQ with a large group, so I hastily looked for a small, portable grill to augment our larger (non-portable) one.  I found this unit for about $35 at a local grocery store and decided to purchase it for the event.  It does take some time to assemble, especially if you try to use the simpleton tools provided.  If you own real tools, it will be a snap.  After assembly, it became clear the unit cooks fairly hot, even when set to 'low' on the gas dial.  At the setting, the thermometer ( a nice feature) registered around 400 degrees when cooking a batch of corn on the cob.  I had to keep turning them to avoid any burning, but luckily everyone liked their corn partially carmelized (browned).  I was so happy with the unit, I used it for the next few times I BBQed.  One annoying problem was the starter cable kept falling off the bottom of the ignitor.  So, I had to reattach it to get the sparking device to light the burner at times.  Then, one day, the burner just wouldn't start.  I replaced the gas cannister, which I'd already done once before, but still no flames.  I listened closely when turning on the gas, and it was evident that there was nothing passing through the valve.  So, I tried yet another cannister and had the same results.  In the process of attaching and removing the last cannister, the flimsy control broke off the rest of the gas line tube, rendering the whole thing useless.  So, it worked well when it worked with a few minor flaws, but it's not something I'll buy again even at a bargain price.	-1
wok is coated with a hard plastic not coated with oil as video shows. it cannot be washed off. i searched online for answers and found customers were sand blasting, using sandpaper, caustic chemicals or burning it off. i have spent 6 hours on the inside of the wok and finally got it off, the outside is harder and still working on it. also their video shows it as a turkey roaster yet they attach a warning not to use it as a turkey roaster. i checked their website and the wok is 'not in stock' , I think they are aware of the issues and need to get rid of the bad woks. bottom line, buy only the burner, get your wok elsewhere.	-1
Net very stable.	-1
Although it would might work for a really short person or someone with better leg strength, this item was much too low to be effective for my use.	-1
My wife tipped it over twice in the first hour she used it.  She has no balance problems, but this thing requires acrobatic skills to keep it upright.	-1
This item was not high enough for me. I also felt very unsteady on this. I gave this to my sister and she hated it too. Great idea, needs to work out the construction and balance. Yuck!	-1
This may be a good product for people who have a good sense of balance.  I purchased it  from Woot thinking that my husband would find it helpful for gardening.  Unfortunately, the first time he tried it, he went a..  over teacup on the grass  :(  I thought I might find a use for it indoors, perhaps to clean the bottom of cabinets, etc.  but even for me at 105 pounds, it just seems too likely to tip over.  We are both seniors so it just may be that our ability to balance is not what it used to be but I can not recommend this seat.	-1
We purchased this garden rocker 3 years ago.  Why wife was weeding the garden and it literally exploded.  The very sharp pieces of broken plastic lacerated her legs in 5 places.  One laceration was approximately 6 inches in length.  I was surprised at how sharp the pieces were.  The weight rating was 350 lbs. I can't tell you what she weighs (I value my life) but it is "no where" near that much.  Please consider an alternative garden seat.  This has the potential for very serious injury. 08/09 Sent letter to Manufacturer Vertex International.  They telephoned me personally and were very concerned about the failure of the product.  Offered refund, alternative item, and also offered to have their insurance carrier contact us for any damages.  I must admit they were very responsive and sincere.  Amazon also contacted me by telephone and said they were going to contact the maufacturer as well.  I am surprised at the response by Amazon and the manufacturer.  Restores ones faith in Customer service.	-1
Not what I expected. Kit had only one (round) file & was missing the necessary flat file. I returned it and purchased a complete kit with two files.	-1
This trap did NOT catch ONE single flea! I put it on my bed, where my flea bag (cat) loves to nap. NOTHING. Waste of money.	-1
it's fair	-1
Worthless trap has not trapped one flea in 5 days my dog still has fleas all over his body have gone back to flea drops	-1
I have several of these flea traps and several of the Victor's Flea traps.  They do attract fleas and if the fleas jump on the pad they stick.  I bought the Victor's model first and was amazed at the number of fleas stuck to it in a short time. (I've also found flies, weavils, June bugs and roaches stuck to it).  However, the Victor's traps are not very attractive when you can see all the dead bugs stuck to it, so I bought some of the Springster's flea traps.  With the plastic grid/cover over the sticky pad, you don't see all the dead bugs so it looks nicer (also bigger bugs would not fit though the grid so would not get stuck to it--could be good or bad).  The problem I've seen is that the fleas sometimes jump on the grid and don't fall all the way down to the sticky pad. Quite a few times, I've seen them land on the grid and jump right back off. I've started turning the grid sideways and moving it down so it only covers the bottom portion of the sticky pad and uncovering the area directly under the light (I also use a binder clip to make sure the grid doesn't come off in case a pet messes with it because I have come home to find a glue pad stuck to a curious cat---they are not easy to remove).  If the open spaces in the grid were bigger, this would be a more effective product.  I'm getting a couple more of the Victor's flea traps (I have them in every room, sometimes 2 in a room). They aren't as nice looking, but I think they work much better. I'm having a big flea infestation problem so I'll take function over beauty.  BTW: I've also noticed that the flea traps with brighter lights attract more fleas, so get the brightest bulbs you can find when you have to replace them.	-1
Device placed next to dog's bed for one week; did not catch any fleas whatsoever.  Conclude this item is a hoax.	-1
First it is NOT that easy to read.  I was fooled by the brand name.  Worked for 4 years in salt pool then got too cloudy to read.  All I could find for a replacement was cheap junk.  I would pay a lot more for a good one, but could not find.  So I got another of these,  after the first month the pool got up to 95 degrees and the Pentair glass tube turned completely brown, wasted. I know it was 95 degrees because I own a Technician's infared/laser aimed hand held thermometer. It is the kind used in industry and automotives to get a reading at a distance.  Now I still need a working, dependable pool thermometer.  35 Years Technology Teacher,  3 College degrees,  USAF Vietnam Vet.  Good Luck in your search.  OH, BTW  I did try a few of the remote radio thermometers, not a good experience.	-1
the metal clips holding the thermometer caused the whole thing to be unreadable due to rust covering the whole scale	-1
Not even close.  When the thermometer arrived it read 95 degrees I the pond.  I thought maybe it had been Ina warm place so checked back 110 in the pond with swimming fish and plants etc. Right now it is 45 degrees air temperature outside and the thermometer reads 75.  Vendor refunded money and didn't even want me to send it back.  The design is nice with a float that is easily attached or removed.  Too bad it doesn't work.	-1
The Leaf Hog did a credible job, all parts worked, but now the motor needs new brushes and they don't sell them. Nothing else wrong with it; lacking a simple $2 part and it is now unusable. I will go with another brand.	-1
I think I know why this was discontinued. First it does not tell youi how many square feet it will do. Second you have to apply it twice a week for 2 weeks. Third the granuales do not spread easily, almost like the stick together and clog the dispense hole. Next time I will look for a liquid that does the same job. The area coverage may be better and it would be easier to spread, I will never purchase anything from this company again.	-1
Doesn't work in a camper stored for 6 months in the woods . This didn't deter any critters at all	-1
Did nothing to repel mice. The old fashion snap trap worked way better. Wood trap was located right next to shake away.	-1
I tried this product twice and didn't solve the problem.  I had voles in my lawn put the product out as directed and it did not work.	-1
I liberally sprinkled this product on the ground around my vehicle, and also put on some of the flat surfaces inside the engine compartment. Recently I noticed some mouse damage to the heat/noise insulation under the vehicle's hood. On closer examination I found the the mice had actually packed many acorns along with a significant amount of Shake Away granules into the nest it had created in this insulation. So much for it being a rodent repellent! Besides smelling horrible, to humans at least, this product does not appear work.	-1
This summer I had rats in my garden eating my tomatoes for the first time ever. I was able to catch about three of them in a rat trap until they became wise to that. Being desperate, I looked for some other cure and read positive reviews for Shake Away Rodent Repellant Granules here on Amazon. So, I tried it.  Don't waste your time or money! This stuff was totally ineffective! It sounded like a plausible idea, but it does not work. The rats pay no attention to it whatsoever!	-1
This table looks terrific, is easy to clean and folds up for winter storage. BUT... move yourself sideways on the bench and it feels flimsy, as though it's going to collapse. I'm thinking I should have bought the more expensive version. Live and learn. I would not recommend to a friend and I would not purchase another one.	-1
VERY DISAPPOINTED!  Not a cheap purchase and I expected more.  Great idea.  Comfortable.  Great for kids and family picnics.  But so upset with dents and scratches upon opening package.  UPS left it in a rush on the ground... must've dragged it there.  Too much to put together or take apart and ship back so I'm looking at this every day, annoyed.  Should have paid $15 for special delivery.  If dented, it is hollow inside so you can't bump out.:( I would not buy.	-1
We haven't even had this table 2 years and already the top and seats are crazed and cracking.  It sits on my patio, semi-protected from the weather and mostly, it sits there unused.  We sit/eat at the table a few times each year, just the two of us.  Yes, it is exposed to the weather, but is protected some, especially in the winter, when we cover it with a tarp.  We paid a lot for this and expected a much longer lifespan.  The plastic is too thin.  One other annoying thing is that the plastic table/benches are statically charged.  My clothes/hair stand out; dog fur, grass, dirt jumps on the table and is difficult to remove, as it is so statically charged that it sticks to your hand, if you do manage to get it off the table.  The shipping was bad; as others have said.  It is not the fault of UPS, rather, it is the packaging.  This very heavy table is just shipped in an inadequate strength carton.  This may be fine for bringing home from a local store, but it is NOT FINE for shipping cross country.  Mine arrived with the box totally ripped apart into pieces that UPS taped back together, as best they could with (no kidding) about two or more rolls of packing tape!  Yes, my table was scratched some, I was not happy about it, but the thought of trying to return or exchange it and having to try to tape the mess of a box again was just too difficult, so reluctantly, we kept it, scratches and all.  I think it would be better if shipped in two boxes.  Disappointed.	-1
While the table itself is nice however it arrived in a box that looked like it had been in a train wreck.  Table itself has a couple of minor dents.  I'd certainly not buy from this company again.	-1
UPS left this table at my front door with both ends of the box open and contents coming out.  I'm an environmentalist at heart so the idea of swapping this out for a new one didn't appeal to me.  The legs and top had minor scratches, but not enough to justify the bother and waste of a product return.  Assembly is easy with a screw driver only - takes about a half hour.  What I didn't like is that the plastic on the frame is so thin in spots that most of the mounting screws don't tighten down.  In other words, they strip.  The screws are not critical for structural support but over time the seats could loosen up. With a molded product like this, it would be easy to simply mold in thicker plastic where the screws go.  Disappointing.  Otherwise, table is level and attractive as advertised.	-1
Putting up was fairly easy. Installed on my redwood deck. After two seasons, the roof started to sun rot and before I knew it, there was a gigantic raggity hole in the top right side of the roof. You know how plastic looks when it falls apart from sun rot. Nothing I can do but take it down and throw away. Very disappointed in this PlantHouse. Should have lasted longer in my opinion, or at least that was what I had expected. I live in area of moderate weather. Yes, we have a month in summer where temps exceed 105 and can drop in winter to below freezing. It doesn't snow and we're in a drought in northern Calif. Yes, it was exposed to full sun. Save your money and buy something with glass panels.	-1
Purchased one of these from my local hardware store.  I liked the idea of having something to protect my winter veggie garden from the sparrows while also helping it grow faster.  In theory, this greenhouse would have been perfect: it's easy to set up and readily portable.  It has a number of advantages over my current strategy of using bird netting.  Unfortunately, the poor quality of the product caused me to return it to the store after three days of use.  Out of the box, there were some areas where it appears machining had caused some minor tears/holes but not so bad that it was worth returning at that time.  However, the zippered door fit poorly and wouldn't close all the way without straining the stitching and it eventually tore within the first couple days.  The plastic panels are all sewn together with wide, single stitches that break easily.  Based on the results of a couple days, it was clear this would only last one season, if that.  And I live in an area with mild winters--I imagine this would fail even more quickly in an area with persistent freezing temps.  This is an expensive item if you consider that you can buy a cheap nylon camping tent for much less and the tent will have more precise fit and stronger stitching.  No, you can't use a tent as a greenhouse but I think it's evidence that better design and quality control isn't an unreasonable expectation at this price.	-1
lets water out too fast	-1
Useless... won't work trashed after 24 hours	-1
After looking at these on Amazon at two different prices, I chose the higher priced item thinking it would be better (wrong !), they are made in China and sometimes they work a little and other times not at all.  Do not trust these to keep your plants watered.	-1
I'd buy again because I have bought them before. I should return them, to get better value, however, this is my 3rd attempt writing a honest evaluation of my order and two have been rejected, so I hope this one goes through! I often read the reviews and think it is important for others to know the truth.  UPDATE (7/29): I tried one and it's a dud. I am requesting a refund from vendor, but it may be too late, so will NOT buy again, if I can't return them for a refund.	-1
Crap	-1
Not so good for my situation	-1
Very tricky system to get right. Dont buy these without the adapters and hoses.	-1
I'm not sure these ever worked, but they came apart quickly for sure.  I was using them in a potted plant on top of a pond filter, so there was a constant water supply underneath.  Perhaps it was the  moving water, or that I had to remove the pot every few weeks to access the filter - but I'm not confident these little guys worked.  The plant didn't die - but I was always putting these back together and trying to get them started.  They were empty whenever I popped the caps.	-1
First the package arrived on time But with no instructions. My husband figured it out by trial and error.  When they work they work great for a day or two, but they become clogged by the soil.  We went on a short trip but still used a house sitter. One plant did very well but the other would have died had the house sitter not watered it. I used 2 of the spikes in each pot since the pot and the plants are quite large.  When they work they're great but I will not trust them for even a few days without someone checking on the plants.	-1
can't get them to work.	-1
Absolutely worthless.  Put four in a plant and it does not suck enough water to stay alive.  Only water leaving reservoir is through evaporation.	-1
Mine caught fire while I was using it. Fortunately I was in the same room when it happened. No it did NOT set something nearby on fire. The actual unit caught on fire. I had a tank in the right side and the left side was without a tank. The fire started on the left side. I own both this unit, and a single cylinder 9000 BTU unit, and they are both fantastic as far as heating performance. Sadly I will never trust them as a safe indoor source of heat except in the most dire emergency situation when my life comes down to either deffinately freezing to death or possibly death by fire or explosion..I strongly hope Mr Heater fixes this known issue before someone gets hurt or killed. 2 stars instead of 1 because I will hang on to tham for use outside because they work so well when they not in flames.	-1
There is evidently abig production problem happening with Mr. Heater Big Buddy. I have one of the "old" ones, bought in 2016, and it works fine with hose 273704. But now I have purchased (and had to return) TWO of these units in succession which will NOT light the pilot with an identical hose connection. There seems to be a problem woth the regulators on the side connectors, as I can see the piloits blowing out due to excess gas flow through their orfice. Im about to try the quick-connect, on the theory that a pre-regulated supply will be a work-around. BUT, get your return tickets warmed up!!!	-1
It works well, but it stinks when it is operating.  Even with an open window in the RV, it still sets off the smoke/LP alarm.	-1
Does it work? Kind of. When it is kicking heat it's a decent unit, but the small bottles of propane last about 2 hours which is nothing when you think of the cost. I bought the external adapter for a large propane tank. When I went to connect the hose the heater broke. They replaced it for me. I tried to do it again and was worried I'd break it again so I asked a friend for help. He read the instructions and then proceeded to break it. I sent it back at that point. It's very fragile.	-1
It has been about 1 year and overall I am pretty disappointed with the quality of this product.  About a month ago the igniter went out, and now the fan is also going out.  I spent decent money on this and I expected a little more reliability.  At least the heater part still works for now.  In the spring I may see what it would take to replace the igniter and fan.  Probably not worth the shipping cost for a warranty claim, if it is even under warranty anymore.	-1
I purchased my 'Big Buddy' in November of 15 and used it once to play card games with some buddies while ice fishing.  We had -19F temperatures last night and I grabbed the 'Big Buddy', put two canisters of propane in the unit and lit the pilot light - that was it.  It would not light.  Nadda. So I went to Mr. Heaters website to troubleshoot and the directions on what to do were written to create problems rather than solve them.  After following their 'troubleshooting directions' I blew out the lines with 30lb of pressure from my compressor as instructed and still nothing.  I switched out the propane canisters just to see if they were the problem and they weren't.  I do not like leaving negative feedback and do so very sparingly but this thing is garbage.  That is my take and I know that it goes against the grain of so many positive feedbacks for the unit but I assure you that I am not a paid rep leaving feedback to get you to buy garbage :)	-1
Great little heater... use it every night on our porch... keeps us toasty...	-1
Bought it at a rural king for about 100 bucks about two years ago. Used it a grand total of 20 hours during the winter. Put it up in a tote. Next winter I brought it out to test it and set it up in case of an emergency. The handle that turns it on is rusted shut and won't open and you can't turn it on. The mr. heater company has agreed to replace the unit and see what happened to it. I will redo my review. Three stars pending the new unit.  ....AND they never bothered to follow up with a promise to take the unit back and replace it. Ended up fixing it myself. Chinese garbage, do yourself a favor and buy a generic unit They all come from the same factories in china, the only difference is mr, heater slaps a name on it and an extra 30 bucks.	-1
Difficult, and eventually impossible, to start.	-1
My husband didn't read the one, two or three stars before buying this.  Lesson learned!  The heater would not stay on!  We tried all the settings and it would shut off in the first 5 minutes...regardless if it was high, med or low.  Reading the negative reviews...Someone mentioned the heater would not work if the temp around it was lower than 40 degrees.  Excuse me...why is it a heater?  Returning it.	-1
I purchased this to give supplementary heat to my house in order to save on my heating bills and to heat my Sprinter van/RV when visiting relatives for the holidays.  I purchased the extension hose to attach to a 20 pound propane tank as well.  After purchasing the heater, I read all the paper work and safety instructions and found the heater to be almost useless.  In order to use the heater it must have an open window to provide plenty of oxygen for combustion.  It also says that it should not be used in a bedroom or used while sleeping.  The propane tank cannot be taken indoors so the line must be run through a window or door if you want to use the heater inside.  But, none of that is the major problem.  The worst part about this heater is that leaving a window open lets in oxygen but it does not sufficiently let out CO otherwise known as carbon monoxide also known as the silent killer.  After setting up the heater I ran it on 50% power with a partially open window during a recent cold snap.  The room it is in is 14'x18' and the house is not well sealed anyway.  Plus, I had the door open to the rest of the house with a ceiling fan running in the room.  When it was time to go to bed I turned off the Mr. Heater and turned on my small electric heater.  By morning, when I woke up, I had a massive headache from carbon monoxide poisoning and I was cold because my little electric heater is insufficient to keep the room warm.  I didn't associate my headache with carbon monoxide until later.  First I turned the Mr. Heater back on to warm up the room.  Then, I went to Walmart to pick up some food.  When I got home my headache was feeling some better.  I then spent a few more hours in the room with the heater running and my headache returned with a vengeance.  Then I noticed my dogs were acting sick as well one of them even threw up.  This got me thinking.  I wondered if my unusual bad headache and sick dogs had anything to do with the new heater.  So, I looked up carbon monoxide poisoning online and there it was.  Headache, nausea, flushed skin color...  I turned off the Mr. Heater and opened all the windows wide open on both sides of the house to get cross ventilation going.  After about 30 minutes of letting the cold outside air blow through the house I closed the house back up and tuned on the central heating system.  It may be expensive to run but at least my central heat won't kill me.  My headache got better as time passed and I felt pretty much back to normal the next day.  I certainly will not be using this to heat any indoor environment in the future.  After doing more reading online it seems that this type of heater should not be advertised as being able to heat indoor spaces.  Letting oxygen in the room does not prevent carbon monoxide poisoning.  Further reading about carbon monoxide research showed that this type of heater is not able to heat a room to a comfortable temperature without exceeding safe CO limits.  Tests show that no more than 3600BTU of unvented gas heat can be used in a 200 square foot room and that is with sufficient window opening to ensure one complete air exchange every hour.  And, this type of heater should be used for no more than 4 hours due to the build up of Carbon monoxide in spite of the ventilation.  That makes this heater completely impractical to heat an indoor space.  In addition 3600btu is not sufficient heat to heat that size room with that much ventilation.  This unit should be thought of as a gas powered camp fire and used only in open areas where the carbon monoxide can fully escape the area.  If anyone would like this brand new only used for a day heater I would love to get rid of it.  Otherwise, I will use it to heat my outside patio if I feel like sitting outside when its cold out.	-1
My dad is on his second one now, after one winter of use heating up his "smoke room". We are trying the filter addition so hopefully it will last longer then just one winter. Other styles of heaters are just to strong and kill the oxygen in the room this unit has a great ability to heat the room and not over burn the fuel. Long term has some issues	-1
wouldn't stay lighted for more then 15 minutes Brand new out of box,  new hose and 20lb tank pcs of junk	-1
I have had mine for over a year now. I read the manual and got the filter and and adapter hose for bulk cylinders (BBQ style tanks) When it was new it would take forever for the thermocouple to get hot enough to allow my to turn it on without the pilot going out. Then if it was at all windy it would shut down, not blow out, but it would click off due to the thermocouple getting cold. Then the whole startup procedure would have to happen again. Sometime later the thermocouple just got stuck in the on position so I could immediately light the burners, sure this was unsafe, but I was using it outside and it sure beat having to relight it a few times an hour Now the thermocouple is working again and it goes out after about 3-5 minutes, regardless of the wind. When it works it works great and is much better then the round style as this generates most of its heat in infrared. This means if you are outside most of the heat is radiated towards you, and does not go up in the air.	-1
I just did an on line review of this product.  After reading several other retail site reviews by buyers, I do not plan to ever own this product.  The oxygen sensor appears to be the primary issue.  Too many posts say the unit refuses to light or won't stay lit.  This is the same technology as those rotten mosquito control devices that run on propane.  Stay away from these products if you want to keep your blood pressure down and not waste your money.	-1
Sadly, I have to give this product 1star.  Looks great but all the reviews indicating paint coming off are 100% correct.  Not worth $149 ...save your money and pass on this one.	-1
UPDATE:  3 months later outside, the paint is wearing off under the lions spout int the shell.  Waste of money!  It's pretty, easy to hang.  There was a small crack that is not too noticeable, but a pain to return, so I kept it.  The pump did not adjust, no matter which way I turned it.  Not the best quality for the price, but it looks good.  Pretty sure there is no way to replace the light, so that is a nice feature that won't last.  I would not buy it for the price again.	-1
Very nice fountain for the money.  Doesn't look like resin.  I don't care for the cord showing so I am going to hide it with a plant as soon as spring arrives. Happy with my purchase. Update: I am having problems with the paint peeling off. The first fountain started peeling within a few weeks then they sent a new one and it's done the same thing. Looks terrible. It has ugly pink showing all over. Lamps Plus told me it was probably because of high humidty when I called them about the first one peeling. It's an outdoor fountain. You would think it could withstand outdoor conditions. I've had to take it down becasue it has become any eyesore. Not happy.	-1
I gave it 2 stars because they did not eat the plants all of the way  to the ground but they did eat the flowers and newest growth on top. This was on "deer resistant" plants too! We must have tougher deer here in Big Pine Key than elsewhere.	-1
Too much work.	-1
Sorry doesn't work	-1
Doesn't work all of the time.  We also have to spray it way more often than instructions describe.	-1
United Industries (Spectrum Brands) replaced this concentrated 1 gallon version which made up to 16 gallons of Liquid Fence with a 1 gallon version that makes only 10 gallons. I wrote to them asking for an explanation and their response was "United Industries prides itself on manufacturing quality products at value pricing; for all consumers. Due to the increases of manufacturing costs, it has been determined that most consumers prefer a decrease in coverage area; rather than an increase in pricing. While the coverage area of this Liquid Fence container has been reduced, the product performance continues to remain as effective as its previous formulation" I don't see a similar price increase for the Liquid Fence that is pre-mixed, so the explanation seems a little weak. If you also want to tell them that consumers are not quite as dumb as they may think, their e-mail address is consershare@spectrumbrands.com and their phone number is: 800-332-5553. If you want to find alternatives, you may want to view a cost analysis of deer repellents from Auburn University - [...]	-1
Did not keep deer away from eating my apple trees	-1
Does not last long.  Deer still munched on my bushes.	-1
Just as I thought, it is pretty much worthless. See attached photo after 3 applications and no rain.	-1
The deer have gotten used to it. We spent a fortune trying this stuff and after 2 months it was like a salad dressing to the deer. We wrote a letter of complaint to Liquid Fence, they told us they would refund for 4 of the 12 quarts we bought, been 3 months and we've gotten nowhere. Screw them for lying!	-1
I wish I could leave half star. Terrible product. Did not work at all. Bunnies actually laughed at me.	-1
works if you spray 3-4 times a week anything less and it doesn't work, also it smells bad. what is the point if you cant walk around in your own garden because of the smell.  also and most important it kills some flowers. I sprayed it on my all my flowers in the front yard and the next day they started to die. its like acid to them. as you can see in the pictures, the yellow flowers started to die as soon as i sprayed them. the red flower was spared because it had not blossomed when i sprayed.	-1
Very smelly and has to be mixed up in large quantities.  It's worth paying more to get the premixed spray bottles.	-1
This item is probably effective, but when I used it, it left a white residue on the plant that was noticeable from a distance.  Many of the plants on which I use deer repellants are used in flower arrangements.  In order to get the white residue off the cuttings, I had to wash each leaf individually.  So, if you are interested in using the plants you spray this on in floral arrangements, my recommendation is to use another brand which does not leave a residue.	-1
In contrast to the other reviews, after 3 applications, it made absolutely no difference.  Rabbits continue to eat away.  No deterrence whatsoever.  Also, sprayer was hard to use and cap came off and sprayed my wife's face.  That said, rabbits ate garlic we put out as advised on the rabbit forum, so we  may have nuclear harden rabbits.	-1
Didnt work for rabbitts	-1
Rabbits ate the flowers that I just sprayed this 3 hours ago.  Returning.	-1
This did work to keep the deer away, until the natural vegetation dried up and all that was left to eat were my flowers. By then all my flowers were in full bloom. I think I got to witness the blooms for about a week before they were eaten. I had such high hopes, now very disappointed that this product did not continue to detour them. I'm sorry I wasted my money on this product and all of the flower plants I bought. Maybe in a wetter greener area this product would work, where the deer had other green plants to eat year round.	-1
Does not work for rabbits!	-1
This was used as directed.  There appear to be more rabbits than before its use.  One rabbit was partially consumed presumably by a coyote.  For ten years we have never had deer in our yard. This morning two deer walked across our property.  We have had some intermittent rain, but then the liquid fence was re-applied.  Based on limited use, I cannot recommend this product.  But if you like rabbits, this product may work for you.  So this wouldn't be a complete loss, we sprayed the stuff on the walls of our back porch.  It appears that the birds don't like it so we have less bird poop on our outside furniture.	-1
Useless. I tried it on squirrels. Just get a one way door.	-1
does not work	-1
it says `just spray and your problems go away` yes i sprayed and my tree dried and dead now..no more problem	-1
I have used the gallon size ready to use spray before, and I ordered this one, but the spray is completely not working. I end up transferred all the liquid into a different spray bottle.	-1
This product has no affect to the unwanted rabbits that terrorizes my yard.	-1
Does not work very well.  Critters, such as chipmunks, seem to really enjoy munching on the plants now with this new 'flavor' product.	-1
Rabbits still ate things sprayed heavy. I wouldn't buy it again. Lost a lot of flowers due to rabbits eating my plants	-1
Nozzle did not work.  The liquid inside has no odor like it was just water.  Have bought in past and was fine.  I contacted company.	-1
The deer ate everything no matter if I used this or not. Would love to find something that actually works for this.	-1
I have tried and tried to use this product and if you can get it on the plant, it works. The problem is that it is time consuming to use, as it needs to be carefully strained or it will plug your sprayer. Guaranteed.	-1
I used the entire bottle this morning all over each plant and all over the lawn. In addition I did the perimeter inside and outside of the fence where the rabbits enter. By this afternoon there was a pesky rabbit eating my new lawn! I live in So Calif. For me it was a complete waste of money!	-1
I considered the rabbits a nuisance mostly - the veggies are tucked in their poultry netted beds and an occasional nip to a flowering plant sacrificed to nature's harmony wasn't going to bother me. That was until I returned from a spring weekend away to find the peonies decimated just as they were setting their buds. So I ran out and bought Liquid Fence - choosing this product over others so the dogs (who had never shown any interest in the garden truth be told) wouldn't feel unwelcome. Since a single "liberal application" (words from the instructions on the bottle) the rabbits haven't been back. Unfortunately, Liquid fence left an unsightly white powder on green foliage. The same delicate foliage so attractive to rabbits was either set back or killed by the product: creeping phlox died outright, bee balm and other flowering plants yellowed and stopped growing, terminal foliage on the rhododendrons just turned brown and withered. And because the dogs' noses led them right into the flower beds, a few young plants got trampled as well. Next year I'll try a granular product that keeps all animals (dogs included) away and hope for better results.  A word about the smell: truly gag inducing! Disposable gloves are recommended. You don't want to store this stuff inside.	-1

Works best in spring and late fall. Quite ineffective in summer and requires frequent reapplication. The company, by the way, simply deletes negative reviews from its website. This past winter, with regular application, the product was useless. Some of my clients have found limited effectiveness; others have found it virtually useless. Wherever predation is bad, building a fence is the best approach (and even that may not work).	-1
1. Unit was incomplete -- middle rack supports missing from _sealed_ parts bag inside _sealed_ manufacturer carton. Had nine extra sets of screws and nuts, however, probably to make the bag pass a weight-test.  800 parts number only open during business hours on weekdays, and no way to order missing parts on the Brinkmann website.  General impression is shoddy QC, and no attempt to compensate by making obtaining missing parts easy.  2. No temperature control, and unregulated temperature way high for true barbecue smoking (should be 210-230F, was somewhere north of 300F).  3. IF this unit had a thermostat, or some other intrinsic means of regulating the temperature, it might be OK. As it is, I am basically going to have to redesign it in order to make it minimally useful.  4. OTOH, it was cheap, ($59.95US at Lowe's) and even after enhancing it with extra parts (an oven thermostat) it will probably still cost less than than a "real" smoker.  IF this unit had possessed competent temperature control and all of its parts, it would be a 4-5 star bargain. As it is, it is pretty awful.	-1
While the smoker itself provides a large volume of room for food, it suffers from two major issues:  1) The bottom base has no way of attaching to the body.  When carrying, you have to bend down all the way and grab hold of the base... and it's just... awkward.  You're telling me you couldn't add a simple couple latches so I could carry with the side handles?  Nevermind, I'll custom add them myself....  sheesh.  What good is a vinyl cover if you go to grab it by the handles and only half of it comes along?  2) It will lose heat with the slightest breeze.  The temperature fluctuations will add significant time to cooking.  I had to fashion a wall of materials together to prevent a very, VERY light breeze from dropping temperatures up to 30 degrees at a time.  Also, the top rack cooks slower than the bottom rack, with a temperature difference of around 20 degrees.  Consistency is important in cooking temperature when smoking.  While it's ok for a young novice who's learning to smoke and doesn't want to spend a lot of money, you'd be better off spending the extra $100-$200 to get a better sealed system with temperature adjustments.  Otherwise a 6-7 hour pulled pork cooking time may turn into 9-10 hours... with very hungry guests.  (Note: A Maverick ET732 Dual 2 Probe Thermometer was used for determining temperatures)	-1
I purchased this smoker to replace the "Cooking Cajun" smoker that I had used for over 20 years before it finally rusted out and became unusable.  This smoker which is supposedly a "step above" in quality from the "Cooking Cajun" is much "tinnier" and does not fit together tightly.  There is actually a gap of about 1/4 inch around the top and the body.  The steel is also of a MUCH thinner gauge.  My recommendation, shop at a retail store first before ordering any smoker from Amazon.  On the positive side, shipping was fast.	-1
The smoker is much larger than it appears on the advertisement so make sure you have room for it.  Mine came with the shipping box in shreds and the product was dented and damaged; I returned it and as usual, Amazon was very efficient in handling the process immediately.	-1
It rusted out right away. The charcoal burned right through the metal in fact. Also, the temperature gauge broke within a few uses.	-1
Bought two of these after seeing orioles at our humming bird feeders. The bottoms of each are made in two parts that screw together. The problem is that both of them slowly leak out through this joint and will become empty overnite. They are worthless!<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Opus-449-2-Oriole-Feeder/dp/B0002Y62W4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Opus 449-2 Oriole Feeder</a>	-1
This is a honey bee killer. Nothing more. The built-in openings allow beneficial honey bees to enter and drown. Last summer and due to the Southern California drought, I had hundreds drown in this feeder. Just one feeder and it was filled with bees.	-1
Very small bottle opening.  Will be hard to clean.  Finally brought this out to use it 9 months after I bought it.  I had bought it as a back up to another one I had that was getting ready to fail.  Unfortunately it is too late to return it.  The seal between the upper and lower molded pieces was bad during manufacturing and when screwed together leaks or weeps.  Most of the nectar is lost while hanging.  More specifically the top half screws onto the bottom similar to a mayonnaise jar.  The contact between the two, when screwed tightly together, fails.	-1
So much for the bee guards. The very first day, the feeder trapped over 10 bees inside! I will attach photos if I can figure out how.  Apparently, the small springs that hold the feeder holes closed are very sensitive. You can easily misalign one by accident just via careful handling and cleaning!  I do not recommend this feeder if you have bees / wasps in your yard.  In order to salvage this investment, I plan to put electrical tape or duct tape over the port that is easily opened, to see if I can use this feeder with the remaining 3 ports. If not, it's completely useless to me.	-1
I purchased this feeder last year, but didn't get any orioles until late spring, as usual. I bought it so they would leave the hummingbird feeder to the hummingbirds. I agree with the other reviewers who say this is hard to fill. I figured out that it will sit upright in my kitchen drain (minus the stopper) while I fill it, but then I had to purchase test tube cleaners to clean the inside of it. What a pain!  The first time I hung it I noticed the level of syrup going down, although I didn't see any orioles. I checked the feeder, and the syrup was leaking all over the back patio. Thinking this was "user error" I threw out the remaining feed and reassembled it. Same problem. The birds do use it, but over half of the contents leak out.  I'm going to try a different feeder.	-1
Leaks terribly. The screw threads are poorly designed.  I tried Teflon tape to no avail Should have returned it. Never again!	-1
I was so excited to give my orioles their own feeder so they would leave my hummingbird feeders alone. This Opus feeder has ports that have plastic springs behind them to open up. Since the ports would move a little to open, it would terrify my orioles! They're very shy birds and this feeder was a waste of money. They all quickly went back to my hummingbird feeders.	-1
We were having problems with bees taking over the hummingbird/oriole feeders & this sounded like a great solution. Unfortunately, the unit leaked around the bottom seam. The bees loved it...	-1
I'd rate it higher but it doesn't stop the Squirrels. Does a good job of feeding both the birds and them.	-1
Four people couldn't figure out how this was supposed to stay together.  Nothing snapped into place, nothing held any part of it together.  It just fell right back apart.  We never could get the lid on either.  I normally like Rubbermaid stuff, but this is a piece of junk.  It's being returned.	-1
It does adapt a small bottle to the stove but it severely limits the output of the stove.	-1
Needed to replace for my old grill and the parts do what's intended, but they are very expensive for what they are.	-1
Not surprised discontinued. too small and too thin!	-1
This kneeling cushion was used for the sole purpose of gardening. The foam may be water resistant, but it is not very thick and your knees can feel the sticks underneath it. The foam does not have a protective coating like other kneeling pads I have used, and therefore it takes the shape of whatever it is sitting on (for instance your knees and sticks below your pad). The kneeling pad could be improved for gardening; therefore, I would not recommend this product for gardening.	-1
Too small and maybe not accurate enough. Spend a lot more $$$$ and get a pro set if you are serious.	-1
Only reason I gave 1 star is because there is no 0!  Gauges are plastic from China. Not calibrated you will have to adjust all 3. Wood is Fischer pice play school quality.  Price tag should be $5. I'm returning.	-1
I'm not sure if any of the gauges worked besides the temperature. I tapped a fingernail on the glass of the barometer once and the needle shifted a quarter of an inch. Looks nice enough, but with digital versions available for around the same price, with remote sensors, I'd opt for one of those instead.	-1
Poor quality....	-1
Fits nicely and looks good for a year or so, after that it starts looking dirty and rips easily because the s***ty fabric starts to deteriorate.  I'm going to order a new one, because there is no other better choices (and its pretty cheaply priced),  but I would gladly pay more for a quality cover that is something like my Weber gas grill cover.	-1
This is mostly my fault, as I didn't read the description completely before purchasing.  I looked at the picture & the price & I needed one so I bought it.  It is all plastic.  The blade is too thick to be sharp & so does not easily penetrate the soil like a metal one.  My mistake - but take my word & just don't buy this product.	-1
While working at a blind nudist colony I had to put up a privacy Fence that would keep people from peering into the pool area. I bought this at the local flea market thinking it was a good deal.  It's made out of cheap vinyl in China so it won't last many seasons. On top of that, you can see right through the fence vinyl so there's no privacy at all. There's some privacy slats made out of heavy plastic that are better or you can use old bricks from abandoned factories.  Eventually I was fired so I didn't care either way but realize that the fence vinyl can be cut with a knife very easily to peer in. Dog urine will also cause rot.	-1
Worked well for the small amount of gardening I've done but u fortunately after less than a year it broke. The tip of the shovel actually broke off. Like I said I rarely do any gardening with it so it didn't have heavy use.	-1
Not As expected !	-1
Dog could see through  where weave did not meet.	-1
it broke within FIVE MINUTES... not metal but plastic.  if you need a scoop, this'll work.  if you need to dig, get something else...	-1
Lightweight and surprisingly strong.  Not cheap plastic and I could probably drive over it with my car and not break it.  Oh and it digs well too.  Update- I guess I was wrong about the toughness of this.  First time my wife used it, she broke it.  Back to searching for one that won't break.	-1
Broke. Quickly. Just didn't last. The plastic spade broke right off.	-1
Lasted about six weeks, then handle broke in half	-1
will easily bend in hard soil but for 3 dollars prime shipping included you get what you pay for.	-1
I've used this for about 3 days to remove weeds from my yard. Unfortunately the blade just broke off trying to dig out a dandelion. I had high hopes for this tool It's light and I liked the idea of it not bending where metal ones might - but I expected it to hold up a little better.	-1
junk	-1
After first setting up this Gilmour sprinkler, I thought I'd found the ultimate poor man's answer to a custom yard irrigation system. It appeared to work great, distributed water only where necessary, and had long "range".  Two months later -- in the summer heat stretch -- I realized that this sprinkler has a gaping "hole" about 2/3 of the way toward the water's endpoint. This area of grass was burning in the sun due to insufficient water. To verify this, I setup four identical low-rimmed cat food dishes in a straight line at five foot intervals from the sprinkler. After running it for thirty minutes, I measured the amount of water in each dish.  Dish 1 (5 feet out) -- 1/2inch Dish 2 (10 feet out) -- 3/8inch Dish 3 (15 feet out) -- 1/8inch* Dish 4 (20 feet out) -- 1/2 inch  *The area of unsightly "burned" grass was around Dish 3.  Because of this distribution issue, I cannot recommend this otherwise brilliant sprinkler. I ended up replacing it with a Dramm oscillating sprinkler and it completely solved the problem.  I also do not recommend owning four cats.	-1
Somebody please kick me if I ever buy another Gilmour pulsating type sprinkler.  This sprinkler is relatively easy to set up, but it does not perform well for irrigular areas, contrary to what some have said.  The worst thing about it, though, is that shortly after I stopped using it it stopped turning, rendering it useless.    I have previously had four Gilmour Metal Zinc Sled Base Pulsating Head Sprinklers (Model: 967ZDGF) that I bought at Lowes.  They look great and work just fine for anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours, but they all eventually stopped turning.  Thus they are useless except to water one spot.  I have some sprinklers of other kinds that keep on turning, so it is not just something strange that I am doing.  I have used sprinklers for many years, and the Gilmour brand is the only one that has failed me.	-1
Broke on the first use.  Complete junk.	-1
plastic junk.	-1
composite means plastic garbage. no.	-1
how could you complain about 84 cents?  Not much.  But the quality as is ... may as well go wild with your wallet and buy the same kind of thing at your local 99c Store.  This time .... You get exactly what your pay for.	-1
A lot smaller scoop than I thought it would be.  It is really no larger than a garden trowel, so not much point to using it. Needs to be about twice this size to be of any use scooping mulch or other garden amendments from the bags.	-1
It didn't work much better than keeping a hose set to deliver a trickle of water, but probably helped to keep some dirt from, washing away.	-1
What's the point?	-1
Does not foam like what I used to buy. I was really disappointed with this Window and Door Foam. It was inconsistent in coming out of the gun and very inconsistent in how much it expanded. It also did not cut as well as the stuff I used to use, it maybe that Great Stuff cheapened the formulation.	-1
Needs a special dispenser top not included.  I did not read the details well when I purchased.  My bad.  Be aware.	-1
Great Stuff 187273 20-Ounce Window and Door Sealing Foam Gun   I just got this in the mail, and the description says it is a "Foam Gun". But it is not. I was reading the directions and could not figure out how it worked based on the product. I realized that it is false advertizing, and that it is not a foam gun, but just the foam that needs a separate gun in order to work.  I really needed to use it, so I used a nail to compress the foam into a bowl and used a palette knife to push it into the window. I lost more than half of it, and think I'll ask for a refund since it is not at all as described.	-1
The metal ring below the connector bent, preventing connection to a second hose. The metal ring is too thin and flimsy, do not recommend.	-1
It is suppose to be 5/8 inch hose commercial strength, well its 5/8 but it kinks, I am constantly trying to  unwind the kinks out of it, but it still kinks.    bob	-1
Item used twice, before it pulled apart when using the garden hose, with a little tug. for a 3/4" hose, (EXTRA HEAVY size,) This is the only thing I could find made of solid brass, but not strong enough to lasts a full season.	-1
I never had a hose that kinked more than this one.!!!	-1
Like some other reviewers i found the barb diameter is too small. There is a large gap between the barb and the inside diameter of the hose.  The hose clamp when tightened to its fullest extent will not prevent significant leaks	-1
the item received had a crack in it ...very poorly made and not a good purchase on my part.	-1
I purchased one of these to replace a failed Fi-Shock unit which died after 25 months service.  That unit worked OK and made a gentle click, click, click noise every second or so as the high voltage impulse was sent down the fence. The Parmak unit makes a noise more akin to a door banging shut - enough to cause a headache if working nearby.  Since the manufacturer confirmed it was supposed to make that sort of noise, I will now have to sound proof it since is installed in my garage which is also a workshop.  Even if you install this in a location where the noise won't bother you, it could well disturb any animals or livestock nearby. A low-impedance fence charger is pretty simple to make - the only part of it that's not an off the shelf component is the inductor or transformer used to produce the high voltage output.  Parmak told me the noise was caused by the laminations of the transformer's magnetic core knocking together.  Probably true and a reflection of a cheap and crude manufacturing method or design.  I've now had this unit in use for 2 months and it's almost useless.  My prior charger kept out deer 99% of the time.  With this unit attached to exactly the same fence, they get in almost every day.  The display on the unit claims an o/p voltage of about 13kV and the label says it will power 30 miles of fence.  I have about 1600 ft, few or no weeds and the o/p measured with a fence tester at the terminals is just 9kV and it falls off measurably along the line.  Bottom line, this is a badly made ineffective piece of rubbish.  Avoid.	-1
I bought 16 pounds of this stuff ... The RATS LOVE IT and keep coming back for more. They're becoming like pets .... this stuff doesn't kill them it just feeds them	-1
rats won't eat it. Ground squirrels love it. If you hate ground squirels put this stuff in a rat trap and you'll kill them all.	-1
Our resident mice love Neogen Rodenticide.  They ate it with great enthusiasm.  I guess that this product must be made from organic healthy ingredients, because it has been two months and the damn mice are still eating it with great enthusiasm. There is no sign that the mice activity has been reduced.  If you love mice, feed them with Neogen.  They love it and will enjoy their god given longivity.	-1
Cheap clipping mechanism fell off after first day of use clipped 5 branches and it's garbage.. Recommend spending more on the better commercial quality... Made in China quality control lacking.  Purchased the other longer handle version with orange handle better quality.	-1
If you prune only a few branches a year, this may be adequate. Anything more, you will be screaming with each use. The cutting mechanism gets jammed with each pull of the rope. The saw blade attachment is not very sharp, and it takes forever to cut a small limb. The pole is too whippy and difficult to control. Get something better for your arms' sake.	-1
The trap does not work.  It seems to attract bugs but they just walk over it and keep on going...they don not get stuck.	-1
Didn't seem to do much of anything. A waste of time.	-1
After struggling for years to patch the old tire I broke down and found Amazon once again had the product I needed at the lowest price. It shipped the next day and is already being used. Perfect!  Update: This was a loser! I expected this to resolve the issue I had with the last on: small leak SOME PLACE causing deflation to a point of having to pump it up before using it. The new one had the same problem. It was good maybe for 2 months before noticing it needed air and maybe 3 months before it lost all it could, meaning you had to be an expert to begin pressurizing it because it was now no longer sealed at the rims. I did find the small pin holes in the side of the tire and there is no way this could have occurred by my use of it in a trimmed yard and garden. Don't remember what I paid for it, but for the last 1.5 years I even had to fix my pump because of the continuous use to keep this inflated. Time for an entirely new 'barrow I guess. Sometimes your the wind shield; sometimes the bug!	-1
did not catch anything	-1
Useless, has not captured a single bug or spider in more than 1 month.	-1
I left it in the path that the ant usually take, for a week or more, and none got caught in the trap. Instead I tested the surface with my finger, and it was hard to wash my hand... had to use some kind of solvent, soap was not enough.	-1
These didn't work for us at all. We had an ant invasion, and the ants just walked around the traps.	-1
to expensive for what you get	-1
Several years ago I bought some Victor traps and cleaned out the roaches in my kitchen. Unfortunately whatever is in these traps repels roaches. I chased one into one and it did get stuck but little ones can waltz in and out with impunity. A great disappointment.	-1
I wish there were some type of "scent" applied so that this would work as a true BAIT for trapping this terrible little critters.	-1
We have a problem with centipedes and cave crickets in the basement.  I set these traps out for a few weeks, and they barely caught anything.  A couple tiny spiders and maybe one cave cricket.  I had much better success with the large flat glue boards.  The ones that look like mouse traps, but for insects.  The "pheromone" on these Victor traps does not seem to attract anything.  So I would recommend using the bigger flat boards.	-1
Everything about this remote rain gauge is fine, except that it wouldn't transmit data remotely from outside the house.  I suspect that the rain gauge has difficulty sending the remote signal through the walls of a house -- which is what you need to do!  I could get the unit to work fine with both the gauge and the base unit in the house, but I could not get a transmission from outside the house to inside.  I followed up with Cheney Customer service and found that the device will not transmit through the metal or brick of house frames.  This limitation should be prominently mentioned on the box!  Other than that, there are battery indicators for the both base and gauge, settable millimetres (0.0) or inches (0.00), and a large display of the rainfall.  I really wish that the system worked.  It would be fine if it could transmit the remote signal to the base unit.	-1
This thing is junk. I bought one for me and one for a friend. Neither one has ever worked, not even once. Both of us read and re-read the directions and tried to get it to work following the troublshooting method described in the manual. Again I would not take another one if it were for free.	-1
This was the 2nd Acu-Rite wireless rain gauge I've received as a gift.  Each lasted less than one rainy season...spring thru fall.  Each of them worked ok for about 3 months.  I kept an old see-thru gauge to compare.  The Acu-Rite was terribly inaccurate after 3 months.  The official weather reporting station is only about 5 miles from my house so I felt confident our rain fall amounts should be similar.  The Acu-Rite proved time and time again that it was Acu-Wrong.  A few days ago we received .80 inch of rain.  The Acu-Wrong reported .000 for 24 hours after the rain stopped.  The next day the gauge read .36 inch of rain.  The sending unit and receiving unit were approximately 20 feet from each other. The only obstruction was a sliding glass door. I have removed the new batteries and thrown the unit away.	-1
After trying three of these, this wireless gauge is a piece  of of junk It has an outside gauge, which becomes inoperative after a short time and an inside unit that also has a very short life. And they go through batteries very quickly. I kept taking the defective ones back to the store but I finally just gave up on the product.  I should have known better. Any thing made by Acu-Rite I have has been a piece of junk. But that is what you get for buying anything made in China.	-1
This rain gauge should be avoided in my opinion. Mine will not reset easily. I must remove the batteries from the outside unit before I can get it to reset to 0.0, and sometimes it won't even do that. It seems accurate other than this annoyance.	-1
This served me well for two years.  It transmitted the info through bricks, glass and metal over a distance of 50 feet for about two years until the batteries needed replacement in the exterior unit.  After that problems mounted, performance became spotty and I finally threw it away after three and a half years.  Never did like having to unscrew four tiny screws just to change the batteries in the outside unit. This by itself is poor design.  Not worth price and frustration for just two years of good service.	-1
I wanted a cheap rain gauge, but this was close to what i thought was a good choice. Works fine on a clear day but the sightest rainfall and the gauge reports low batteries. I have to reset the the reciever about 20 times before it works again to pull the same game on the next rain storm. If you want reliable rain readings, spend a few bucks more and buy an Oregon Scientific model instead.	-1
I ordered this product thinking it was the OEM basket with the metal handle.  The item picture clearly indicated this.  Instead, I get the aftermarket, pool store quality basket with a plastic handle that is almost certain to break before the end of the season.  The product images have since been changed to reflect the aftermarket basket.  Maybe this thing lasts a few years, but the fact that I didn't get what the product page suggests is very disappointing.	-1
Did not have any effect that I could see.  Bug problem unchanged.	-1
doesn't work well	-1
While we got some kill, it was nowhere near a complete kill. We have 2200 Sq ft on 2 floors so I used 6 cans.	-1
i cant see that it really did anything at all! no dead bugs found and we still have a problem with gnats in the house. bought 6 cans for 6 rooms (1 room twice). i would look for something else more potent.	-1
I thought the price was good, but the product sure wasn't. When I received the package, I first noticed how small the cans where. When I say small, these are really small; I've used this type of fogged before and these are about half the size. I thought maybe it's a higher concentration and you don't need that much, or inflation really has a tight grip on the economy.  I used all 3 cans in an area less then 700 sq ft, and before I finished setting off the last can, the first can was already finished. All 3 cans had finished spraying before I shut the door behind me.  Now in all fairness it did seem to initially kill the tiny ants I was trying to get rid of and one roach, but 3 weeks later, ants are back and I saw another roach. So I'm not too impressed, I can spray liquid around my baseboards and get months of protection with other products.  This was one of those deals that turned out to be not so great.	-1
These bug sprays / gels are a health hazard so I opted for something more effective and safe. I recommend this:  https://goo.gl/2VnMBH  ..you can also research on its other health benefts and what other people are saying about it. Hope this helps.	-1
I bombed out house and specifically our bedroom but within 2 weeks started getting bitten again so what ever the bug these bombs didn't kill it.	-1
Seems fine, so far. I've run it for 7-minutes at a time with no issues.  It is great for dusting off the lawn furniture instead of having to drag out the big one.  My wife can easily use this.  Note: There are many of these on sale in different colors and with different names, but upon close inspection, I could not find a difference.  Also, the photo is in accurate. It only runs in one direction, so to  use as a vacuum, the bag goes where the nozzle is and the nozzle goes on the side where the bag is shown.  The bag never goes on the side as that is where the air is always sucked in.  Update: Used it yesterday for a few minutes and it was fine.  Today it would not run at all. I tore it apart and the windings in the armature are shot.  No warning, no smoke, just open circuit.  It's a shame because it was perfect for the job.  Too bad too as a little motor like this isn't new technology and should run forever.  I only used it about a dozen times in the 3 months I've had it.	-1

The flies could not care less about this product.  Placed it inside a large wagon that was full of flies.  Watched them for 10 minutes and they would not even go near it.  Checked the wagon day after day and not a single fly dead in the wagon.  Plenty of live flies around the ranch though but none seem interested in this.  Total waste of money.	-1
I am trying this in several locations in our 1 acre yard with livestock. I put some in a Farnam Fly Bait Station 4 feet from the ground hanging from a tree branch above manure, as well as in little piles in other strategic locations. I check every day, and so far there is zero sign of any flies attracted to QuickBayt. There are no flies in the hanging bait station, which are supposed to fall into the plastic tray. Sometimes I watch the flies and they only care about the manure and walk around the QuickBayt like they are avoiding it. I read that you can mix Coke with the bait to create a 50% sludge mixture and then it will attract flies, but keep it away from animals. I'll try that next.	-1
So far when I've mixed it as a livestock spray, it doesn't help with the flies on the horses' legs.  I even increased the concentration.  I've started trying some other products now for that, and I plan to use this strictly as a premises spray until it's gone.	-1
Product does not work as described. Horrible smell and stained my clothing. Would not buy again	-1
I am starting to wonder where this is manufactured. We have used Permethrin for garden and chickens and dogs as flea and bug control. Seems in this years purchases we are NOT SEEING RESULTS. I also wonder why there is no odor as there used to be. Feels as though all we do is spray expensive water. I am definitely not purchasing again. I also used it straight from bottle 3ml for back of hounds and the fleas are having a field day. Like to see an MSDS or GCMS report on this to verify my suspicions about it being strictly a cheap Surfactant. I wash dogs with Dawn and the fleas come off, this however does absolutely nothing. Frankly i feel ripped off wouldn't mind if someone here replaced my money and I'll go with a diff. product from diff. manufacturer.	-1
Does not knock down flies on horses. I mixed normal strength, then double strength in a spray bottle for horses. The flies came right back.	-1
I have used worm castings many times. these are terrible stunted every plant grown in the mix  I mixed 2 batches of potting mix exactly the same except in the second batch I substituted the castings for DR earth vegetable garden soil. ALL the plants growing in the castings mix are stunted all growing in the DR earth mix is on point. I am usings LC's mix. 5 parts sphagnum peat 3 parts perlite 2 part castings. 1 cup lime per cubic foot or 2 tbs per gallon.	-1
no difference noted	-1
Did not see any improvement in my plants.	-1
I didn't find that it did anything special in my garden, nothing amazing at any point. Used it for a while then just stopped.	-1
not really what I was expecting.  thought it would be a larger bag.  didn't seem that special..	-1
I want to believed that this is good stuff, but it kill my 13 bell pepper plants, the leaves burn after 3 days of applied earthworm, the fruits and new flowers drop, like other review said this earthworm making fungus to my bell pepper plants. by the way, this item smell like chicken manure, may be I got wrong item or something wrong about the wiggle worm I got.	-1
For the price, this was not worth it. I have seen no difference in my plants after applying this. Disappointed.	-1
Dry beyond belief!!! Hopefully still a good fertilizer, but doubtful as a good source for microbial life. Highly dissapointed, was looking forward to some great compost tea!	-1
Arrived with a small hole in bag & worm castings were all over the box	-1
DIDNT MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE.. I want a refund, but how do you refund this kind of product.  : (	-1
I've used this stuff a long time and never had issues, but the bag I got here was very bad. The microbes must have been contaminated because they diseased my plants horribly killing off one mother entirely. I don't keep sick plants when they're on the way out, too many concerns over cross contamination to other plants. I had to nurse the survivors for 2 months before they snapped back entirely.	-1
I've been a gardener for forty years.  During that time I've always had dozens of thriving, radiant, healthy houseplants.  This past spring I decided to give them these organic earthworm castings as a treat when repotting after winter.  Without exception, all of my plants have either withered, died or failed to flourish.  I used the same potting soil I've used for over a decade from a small reputable source in Vermont.  The only difference this year was the use of these earthworm castings and the addition of some "aqua pebbles" from another supplier at the bottom inch or two of each pot.  Today I narrowed the source of the problem down to these two items.  Reviews of the pebbles produced no problems, only glowing comments about flourishing plants.  And here I find several reviews that this product killed people's plants.  I believe them and my conclusion is the same as theirs.  In fairness, there are endless examples of products having a bad batch and given all the great reviews, that would be my conclusion in this case.  So I'll just say beware if you use this product.  Try it on just a few plants at first.  I lost some beautiful houseplants that can't be replaced.  Hopefully I can save a six foot ficus tree that I've had for thirty years.  Though it's not the best time of year to do it, I'll be repotting today without this product.  And if it turns out that I was wrong, I'll correct this review.	-1
You cant get any info on what they feed their worms because the feed formula is patented by them. Do not buy. Make your own. Save on shipping.	-1
This is the second brand of worm castings I've used and I wish I would have stuck with the original but Amazon was out of stock. My seedlings started out completely happy and healthy then a transplanted them into a mix of this and coconut coir (I used the coir to start them and then used the remaining coir mixed with this)  THEY ALL DIED! AND my plants that I just did a side dressing of this ALL DIED!!! My established about to produce plants, my mom house plants and my seedling everything DEAD!  I also found bits of plastic and stuff in the 'castings'.  DON'T DO IT!	-1
Perhaps I'm a klutz or something, but I didn't have much success with this gadget.  Most of my pots didn't turn out good enough to use and I found that even the ones that did were awkward to fill with soil and/or line up in the pan I was using for my water tray, since the bases weren't completely flat on most.  I certainly gave my project the old college try on multiple occasions, but in the end found the little peat pots much easier to use.  The form itself is sturdy, attractive and well made and seems like it would last for countless seasons.  Apparently, others have had success, but folks should know that this device doesn't work well for everyone.  It seemed like a good idea and I worked hard to cut the needed newspaper strips to the correct size and all, but I wasn't happy with my results and ended up giving the form away.	-1
I'm sure this a typical scooper but I'm giving it one star because the product dimension size is listed incorrectly...i don't like to hand out one star review unless they are deserved, but i needed this right away and now have to wait, yet again, for the correct product ti be delivered	-1
The holes are too small.  I watched woodpeckers, chickadees and nuthatches try to get the peanuts but were not able to fit them through the openings.  Sunflower and safflower seed falls out like rain. Don't waste money on this item.	-1
Holes are to small for mid to large woodpeckers.	-1
Thought this would be squirrel-proof....I was wrong!  Squirrels hang from it and chew out every last morsel they can get to.  On the up side, it was inexpensive.	-1
I put this out and I had very few birds eat anything from this. I tried a variety of seeds and by sunflower and peanut eating birds preferred the wire feeders that hold the same type of seeds over this one. I have finally taken it down and I will be donating to Goodwill. I would not recommend this product.	-1
This is a very sturdy little squirrel feeder.  It is inexpensive, and rightly so.  It is almost useless, unless your reason for buying is to feed squirrels.	-1
When this feeder arrived the holes were clearly too small for whole shelled peanuts. So I put the whole peanuts into the Ninja blender and ground them up finer. I've been hanging the feeder everyday since and have yet to see any birds on it. I have a number of Downy woodpeckers and one red-bellied woodpecker visiting my other feeders everyday. I thought they would be all over the peanuts but they've show zero interest in this feeder. Additionally I've read that shelled peanuts spoil quickly and need to be eaten right away or thrown out so I feel like I'm just wasting the shelled peanuts (which aren't cheap). I wouldn't recommend this feeder but I will keep trying for at least a few more weeks.	-1
The day after I received this feeder in the mail, I assembled it and filled it with sugar water.  The next day I noticed the feeder was almost empty but I had seen no orioles in the yard.  Upon closer inspection I found that the solution was leaking out the bottom of the feeder.  At first I tried tightening the container holding the water but I found it did not have sufficient threads to tighten.  I looked underneath the feeder and noticed the plastic plate was partially out so I popped it in hoping I had stopped the leak.  Unfortuneately, I slowed the leak down but did not stop it.  The next step was to take a bottle of Gorilla glue and put a bead of it around the entire seam of the plastic plate.  I live 15 miles from the nearest post office so I hope I don't have to box this thing up and send it back, but I will if the glue doesn't work.  This feeder is manufactured and guaranteed by Perky Pet in Denver, Colorado.  I was suspicious that this feeder was made in Denver and after looking a little closer I found the "made in China"  label.  It is a classic piece of Chinese-made junk that companies are so happy to sell us. I'm guessing the wokers were unskilled and underpaid and possibly even kids. This product should not be for sale on the Amazon website as it clearly makes Amazon look as if it has no standards for even the minimum amount of quality.  If you have time and energy to bother with fixing this feeder yourself or if you like repacking stuff and sending it back, then it's the one for you.  I'll give it one star because it did arrive in a timely manner.	-1
This Feeder is lovely - however, mine had a slow leak that caused an ant infestation.  I reluctantly had to return it.	-1
This is a good feeder.  However, it is nearly impossible to clean.  Even on their own website the reviews support this.  It is sturdy and lasts a long time, but I won't buy again due to cleaning difficulties.	-1
I liked this, but can't find replacement part for it.	-1
It's a haven for Bees!!!  The birds cannot even  use it due to the large holes for the feeder....for the future this company should use the technology for this feeder.....	-1
I had to return this, because it arrived broken into pieces.  I had better luck on shipping with&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/C-S-PRODUCTS-CO-INC-C-S-WOODPECKER-SNAK-Part-No-820715-Catalog-Category-WILD-BIRD-SUNFLOWER-SEED/dp/B005KLYA0K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">C & S PRODUCTS CO., INC., C&S WOODPECKER SNAK, Part No. 820715 (Catalog Category: WILD BIRD/SUNFLOWER SEED )</a>	-1
I ordered one of these feeders in December for my Dad and liked it so much I decided to order one for myself. Description on the site doesn't show that the feeder had some what I felt were major changer. 1: cover is no longer hinged making it more difficult to fill. 2: suet holders are no longer enclosed which makes it easy for the greedy birds to knock it onto the ground. If these issues don't bother you then go ahead and buy one. Construction is still nice and should last a long time.	-1
This is just poorly designed. The fill hole is tiny and even with the funnel if you pour too quickly there is a second small hole that will have fertilizer dripping out of the hose connectors. The first time I connected it the contents shot out the ought the top screw cap. I managed to cram a second washer in it and got it connected at last. The next week I removed it to refill expecting no further trouble. This time the fertilizers was ejected through the bottom drain cap even though I hadn't touched it since it worked the previous time. At that point I said the hell with it. I think this would be a better product if they sealed top and bottom and made it screw together in the center with a gasket. easy to fill and less leaky connections. oh well, lesson learned. I do not recommend this product at all.	-1
had to replace the first one, this second one only leaks a tad and am keeping it till i can find one that actually works well. why am i keeping it till then? because its a lot of labor to keep filling up a watering can over and over. still, i can't recommend it. if and when i find one that works the way i want it to, i will update this review and let you'll know what it is.	-1
Leaked like a sieve, both caps and both fittings, even with gaskets and PTFE tape I couldn't get it to stop dripping.  Ended up snapping off the faucet by the end of the season, I found it laying in the dirt and water just pouring out of the faucet when I went to check the garden during a watering cycle.  The fitting was still attached to the faucet, and it broke where the pipe met the body of the unit.	-1
Poor workmanship, threads were poorly done, brass fittings wanted to cross thread every time connected, caps leaked	-1
the fittings leak	-1
2.5 stars. this hammock is strong and probably durable, but:  1) it's VERY UNCOMFORTABLE, my wife stayed 1 minute in it. Especially uncomfortable without clothing or with light summer clothing. I bought it on purpose since I am blessed to live in Florida. the cords are very hard material, not cotton like at all. so it's more for wintery weather. At that point you buy a more comfortable tissue one. so I wish I didn't buy it. but I really need the outdoor durability so I had no choice, it's going to be outdoor 24h/7x364 days a year (1 day a year I might bring it in before running for shelter because a hurricane is arriving.). I'm considering buying some kind of pad, so far could not find one good enough :( I have to shift my weight every minute because how uncomfortable it is, which is irritating for someone who works hard and got a house with a nice backyard to enjoy the dream of comfortable induced drowsiness.  2) some of the bowline knots are cut too short (some less than 1/4 of a inch!) and going to unravel soon. I'm a fisherman so I can tie them upside down with oven gloves and my hands tied on my back, but I'm also lazy and when I spend such money I don't expect to have to fix bad assembled stuff.  3) the holes are too big. this net to be comfortable should me much more dense, in fact, if you sit crossing the hammock (who does that? too short for that) it's more comfortable. someone said you could fit a grapefruit, it's true. or more. dangerous for my 3yo kid who could break a leg/ankle being caught in the net	-1
Very disappointed that the DuraCord Rope started breaking in just two years, even though we only used it for 5 or 6 months each year and stored it indoors in the winter. Need to buy a replacement and will avoid DuraCord this time.	-1

I bought two of these hammocks, and after only 14 months, one of the spreader wooden bars broke. Only one person was on it and she is around 110 pounds. I then fixed the spreader bar with two pieces of metal support and the first time someone used it, another area of the spreader bar broke. Clearly the wood is defective because this is rated for over 400 pounds. I contacted Pawley's and they told me basically to go buy a spreader bar and I am sort of surprised that there was no other option as I also then have to untie a bunch of tight knots to install the spreader bar.  I guess I expect more from a company like Pawley's who claim to be about customer service and quality -- they did not even respond with any positive words like "sorry for the inconvenience" or "thank you for being a customer and explaining their warranty".	-1

I received a Pawley's Island hammock as a gift in July, 2009 (birthday). It was the new DuraCord version. It was comfortable but the rope deteriorated and broke by August of 2010, just one month past the one year warranty, and was not in a place where it could be retied. My previous hammocks made from the traditional cotton rope have lasted 4-6 years on average. I think they have some work to do on the duraCord product!	-1
