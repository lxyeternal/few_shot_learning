OK	1
I love this toy and so does my baby. I was worried at first, there didn't seem to be much interest, but now older, baby loves it!	1
I read the reviews and was "talked" out of purchasing this toy for my grand-daughter. I didn't want another irritating synthesized musical toy. I was at a local boutique type baby store and saw the Mozart Cube on the shelf and immediately went to go play with it...I was addicted! I went home with it to show my husband and get his opinion, after all he was going to have to listen to it play over and over again too. He got addicted! I told him what I paid for it and he nearly had a heart attack. I told him my intent was to return it if he liked it and order one online...Amazon was nearly 1/2 the price, and we kept the 1st one until the second one arrived! The Cube is a Christmas gift for my grand-daughter, but I already let her play with it...she is only 12 months...she isn't going to know the difference...her mom and dad will think it is new :) shhh don't tell. BTW, SHE LOVES TO DANCE and wave her arms to it, looks like she is conducting. Oh, one more thing, I only gave it 4 stars because the wires that attached it to the packaging were strung through the cube - and we can't get them out! CS suggested that we use a pliers and put the wire...we had already attempted that without success...waiting for a new one to arrive before returning this one. We will just continue to have her use it with us until then.	1
This cube plays very synthetic sounding imitations of various instruments that are represented on buttons for baby to push. The music is slightly out of tune and definitely doesn't sound anything like an actual piano, harp, etc - not sure why they didn't just capture recordings of the actual instruments, rather than use a cheap synthesizer, but they didn't.  I have no idea how you could possibly claim this toy is educational. The sounds played don't match any actual instrumental sounds and the baby does nothing more than press a button to make it go. Maracas, bells, a small piano or keyboard, a little drum - any kind of actual, basic, musical instrument would make a much better toy, developmentally, for baby, in my opinion. The Mozart Cube requires very little effort from the child and doesn't encourage creative play.  That being said, our 1 year old does love to push the buttons and hear the music. It's exciting for him and I don't think it's a harmful toy - just an annoying one for mom and dad. I recommend looking at the musical toys Hoener makes for children if you want a toy that makes noise or introduces baby to music. There are all kinds of different options, they are affordable, and will give you more bang for your buck!	-1
love it	1
It works fine and got some life back to my son's Mustang.  Original battery held a acceptable charge for 2+ years.  If this one lasts as long, I'll be happy	1
This is a great battery for kids' Power Wheels cars. Do not overcharge, lest you lose overall battery life. What could improve this product is a charge indicator light to alert parents when the product is fully done charging. As long as you watch the clock, you won't overcharge. But when you have to leave something for 18-24 hours, it's easy to overcharge.	1
My 15 month old still enjoys this toy after getting it for Christmas when she was near 9 months. She didn't quite get it at first since she was so young, but through the months she's enjoyed pushing the buttons, watching the lights go on and off, hearing the music, and now at 15 months knowing that the different buttons do different things. My only complain is that there are a couple of songs that get old quickly, but I guess that comes with every music making toy! I like that it's colorful and the education it provides with the instruments (mommy and daddy are crazy music lovers) as well as the simplicity of the toy. Hopefully she'll enjoy it for a few more months!	1
Quick delivery! Got to replace a battery for child's hot wheels that wasn't holding a charge. Worked great!	1
Perfect for any power wheels	1
We love this toy. I bought it for my 5th month old for christmas, and now he's 9 months and he still loves it. The best part is... it's not annoying at all! Score for mom :-). It lights up and has a rubbery grip to it so i don't haver to worry about him bitting the sides of it when his teeth are bothering him. Very happy we bought this item.	1
This toy definitely keeps my 7 month old entertained. The flashing lights are very attractive. Though I have to say, the sound quality is just so-so, but at least there is enough sounds/songs on there that it does not repeat very often and becomes annoying, so that's all that matters. I have to say the toy itself is a bit heavy. My son likes to grab hold of it while rolling around and sometimes he drops it on himself and cry...	1
I'm really not sure why so many people writing the review for this product are a.) being incredibly elitist about it vs. the older product by Embryonics that no longer exists and b.) complaining about the sound quality.  Perhaps some of these parents expected the toy to be extremely loud and obnoxious like some Tickle Me Elmo doll, but I personally don't have a problem with the sound quality. Since it is made for close contact/play, it makes sense that this product wouldn't be so loud that I could hear it a mile away. And to be honest, the sound quality really isn't bad at all for what it is.  This toy is very colorful and my son (who is only just turning 4 months old), while not really interested in toys yet, holds a fascination for listening to this thing make its noises. If I put it at his feet, he will kick it just to make it turn on. He really seems to enjoy it, even if he doesn't have quite enough strength yet to really push the buttons on his own. The construction seems pretty solid (I would almost be afraid that my kid could brain himself with this item if he were strong enough to pick it up) and it came included with batteries already installed.  Children have the option of pushing one side of the cube to listen to it or adding in the sounds from other sides to create a cacophony of sound. There is also, of course, the orchestra button. If you push the button twice, it turns that particular instrument off so you can hear the other instruments. It lights up but I kind of wish it lit up more as you can barely see it in well-lit rooms.  About the only complaint I really have is that some of the instruments don't sound anything like what the represented instrument should sound like. The violin for example sounds suspiciously like an oboe and the piano sounds remarkably like a harpsichord. However, I am not so elitist that I wouldn't let my kid play with this because the sounds are different than what I would expect them to be. I realize that most people cannot discern the differences in the sounds of like instruments in most cases unless they have had a background in music education, so it's really not a big deal. If he enjoys it, then that is ultimately what matters.  However, I am giving this product 4 out of 5 stars because of this discrepancy as well as the fact that the French horn (while also sounding off) sounds really, really weak compared to the other instruments on the cube. The other instruments seem very clear and concise and yet, I can barely hear the French horn.  But, my son seems to enjoy it so far (and as I mentioned, he doesn't seem to care much for toys yet) and to me, that is worth the money in the end.	1
Based on the myriad of reviews here, I purchased this toy when my triplets were several months old.  To be honest, they did not care for or notice it until they were closer to 8 or 9 months.  At that point, they realized they could start and stop the music by hitting at it.  All of a sudden, they took great interest in it.  It was also excellent when they were just learning to sit unassisted.  They could lean forward and balance on the cube while playing at the same time.  Now that they have "figured" it out, the toy is a little less appealing.  I am waiting for the next enjoyment phase to kick in when they start noticing and playing with the different instruments.  My only complaint, and it is a minor one, is that battery life is shorter than I would have expected.  While not bad, it seems to slow down more quickly than our other battery operated toys.	1
This item has been a life saver for me!  Not only does my child love it but it's the only thing I can distract him with while dressing him (he apparently HATES putting sweaters on). I can hit one of the sides and instantly get flashing lights and music while I try to squeeze a sweater over my child's head. My child loves it because it's easy for him to hit and acheive the same flashing lights and music.  The music is good and there are a lot of different choices.	1
Always nice to have an extra.  That was the reason for my purchase.	1
Excellent battery.  Will be lying another one soon!	1
We bought this for our eight month baby girl and she seems to like it a lot! It's fun to see her reaction when the music starts up and when we turn the different instruments on or off. There's a good range of music too so we're not having to hear the same song over and over again. The cushioned corners are great too because she loves to chew on everything and we're not having to worry about a sharp corner cutting her gums or mouth.	1
This is an entertaining toy. The sound is of good quality and not too loud. Although it is not a music studio sound quality - it is far better than the usual kind of sound found in most toys. It is not annoying too for adults. It is also of good size- not too small. The edges are made of some kind of rubber material that does not easily slip or protects the toy when falling.	1
I like the features listed. The instruments have an "electronic" sound, but are close enough to tell which is which. The Mozart selections are familiar tunes. Be sure to have a precision size Phillips screwdriver to change the batteries.	1
It's a bit on the loud side, yes, but my baby loves this toy.  She smacks it, turns it around, bites the corners.  It has kept her entertained for several minutes at a time, which is a lot for my very squirmy, active little one.  Very happy with it!	1
I bought this for my 9 mo. old daughter for christmas.  I love this toy.  There is an orchestra button on one side that starts a song or switches to another song.  Each song is a classical music track.  When a song is in play you can push the other sides of the cube to add or subtract instruments.  I think this is a fantastic toy that will get toddlers thinking about music.  The best part of this toy is quality of the toy.  It is clear that the programmers put a lot of thought into creating it.  The instruments definitely sound true to what they should be.  You can very clearly tell the difference between the sound of the french horn, flute, piano, harp, and violin.  Each of the instruments plays a different part of a song and each instrument is playing a part "true" to what the instrument does in a real orchestra.  What I mean by this is that in an orchestra, a tuba doesn't just sound different than a flute, they perform different musical functions.  I love that this cube respects this concept.  The result is that the music is worth listening to and I am always happy when my daughter plays with this toy over other toys with less-pleasing music.  I highly recommend this toy.	1
Not much to rate here. It's a music box. Press the button on each side and it plays classical music instrumental. Nice bumpers on all corners so the box does not scratch the baby or floor	1
A six sided cube that offers several songs based on classical melodies.  PROS: Has a variety of instrument sounds that can be isolated, so kids can learn the difference between string and wind instruments. Tunes are easy to recognize and it's extremely durable.  CONS: We're a musical family (I play the piano, my wife has a degree in flute performance and is a composer, our oldest started piano at age 5 and our other kids love music) and our youngest kids WON'T TURN THIS THING OFF! So it plays for hours and hours and HOURS because they love it so much! (We actually burned out the first one from so much use and bought a new one -- something I still can't fathom -- because they played with this thing so much.)  It has soft, but tough, rubber edges that allow it to bounce when dropped, thus eliminating any damage to the floor, wall, etc. It also offers some interaction as the kids can push the sides of the cube to turn a particular instrument (or the entire "orchestra") on or off. It doesn't eat batteries -- as often as my kids play with it, I'm surprised the batteries last as long as they do. It's great for toddlers and those just a bit older.  However, the repetition of the songs can get a little much, so like I said in my title, if your kids like this thing, oh well, you've been warned......  :)	1
A must have for those powerwheels vehicles. Always keep a backup so when the car dies, you can pug in your backup for more fun.	1
thanks	1
Purchased this for a used Power Wheel Jeep that I gave my daughter. My Jeep runs for a long time and the battery lasts for hours. You HAVE to pay attention to charging recommendations. Charge it after use, and do not leave on the charger for my that 24 hours and you will get lots of use out of this battery and your power wheel vehicle.	1
As I mentioned in my review of the Electric Car, I would suggest you splurge and buy 2 Rechargeable Batteries when you buy an Electric Car.  The Batteries run out so quickly (and take about 12 hours to charge).  Your little one will be disappointed when the fun "runs out" quickly UNLESS you have a backup plan ready to go!  The whole set-up (car and batteries) has been a huge hit with our 4 year old Grandson.	1
This is a great musical toy.  I think it's very well made and should last a long time.  It's been dropped dozens of times and it keeps on playing like new :o)	1
This toy is great.  Not annoying and definitely a plus that there is an on/off switch.  My 7 month old figured it out pretty quickly and loves to bang, roll and chew on the thing.  She even gets excited when the music picks up and wiggles around.  Well worth the money.	1
Shows different musical instruments so baby can experience either each instrument on its own or combined with others. However munchkin did a bad job with packaging using wires to secure box to package. Wires are attached to internal part of cube and not possible to remove. Had to cut, could not pull out so had to push remnant wire into cube. One wire got stuck and may poke my child. Think will throw the cube away as it is a safety hazard.	-1
Some reviewers have commented that this is not the original Mozart Magic Cube.  Sadly, there's nothing that can be done about that.  From what I've read, this one has poorer quality everything.  Thus the four stars. The music quality is definitely lacking... I have yet to replace the store batteries, and know this can make a difference.  But it works well enough that I'm not annoyed enough to try changing them yet.  Packaging needs its own separate star rating, which would be a grand total of ZERO stars.  Holy cow!  Other reviewers complained about how the product is wired into the box.  WARNING: these people are not idiots who cannot figure out how to unwire the darned thing.  It really is abysmal how they attach this to a box.  I think a plastic zip-tie would do the trick just fine, without the FIFTEEN MINUTES of wasted time trying to disengage the wires from the toy.  My solution was to cut them as close as i could, shove them through the holes and "around the corner" so to speak, so they would not pop out again.  The disadvantage here is that they rattle around inside a little bit... but not annoyingly so, and I probably wouldn't notice if I didn't know to listen for it.  I tried shoving one end all the way in so I would be able to work the whole thing out the other hole.  This worked notsomuchthanks.  Now, I knew this was coming.  Several reviewers have complained about it.  I was HOPING that the company would have gotten their act together to fix this.  No luck.  So, if you're willing to spend fifteen minutes of extra time to free the toy, yeah, it's worth it.  You only have to do this once, after all.  Just watch the little buggers to make sure they don't pop out.  Seriously - worst packaging EVER.  Even worse that all those toys with about a ton of plastic wrapped around them, I promise you.	1
The Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube is ideal for those who are interested in introducing classical music (And the instruments that play it) to their children in a hands-on fashion from a very early age. The Cube is very durable, and the ability to change the sound by pressing the buttons is intriguing.	1
Exactly what I needed	1
Great battery and great price. These are so expensive in stores. I'm glad I found it here on Amazon. I've also learned these need to be charged BEFORE the battery is run dead to keep it operating and full of long life. And that when it's not being used like let's say during winter months that you should charge it at least once a month to keep it good. I never knew this about these. I bought a rapid charger when I bought this as well and I highly recommend those over the standard charger that comes with the power wheels. We've had this battery for a few months now and my kids can go continuously for about 6 hours before the battery starts slowing down. I haven't let them run it dead yet and don't intend to and this battery is working great.	1
the first one came in a dud, so amazon changed it in a flash and this one came and its all happy again in kiddy cameot	1
I purchased this for my daughter when she was seven months old, and it was an instant success, and so it remains (she shall be two in late December). While it is true that the music has a slightly computerized feel to it, it doesn't grate on the nerves, and more importantly seems to be (at least for my little one) attractive to the ear. An added plus: you have music without the addition of character voices narrating what instrument is being played, etc.  You can choose from hearing a small selection of Mozart's pieces on the piano, violin, french horn, harp, flute. You/your little one can combine these instruments as you wish, or, if you want to go all out, you can employ the orchestra mode.  The instrument tabs are very large, making it easy for little hands to manipulate the cube. The cube is made of highly durable plastic: ours has endured being dropped endless times from various heights and doesn't have a single crack. Also, though the cube was played daily (multiple times) for months on end, the battery did not need to be changed until about 6 months ago.  Other nice features: Bright, vibrant colors on each of the cube's sides that attract the eye. This feature allows you (as your little one gets older) to ask "could you push the blue button," etc. This helps, to an extent, teach colors and their names. Something else that is nice: each of the instruments is illustrated and the name labelled. So, as your little one pushes into the toddler years, you can teach them the names of various musical instruments while having them listen to that instrument.  All in all, I have to say that this is one of the best purchases, in terms of play value, that I have made. She adores listening to and dancing to the music. The only negative is that the cube is light enough to be fairly easily lifted, but heavy enough to give your little one a little clack on the head unless you're there to supervise. But once they're a little older and gain better finger/hand dexterity and control, you can feel pretty confident about leaving them unattended (in a play area!), as there are no small parts and the cube is very well constructed.  I would certainly buy this for a little one, especially if I noticed an interest in music. Highly recommend!	1
Love this toy! My daughter enjoys manipulating all the different colorful sides.  I would love for there to be even more different selections that play, but we are enjoying the ones that are included.	1
We like this toy.  The corners are very soft and it is very easy for a baby to turn on and off. He loves moving it around the room.  A few of the sounds could be improved. But I would buy this for a friend.	1
We ordered this toy from Drugstore.com, which showed a picture of an older model, not the new "upgraded" toy. The idea of this toy is intriguing but the actual execution of the idea is less than stellar. The "music" is tinny and unattractive. Apparently, the older model had better sound quality, which is why I went with this vendor. However, communicating with Drugstore.com and the whole return process is a significant hassle. The also blamed the deceptive picture they used on a glitch with the manufacturer.  I would actually recommend either getting a used model with all purple corners (the older model) or buying  it at a brick and mortar location so you can actually listen to it. If you are going to purchase on Amazon, consider another vendor. Very disappointed. I will not do business with this vendor again.	-1
Item as described.  Needed a replacement battery for my daughter's 4-wheeler power wheel.	1
Original replacement battery for our two quads. 1st charge and run went beautifully. The other batteries i ordered lasted close to 6 years. Lets hope for the same with this one.	1
We bought a used jeep and the battery was making it run slow. We purchased this one and its running great!	1
My children (an infant and a preschooler) like this toy--but it is WAY too loud. I wish there was a way to turn the volume down. I'd return this if I purchased it at a store, but it's too much of a hassle to return this to amazon. So sad.	-1
This toy inspires me. I messed with it constantly when my son was an infant and too young to understand how to add and subtract instruments from the full orchestra sound. Now he gets the full functionality of the toy. It lasts for years, offering various entertainments to various ages of kids. Classical music is awesome for babies and little ones, so we love this. Warning, it's very heavy. Don't put it in your backpack when traveling to grandma's (we learned this lesson). The rubberized bumpers on the corners are fantastic for safety. We're never giving away this adorable musical toy.	1
My 4 year old son spotted this toy while we were out shopping for my 4 month old daughter. He couldn't help but play with this in the store and I thought that since my baby loves music so much she would probably enjoy this. I was a little put off by the price. (I paid a bit more than it is here) but it was worth it! My daughter was totally fascinated by the flashing lights and music and I even found myself and my son playing with it together! I'm sure as she gets older, she will really enjoy how interactive it is. Such a cool toy. And the best part? Unlike many other toys that make noise, this one is not annoying at all! The instruments sound so realistic that it's enjoyable to listen to. I would recommend this and will probably give as a baby gift in the future.	1
The MOZART MAGIC CUBE, truly IS magical.  Press the "Orchastra" side of the cube, and various Mozart melodies are heard.  Press each individual instrument, and it goes silent, leaving the other instruments to play.  You can touch the individual instruments again, and hear them come back on.  The lights flicker as the music plays.  The batteries are a little difficult to change -- but otherwise, this toy is pure magic -- for anyone of any age!	1
Exactly as described.	1
works great on my barbie car.	1
I bought this battery because my children's Barbie Jeep was running a bit slow and was having a difficult time moving up a hill or in the grass. After connecting this and charging it, it has given jeep more power.	1
Nice Pterodactyl stuffed animal.  I wanted a stuffed animal to go with a book I was purchasing for a present.  Pterodactyls are not easy to find.  He was very happy with this.	1
This pterodactyl is going to be the best stocking stuffer for my 3-year old son who loves dinosaurs! Perfect size, cute, and soft! I'm very excited about Christmas morning!	1
Perfect for the grandson.	1
I love Swoop.	1
My granddaughter loved it	1
This is the best purchase I have made thus far for my new grandchild.  She has loved it from the very beginning and her interaction with it as she grows is ever changing and stimulating. She has gone from just looking and listening to it, to pressing the buttons herself and chewing on the ends as a teether and has begun to select the music and instruments on her own. It is an incredibly well designed item and very sturdy as well.  This is an excellent choice for a baby gift.	1
I was able to give this a trial run before wrapping as a gift. I loved it and am sure the baby will too.	1
I bought this for my 19 month old son based upon the reviews of others. Well, the reviews were right -- this is a great toy. The music is great, the sound quality is surprisingly good, and the ability to add/remove instruments from each piece being played is very clever. In addition, it seems to be well made, with rubber bumpers on the corners. My son loves this thing, and becomes very involved when playing with it every time he uses it. Highly recommended.	1
Satisfied	-1
very cute	1
This arrived in a timely manner and was exactly as described.  My son loves it.  He has already had Swoop flying around the house, so I think this purchase was a success. :-)	1
Great service and product!!	1
The Pterodactyl is a longtime favorite in this household. And this Beanie Babies version has been a very welcome surprise, because the design allows great sitting, and head tilts, to become a real part of the scene when playing with many animals at the same time. A few too many "Beanie Babies" are just OK, in my book, but this one happens to be a clear 10!	1
Make sure to give a full charge before use.	1
Played with this at a friends house and had to buy one for my 9 month old.  She loves it!  Colorful, pleasant music, different instruments that play alone, or together, depending on what buttons you push.  She even tried to chew on it, which was OK bcz there aren't any sharp edges or small pieces - perfect musical toy for a baby/toddler.	1
My little Munchkin is 19 months old, and her dad loves music. He plays guitar and writes songs. She has heard music since her first appearance in the womb. She absolutely loves this Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube. The minute she got it out of the box, she pushed the button and the flute started playing. A big smile appeared on her face. She started pushing all the buttons and turned the cube upside down and got the entire orchestra.  There are two pluses to this Mozart Music Cube besides the normal one of loving this toy.  1. My Munchkin has rhythm. When the music is playing her little hips and shoulders sway to the beat. She even gets up on her feet and dances 'The Happy Dance'.  2. The Mozart Music Cube serves as a seat. The circumference is just right for her little bottom, so she practices sitting.  I cannot say enough positives about this Magic Mozart cube. The music is lovely for all. The music brightens up the winter days and entertains my granddaughter. It is sturdy and the music is fine to our ears. It is wonderful to bring a smile to a toddler.  Highly Recommended.  prisrob 02-17-11  <a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Musical-Soup-Mozart-For-Toddlers/dp/B00004TXSL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Musical Soup: Mozart For Toddlers</a>	1
This is one of my son's all time favorites! He is 13 months old right now and plays with this toy every day.  Besides being educational, safe and easy to use, it is also parent friendly-not noisy at all.  There is a lot of loud and out of tune toys out there but this is not one of them.  I would recommend to everybody!	1
as expected	1
It works just like a battery should lol. It is the original power wheels battery.	1
We like to buy "extra" batteries for our Power Wheels ride-ons. You can easily re-wire them for twice the power. Check out the video! [...]	1
It did not come with the wires for the battery	-1
My 4-5 month old baby loves this toy.  It is very easy to press the buttons and activate the sounds, so even very young, uncoordinated babies can get this toy to make noise.  As she gets older, she can use the cube to learn about different kinds of sounds and about colors.  For now, though, she just likes to chew on the corners and is delighted whenever the music starts playing.  I am giving this four stars instead of five because the cube is secured to its packaging with wire-like pieces of plastic that protrude from the toy.  It is actually very difficult (and maybe impossible) to remove these pieces entirely from the toy, and that presents a danger of poked eyes and scratches.  Eventually, we had to cut the plastic ties very close to the toy and then push the raw ends into the toy, where they still are (and we hope they stay there).  There seems to be no way to remove them entirely.	1
This toy is great but I had to replace the batteries before he could even use it because the sound was so awful with the old batteries in it. It shouldn't be like that with a new item.	1
My 13 month old son loves playing with this. He enjoys switching up songs. 2 complaints, 1)its pretty heavy 2)all the instruments sound very electronic	1
Works perfectly with our Power Wheels Jeep.  We charged it the first time just as the instructions say and it worked great!	1
Compr este Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube para mi ahijada hace seis meses y todava es uno de los preferidos de ella. Es bastante fuerte y no pesa tanto como para que ella lo pueda manipular, 100% garantizo la compra de este toy.	1
This is a wonderful toy.  I bought it for my son when he was a young toddler (probably sometime in 2008).  He liked it, but wasn't in love with it.  My second child is now 13 months, and she LOVES this toy.  She always pushes the buttons and dances to the music.  I host a playgroup for children between 7 months and 3 years, and this is a wonderful toy to have out for all to enjoy.  The babies tend to play with it more, but the toddlers like to come over to see what they are doing.  I bought this in November as a baby shower present as well.  Both times, I purchased the product on sale (I think for around sixteen dollars).  For that price, it is definitely worth it.  I'd also like to note that I have only had to change the batteries once in the 2 years I have owned this.  It definitely sounds awful when the batteries are dying.  Overall, a wonderful toy for babies and young toddlers!	1
This is a great game!  It's a kids version of Mancala in that the pieces are colorful little animals instead of pebbles - otherwise it's the same game.  It's great for ages 4 and up.  My son plays it every night and we got it for all of our friends for christmas!	1
Mancala, of course, is one of my all-time favorite low-tech games; now my daughter plays it for hours with her friends, just like I did 30 years ago. This set has a nice folding wooden board and the fun animal-shaped plastic pieces -- the kids like the animals, and the irregular shapes actually are easier to handle than smooth stones.  It also stores fairly compactly. The three things I don't like about this set: - the clasp is very difficult to work.  You will break your thumbnail. - The pits aren't deep enough to hold more than about 5 stones.  This is a problem when you get a big stack. - The wooden hinges, while allowing the board to lie flat, look flimsy and are difficult to work. In all, a good game marred by a few technical problems, but the kids won't care.	1
It last part of one summer and then nothing. Not impressed for the $$$$	-1
This will be our 4th Power Wheels battery. They simply do not hold a charge. My son loves to ride his jeep and quad, however, the battery drains extremely fast. At $50 a battery, we have invested $200 of worthless batteries. I expected them to last longer than a year. Yes, 4 batteries in a year.	-1
Battery is great. Holds charge well and for a long time. Now my son doesn't have to wait for his jeep to charge we just change them out!	1
Great price and fast shipping	1
Put the zip back in my sons truck!	1
Back in business.  Fit in the toy Escalade just fine.  Looks like a direct replacement.	1
Speedy shipper, quality was great, exactly as expected. Thank you,	1
Got this to replace a 12 volt battery in my daughters ride on jeep. Works great and holds a charge for a long time. Hours of driving around with this. Would definitely buy again.	1
Wish I had bought this for Barbie jeep two years ago. I thought jeep was busted but finally got around to sucking it up and buying new battery. Works greet will make sure to follow directions from now on (charge battery after every use and remove in cold weather for season).	1
Great battery with a great recharge. My daughter was able to ride her jeep power wheels around again which made everyone's day.	1
Works great, but is priced a little high.	1
Based on the mostly positive feedback, I purchased this cube as a birthday present for my son's first birthday. He's not even slightly interested in the sound; my 4-year old pushed the buttons a few times, but complains that it's much too loud - unfortunately you can't control the volume. It really is too loud. The 1-year old pushed the buttons twice, and got very close in order to look at the blinking light, but that's it. The sound quality is also not the greatest, but it is a children's toy, so I didn't really expect it to be any better. So, neither one of my children plays with it or is actually interested in it, and the biggest drawback is the lack of volume control, since the toy is way too loud. I'm seriously considering returning it.	-1
works great! the kid love the hot wheels running again, would recommend to anyone	1
Needed a back up battery for grandson's electric car.  Old battery not holding the charge as long as when new.	1
Bought a used Power Wheels Jeep for our daughters... didn't have battery or charger included, this fit and seems to do a great job of holding charge when not in use.  Only bought 1 so far but considering a 2nd so dead battery is never the reason play has to stop.	1
Well it did what it was suppose to do.  My Son's Power Wheel is up and running.  I had bought it at a garage sale without a battery for $15, if I had the original battery, there are cheaper batteries that can be used, but you need the original plug.  So, buy this now and the next one, Google hacking your Power Wheel, and have fun!	1
This was a great replacement when our battery died.	1
We received this as a gift for my first child, but I just rediscovered how nice it is with my second.  My 2 year old loves to play with this with her baby brother.  The corners are a softer (maybe silicon) material so that if my 5 month old bumps it as he's trying to grab it doesn't bother him.  He can push the buttons easily and my daughter loves to help him add the instruments.  He loves how it lights up and I love the nice tune vs. other noisy baby toys.  My only complaint is that it was not immediately obvious where the batteries go once they die (and they do die rather quickly during frequent play in my opinion), but keep an eye on the little screw to figure it out!	1
This is one of my son's favorite toys. He's been watching/listening to it since he was born. Now that he's 5 months old, he's still very interested in it. Currently likes to kick the buttons with his feet and loves the music (as do I). This is a toy that will provide entertainment for months to come!	1
Got this as a gift when baby was 5 months. He liked mouthing the somewhat soft corners and I played it for him. He now plays it himself (13 months). I do not think he gets he can turn off and on each instrument but I suppose that will come. The quality of music is very good, not mechanically computerized like some toys. It has five or so songs and you can turn off and on each instrument. That is pretty neat. Baby likes it. The only problem is that there is no volume control. Batteries last a pretty long time in it. The songs are nice too, jazzy and complex enough to be interesting. It seems really tough. It has withstood some hard knocks. It has a very solid feel, which worried me at first because I was afraid baby would hurt himself face-planting into it, but no injuries. The corners are rounded and slightly rubbery. It's kind of heavy so just now has baby really been able to haul it around.	1
Nice product order for friend for backups.	1
Cool	1
My granddaughter loves Beanie Babies and  Beanie Boos, I used to buy Beanie Babies for her Mother. :)  Sneaky the Leopard is so cute,... soft fur and sweet face! Well made and fun to play with or collect.	1
This leopard has a nice shaped head, it's fur is soft and it stands up nicely.  Overall, it's a nice addition to my 7 yr old son's cat collection.  He loves it.	1
At first I wasn't sure I liked the little animal parts, but they grew on us and it's pretty cute.  If we loose them, we can just go down to Hobby Lobby and pick up some little glass beads to replace them.  The wooden part of the game is nice and sturdy.	1
We were given this product for a gift - from our wishlist - for our, at the time, 12 month old daughter. She loved it, and carried it around everywhere. One day, she dropped it. She was 29 inches tall. It was in her hands and fell no more than 15 inches. It broke. Saddened, we contacted the CS department to see about getting it fixed. We were told too bad - it fell.  So, basically, a toy made for young children can't fall any distance, and was not under a warranty because of the fall and would not be fixed. Therefore, I will never buy anything from this unrealistic company again. If you make kid's toys, you might want to make them kid durable.	-1
Most musical baby toys are terrible. The songs are poorly arranged and annoying as hell. This box plays enjoyable tones and tunes that baby can mix and match to create either a fuller orchestra sound or solo instrumentation. I bought this toy for my baby niece and she has loved it since about 4 mos on (she will be 1 soon). It is fun yet low key, durable, and as long as the batteries aren't dying it sounds great! I highly recommend this toy as an early intro to music for your small child.	1
My daughter LOVES this toy.  We first gave it to her at 6 months for Christmas, which was too early. She wasn't strong enough to push the button herself, so she didn't really like it. Around 8 months or so, she started liking it. The more she figures out how it works, the more the likes it. At 11 months, she plays with it all the time. Now she's strong enough to lift it, so she hands it to us to play.	1
Super cute and easy to use.	1
Very cute version of this game!	1
Mancala is a nostalgic game for me and I loved playing it as a kid. This set has a nice heavy wooden fold up gameboard with 48 plastic animal tokens.  The set would be nicer if the tokens were glass or polished stone.  Instructions for play are included and written very clearly in English unusual. Game pieces are a choking hazard and not appropriate for small children.	1
Great game!	1
Happy to have the pink car up and running again. Keep the instructions so you remember how to keep the battery life lasting longer.	1
Charged the battery and put it in my sons electric toy and it did not work.  No refunds.  NOT ideal considering how expensive it is!	-1
Bought for neighbor's granddaughter the grandpa does odd jobs for me nice way to repay since he could not afford to buy.	1
My kids love this game. They are from 5 years to 13 years old.... and even I, an adult, like playing this game.	1
My girls love it!	1
my son received this as a gift for his 7th birthday - he loves the figurines and is really good at figuring out the strategy behind this game.	1
Great and colorful variation of such a great game!	1
My nephew loves it!	1
I am glad we got this for our son.  The lights are interesting and the music is nice.  Much more tolerable than many other infant toys.  My toddler daughter is just learning about instruments so this interests her as well.  She enjoys picking the different instruments to hear.	1
perfect replacement	1
useful	1
A little pricey but it's a must have for my 3yo's power wheel.	1
this is a great set up but the board is a little flimsy and we were missing one of the pieces, but the animal pieces are very creative. and the kids love.	1
I loved this game as a kid. I got it for my kids and we play it all the time and when they go to bed my husband and I play	1
Great game. Shapes make it more fun for kids!	1
Such a fun game for kids.  Animals were a fun touch.  Easy to learn and good game to teach strategy.	1
I have a 45 year old autistic child who LOVES this toy! He can change the songs, and even which instrument is playing each song simply by pressing the sides of the cube. My 4 year old granddaughter also loves it!	1
I received this for my son when he was born.  It is now my go-to gift anytime I find out a friend is having a baby.  What's great about this is not only that it's fun, colorful, and interesting to children from age 0-6, but it's even fun for parents.  The music is simply lovely, and it's fun to add and subtract all the instruments from the ensemble as it plays.  I'm not sure I would have survived my son's colicky babyhood if not for this toy -- it was one of the few things that kept him entertained and amused me as well.  My father in law, a renowned conductor in Europe, fell in love with this when he came to visit.  He bought it for all his grandchildren abroad.  It's the real deal -- buy it!	1
We purchased this cube for our daughter at 6 months.  She initially loved watching the lights as the toy made music and as she has gotten older she loves to pick it up and press the buttons.  She is still too young to understand the concept but it entertains her for quite some time.  The rounded soft corners are nice so that she cannot injure herself and she does enjoy trying to chew on them at times.  I'd recomend this to anyone looking for a great priced toy.	1
Perfect!	1
My kids and their friends love this game. They are aged between 4 and 12, and while the kids on the younger end need a little assistance, they all like it. They especially like the unique little figurines that are used as "seeds." Nicely made and no complaints to list.	1
So fun! This game has become a family-favorite!	1
My kids love this game,  it sits out and they probably play 7-10 rounds a week.  This game has lasted a lot longer than any other game we have purchased.  There is not much to it,  but they have found a pattern on how to win each time.  So good old fashioned game that was worth the $10.	1
I bought two of these Munchkin Mozart Magic Cubes, one for my 11month old niece and one for my 1.5 year old daughter. They can listen to the violin, the drums, the flute, and a few other instruments. They can listen to the instruments one at a time or all together. Both of the children LOVE it. They can roll it around and dance to the music. I don't have to worry about them bonking there heads on the corner of the cube because the corners have been rounded off. We have also found, in our experience, that they are very durable. I recommend this product to any baby or toddler! I think it is loaded with fun and it is educational for them to listen and learn what each instrument is and the sounds each instrument makes! Thank you	1
This seems like a great toy for the musically inclined baby, my 5 month old likes looking at the flashing lights and trying to eat it the music doesn't seem too loud to me or out of tune,  perhaps that is a defect for the previous reviewer?  My son seems to love looking at it and pushing the buttons, I think once he is a bit older he might appreciate it more.  However I do agree it is a great book shelf toy too.  IT looks fantastic!	1
This is horrible.  After spending most of my life studying music I am sad to say that this will ruin any child's ear for music if they have one.  I thought it was just ours that always sounds out of tune and like a dying cow, but it isn't.  The movie preview isn't much better than the one in our home.  It has a bit more rhythm.  After having this toy for over a year I am ready to throw it away if it weren't such a great book end.  It is somewhat heavy and has rubber stoppers great for your child's book shelf.  Feel free to replace and buy new batteries the results will always be the same.  The directions state that if that happens you should turn it off wait a few seconds and turn it back on again.  This never once fixed the problem.  Since this problem is noted in the instruction manual the company won't do anything about it unless you are the original purchaser with the receipt.  Ours was a gift.  Good luck with this toy.  I have moved on to find ones worth my time that won't disable my child's musical talent.	-1
It is wonderful, my granddaughter is very happy! :)	1
Pros: works like it used to. Cons:  none	1
Exactly as stated, works great.	1
My daughter got this as a gift at 8 months and loved hearing the music and watching the squares light up.  Now at 18 months, she still loves this toy and will frequently dance to the music and start the music herself.  I think in another year, she'll still love it, once she understands how she can create her own music by adding and subtracting instruments.  This is a toy that grows with the child, which is so rare.  It is literally the only toy she got last Chanukah that she's still playing with today.  Plus, I love playing with it myself...can't beat that!	1
Great find! Perfect gift for a 5+ boy or girl. Great price for the quality. I bought this because the animal glass pieces are just adorable.	1
Absolutely love these! It's better than the regular one because it's animals!!!!! My kids love to play with this one!!!!! Great pricing too!	1
This is a great starter kit for kids. I bought it for my ASC program as an addition to other sets for the older kids	1
good and beat retail price.	1
I worked in the church nursery for over 4 years with this toy in one of the toyboxes available to the children.  I never saw any of them properly engage with it.  They'd pull it out, bang it a couple of times (starting up 2 different sounds) and then get bored and crawl away.  It was the one toy I knew I'd never buy for my children.	-1
I was so excited to get this for my 1yo, and it is a great toy...  My 1yo & 3yo love it.  BUT it has an issue with batteries!  When it arrived (with included batteries in a "try me" box), the batteries were dead.  It's not being played with at a rate that warrants having to change the batteries once or twice a week.  When it begins getting low on power, the music sounds warped, like an old warped record, which is dreadful!  Perhaps we got a defective one.  I don't know.  I hope this isn't happening to others.	-1
The kids love this	1
I bought this for my littles while we were studying Africa. Not only can my four-year-old play it, I find it entertaining as well.  We love taking it out with us and introducing new people to the game.	1
The stones are not easily recognizable as animals. And the holes to hold such animals are too small and the animals fall out.	-1
The younger of our two great nephews loves, loves, loves this game!	1
After looking for a musical toy that was not annoying, off-key or obnoxious, we discovered this.  Plays several songs by Mozart; baby can play a song with all instruments at once by pressing "orchestra" or one at a time.  Baby can also turn off instruments one at a time. The instruments are clearly synthesized, but still, the quality is not bad and I could listen to it for long periods of time.  I have yet to be annoyed by this toy.  In fact, I may have to buy two - my twins fight over it constantly!  My only reason for not giving it 5 stars is that it's a little bit loud.  I wish there was a volume control.	1
Product as promised.	1
My Kindergartner and I  really enjoy playing this game as a painless way to practice counting aloud, sequencing, and number value.	1
This was my favorite game when I was a kid, and my sister and I had one just like this one (with the animals instead of regular beads/marbles). Now I taught my six year old how to play and she loves it. Even my two year old was able to grasp the concept with a bit of guidance. Great quality and brings back lots of memories!	1
Wonderful game--wooden, well made, and the adorable animals are super cute and fun to play with. My girls (4 and 8) love this game, and it folds up for easy storage.	1

Terrific Childrens board game. Appropriate for ages 5 and up.	1
This is a very good game for a 6 year old. My daughter loves this. It is easy to carry and can be a good timekiller during travel	1
my daughter loves this, but already lost a piece within a week.  Any replacement pieces?	1
Worked out perfectly!	1
My niece requested Mancala for Christmas. I bought this one because the "marbles" are cute.  She loves playing it and I love that it compact and stays closed so we don't lose the pieces.	1
So much fun for my family. The shapes are easy to handle and move.	1
Great item! Shipped quick and worked wonders on my sons older power wheels you!	1
Works great, fit the power wheels rider we have, charges good, my son rides all day, very happy	1
Has kept charge for so long in our daughters Barbie jeeps! Works great!!	1
Bought this for my grandson, and we play together. Wood board. Plastic pieces of animals. He's eleven years old.	1
I bought this game for my kids after my oldest kept asking for it. I am so glad she did because this is such a fun game! This game can be for just the kids or the family as well. It helps little kids build on their counting skills as well, which is a big plus. It is super easy to learn and so fun to play!	1
My 6 and 7 year old girls love this game. The little animals are adorable. They do fill up the little holes quickly but it isn't that big of a nuisance. 4 stars because there is an ugly "Made in China" stamp on one side of the box you can see when it is closed, but we just put a big sticker over it. The wood doesn't look too pretty or anything, just plain, but it is a great beginner set to make sure the kids even enjoy the game.	1
My baby really loves it. He has so many toys, and this is one of his favorites. He keeps strong interest while playing with it every day. When he cries, the magic box can stop the crying at least for a while.	1
Santa gave this to our 6 month son for Christmas.  Both he and my 2 year old LOVE it.  It is wonderfully sturdy, and has many music functions.  My 2 yr old will announce each instrument as she adds them into the melody.  My husband is a music educator, and he gives this a big thumbs up!  Thank you Santa!  Would buy again and again.	1
So the biggest complaint I have seen has been that the time it stays charged for only a short time. I  have to say use the slow charger first if you have the fast charger. Let it charge for the 18 hours the first time, I know it's an inconvenience, but it will help. I have had this battery for over a week and so far so good. My only not so happy comment about this is that the expiration date on the battery I got is only 8 months away. Make sure you check the expiration date on the battery and I would see if you can send it back/get a credit if it is not at least a year from the purchase date.	1
A+	1
Good replacement battery for power wheel jeep. Lasts awhile and works as it should.	1
This battery has worked much better than the original, that that is most likely because of us.  If you want this battery to last a long time, remember three things:  #1.  Initial charge is 24 hours, do not interrupt that. #2.  When you kid is not using the vehicle (like at night), plug the battery in.  Do not let the battery sit there. #3.  Do not let the battery discharge completely.  This is a lead acid battery, so treat it as you would a car battery.  When a car sits doing nothing for six+ months, you will most likely be changing the battery.	1
Love the game! Great that it can fold up - pack & go kind of toy. Only thing, as other reviewers have noted, is that the animal pieces are cute but harder to handle than traditional stones. My son prides himself on how quickly he move around the board and they cramp his style a little bit.	1
My kids learned to play Mancala in Disney's Animal Kingdom and loved it.  I choose this set because it looked like a "real" board and set.  The plastic pieces are not so childish that it would look funny for adults(or teens) to play with the set.  It folds and has a "locking" clip so the pieces can be stored in the closed board without fear of getting lost.	1
This is a fun game and my daughters and I love playing Mancala and the pieces are colorful and cute. I only wish they were not so cheap plastic looking.	1
Just what the doctor ordered ! Great price fast shipping!	1
This was a spare so batteries could be changed out. Kids never have to wait for a charge.	1
good	1
My daughter got this when she was 3 months old and it was one of her favorite toys. She'd kick her legs to turn the music on and off. At 3.5 she still loves it and she sits and plays with it along with her 9 month old brother now.	1
Just received this toy for my daughter's first birthday. She loves it. It keeps her attention, which is quite hard to do. It has beautiful music and its neat how the different instruments can be turned on and off without skipping a note in the music.	1
perfect	1
I bought this because my teenaged daughter uses it in the summer camp where she works.  My kids ages 6 through 17 play this together for hours.  It addictive!	1
This is just the biggest hit with the grandchildren and their parents probably thanks to Mozart.  The children love it and it is so simple and unobtrusive.  The music is pleasant.  The on and off switch is easy. It stack and stores!	1
I think I may like this better than my son.  He loves looking at the flashing colors and I press each button so he can hear all the different instruments together.. Hes getting better at pressing the buttons, which are big.. he is just not coordinated yet.  :)	1
great	1
Too loud. Too hard. Buttons don't depress easily or distinctly. My 6 month old has fallen headfirst onto the cube and has cut her forehead and chin and jaw on the hard(!) unpadded edges. The corners have sufficient covers but why not the edges between corners??? Buttons require too much strength to push for a 6 month old. She can sometimes manage it her feet if cube is braced against other object. Definitely NOT for under 1 year olds. Battery replacement requires screwdriver.<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Munchkin-Mozart-Magic-Cube/dp/B00004TFLB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube</a>	-1
My son's 9 months old and we received this a month ago as a present for him during the holidays. I had put it on his wish list after reading the bazillion glowing reviews here on Amazon.  As expected, he's loved it from the moment we took it out of the box.  He's not one to sit and play with anything for long, but he always goes back to the Munchkin Mozart Cube.  What I totally didn't expect, though, was that his older brothers (ages 4 and 6) would sit down and play with it with the baby!  They love to push the orchestra button and tell the baby which instruments they're removing (or adding on the reverse) as he pushes each button.  It's absolutely amazing to watch them "learn" the sounds of the different instruments!	1
My 8 year old daughter isn't real interested in this game. Hoping she will like it down the road, but not too sure.	1
My 8 year old daughter asked for this game last year after a vacation. I honestly thought it would be played with once or twice and then gather dust on a shelf. Thankfully, I was proved very wrong as she plays with it frequently still. This set is not particularly fancy; the animal shaped plastic pieces appeal to the younger set while still retaining the classic elements of the game. I do wish there was a storage area for the pieces (we use a resealable plastic bag) and it would be nice to have the option to buy additional animals in case a few were misplaced. Otherwise, we're very happy with this purchase and I'd definitely recommend this games for ages 4 and up.	1
Mancala is an ages old game and this version comes with easy to understand instructions and the kids love the animals. The board folds for easy storage with wooden hinges. Well constructed, this should last a loong time!!! this game helps those mathematically challenged and will improve strategic playing by your youngsters.	1
Product as expected	1
Still going strong after one year. Will purchase from amazon again if ever in need of a replacement power wheels battery!	1
This is a pretty good toy. My son loves anything that lights up, so this is great for him in that aspect. The music on this toy is enjoyable even for my husband and I too. I have to say that since my son is only 7 months old, he will probably like this toy more as he grows, but for now it doesn't hold his attention much. I read all reviews before I purchase anything since I'm a 1st time mom. I trust others to put honest feedback and I do so myself. I'd recommend this product! It's very well made.	1
I bought this for my friends son that has special needs. At first the parents were indifferent until their son began to play with it. He really enjoys the music that he is able to create on his own. It helps him use his limited motor skills by pushing the different squares to add or subtract different sounds.  It is nice to see something that can bring a smile to a childs face. It is great for children with special needs.	1
so far so good. Works perfectly	1
perfect	1
Good Product	1
charged it and installed and it worked as expected.	1
This is bright, sturdy and has great music.  It's a nice concept - conducting your own symphony, so to speak.  It has not maintained my one year old daughter's attention for very long, but that may be because it was a Christmas present and there are other things that she is more interested in right now.  I love the rubber balls on the corners and the bright colors.	1
It was perfect for our 9 mth. old grandson.  Excellent price.  Wonderful, interactive toy.	1
works  as expected.  it's ... a battery.  for ... a power wheels toy.	1
Perfect fit for power wheel 12v	1
Perfect replacement for the Barbie car we had. Works like the original.	1
did the job	1
So far works great.  We used it about 6 times.  The charge lasts a really long time.  The last one I had the charge didn't last 10 mins that is why I needed to replace it.  Super happy.	1
This is a totally cool product...for the parents.  By the time the small child this is designed for could possibly appreciate what the toy teaches, he/she would be at least 5-10 years old and by then, the toy still requires patience.  This is just a good idea that can't quite reach the audience it hopes too.  I still like the toy, but sadly, it's just not for babies. (And I'm a musician with a broad mind for what my little one can understand---this is just too advanced.)<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Munchkin-Mozart-Magic-Cube/dp/B00004TFLB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube</a>	-1
I bought this music cube because of the high ratings on it.  I didn't expect much because it didn't look like it could do much.  Our 1 year old doesn't really spend hours playing wtht the music cube but it is creative.  It plays different instuments. One instrument can be played or all of them together which is neat.  The music is soothing and not loud and annoying.  The cube is very durable so it can be dropped many times and still play.  Oh, the colors light up too, but hard to see in daylight.  I still recommend this toy.	1
Perfect. Just what I needed for the Power Wheels jeep I purchased at a yard sale.	1
Works great	1
My youngest drive the jeep for a long time every time, and so far so good. But, we always followed the instructions. We always charge it after use, always store it in a place within the recommended temperatures, and we always charge it for around 14 hours.	1
I liked this for my 6 month old son because it plays music and lights up. You can also press a couple of the buttons together or seperate and it plays together. It's neat and my son enjoys it.	1
I may like this toy more than my daughter. My favorite thing is to do a bit of orchestration by adding and subtracting the various instruments. I do find the tone of the piano mildly discordant and usually remove it from all of the tunes.  As for baby, this toy is great for putting an end to the occasional crying jag. She presses the buttons easily. I don't think she's got it all figured out yet, but it's one of her favorite toys. We also love the soft rounded corners on this toy.  I've seen my daughter giving them a nibble now and then.  The cube is durable. My baby often pulls it off the shelf to send it thudding to the floor and it still works.  It is a bit big and rather heavy for a child to carry.  However, my only real complaint is the packaging. When I received the cube, it was fastened in with plastic coated wires that ran through holes in the cube. I cut them with scissors at first only to have them stuck in the cube. I finally wrapped the remainder around a letter opener and pulled it free. The cube comes with no instructions on removing these wires.  Quick mention: You'll need a screwdriver to install the batteries.  5 stars. Great toy. Neat concept. I think my daughter will grow to love this toy more over time.	1
Purchased this for our grandsons quad. We have a quick charger so we could charge this in the time that he was wearing out the other one riding around our farm.  Every battery like this will eventually wear down after multiple charges. But this one and the original one lasted our grandson all summer, and trust me, he rode all day long when he visited at least one day a week.  These are a good brand, just wish they would last a little longer than an hour each. I should add though, our farm has hills and taller grass, so we so put this battery through some tough work.	1
Item as described.  Good price.  Quick shipping	1
Battery drained within a year despite regular use and charges.  $60 of waste.	-1
The Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube is practically the perfect toddler toy. My 15 month old son recieved this as a gift and at first I thought he would get bored of it rather quickly. Turns out, this is one of his favorite toys. It is durable enough to withstand being dropped, kicked and rolled around the playroom floor. He loves to play the music and dance along to it. I don't have a problem with the sound or music quality. This is one of the better sounding toys we have purchased. My son loves how the sound changes when he presses different buttons (which are large and easy for small hands to press, unlike many other similar toys). Even my 10 month niece loves this toy. This is definetly on the top of our holiday toy giving lists!	1
works great!	1
Christmas present	1
Good	1
this battery is great I charged it per instructions and it works just as it is supposed too the shipping was very quick as well	1
I have read through some of the ridiculous low-star reviews and can't believe how anal people are.  This is a baby's toy for $20.  It's not a minature version of the New York Symphony stuffed into a $600 Bose music player, like some people are expecting.  Since this is a child's toy, I think it's serves it's purpose well.  The music is clear.  The lights flash when the music plays.  I think it's neat that you can add or subtract musical instruments during the song that's playing so your baby can hear what each individual instrument sounds like.  My daughter loves the toy.  It keeps her occupied for long periods of time and she's learning the names of each instrument and how they each sound both together in an orchestra and individually.  The people who are expecting this to be something more than it is need to understand that the toy wasn't designed for their enjoyment.  The toy was designed for children.  And, in my opinion, it's an exceptional toy that will keep most children entertained which, in and of itself, is a blessing.	1
Plays nice music that isn't to loud.  Item is smaller than I expected, but that is not a bad thing as it makes it easier for little ones to hold/carry.	1
My one year old son has played with this toy since he was 6 months old and it still entertains him.  While the instruments do sound a bit synthetic, the toy still provides an introduction to different instruments and how multiple instruments can create a complex music piece.	1
This battery is a perfect replacement for my son's Power Wheel battery.  He has the arctic cat.  He rides his so much that the battery dies quickly so I decided to get a 2nd one so he could keep going :) We are very satisfied with this purchase. This one lasts quite a bit longer than the original one, though I'm sure it's due to the age of the older battery.  He always wants the newer one because he says it makes him go faster :)	1
This toy keeps my 4-month old's attention for a while - she really seems to like the flashing lights as the music plays.  I only wish there was a volume button on it - it seems a bit loud to me (and if it seems loud to me wouldn't it seem loud to the baby as well?), and I wish it weren't quite so heavy.  It will be a long time before my baby will be able to turn the cube or pick it up, for now it just sits on the floor between her legs and she's able to hit the buttons that are facing up/out.	1
The fabulous Munhkin Mozart Magic Cube was given to our friend's daughter when she was an infant. From a very early age, we watched in amazement as she responded to the sounds of the music, obviously recognizing changes. We could see the pleasure on her face. As time went on, she played with the toy herself and was constantly drawn to it.  There was always a limited assortment of toys for her to explore on the living room floor. She loved to play with some more than others. However, she was always constantly drawn back to this -- the sounds of the music from different instruments was a great source of fascination.  As she gets older, the way that she handles Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube becomes more selective and sophisticated. This is one of the best toys we have ever seen to develop delight in music!  She is beginning to talk now, and I feel certain that her first words will be, "GET ME A HARPSICHORD NOW!!"  Love it!	1
Perfect! Nice having a back up battery	1
After reading mixed reviews I hesitated buying this toy but I am so glad I bought it!  Both of my 10 month old twins enjoy it.  Even I want to play with it.  My husband understands and appreciates music and he approved it too.  He said this toy is not meant to be a musical instrument with the perfect sound but for a toy the sound is pretty good.	1
The baby was just born on 6.22.08. He hasn't used it yet but my Daughter thinks it's fantastic.	1
Great	1
mine came damaged but it seems to work very good.	1
I didn't buy this for my son because some reviews said the sounds weren't true to the instrument.  I'm a very musical person, so I'm picky about these things.  I am SO GLAD someone bought this for my son.  My son is 5 months old.  He is entertained by this toy (so am I).  He doesn't get the concept of the different instruments, and adding/subtracting the instruments.  But, he does press the buttons himself.  The lights just add to the experience.  I don't think the sounds are that far off.  It's a baby toy remember.  I like the choices of instruments - violin, piano, harp, flute & French horn - partly because I play three of those.  It cycles through 8 songs (not all Mozart as implied by the name).  Unfortunately, it will only cycle through the songs by pressing the Orchestra button multiple times.  It would be nice to cycle through them only using one instrument.	1
My 6-month-old loves this toy, and so do I. She also likes to kick it with her feet to make it play. It it durable, plus it has an on/off switch. It plays several different songs, plus you choose which instruments play each piece.	1
didnt recieve itnothing but the box and some paper in itthe battery was not in the box	-1
Fast shipping, and the battery works good so far. Awesome price!	1
Bought for my niece.  I blew plenty of time playing with it when it came in even though it was in the box still.  Can't wait till she opens it so I can get back to playing with it.  Will update after I see how she likes it.	1
My five month old loves this product. She uses it to support herself while sitting up and explores the buttons with complete concentration. Considering most toys only hold her interest for 5-10 minutes, the 15-20 she gets out of this speaks for itself. The sounds of the instruments is artificial and tinny, but not so much so that I can't stand to hear it. My only complaint is that it is quite loud, I wish it came with the ability to adjust the volume. Recommended.	1
I haven't seen my nephews play with their Magic Cubes (they're still a bit young), but I still think it's a great toy.	1
I've given both of my new grandchildren a Magic Cube and they love them. Even my 3 year old grandson enjoys playing with it. My granddaughter loves to turn it on and then dance to the music.	1
Perfect exact replacement. Power wheels Jeep works like new. No shipping damage.	1
Great!	1
Revived an old jeep that we "salvaged" from the dead.  Throw it on the charger every few days of use, and it powers that toy for a few hours of play.  Self contained, no worries about leaks. I plugged the charger into a timer set for 12 hours so it charges, and I don't have to worry about it again.  Very happy.	1
We've had ours for several years, and it still works great.  Very durable.  The kids love to turn one instrument on and turn another one off.... they love creating all kinds of combinations.  We have both of them, and they have been dropped, still going strong.  If no one plays with it, I put it away for awhile, then take it out, and it's like a brand new toy.  :-)	1
Bought extra battery, didn't want our grandson to lose power and not be able to ride.  Works great.	1
I have both of these cubes and my 18 month old must play with them at least two or three times a day.  Other toys have come and gone in his short life - but not this.  He has grown to use it in different ways - from a chance bump to identifying the instruments to humming along with the songs.  Great sounding so it never gets on my nerves after hearing the song loop about 10 times a day.  It is also virtually indestructible and easy to clean and change the batteries.  Baby can manipulate it easily and operate it with little to no frustration. I think it is a great shower gift.	1
I bought this for my 3-year old daughter as one of her Christmas present from Santa Claus, she is not that into it, I think this is best for kids age 6 months to 2 years. I was going to buy it on Amazon, happened to find it elsewhere for just a little over $20.	1
The music is pleasant, I think my kids (3 under 3) enjoy it.  They don't look to play with it, but if it's around they won't just pass it by.  But then again they won't play with it for very long either.  I really hoped they would like it more.	1
Okay, so this is a good battery....at first. I have the one came with my product that was purchased 5 years ago and it still runs like a charm. I bought one last year and it is no good this year. We'll see how this one does.	1
Works great in our Barbie Escalade!	1
Great buy!	1
Exactly what we needed to replace battery on her Barbie 4 wheeler. We even checked prices at interstate batteries and walmart but noone even came close to this price. Works great!	1
GREAT buy! A LOT cheaper than toys r us and walmart and it is the SAME battery! If you need a replacement for your kiddos powerwheels this is the one to buy :)	1
Didn't last long as others have said.  The one I bought from Walmart holds a longer charge.	-1
I purchased this for my granddaughter's 1st birthday.  This was the gift that she took to bed with her that night!  She just loved it.  I just purchased another one for my grandson who is 8 months old because I couldn't wait until his 1st birthday to give him one!	1
This is a great toy.  My 7 month old daughter loves it and so do many of my musician friends.  There is one significant flaw in its design; this is that the volume is not adjustable and it is too loud.  If it were 1/2 this loud, I'd let me daughter play with it all the time.  As it is, I usually limit her to playing with it with me, so I can hold it away from her head/ears.  Due to the too loud volume, I'm giving it a 4 star review, instead of 5.  Otherwise, it is a great, great product.	1
was what i needed.	1
Yay our 5 year old big wheels comes to life.  If you ever see one on the side of the road pick them up.  Buy a new battery and maybe new wheels and wa-la a brad new big wheels! at more than half the cost.	1
expensive but worth it...put my daughters jeep back on the road and the smile on her face	1
Works great and best price I could find!	1
This made the jeep turbo charged! Heart attack for me, giggles from my little boy!	1
Get your little one rolling again with this replacement battery.  Power Wheels are fun, but not if they are sitting in the garage. This is an EOM battery, and worked in our Power Wheels vehicles.	1
The yellow Jeep runs again!!	1
My grandson had multiple vehicles that use this size battery and was time for replacement. They usually last decent amount of time.	1
Wouldn't keep a charge	-1
Shipped faster than expected.  Holds a charge for several hours.	1
Works perfectly. Great purchase.	1
I bought this for my girls 1 year old Power Wheels Jeep and it did the trick; they're back to zooming around the neighborhood.	1
This toy gets my son's attention- and did since he got it for his first Christmas (9 months)- but unfortunately, it is NOT DURABLE. You cannot let the child actually play with the toy- if they throw it at all, it's history. And guess what- most babies throw things when they get excited. They tend to drop things, too- the toy is heavy for a small child. He loved the lights, and he loved pressing teh big buttons- the music is not too bad, either- but for the cost, you want it to be durable so the baby can play with it.	1
My parents gave this to my daughter when she was three months old, and she seemed to like the musical sounds as we pressed the buttons.  She is now eight months old, and she STILL loves it!  It is her favorite toy.  At 5 months, we would put it between her legs for balance while she learned to sit up, and she would make the music play. Now she's learning to crawl, and she always goes for this toy!  The music is NOT annoying, and we enjoy listening to it as much as she does. We feel like she will enjoy this toy for a long time to come!	1
Works great and replaces the worn out battery on the power-wheel we have. Still charges fine even with long periods between uses.	1
I bought the battery on here cause it was the cheapest place I could find a replacement and it works great with my nephews vehicles. It charges well and holds the charge for about 1-2hrs I would say but that is with them using it non-stop. If they don't use it non-stop then it will last about 1-2weeks with little use I would say.	1
I don't know who loves this thing more, my 5 month old, or my husband and I.  It never gets boring and its fun to practice your timing, by having certain instruments come in at a different time... my baby goes nuts day after day for this toy.  Buy it for every baby shower!  I just wish it wasn't so darn expensive or I'd get it for everyone on my baby list.	1
I had no idea it was so easy to replace this battery.  Great value.	1
My son got this for his first birthday and he hasn't stopped playing with it.  He loves the music and has started dancing to all the songs.  If the cube is out of reach he will even point at it and start dancing.  It was so easy for him to figure out.  He carries it around room to room so that it always nearby for music.  He has thrown it several times and it was not damaged. I am going to start buying this toy as a gift for other babies and toddlers because I am positive they would enjoy it also.	1
I am on my second child and this toy continues to be a favorite. The cube has six buttons.  It will play one of six Mozart tunes.  One button switches between the tunes while the others turn on and off specific instruments (piano, violin, harp, french horn, flute). The cube has rounded corners with durable rubber bumpers that make it both safe and durable.  It is amazing how much abuse this toy can take. My oldest received the toy when she was 13 months and now nearly three years later she is still playing with it as is her younger brother. A little pricey, but very-well made.  A toy that will last from one child to another.	1
Quite surprised that this didn't last more than two weeks.  By the third week, it had completely lost any charge (and yes, we know the specifics of how to keep a Power Wheels battery charged, as we are not new to Power Wheels).  We've had Power Wheels batteries go bad after 6 months, but 2 weeks?!?  I even bought a brand new charger at the end of the 2nd week, thinking that maybe our older charger was failing.  But it is clearly the battery, and we are very disappointed as it was nowhere near worth the cost.  Have contacted Amazon, will hopefully update with a positive experience regarding this poor battery purchase.	-1
Works just fine in my kids Power Wheels Jeep.  The old battery died between my 9 yr old using the jeep and my 4 yr old using it. Not sure of the charge time but it seems to run forever.	1
Works great.	1
We've ordered several of these batteries. First set worked for about year before they lost power. Second set died after one use. Third set so far so good. Customer service was efficient and easy with the second set.	1
same as original, fits and works perfect	1
I have run about a dozen cycles through it so far with no issues.	1
Works great, 3yo  happy again	1
Exactly  what  we  needed  and  service  was  super.	1
it works without issue.  What else is there to say?	1
So happy to find this for sale! My kid can hit the open roads (sidewalks again)!	1
Fits perfect and it came fully chargerd	1
Works just fine in our Power Wheels 4-wheeler. The air bubble packaging in the box was all popped when it arrived, so the battery was tossed around inside the amazon box. Other than that. I have no complaints.	1
worked out great	1
Replaced my old battery and it's charging and running my kid's escalade	1
always a great choice a NEW battery:) we found ALL of our powerwheels on craigslist, and of course the batteries had no charging life.. a new battery and BOOM in biz	1
Great battery at a great price!	1
Was worried when I received this.  The packing was beaten up pretty good.  Charged it- works like a champ.	1
Works well so far.  The original battery lasted a long time.	1
Wow what a difference a new battery makes	1
Worked Perfectly	1
Works fine in my granddaughterso Barbie jeep.	1
I charged this battery as instructed and the charge only lasted about 30 mins , Sadly, I got a  Defected battery is what I assume.	-1
Item was as described and worked well for a child's battery operated  car.	1
As described	1
Great. Fit as advertised and just keeps on working!	1
drives that you'd think it would.	1
Works great in the Barbie Jeep and Ford Raptor. I bought a used Barbie Jeep and this battery was necessary since the original battery was dead. It charges well and holds the charge a long time. Great purchase.	1
Works well	1
Kids were up and rolling	1
Just what I ordered to fit into the Barbie Power Wheels	1
Found a cheaper alternative that lasts longer-- If you don't mind making a few modifications.  check out -12v 12Ah Sealed Lead Acid (SLA) Battery with F2 (.250in) Terminals	-1
works great.  was easy to charge and plug in.  the kids love the car.	1
always good to have a spare with kids stuff. I use the charger and this battery to make sure my grandson has enough power and time to enjoy his turtle nija wheel.	1
These batteries are great off amazon for the price!	1
Battery worked great and charged wonderfully for hours of fun over the summer.	1
If you need a replacement, this is a better option than Craigslist or eBay.  The battery hasn't been delivered yet, but I am anticipating it to be new and fully functional.  All the ones I saw on eBay and Craigslist were either used, or of questionable newness.  I trust Amazon more than those places, and it was Prime, which helps.  Definitely go this route over your local Toys R Us, as their 12v batteries run $80 or $90.  Save some money since you'll definitely be buying more than one of these over the life of your [insert Power Wheels vehicle here]	1
If it's been more than a year and the kids use their power wheel this is awesome. Lasts a lot longer and much more GO!	1
IT DOES WHAT IT WAS MEANT TO DO AND WHILE GRANKIDS ARE RIDING THIS ONE CHARGES SO, THEY KEEP ON MOVING.	1
I was given a used Power Wheels Jeep from a friend but the battery was dead. I bought this one and it was the perfect OEM replacement and works great. My kids get well over an hour of constant use with a full charge. I make sure to recharge after every use and I've had zero problems in over 1 month of use at 3+ days per week.	1
works great.	1
Must have back up battery for power wheels! We have 2 power wheels and 3 batteries that way everyone can always ride!	1
I should have ordered this a long time ago, I can charge it and my son can drive is car all day even two days.	1
These batteries are expensive and do not hold up well had to replace constantly we spent more money in batteries than we did on my daughters Barbie jeep charging did not help they would just quit charging after a couple months. My daughter loved her power wheels but be prepared to invest when it comes to getting these batteries	-1
It works well and charges quickly. It provides much more power for our Power Wheels Jeep.	1
No problems.	1
Did the job perfectly.	1
Worked great for what we needed it for.	1
Exelente	1
Thanks for on time delivery. Works great. Will use you again. Great product! !!	1
Works great! Holds a charge perfectly.	1
Great replacement.	1
LOVE having an additional battery on hand. We always have one charged or charging while one is in use so we never have to wait for a battery to charge.	1
Works like a charm	1
Perfect replacement for our 12 volt power wheels vehicle.	1
Great buy fast shipping	1
Shipped fast and an overall great product.	1
works well	1
I've read many bad reviews... but now that I've received the battery I wonder how many of these reviewers followed the directions?  First things first, charge for 18 HOURS. Then essentially make sure it lives on the charger when not in use. NEVER drain battery.  I just got this from Santa's workshop in the Amazon to replace my son's dead jeep battery. I will do an update in a month and again in a year. But first things first - read the entire directions booklet!!	1
Good!	1
no issues	1
Incredible battery for Dora Jeep or other Power Wheels toys.  Lasts forever, over a year on a full charge, unless you run it every single day.  My first charge literally lasted a year.  Granted she used the thing maybe 15-20 times, but it still goes.  6-12 hours to run a full charge, no leaking, no danger, very reliable.  I bought a second as a backup and it performed equally as well.	1
works good. i don't think it lasts as long as our original did, but is does last long. im happy with the purchase!	1
As Expected Thank you.	1
Works perfectly	1
Great battery. Been using it heavily for almost 2 years and can't kill it.	1
Good	1
Our original FP battery lasted 5 years-just replaced	1
Works like a champ. I'll probably have to buy another one so there is always one charged up. Got it to replace the original the we messed up.	1
Works great. Keeps a charge for a long time and lots of usage.	1
Battery died after a couple weeks of use.	-1
my son's 4x4 runs great , quick delivery	1
Disappointment. this was ordered as areplacement for a original dead battery. Never worked the same way as original. I would say half power and needed to be recharged more. Eventually gave up on it! Could be just our bad luck.	-1
A year of use and it is still going strong	1
good battery when kids need to drive the truck	1
Works just fine.	1
super deal!  almost half of what toys r us was asking!	1
Battery works great. Really gave our old Barbie Jeep new life for our girls.	1
bought this for extra battery, working great so far, charging as directed and it has never run out even with full day of play	1
FAST SHIPPING! GREAT PRICE! THANKS!!!	1
great	1
Fits the Power Wheels 4 wheeler, charge holds up for longer than expected.  No problems.	1
works great	1
I got this item 3 days ago. Directions said to charge it the first time for min. 18 hrs and max 36. We charged it for 24hrs unplugged and didn't use it until a day later. We have the power wheels Cadillac truck and as soon as they pushed the pedal you could tell the battery wasn't giving out much power. It drove very slow and after 5 mins was dead completely. I am assuming we just happened to get a bad one, sure most of them work fine, but when I got on amazon to exchange it, I get a message that I can't because it's hazardous. So I'm out $40 on a bum battery and my kids who were so excited to get a new battery are all now upset.	-1
Works for about 3 hours straight. Or a full day of "off and on" play.	1
Quality replacement battery by the brand name. Check your vehicle first to make sure this is the correct battery as there are a few different kinds. We found out the hard way though that these batteries die if not used every now and then (it got lost in moving boxes for over a year). The charger we purchased lets you know if they battery is still good though.	1
We needed this for our sons jeep. Work great!	1
This was exactly what we needed and cost a lot less than buying from any other store. We needed a replacement battery for my boys' jeep and this was perfect!	1
Great price	1
Renewed life for the kiddie car!!	1
Wrong battery ordered. Amazon won't allow returns due to harzardous materials in the product. Wasted money-not happy.	-1
Got in through the mail. Charged it for 24 hours before using it and the battery was completely dead. I know is not the charger because I can still charge my original battery. Can not return it because is not through Amazon and is a hazard. This is my first bad experience with Amazon.	-1
Worked day one. We shall see what the future brings.	1
i buy a lot from Amazon.  i rarely provide comment.  i bought this in January of 2014.  the first charge did not last long.  the second charge ever shorter.  by the 5th charge or so, it would not hold a charge at all.  very disappointed.  maybe i got a dud.  i need another one now, and have put off buying another due to traveling with work.  i'll by another, but if this one fails i'll be moving on to another supplier.	-1
We bought a second battery for our daughters power wheel so she would always have a charged battery.  I didn't realize her old battery was wearing down, until we put this one in her car and saw how much faster she can go.	1
A huge disapointment that the bateries change configuration from one year to another. We bought this battery and it did not fit in the car plug. Because it's considered hazardous material it can not be returned and we lost $78 on it.	-1
Found a power wheel for free on the side of the road, my husband brought it home spriced it up did a little bit of fixing up and it only needed a battery and charger.  So we bought this one and it is still working two years later!!  For the price of the battery and the charger.  Very happy with this purchase and best price around.	1
it came as promised and works as it should. our kids are once again thrilled with riding their Barbie Jeep.	1
I've not used this yet but I did test to see it was working.  There was no package or any papers that came with the battery just packed tight in a mail bag.  I tested the battery to see it works and fit the car we had for my son.  I hope it hold a charge and will also have a long charge life.	1
your rules are tired & I don't have time for all this. the product was as advertised. nuf said! OK	1
Subject says it all. It does what we got it for. We wanted to get a new one to see if our old one was loosing a charge. Ultiamtely though, we discovered that my son getting bigger was the reason it wasn't lasting as long. Now we have two batteries to get him to the same ride time.	1
I am so glad they sell these. We got a Power Wheel for my son from a friend, but it didn't have a battery. So I bought it on here, cheaper than it was from Fisher Price and it works great.	1
They work really well--each battery gives about an hour of life to a Powerwheel. They seem to recharge pretty quickly too---a few hours or so.	1
Worked great for my son's Harley Davidson motorcycle. Its just really heavy, don't drop it on your foot. It takes a while for it to charge.	1
Needed an extra for her 4 wheeler, so she can continue to ride as long as she wishes without a wait time..Love it!	1
Product does work great on granddaughters Jeep, but little expensive. But she's happy and we're happy.  If price was less I would have given it 5 stars.	1
We got a free jeep that worked for years, then the battery died. Replaced it with this and has been working great, worth the price.	1
Battery either died right away or somethings wrong with the Power Wheels motorcycle that it goes in. It's likely the motorcycle.	1
Got an older Hot Wheels Mustang. It came with both battery & charger but batter was no good. Checked Fisher-Price. Did not want to pay that price. Checked Ebay did not want to play the wait and see game of bidding. Thought I would try Amazon not sure if there would be anything like it there. Bingo found you and was very very happy with price , shipping cost & time. I was confident it would be new. Battery charged up fast and my granddaughter had a great time . Thank You	1
Bought this is as replacement for the original battery from the power wheels. It works well like the day I bought it.	1
I'm kind of apalled how the price of this, BUT this rating isn't about that (just keep an eye out for it to go on sale).  This battery will hopefully last longer than the original that came with my daughter's Barbie Jeep, although, it did last a decent amount of time.  Works great and keeps a decent charge.	1
Exactly what it says it is. You have to charge it as soon as you get it but after charged it goes and goes just like the factory ones you get with the power wheels do at first	1
So far so good.  Kids are rolling around the neighbor like bosses. Charged real fast and keeps the charges too.  Thanks..	1
Perfect OEM replacement part for PowerWheels motorized electric toys. Replaced an original 5 year old battery. Price is better than in the stores.	1
Gotta have an extra or even two if your little one rides their Power Wheels to death lol. The charge on these lasts pretty good, can't complain!	1
So disappointed with how these batteries handle charge if you don't care of it everyday like a child. Have only owned the battery for 6 months or so and it's already dead.	-1
Not much to say about a battery.  My kids wore the first one out, so it was nice to get a replacement so they could keep on riding their jeep in the yard.	1
We purchased this as a backup battery for our sons fisher price pickup truck. It has worked very well and makes it so much easier to always have a charged battery ready.	1
Tee battery in the powerwheels jeep was dead when we found it for $1 at a garage sale.  But the kids were excited at the prospect of a new toy so it came home with us.  With the purchase of this new battery and a charger also from Amazon it has been going strong every since.  We also have another PW vehicle that has a 6-volt battery.  This 12-volt battery for comparison runs much longer than that other toy does.  So it is clearly holding more power.  A good find all around.  Make sure that the connectors are right for the vehicle you are getting a replacement for.  Match the charger and the vehicle and all will be well.	1
It holds a charge great and really kicked in my son's power wheel jeep. This battery was much cheaper thru amazon than buying in the store.	1
We purchases this battery for our barbie jeep.  We received it and originally it would not hold a charge.  We thought that perhaps we needed to buy a new charger.  We bought a new charger, and yep, it charged BUT would not hold a charge.  Amazon sent us a new battery and my kids are very happy.	1
This battery is great, but you have to be aware of how long you've used (or not used) the car before charging.  In other words, you are not supposed to let the car sit in the garage for too long without use, or the battery goes bad.  Also, you need to pay attention to how long you charge the battery for.  Overcharging can cause burnout. So pay attention, be aware, and it'll be well worth the money.  Toys R Us charges a lot more for this.	1
My husband had bought two replacement batteries through "Amazon.com LLC" in 2011 and both failed shortly after. I told him to return them, but he said the return policy seemed complicated and he neglected to do it. This year I ordered one battery from Seneca River Trading and took a picture of the battery ID number on my phone so I could keep track of the new and old batteries. We charged it fully and the kids took off in their Power Wheels toy - for the first day. Once they wore it out, we placed it on the charger that night and attempted to take the toy out again the next day - It barely moved. I switched outlets and let it charge again overnight. It still won't power the toy out of the garage. I purchased this on 7/26/13. I sent them an email about their return "Criteria" which states :   "In order for us to accept a return it must meet out criteria. As long as the item is returned within 30 days in the original condition. Meaning it can not be opened or used. If we feel the return criteria has not been met we will notify you. Please email if you have a concern with the return criteria or question about your order."   It goes on to explain the refund procedure which also means that once you ship it back, it is up to the company to give you your money back after they perform a test evaluation.  And just for the heck of it my battery number is 1423PM2 in case I ship it back and someone else may get it someday. I am beginning to believe that these companies might sell recycled batteries and don't advertise that. I will have to purchase the darn $90 Fisher Price battery from Toys R Us to actually have the kids enjoy their toys.	-1
I was excited to see this on Amazon because it was significantly cheaper than the price in stores, but lo and behold they sold me a bad battery. However I just resolved the matter with customer care chat and they will be refunding my money. Disappointed, but pleased with the customer service response.	-1
If you have a Power Wheels ride on toy, you know how important it is to have more than one battery!  Very easy to charge and change out.  Fast delivery.  Very satisfied!	1
Our son is super happy to have some power in his jeep again. The original battery made it about 2 years before it needed to be replaced. He can ride all day now instead of 20 like before.	1
The battery's working fine, it says to charge it every day, but I do it every couple of days. But the jeep runs fine with it.	1
I mostly ordered this battery off of Amazon because it was at least $20 less than in a retail store. It arrived in great shape and the packaging seemed to protect it well. We have had it for a month exactly and it seems to hold a charge well, we did follow the instructions to a T for the first charge and that might be why it has worked so far.	1
saved approximately $30 versus buying from toys r us store. works fine, kid is happy once more.  lasts about 4 solid hours before charge.	1
I got these for extras for my grandsons power wheel vehicles.  They charge while they use their other ones up, so they always have their cars ready to go.	1
my kids are very happy that their power wheels car works now.  the battery came charged and ready to go  thanks	1
Works just like the original. Make sure to charge it over the winter, otherwise it will not start again in the summertime (happened to us with the original). Works well!	1
The other reviews about getting stuck with a bad battery are no longer the case if you shop smart.  Ensured you purchase from amazon and you will be in their words "well protected".  When I did have an issue, amazon was there for me and replaced the battery right away (next day shipping even).  I am glad I bought on amazon and much easier than trapsing around town trying to find it in stock with a recent manufacture date. In terms of the battery, they arrived almost fully charged and ready to go (according to the quick charger).  I wish it had been packed a little better, but I also left feedback to that effect.  The warranty does state that it covers batteries purchased from PowerWheels for 6 months (usual exclusions) so I don't know if this is in warrenty but I am not worried.  Brought a powerwheels that I scooped out of the trash right back to life.  Very happy	1
I had the opportunity to purchase a used power wheels Cadillac for my kids but it did not come with a battery or charger. I bought both here on amazon and have been using them almost daily since receiving them 2 weeks ago. The battery has held a charge for several days at a time and thankfully we haven't run into the issues as some of the other reviewers.	1
When you initially get it you have to let it charge for something like 18 hours, but after that it doesn't take as long.  Just commenting on that because I didn't expect that when I ordered.  Otherwise work well.	1
This battery works as advertised. Just be sure you charge it after every use, and don't charge for more than 30 consecutive hours.	1
Plugged it into my sons Power Wheels Dune buggy and it worked like a charm.  This is the first one I have bought (not including the original one).  Bleeding expensive, but what are you gonna do.........I tried to "refurbish" the original one but the store said it couldn't be done.	1
Well, I took a chance here after reading the reviews...and I lost. Charged the battery 18 hours, per instructions. Worked for an hour. Charged again for 18 hours. Worked for 10 minutes. Used both times in a Power Wheels Dune Racer. Good news is that Amazon CS was awesome, and immediately sent out a new battery at no charge. I'll update after I've used the new one.	-1
i bought this for a power wheel that we found at a yard sale...turns out the motors on the wheels were both bad.  so this is waiting for the kids' birthday when we will probably buy them a new one (spoiled brats, et al).  i have been storing this for about 4 months and it still meters over 12V...so it holds a charge well enough.	1
Received it quickly and it works great.  Charges beautifully and keeps the Barbie Jeep rolling along.  Would definitely buy again.	1
I needed to replace the origanil battery that can with my 6 year old daughters Hot Wheels ATV, as the battery had been overcharged to many times and would not hold a charge any more.  This new batter is an exact match to the original one. Great product, works great and now my daughter is out and riding again	1
My original battery lasted 5 years. it still ran it just would not hold a charge long since my grandkids now drive it at the 5 mph speed. The new battery is awesome. They drive the jeep for hours at a time. Only recharged it once so far. I will probably get another 5 years out of it.	1
Great price, used it in my kids motorcycle. They have a blast. Would definitely recommend. I didn't find a cheaper price than this.	1
Arrived quickly and just in time to charge it up and save an aching back from having to push the car back to it's storage place. A second backup battery is great!	1
Replaced the original with this one.  It is awesome.  Holds charge well, fits in the original compartment and uses the same connector.	1
It gave new life to our 8 yr old power wheels jeep. I know the last battery lasted over 5 yrs.	1
My daughters barbie jeep needed it, now she drives around our yard happy as can be. Im so glad I was able to replace the battery.	1
I did receive the item very quickly and it seems to work. HOWEVER, I have no idea if this item is brand new as there is NO PACKAGING included.  Literally the only thing you receive in the (very thinly lined) bubble wrapped package is the battery.  Extremely poor shipping materials used (a priority mail envelope!). I was expecting it to come in the original packaging and it did not. That said, the battery seems to be okay for now but I am quite positive that being banged up and thrown around, like all packages are, across the country was not good. I would not recommend this seller.	-1
I have no problems with this battery whatsoever.  Is it overpriced?  Hell yes?  Does it do it's job?  Hell yes.  Good purchase.	1
We bought a Barbie Jeep from the want ads and all it needed was a new battery!  I was glad that we found one for a good price.	1
This battery has a long life compared to the battery another store sold us. The other store talked us in to getting a refurbished battery and was a waste of our money. Our 4 yr old was frustrated after only a short time while riding the power wheels. She is really happy now that it last longer than half a day. Now she can ride all week with out recharging the battery. Thank you for having this power wheels battery. We have had this riding toy for 4 of our GRANDS and it is still going strong thanks to the new battery.	1
I ordered 2 of the Power Wheels 12-volt rechargeable batteries and both work great. I'm unsure of the reviews saying they don't hold a charge because I have had no problems with them. If you follow the directions for charging you will be fine.	1
This works fine for us. I wish it came with a manual though as I know how different batteries get charged differently. I'll have to look for a manufactures webpage.	1
Arrived in great shape and charged up fine. Runs the toy car like it was new. Came faster than I expected.	1
This replacement battery was half price compared to the manufacturers website. I'm so glad I thought to check amazon. You can find just about anything here!	1
see above title for all i have too say on this...i mean come on its a battery and it works...nuff said	1
I read the reviews about the battery dying and thought that perhaps things had changed. Apparently not. I bought the battery on 4-11 and got less than 10 charges out of it before it croaked. Amazon was nice enough to credit my card, however I won't be purchasing another battery from Amazon. I am hoping to get one from Fisher-Price that is better?? *crossing fingers*	-1
Needed a second battery for my daughters powerwheel. This battery is identical to the one that came with the powerwheel I purchased. Shipped fast and in its original bubble wrapped package. The company sends a letter that tells you they receive these in bundles and before they ship them they test them. I would reccomend to order powerwheels parts from this company!	1
We purchased a Ford truck for our grandson.  Since he usually drives it until the battery is dead (an hour on our terrain) we purchased this as a second battery for more hours of fun.	1
There is nothing like a new battery :o)  Last summer we bought a power wheels at a garage sale and let the kids drive it on the original battery.  It never lasted long.  Now it is the vehicle that my three kids fight for...of the 2 power wheels we own, it has the most power and lasts the longest.  We like the product and had never had a problem with it - as long as you follow the instructions for charging (i.e. always fully charge the battery for 18 hours before its first use, make sure it gets fully charged after every other use, etc.)  We were able to get the best price for this from Amazon...good deal!	1
I rarely give negative reviews, almost NEVER!  This is the most worthless junk I have ever bought. Stay away from Fisher Price in general.  Everything they sell is either dangerous or cheaply made.  I have a degree in electronics and computers and I can tell you no matter what you do this battery will not last.  They wear out way too quickly and you;ll get zero customer service from Fisher Price.  This has been one of the worst purchases EVER.	-1
We ordered this battery from Amazon.  This was the best price, delivery time was excellent and battery works great.  Follow charging instructions carefully for maximum battery life.	1
this is a good product but beware that they are dead upon arrival and have to be charged for a minimum of 72 hours straight no short cuts to get the full advantage out of them.	1
I purchased a power wheels jeep 4 years ago that came with this battery.  My son rides in his jeep almost everyday and this battery will give several hours of ride time before needing recharging.  The reason i write this review is i purchased a competitors ride on called the gator which works fine. The battery is a 12v, however, the run time is very short and only last 60 minutes or less on hard flat surfaces.  We have never had one problem with our power wheels jeep and the battery has been terrific.  I would suggest one consider the battery life before purchasing a ride-on as my son does not ride his gator much as the battery runs down very fast...and he ends up back in his trusted power wheels jeep and battery combo....we will be taking back the gator as i don't think we should have to pay for a second battery which the two will still not run as long as the one power wheels battery...worth the $$$$	1
I sleep with sarge every night. He is my best friend. I got him because I used to have a German Shepherd mix but I had to give her away. So my grandma bought me sarge. I love sarge. He is my comfort buddy. If I am sick, sad or angry he is always there to comfort me. I am 11 years old by the way. I am in the 6th grade, I bring him to school with me and put him in my locker until the end of the day. Everybody loves sarge, they say he is one of the cutest stuffed ty dogs ever. Also he is super soft. Most of the time I have to hide him under my pillow because I am afraid my dog will tear him up if I leave him out in the open unattended. SARGE IS SUPER FANTASTICALLY AWESOME!!!!!!!	1
True Colors is a great game to play with a group of people you know well (a mixed group of guys and girls works best).  The scoring is described in other reviews, so I won't go into it here. The key thing is, if you are comfortable around the people you play the game with, you'll laugh till your sides hurt.  I read another review that said the game was hurtful if you didn't get any votes on certain questions...this could be true.  But remember: 1) if you are with really good friends, you know they accept you quirks and all...and this game is a great way to laugh about (not at!) everyone's quirks; 2) you can always vote for yourself to avoid any embarrassing situations.  Play the game--you'll like it!	1
This is a very good party game that lets you find out about others opinions of you.  Question cards, such as "You just found out that you've been eating choclate covered ants.  Who keeps eating?" (not intended as a direct quote) are placed in a container and each player gets one.  You put two color cards (each color represents a player) in the container and pass it on.  When you've gotten every card, you guess whether you've gotten some, most, or none of the votes and score for correct guesses.  This game is easy to learn and play and very enjoyable.  I recommend this especially for adults and good friends.	1
When I look for a game I try to find ones that are challenging, interactive and fun. When I came across True Colors I found the game that  met my qualifications and I am glad I have it in my house. True Colors is  not your ordinary game and the fun start when you open the box. The one  page simple to follow directions makes getting started a breeze. The  playing pieces are clothespins, which is certainly different than any other  game I have. The game is fast paced and this one will give you a closer  look into what people think of you/ Each player votes on the question  that is read aloud but before opening the ballot box you also must decide  how votes you will get. Then you tabulate your votes as compared to the  predictions you made and you score point based on this. The next round  begins after the votes are counted and you play ten rounds to find the  winner. I found that 6 players make the game more interesting and fewer  rounds also helped, but you can make that decision yourself. A great party  game or when friends come over - well done again Pressman Toy!	1
I bought this to be a companion to Courage for my 4 year old grandson. He loves them both. They are well made and I like the story behind them which makes them special.	1
I bought this game for a game night with our extended family.  It was really fun to play and kept everyone laughing and interested for at least 2 hours.  You need at least 4 people but ideally 6 to make this game really enjoyable.  We purchased one for our inlaws house as well.	1
this is a lot of fun to play with people you know well.  I would have girls night and some of my friends wouldn't know each other very well and it made this game more difficult, so best played with a few close friends that all know each other	1
Enjoy playing with family and friends. You can really label people and tell them exactly what you think! Funny stuff.	1
This is a very fun game. The more people playing the better, 4 or more. This is a fun way to see what people think about you and makes you think of some interesting things about your friends. This game requires that one should know the people they are playing with an not someone barely known.	1
my son is in the lions class for kindergarten so we purchased these as V day gifts for his teachers along with candy...	1
soft, cute TY beanie! just as described and my child really loves it! could not be more happy than we are. my babygirl really loves the fuzzy maine!	1
This little lion is so cute.  I have had it for a year and it still has all it's fur- even after being well loved by two small children.  Also- if you have a cat- watch out- ours LOVED the fluffy fur and we had to make sure to hide it when it wasn't being used.  Cute little TY beanie baby!	1
The Ty Beanie Babies - Bushy the Lion, My Girlfriend Loved it! She Loves Lions so I knew She would love it!	1
This game was a big success and has given us hours of fun and laughter. Highly recommend. Has both words and pictures so all ages can play it.	1
Our 5 and 3 year old kids love it and it's enjoyed by the adults.  Thumbs up for its kid creativity/imagination stimulation and fun.	1
Adults and children from 3yrs and up, special needs and teens can all enjoy "acting out" the pictured clue.  What fun for a family reunion, indoor weekend, etc.!	1
I got both this and the adult version of Charades.  The grown ups all play this when we get together and the kids so much want to be a part of the fun.  Now they can be.  We set this next to the grown up box and let the kids rotate into the mix and just draw from theirs.  They love being a part of the family tradition.  It has words for older kids or pictures for non-readers.  It goes around like a board game but we haven't played it that way yet.  This is one of my girls favorite holiday presents.	1
Ravensburger are awesome durable puzzles. Love the colors.	1
Great Puzzle! I bought this for my 6 year old who loves learning about the universe. He loves it!	1
The puzzle was purchased for a disabled adult.  The puzzle was sturdy, colorful, challenging but not too hard.  Loved the added elements - - - astronaut, etc. and impression of motion that I have not seen on other puzzles of the galaxy.  Not to big, not too small. The adult with autism that the puzzle was purchased for took an immediate interest.	1
These puzzles are high quality with excellent graphics and cutting of the pieces.  They are also non commercial in that they do not advertise TV or movie characters and encourage additional learning of the subject material.	1
Great Service and I recommend the product. Great challenge for my 4 year old and he loves it. Buy one today!	1
High quality, durable.  Seems like it will stand up to lots of use.  Needed a puzzle in between the 40 piece and 100 piece size; this was a perfect stepping stone.	1
My father has alzheimer's and in addition, he has had many small strokes and is a cancer survivor. He used to put together puzzles that were thousands of pieces but this is about all he can do now and he has trouble with these. I appreciate the fact that many of Ravensburger puzzles are suitable for the elderly. My father would not like putting together puzzles with GI Joe or Barbie but he has put together this one and a few others. Very Very happy with this and as my father is still working on it and it is something I can do with him and makes him feel a little connected to his past....then it is worth its weight in gold (plus..its good for his brain)	1
This is the 3rd Ravensburger puzzle I've bought for my preschool son. Each of them have provided endless hours of enjoyment, he never tires of these (also bought the fire station and airport puzzle). They are great value for the money, pieces are the perfect size for little hands and wear very well even 2 years after regular use.	1
Great puzzle at a great price	1
I love Ravensburger puzzles.  I don't work on any other!  Can't wait to get started on this one!  I have so many more I want to purchase!	1
The pieces are fantastic. When they fit together, you can tell because they lock in the back in a good way so you aren't second guessing yourself a lot.	1
I purchased this puzzle as a Holiday "lightening special". . .. and I didn't look closely enough. . .  This puzzle is a "pre-9/11" photograph, as the "Twin Towers" are in the picture.  If I had noticed this, I would not have purchased the puzzle.  Personally, I just don't want to put a puzzle together and constantly be reminded of such a tragic time in our history.	-1
I have always loved puzzles and especially the quality of the Ravensburger puzzles. It took me a couple of weeks to get it done, but it looked beautiful at the end.	1
Good quality puzzles	1
Sister loved it	1
Bought it for my parents.  They said it was too difficult and that it hurt their heads...  So if your parents are getting old and don't want to spend too much cognitive energy then get a puzzle with less pieces.  Still good product.	1
Can't beat the quality of Ravensburger	1
I love it.	1
Of the ten or so 1000-piece Ravensburger puzzles I've built, this was one of the best. The colors are always great on Ravensburger puzzles, but sometimes the pieces fit too loosely. This puzzle did not have that problem. I find it about average in terms of difficulty, too.	1
write review	1
Good product, good service!	1
Lovely birds, Ravensburger quality - what's not to love about this puzzle!	1
Just finished this puzzle and it is a really nice puzzle.  All pieces were in the box, pieces are cleanly cut, colors are vibrant and realistic looking.  Very little cutting dust in the bag.  Pieces stay together once placed.  Quality puzzle.	1
Bought this for my step mother as a Christmas present. She loved it. She had never had a Ravensburger puzzle before and could not say enough about the quality, etc. She said it was the nicest puzzle she's ever put together. Plus she loved the picture. Highly recommend.	1
love this puzzle, very pretty plan to frame it	1
Enjoyable	1
Love the Ravensburger quality, doesn't separate. Mildly difficult and fun.  3 adults and 1 teenager knocked it out in a day.	1
This is the best puzzle I ever assembled! I bought 2 for holiday gifts, and one of those we completed on the next day, it was just my friend and I and it took about 6 hours. The puzzle is very easy for a 1000 pieces - many distinct features and the colors are very versatile. Lots of fun to put it together. It looks gorgeous, and the quality is remarkable. The Ravensburger company is renown for the best puzzle quality on market, a friend of mine told me. I loved it so much I am close to bying one for myself again, although it is kind of silly to do the same puzzle twice; it is very time consuming anyway, so I probably won't but I would like to have it on my wall. So much so I came here and wrote a review.	1
Nice item. Fast shipping.	1
Pretty tough puzzle for a 1000 piece since so many greens, flowers and bird/butterfly colors are similar. Ravensburger makes great puzzles and I'll be buying more of this brand. I highly recommend it.	1
This is a beautiful puzzle. Took me awhile to put together. It was to be a 1000 piece puzzle but only had 999.	1
Love these puzzles! Fast shipping too!	1
Beautiful puzzles - Ravensburger is the best !!	1
Challenging but fun, beautiful picture.	1
Lovely puzzle...quality all around.	1
This is the second Ravensburger puzzle that I've received that were missing pieces. I'm 0 for 2. This time 4 pieces were missing. Each time it's been a brand new sealed package. They must just sweep up the floor at the factory and toss out all the dropped pieces. There's no pleasure in searching for hours then realizing the piece is missing. Save yourself the money and frustration and don't buy Ravensburger.	-1
Head scratcher. Tons of fun. Some of the best puzzles ever.	1
Love this puzzle, fun to work, lots of birds and butterflies.	1
Beautiful picture. Awesome puzzle! I will frame it when I am done. I bought one for my friend who loves birds also!	1
great price, well made, beautiful picture.	1
my mom loved it. very colorful	1
Another gift that does double duty- keep the dh busy and out of my hair and when it's done I get to hang it somewhere if I want. This is a really cute one- will find a spot for it in the FR. The graphic quality of Ravensburg Puzzles is always perfection.	1
fun and pretty puzzle	1
Beautiful picture, but quite a challenging puzzle.  Not for the faint of heart!	1
So Pretty!	1
This is one of my kids (and mine) favorite puzzles. So much fun to build. And colorful!	1
Great Buy!	1
I'm a huge Ravensburger fan, and this puzzle really intrigued me because of the multitudes of vibrant colors. As always, the pieces are thicker, are cut well, and the colors match the box. The leaves added an element of complication that we enjoyed thoroughly. We are now seriously ADDICTED to puzzle assembly!!!	1
Great puzzle lots of challenge and fun.  This was my first time with a Ravensburger puzzle.  I loved the colors and the structure of the pieces.  It will be a do over again puzzle	1
A gift.  Recipient had several enjoyable winter evenings with this purzzle.  Good quality.	1
The best jigsaw puzzles I have ever assembled. The pieces lock together and are very strong. These puzzles will last forever. The picture is so clear.	1
Another gem n so much fun to do,it wasn't a push over but I like puzzles that make u use your mind to figure it out,it's fun to know that u can overcome the shapes n sizes n have fun doing it	1
Ravensburger is the best puzzle brand we have found. The quality of their puzzles is always top notch. The pieces fit together nicely, the image is always bright and crisp, and the pieces don't bend or break apart like with some puzzles. All Ravensburger puzzle pieces are blue on the back, which is a nice touch, but sometimes makes it a bit more challenging to pick out blue pieces such as sky. They also come in a nice sturdy box.  Another great feature of all Ravensburger puzzles is that they are packaged in a plastic bag (within the box) that is labeled with a batch number that you can use to try to get replacement pieces. We have never had a puzzle from them that was missing any pieces (and we have done around 20-30+ of their puzzles), but if you happen to end up with any missing pieces yourself, you should have the batch number available so you can contact Ravensburger's customer service (through their company website). I suggest that when you open up your puzzle, you write the number from the bag on the inside of your box. This way, you don't have to keep the bag around, and you will always have the appropriate batch number with each puzzle. Their current policy states that they are not always able to replace single pieces, but they will do their best to resolve the situation. Their manufacturing process requires they change the cutting tools every so many puzzles (and this process changes the shapes of the pieces), so my guess is that you will be able to get replacement pieces as long as your puzzle is from the current cutting tools.  This particular puzzle is cute with all the signs and little bugs everywhere. The puzzle has a good color balance, and it's relatively easy to put together.	1
The person we bought it for likes puzzles. Not sure what you write about for puzzle recommendations, but this person liked it, sooooo there ya go!	1
Ravenburger puzzles are my favorite primarily because they are well made and often challenging.  This one was was a particular challenge with lots of muted greens and pinks to keep a puzzler busy for several days.	1
This was a christmas gift for a very good family friend.  Their family enjoys sitting around trying to get the puzzle together. I liked the picture imediatly and thought of them, as they have several bird houses on their property.	1
If you want consistent quality and beautiful images stick with Ravensburger. Well-packaged and sealed boxes mean all your pieces are going to be there.	1
As usual, I find that these are great puzzles, and I got this half price, so how could I go wrong.  My Grandmother will LOVE it!!!	1
beautiful puzzle when complete.  very realistic looking and looks exactly like the photo.  I enjoyed assembling this puzzle and I think it took me 2 days.	1
High quality and non glare pieces.  Loved doing this puzzle but upset when at completion there was a piece missing!!  For a number one company was surprised that there would be a piece missing.  Have written to the company with a complaint.  Still a fun puzzle to do!	1
I got this to put together at the beach.  I figured my mother and sisters would want to do it with me.  It ended up being my dad and partner who spent hours working on it.  They really enjoyed it and I enjoyed doing it with them.  The picture is truly magnificent.  Love the puzzle and the quality.	1
I love this puzzle maker, the colors are beautiful, the pieces fit good, very interesting picture. I will buy again, and I recommend.	1
I just finished this puzzle the other day.  It is such a great picture.  I was going to seal it and have it framed and hang it but I know I will enjoy doing it again in the future.  The pieces are sturdy and the puzzle is so colorful.	1
This puzzle was fun to do. It is made well and looks great. Very colorful and was not hard to do.	1
excellent puzzle. love this brand. the pieces are interlocking and fit together nicely. the subject is very pretty and colorful.	1
For some reason my 3 and 4 year old grandsons love to pretend they are baby alligators when they bathe. So all of a sudden they are baby alligators everywhere. I gave them these baby alligators and how thrilled they were. very sweet well-made toy.	1
Wow, sandboxes can be expensive! I looked at all of the sandboxes before I bought this one. The little tikes frog sandbox was the most inexpensive one I could find, but it could only really fit 2 toddlers in it. I didn't want to spend too much on a sandbox, but didn't want to go cheap in the material as well. So I went the next step up, to this one. It is really sturdy, and my 2yr old son can sit on it's claws, or sit inside. The lid is a little flimsy, but it closes well, and I don't have to worry about "little intruders." And it can hold more than 2 toddlers so he can invite his friends over for some sun and sand.	1
Great sandbox! Shipping was about 5 days.	1
The turtle sandbox was a little too small for 2 kids to share. This box is deeper and wider, definitely what we wanted. The lid fits snug, no scorpions in our box.	1
Met my expectations. Lid fits well. Perfect size for 2 toddlers.	1
My kids love it!!  It has almost made it through a summer and still looks and works brand new.  Warning though, don't leave it in one spot on you lawn for more than a week or two, of course.	1
It's cute and serves its purpose, but I didn't know there would be small holes on the side (where the handles are - see my customer question and the responses) and they are annoying. We keep tape there to cover them up and seal the sandbox when not in use.	1
This is a fine sandbox that holds two toddlers just fine. It's ample space for one. It's enough space for two. It'd be a little cramped with three kids in there at once.  The plastic material it's made from is sturdy and durable. It's been on the deck in partial sun at grandma's house for 3 seasons now and it's holding up very well. I'm not seeing signs of fading or cracking or anything like that. The lack of fading is a huge surprise and red plastic tends to turn whiter in the sun. But I don't see that here.  The lid is a slightly thinner plastic than the sandbox itself, which is actually good because it makes it easy to remove it and carry it away from the box when the kids are playing. It's plenty durable enough to keep rain out, and it's still heavy enough to stay in place during strong winds. Outside for 3 years, rain and debris does not get into this sandbox with the lid on.  The round design makes multiple kids fit better, but it's worth noting that the round design and the crab's claws and feet make this sandbox take up a decent amount of room. You'll need a large deck or good space in the yard to fit this well. If that's an issue to you, you may want to consider the Step2 castle style sandbox. I have that one at my house and it's more streamlined to fit in a small space. It also holds 2 kids well. But it's a rectangle rather than a circle to it sticks into a corner of a deck better.	1
Plenty big and love the lid. It has stayed on through two storms.	1
Such a great product! Love the size and the fact that it has a lid for storage outside. It fit 300 lbs of play sand and probably could have fit one or two more bags. Plenty of sand for my girl to play in and she loves the fact that it's a crab. She received it for her 2nd birthday and plays in it any chance she can. The only downside to this is the seat areas are fairly small so she mostly just stands up and plays with the sand instead of sitting down on the side seats.	1
So far so good, no mold and no lifting of the lid by wind	1
My son who is 1.5 loves this sandbox. I fit 4- 50lb sacks of sand in it and was perfect to sit in. One quick advice issue for the adults. ... don't sit on the claw to play with your child in it I sank the claw in and it's not popping  back up.	1
Sand stays in the box, lid stays on the box, kids love the box - Repeat = success	1
The sandbox is great, the box it came in was totally torn up thank goodness the sandbox is unbreakable	1
very happy with this item	1
Grandaughter loves.  She can sit on the edges.	1
SUPER cute sandbox!! My toddler absolutely loves this! It's durable and the cover helps to keep the sand dry and the critters out.	1
It is awesome. We used it as a pool for our 18 months old!!! Will use a a sand box in fall	1
We bought this for our granddaughter to replace the turtle sand box she had to leave behind. I expected this one to be nicer at twice the price but it's only slightly larger and the plastic is not as sturdy. The lid doesn't fit on as well or as easily as the turtle (and really, the manufacturer couldn't have added a latch to keep it on?) Yes, the seats are cute for kids but an adult can't use them since they aren't strong enough. The top dented a few times and can be pushed back but wouldn't it be clever and useful if the top could be used for play?  I wish I'd bought the cheaper turtle. The crabbie is not an improvement. I'd give it 2 1/2 stars if it were possible. I don't hate it but I'm not happy about my purchase.	-1
The price of this item fluctuates mightily here on Amazon it's $70 today, but yesterday it was $117!! It's constantly around $60 at ToysRUs, which is where I purchased it. We love the sandbox btw, just not Amazon's inflated price. I usually find Amazon to be the best price for merchandise, but not this time!	-1
My grandkids absolutely love this sand box from Amazon.  In spite of the good plastic molding, the tight fitting cover and the looks/utility of the sand box, I had a problem which is why I gave it only 2 stars.  When I received it, I bought some fine white sand and the kids played in it for several days including a small amount of water.  At the time, we had been having weeks of extremely hot 80/90 degree days and this may have contributed to the problem.  Every time after they were through playing in it, I installed the cover which goes on easy and this keeps out any critter that want to use it as a potty box.  Here's the problem, Mold!  The sand turned green because there was no air circulating and I think it was a combination of several factors, dampness, heat, no air, no sun light etc.  As I said, the box is very nice but maybe the lid needs some holes drilled in it for ventilation but then how do you keep the rain out.  The kids are mad at me now for taking the crabbie away but I think playing in mold could lead to many bad things later on.	-1
WARNING!!!!!!  Watch out for Vendor called " Dundee Deals"  I paid a premium for the Green and Black Othello Game.  What I got was the newer Blue Othello version. If I wanted the newer Blue version, I would have paid $15 dollars less for the other Amazon Vendors!  By the way... the Blue version is super cheap hollow plastic.  It does not feel firm and nothing like I remember.	-1
First, let me say this game is fun if you are playing on a quality game board with quality playing pieces.  Othello is a great game for young children. The rules are easy to learn and this game provides a solid education in basic strategy.  However, I set aside my own nostalgia for this game and looked at the reality of what's inside the box.  Here's the negatives:  This game board is cheap.  The poor construction means poor durability; the faux felt is already peeling away from the board.  The board is designed so tight that the game pieces almost have to be snapped into place when you flip them.  The game pieces are thinner and harder to pick up, especially for older hands (beware grandparents).  Steer clear of this version from Mattel. See if you can find a better quality version of the game. It makes a difference.  Message to Mattel: I'd rather pay the extra $10-$15 for you to provide better-quality materials. Cheap construction like this makes me think twice about buying your other games.	-1
These things are horrible. They are just plastic tubes with about as much musicality as paper towel cores. Very big disappointment.	-1
Overpriced and out of tune, especially the A in our set. They might be colorful but they do not resonate well. Flimsy plastic and easy to squash. If you are looking for a good music toy, don't waste your money.	-1
I bought for a talent 4 year old grandson.  It must not be age appropriate because the 4 yr old didn't play with them, nor did 2, 6, 30s, and 2 60 year old. Also needed better instructions.	-1
So to be fair I bought these for a 2 1/2 year old who LOVES banging anything together and loves to sing and make music. I do not think that these are meant for that purpose even though they seemed like an ideal gift for someone who likes all of those things. They did not make good tones unless banged on a very specific type of surface on a very specific spot. Then the noise was lovely, but it wasn't as though you could bang them randomly and get that same nice tone.  So, to be fair, the rating is related to what I thought they would be, and they weren't. I think there are probably some good applications for them, and my sister will be donating them to the music program at the preschool and perhaps they will work well with guidance and know how.  So to be clear, the rating is based on my expectation that these would be wonderful musical toys for a two and a half year old. I do not think that is what they are intended for but did not have that information going in, so this is just for those who might be considering these for that purpose.	-1
I bought these for two blind children who are interested in music but was really disappointed in the sound quality of the boomwhackers to be honest. One needs to find the perfect place to whack them and then the sound is so quiet that its barely noticable - not worth the money at all!! Steer clear - or as other reviewers say, make your own rather!!	-1
So disapointing, cheap material ripped  in multiple places within minutes of using.	-1
blah blah blah....	-1
My Grandson didn't like this because the netting broke after not very much playing, wasn't worth anything	-1
It's really dumb.	-1
falls like a rock, parachute barley opens	-1
It is impossible to "toss it high" like the instructions say. I even climbed up in my roof and tossed it as high as I could from there and it was totally non impressive!!! I even tried launching it with a catapult that sends a foam ball as high as 100 feet in the air but it was too heavy to go high enough to really work. My grandkids quickly lost interest. Waste of money!!!!	-1
Broke after one use.	-1
Wish I would have known that pink was an option in the variety of assorted colors.  I wouldn't even attempt to give this to my son as he will want nothing to do with it.  It would be nice to at least let your buyer specify if they have a girl or a boy before sending random gender specific colors, especially since there is a no return policy on this toy.  Will save it for my daughters, but my son would have been the one to really love a toy like this.	-1
Arrived without figure.  I promptly threw the whole thing out and chose to ignore this purchase rather than deal with mess of sorting it out.	-1
cheap and does not work well at all.	-1
tangled in broke in under 1 hour.	-1
Does not work well, very poor design.	-1
This does not work! My 7 yr old son can't get it to parachute. Plus I ended up with 2 pink ones. I can't even return it, my son paid for it with his own money and if I could send them both back I would. I will stick to the old ones with the plastic chute.	-1
did not float down sudden fall to floor no fun	-1
It's well made and doesn't tangle, but the design doesn't allow it to catch full wind until seconds before it hits the ground, regardless of how high you throw it. We had to throw it off the top of the roof to have any enjoyment. Total bust.	-1
Nice toy but I received a completely pink one. Was for an Christmas gift. My sister will not enjoy a pink one for her son so now I'm stuck with it.	-1
I picked up several of these for holiday games with kids and am more than disappointing.  I opened up one to try it out, I am an adult, and couldn't throw them high enough to get them to work.  I went to the top of a staircase and threw it from there and had success.  I think a young child will have difficulty playing with it.	-1
Need to throw it from a high area or it doesn't really float.  Nice that it doesn't tangle but not really that much fun for a younger child.	-1
KIds were excited to play with the parachute. Unfortunately, the mesh bottom of the parachute ripped after 10 minutes of play.	-1
The mans head broke off after about eight flights. Now I have a fishing weight.	-1
1.  DOES NOT FLY OR PERFORM AS ADVERTISED.  2.  YOUR CHILDREN WILL PROBABLY BE DISAPPOINTED AS MY SON IS  3. MY SON WRAPPED IT AROUND HIS BIKE HANDLE BAR IN ATTEMPTS TO GET IT TO FLY AND IT DOES MINIMALLY, BUT CLEARLY NOT AS SHOWN IN OVERSTATING, OVER ADVERTISED PHOTO SHOOT TO TRY TO SALE THIS PRODUCT.	-1
This toy is of pretty good quality but your really need about 20 feet to get anything out of it. I have 10 foot ceilings and it will not deploy even if I stand at the ceiling. I imagine it will be fine when it warms up and I can climb a light pole but, not really that great.	-1
Seemed like a great toy, but then when it was being thrown in the air outside, the body gave a clean break off from the head.  It doesn't have the weight it needs to work properly without the head.	-1
Too heavy to "float" down.  The man on it is a bit too big and heavy. You'd have to drop it from a really big height for the parachute to open. I had high hopes for this because my son LOVES to make parachute's out of bags (course the don't really work) and he loves the cheapy parachute men he got at a birthday party (but they tangled too easily).  This doesn't tangle, and the idea/design is good, just need a little better man to go with it.	-1
This does not work at all unless you throw it off a mountain.  At home, it just goes up like a lump and comes down the same.  Very disappointed.  If I weren't so lazy, I would have returned it.	-1
Im not sure what I expected. After ordering this item through Amazon Vine, I studied the product page and thought I was getting a nice, collectible baby doll. This doll does not match the price. It is a stuffed doll with a plastic head nothing more. The doll actually measures 10 inches, not 12 inches as stated. It comes in a very cheesy thin box.  In this economy, we are all looking for good value for our dollar. I thought since the retail price was about $45 that this would be a quality doll my grand children could play with when they come to visit. But this doll is stuffing, and plastic--at almost $50 that is about $40 too much.  If you are looking for something nice for your kids or grand kids, I would look at another product. I did a search for baby dolls for toddlers and young children and Amazon has countless options, at $25 and under. In my opinion, this doll is not worth the retail price.	-1
Yes, this doll is durable and has a classic face.  I was disappointed though by the "dog squeaker" inside the doll's belly to make a crying sound.  It is literally the same sound my dog's toys make.  Also, the doll's right eye is stuck shut more often than not.  I had read, prior to my purchase, in another customer review that they had this same problem but I was swayed by the other overwhelming positive reviews. I will be returning this overpriced one-eyed dog toy. The fancy name brand doesn't make up for the price.	-1
I was very excited about this game as my 8 year old son loves math.  I expected a "scrabble" quality product with wood or hard plastic chips and solid trays but instead there are cardboard chips and flimsy plastic trays.  I love the concept of this game but the low quality will not hold up.	-1
This kitchen is ok, but there are much better kitchens out there.  The biggest problem is that the oven door and dishwasher door are hinged at the bottom, not the side.  It's awkward for me to open the doors, let alone my daughter.  It's also small, which I liked when I was looking, but I've found that my daughter really prefers slightly larger kitchens (she likes to reach) with doors that are hinged on the side (she loves to open and close the doors).  I'm going with a wood kitchen for the next version and sticking this one outside in the playhouse.	-1
My mother bought this an incredibly long time ago when this was her account. Works fine, I guess. Can't really go wrong.	-1
This house came up when we searched for wood dollhouses. However, it is not wood and unfortunately looks pretty cheap for the money you pay for it.	-1
The apron is too stiff.  I have two of these, and my kids do not like wearing them.  Also, my daughter's hair gets into the velcro, and gets stuck there all the time - it's a pain to take the hair out while she is screaming.	-1
I am a former teacher and thought this would be good protection for my grandchildren. Not so! It is so stiff and uncomfortable. It went into the box when I could not even unfold it much less put it on a child. I would not suggest this for any child. The child is so covered with heavy plastic that their skin cannot breath. This is also unhealthy.	-1
I purchased this apron for my 2 year old niece for finger painting and easel painting. I knew it would be too big for her, but I thought I would give it a try. I folded the sleeves carefully and my little niece was very cooperative. The plastic is very stiff and too uncomfortable. It was too hot for easel painting and the sleeves dragged onto her finger painting master pieces. I would not recommend this to anyone.	-1
It was a different lightsaber the one a got delivered to my house, the worst part cheaply made.	-1
Cheap.  Broke day one.	-1
Poor quality.	-1
don't waste your time. krogers sells them that are more effective and better quality	-1
very cheaply made..not worth the money	-1
Pool quality. Cheaply made. It broke in 2 hours. I found a much better one at a toy store...about the same price.	-1
Not worth the money; poor quality, too lightweight.  I thought it would be a lot nicer because I like the company.	-1
This is a hit with my grandkids, but the first one I bought for another granddaughter came with the caterpillars inside the kit.  This was disappointing when the little ones wanted to start right away, and we realized that we had to send away for the caterpillars.  It was a long wait for my 3-year olds.  It's also irritating to have to send more money for shipping costs.  The first set I bought was much better.	-1
I did this last year and ordered only 5 from a different company. They all made it. This year I ordered 10 and got 8 and only 3 survived. Wasted my money!	-1
Colors are very dull	-1
Does not color in metallic colors, I was very disappointed	-1
I could not tell any difference between the metallic colored pencils and a regular colored pencil.  disappointed.	-1
I thought there would be a major difference between the metallic colored pencils and regular ones. Unfortunately, there wasn't much difference at all. They're different hues than I already had so they're ok but I was looking for a greater contrast.	-1
Bought the 10 pack and it came with 8 bottles. Missing the turquoise and the magenta  paint. I'm very disappointed, wish I could have given this no stars. The box also came open and damaged and I bought a brand new item. Buyers be aware.	-1
This has such a strong chemical smell no way would I let my child play with it. I spilled a little bit on the table, cleaned it up and I could still smell it for days. Plus I saw this at target today for $3 cheaper. Went to get a refund and the shipping to return it costs almost as much as the product. I regret buying this.	-1
There was missing bottles! Box was messed up. WON'T buy again	-1
I must have a bad batch. According to th reviews, these wash off of everything. Ummmm, no. My daughter has ruined two shirts and a pair of pants after paint got on them. We even took them off promptly, and soaked hen in oxy clean. Still stained.	-1
I got the package from "Toys R Us delivered by Seller Sushka". I wondered why, only to find out it's much cheaper there, also inTarget & Walmart. It's my own mistake. I should've checked the in-store prices first.  The paints themselves are great in terms of colors and being washable, but they are so small and smell odd.	-1
this paint has a very strong very bad smell to it....	-1
Too sharp for 3 year old!	-1
Discomfort	-1
The box came opened and the paint was rolling around my package thank goodness they didn't spill and get on my other stuff	-1
Just a word of warning-open your box of paints as soon as they arrive.  We bought ours long ahead of when we needed them, and just opened the box only to realize 3 of the paint pots are missing.  Someone must have only needed certain colors and returned the rest (though two of the pots that were in there had dried paint around the edges so perhaps they needed a little of those colors too.)  For the price and time it's not worth my returning this, but I would like to save others from the hassle.  Check the box of paints as soon as it arrives to make sure you're not getting someone else's used paints.	-1
I have a 2.5 yo who LOVES to paint. To keep the mess to a minimum we paint nearly every day in the bathtub. What I liked about these are the colors and the variety. And they are very, very washable. They instantly clean off skin and our (sucky) bathfitters tub better than the squeezable tube crayola paints which have no smell but require a LOT of scrubbing (especially the red) BUT the good ends there. These STINK! After using the squeeze ones, I was shocked how much and how strongly these smell.  These smell like acrylic paints or a poorly ventilated nail salon. Even my husband (who has a masters in art so he knows paint) asked when he first smelled these if I'd made a mistake and given her HIS paints. And he had to come in the bathroom to take over for me because they smelled so strong they caused me to have an asthma attack!  So since we use these in a confined space (bathroom) where we can't guarantee a great cross-breeze, we gave these away after the first time to a friend who does store window decorations. His response? Thanks, but, wow do those SMELL STRONG!  I can't believe they are non-toxic! Or safe for a little one with little lungs to breathe in. Or have on their skin! Or mouth! They rinsed right down and we will not use these ever again. I cannot take the risk of another asthma attack.  BTW my friend said they have no smell when dry.	-1
I received the package as expected but the Crayola packaging was worn out and broken so the paint fell out as soon as I opened the shipping packaging.  Upon opening the paint bottles, none of them had a seal (not sure if this is normal) and the lids have smears, as if it's been poured before.  With this suspicion, most of the paint were, at most, 75% capacity, being the blue color with the least at half contents of the bottle.  Out of all the colors, the yellow seemed full but when poured out, it was a thin liquid unlike the other colors that it spilled out half of the bottle.  My kids used the paint nevertheless since we had already the set up all the materials to paint but I was not happy with the purchase.	-1
The green bottle of paint had already been opened before I received this item, and it was all over the outside of the other bottles. It was too much trouble to complain about, so I did not return them. I will not order them again online.	-1
Nice variety of colors but kids will go through the small bottles very quickly. The smell is so strong and offense, it actually gave both my husband & I headaches. And he's not usually one to be bothered by things like that. It also made me somewhat nauseous too. I say pass on these and go for larger 16oz bottles of tempura paint which is just as colorful, washable and has no smell. And at about $2.50 to $3.00 at discount school supply, it's a better value too.	-1
This ruined 2 pairs of my girls pants, lucky they had no shirts on.  I tried washing multiple time and even washed them right away after they finished painting and now the pants are stained with paint.	-1
I was really disappointed with this. It comes it a basic and flimsy plastic container, the items described on the outside cover of the container were not the items in the container. The items in it were mini size and the "projects" given to make we're boring very very boring and with the mini size items supplied it made it difficult to make the boring items. The price your paying for this makes it a bigger rip off.	-1
I am not one to write reviews, but my disappointment in this product is overwhelming. I purchased this for my very crafty 5 year old son for Christmas. After reading the reviews I was expecting quite a variety of Crayola products inside, what we received was exactly the opposite. The following is what we received. My son was coloring in the notebook before I realized the lack of contents inside the box, if not for it being used, I would be returning this for a refund.  Steralite container with a blue cover. Small Color Wonder 15 page coloring book 25 Page note pad 8 Crayons Child scissors Glue stick 8 Fat markers. 8 Color Wonder markers 2 Glitter Sticks.	-1
You can't color on the back side of the paper!  30 sheets are used up too quickly for the price of the item.  It is a good concept but too expensive to refill regularly.	-1
THE Pages ARE Flimsy AND Rip OUT Of THE Book easily. The pages curl and do not lay flat. Over priced for the quality of product.	-1
Returned them	-1
Warning: only three of the scented markers actually smell good. My kindergartner has renamed the stinky ones "blech!", "garbage", "dirty toilet", and "oh no no no!" They color well, but I recommend sticking with Crayola's unscented markers until they improve this feature. There are waaaay better scented markers out there.	-1
I spent way too much money on Color Wonder pads after my mom bought the Color Wonder paints for my 2yo for Christmas.  The paints went quickly and were just as much trouble to clean up as regular paints.  Don't waste your money on this stuff, just buy the Crayola Washable markers/paints/crayons - they are far superior to ANY other brand.	-1
My main issue with these are that almost all of the marker tips were deteriorated in some way from the time we opened them. Issues include; clumpy ink (?) tips, tips that looked like a toddler already pushed them back into the plastic casing, or tips that had pilly fuzzy threads that made the markers write horribly. My 4 year old doesn't mind it, but I think they are terrible.	-1
These markers run out so fast, I don't know why I keep buying them for my daughter except that there is such a good variety of colors and she likes to do very intricate work - needing the thinner markets.  The case is impossible for storage, so I put them in a large zip-lock bag.  Several of the markers leaked all over the bag.  Several dried out.  The tips smash.  Just not good.  Perhaps I am biased because I am a professional artist, but these markers are just poor quality.  Two stars only because the vast amount of colors in the package.	-1
I bought these monkeys to entertain my 11 month old on long flights.  One monkey arrived with stitching under its dress already undone.  I am out of time to return and get back for our next upcoming flight and am not happy ;-(	-1
I returned this item.  The strap on the purse is not nearly that long, I wanted her to be able to put it on her shoulder, not the case with this item.	-1
The seller was nice & delivered the item however shipping took a wile to get here. The size of this toy is almost microscopic. I don't understand how the manufacturer can chage the same price, or more & reduce the size of the toy. I was disappointed. Not with the seller, with the item	-1
Hasn't really played with it yet.	-1
These were not like I expected them to be. they were quite disappointing. By the time I saw how my son did not like them it was too late to return them for we had used them.  My son doesn't like art and these did not help in the matter... the fine motor skill is so forced and not what I wanted	-1
Horrible product,not only did the top/dabber tear very quickly, the washable part, not so much..Contacted their customer service and have not heard anything	-1
my 2 yr old loved stamping with these, but when he was done we started to clean up and he had ink stains left all over his hands, he is not a big fan of dirty hands, so he was not pleased.	-1
Thought these would be like bingo markers, but they have thick paint in them. prob good for a 4+ year old.	-1
These markers do not dry out and have a good shape; however, they are NOT washable! We tried to wash the red marker from our light brown carpet and now we have seven hot pink dots. Good thing we own this home and we have plans to remove the carpet.  If the kids get them on their fingers, they look freshly inked, even after using baby wipes.  So, great markers if you do not care what gets inky, because it will stay inky!	-1
These leak, and dry out almost as soon as they arrive. Would not recommend. Should have asked for a refund, but not worth the effort.	-1
My 3 year old grandson has trouble using	-1
I should have read the reviews...NOT washable!!!	-1
messy and drippy.	-1
These are ok.  They do run and get messy. Beware!	-1
Buy these! So much fun but so difficult to wash off.......Buy with caution, I am looking for another brand that washes off better. Will not purchase again. I am frankly very surprised by the number of reviews that stated they were easily washable....definitely not from skin.	-1
These are great for BINGO !!  However ,  that is all you can really do with them.  The do a dot artwork coloring books that you can ordedr to use them in are useless.  The ink dots are too big for the pictures and do not color well at all.	-1
didn't really have the entertainment factor I they would. My two and three year old became bored with them. Not too different than markers but much more expensive. coloring books are expensive too.	-1
Maybe I didn't read properly, I will check the description.  Don't buy these for toddlers because they are 100% not washable off hands...what a disaster :-(	-1
We have 3 dogs & they all hate this.  It's fairly quite, but some of the sandpaper was already falling off the disks when we received it new.  My husband glued them back together without much trouble, but it scares all the dogs & they won't have anything to do with it.  2 of them are Shih Tzu's & 1 is a lab & her nails are so thick that it would take forever even if she would let you near her with this grinder.  The worst thing is that I have looked everywhere for replacement disks and have found none anywhere.	-1
Poorly made and my daughter and I did not like it.  We would not recommend this product	-1
I would be giving a better review if not after a month of using it the color already starts to fade it's like it's been in the Sun for months on end it's still holding together for now but I'm not very happy that the colors faded so bad	-1
My son was about one when we bought this for him.  He had zero interest in using it as it is made to be used.  The balls were all over (a couple are missing now) and the hammer is mainly used for other things.  We thought he would "grow into it," but at two and a half, he still has no interest in it's real function.  For around the same price we could have gotten a more interesting Plan ball & hammer toy that he would have enjoyed more.	-1
While I know this isn't really the manufacturer's fault, my son can never enjoy this toy because 1 or more of the balls is always lost (and the toy doesn't work without all of the balls).  It might be fun if we consistently had all the balls but in our house we just can't seem to keep them all in one spot.	-1
This game was recommended by a teacher to increase a student's visual memory. The pictures are kind of weird and not interesting to my kids. The questions are very difficult - like which hand was holding the green shoe? I don't know how this game could be fun, either. I returned it and I bought BrainBox Art instead. It is a similar concept but instead of a goofy illustration the picture is a famous work of art.	-1
This game has the most awful graphics, my kids didn't care for it at all, especially since most of the picture cards to memorize were either too difficult or really boring and old fashioned looking. This game needs a 21st century makeover.	-1
My son received these as a gift.  They are cute & I loved them at first.  Then I realized that they were scratching my refrigerator & dishwasher....not just a little....but the entire surface is full of scratches.  Being dinosaur magnets for kids, I didn't think twice about letting them play with them but obviously I was wrong.	-1
I have four toddler grandchildren.  Their response to this toy was to open the box, remove all the pieces, and then get another toy with more interest.	-1
Colors are a bit dull. Also some of the cubes have smudges of other colors.	-1
This clock shown to be must larger. I am teching children to identify the times. I could have used the class clock if I had know how small this clock was. I better look closer to numbers instead of pictures. I feel this was not good advertising.	-1
Worthless. Can get better bang for your buck	-1
Yes there are only 40 letters, but the ones you'd think there would be multiple of aren't. Only one D in the entire bucket. So I can't write my kids names, can't write DAD, very limiting. But their are 2 X's???  Wish I'd known about the lack of practical letters before purchasing	-1
These are useless - they just barely hold their own weight on a vertical surface. Forget about actually using them as magnets!	-1
magnets don't hold all letters in place	-1
The small magnets on the back are not strong enough to hold the letters on the fridge. Unable to use as desired, resorted to using them on the floor.	-1
Luckily the letters in my sons name were the ONLY letters that happened to stick to the fridge. all the other letters were bent and most had magnets that were unevenly put on the letters making them slide down the fridge or not stick at all. i thought this would be a "bargain"...instead it was just straight up throwing away money. i would not recommend this product. spend the extra bucks and get a nice set. although, i did learn that my son loves magnet letters. So, i guess im safe with buying a pricier set the next time.	-1
My son opened the package and started putting the letters on his magnet board - as fast as he could put them on the board, they slid all the way down to the bottom.  The magnets are very weak!  Returned to Amazon...son was bummed.  Ordered a different set and they didn't work...we're on our third set.  Tested them on multiple magnetic surfaces to make sure it wasn't specifically the magnet board.  They didn't stay up on the refrigerator, the dishwasher, the front door or the magnet board.	-1
Good quality, nice large pieces, but they do not stick even for one second to my stainless steel fridge:(	-1
Weaker magnets, don't stay on to the magnetic board.	-1
magnets don't hold some letters	-1
Great size letters, but they fall down the fridge when using! Disappointing! We use them on the floor instead of using them as desired.	-1
Doesn't work at all. Can't hear a heartbeat on anyone, even tried the dogs. Don't waste your money.	-1
Cheap sponge dice. Do not handle wear and tear.  Not for outdoors.	-1
Very uncomfortable to put in ears and doesn't work at all. Plus the end kept falling off and eventually wouldnt even glue on again. And we had less than 6 mths	-1
it was great for a couple days and then it broke and I can't find the cover piece.	-1
For the price, expect it to be disposable. The  drum part detaches and you won't be able to get it back on. Definitely not built for kids.	-1
poor quality	-1
This is a piece of junk, but I only paid &6.00 for it on sale. I got permission to return it, but at my expense. All we can hear is noise from our hand touching it.	-1
It works and it was really cool at first, my son loved it but the circular part that you use to listen with detaches and falls off constantly, my son has gotten so frustrated he won't even bother playing with it now. Disappointing	-1
Very cheap!  This fell apart the first time we played with it, super glue could not even fix it.	-1
Be sure to have low to zero expectations when purchasing this. I can't believe this is not packaged and sold as a toy rather as an actual piece of medical equipment. For the low price, you get what you pay for. Amplification in general is low and not always easy to hear the heart - this doesn't bode well for an excited 3 year old who's attention span wanes easily. Also know that you have to turn the amplification piece 180 degrees to get better results. You will feel it 'click'.  The ear buds are a bit uncomfortable and small but larger, softer ones are included as an alternative.  Best used as a toy or with a costume.	-1
Hurts my ears!	-1
While it works as it's intended function, there is a metal ring that screws on and holds that white circular material over the part you put on someone to listen to. That ring pops off if you look at it wrong and we thought for some time we wouldn't find the ring part after it happening while we (mommy & daddy) were on a date and our sons grandpa and grandma didn't catch him set it down somewhere when it came apart for the 100th time.  Thankfully we found the part, and I used a liberal amount of super glue to keep it from coming off again but I should have to super glue something that I just bought.	-1
The stethoscope is very tight fitting for my 4 1/2 yr old grandsons and they cannot hear the actual heartbeat -as advertised.  Disappointed in this product and it's advertising.	-1
Should get zero stars. Had to go in the garbage. There are no words to adequately describe how cheap this game is. It is an absolute disappointment. It is pure garbage. The mechanics don't work at all. the doors just close nonstop. Would be impossible to actually play. As a society, we are supposed to be more responsible stewards of our environment, yet we allow Hasbro to manufacture garbage and then we pay them to do so. The guess who? from the nineties lasted years and years, whereas this one literally cannot be played.	-1
Ugh! Crayons broken and box corners torn as though used. New? I don't think so.	-1
When I opened the package, every crayon had fallen out of the box. The box and crayons were covered in crayon marks. Some of the crayons were broken.	-1
Poor box of 64 crayons. Surprised at quality. 2 were broken. Top lid had crayon writing underneath lid from sliding around in box. Seemed as though had been sitting on shelf a long time. Poor packaging. Not the usual new crayons that one expects.	-1
Very over priced, I found for less than a quarter of the price. Will not be ordering anymore	-1
For playing my 2yr old thinks this is amazing and its helping her to learn colors.  Unfortunately the copy we received was sealed, but missing a fishing rod and some fish were missing	-1
This toy broke about an hour after it was opened.  It literally just stopped working.  We tried changing the batteries but that didn't fix it.  Very disappointed.  My older son had a game like this when he was younger and it lasted for years.  I'm really beginning to believe toys aren't made as good as they used to be.  This toy turned out to be a piece of junk very quickly.	-1
Only worked for like 5 minutes before it got jammed. There was no sign of anything getting stuck so i guess its just defective one.	-1
Not the fun magnetic game I grew up with. The poles have ridges that easily catch a fish each time. Much too easy- No skill needed. Even my four year old gets bored quickly.	-1
First time playing with it and the turntable stopped working. Very disappointing. I guess that's why it was so cheap.	-1
Cheap plastic	-1
The fish came broken	-1
Received a used product, no fishing rods included!	-1
Very cheap! Two little fish broke within first use.	-1
Much smaller than I thought this game would be for the price.	-1
It arrived without the little fishing rods. What a waste.	-1
My grandson did like this game but it is very cheaply made and the fishing poles are horrible, I will be requesting a refund.	-1
I ordered this for my grandchildren. They came for a visit just yesterday and were so excited to see all the games I had bought. Well of course we opened Lets Go Fishin first and guess what? There were NO FISHING POLES in the box! Needless to say, my grandchildren were very disappointed that they couldn't play with it!	-1
Boring!	-1
The kids love this game and the concept is cute.  The fishing poles, however are are ridiculously flimsy, so much so that two were broken during the first game.  The "hooks" slip off rendering the poles useless, the kid frustrated and the parents disgusted.	-1
Arrived damaged.	-1
The game doesn't rotate properly.  Rather disappointing.	-1
Not delivered! money is not returned!	-1
Broke after playing it 3 times.	-1
Bought this for my son, it's nice but cheap.	-1
The board gets stuck and makes an awful noise. Very frustrating for a 2 year old to try to play.	-1
My 3 years old daughter was super excited to get this classic game. She played with it a few times and then it just got stuck and stopped spinning. Very disappointing!	-1
They should send the battery with it. It requires a 1.5v battery and those aren't easy to find.	-1
This was a huge disappointment.  The battery needed to be in there just right, otherwise it stopped working.  My kids loved playing it, but it worked for about a day and now even with adjusting the battery it doesn't work.  Huge disappointment.	-1
Junky	-1
came broken. flimsy and cheaply made.	-1
The game is cute but so badly made , 3 of the fishes heads broke within a day so would be nice if they could have been made a bit stronger...	-1
Loved this game as a kid. So cute. Kids liked it. But broke on day 1! :( Just stopped working.	-1
I bought this on September, I ordered all my Christmas presents early, so here we are Christmas day, no fishing poles, return window closed, unhappy kid...	-1
It's ok toy for my 2 year old daughter she tries to catch the fish. Two of the fish jaw was broken aw soon as I opened it. The fishing pole is very cheap. This toy may last a month	-1
some fish came broken.	-1
It's fun while it lasts. So cheap!  The ends of the fishing poles fall off. After about a month the motor stops turning, even with fresh batteries.	-1
This was delivered with a strong moldy odor and a hole in it.	-1
This product was cheaply made, very thin plastic. Some of the fish were broken.	-1
All the fishes so easy to break on their mouth. Worse item that i got from Amazon	-1
Very fast and noisy, wouldn't work for small kids below 6	-1
This item was returned because it was missing the fishing poles that were needed to play the game. Very disappointing.	-1
Wasn't the best quality	-1
This was made for maximum profit and minimum quality. Does not operate like the Go Fish of the past. Fishing lines are all plastic, meaning no rope to dangle the line straight down. Game cant work as origionally intended due to your natural wrist movements turn the fish hook. This makes it very difficult to actually latch onto the fish. This game is fundamentally broken.	-1
Fun game, made for 4 & up, too tough for little ones, pieces fall off fishing pole then you can't use it	-1
Item came with one fish broken already. Doesn't play music as others say theirs do. Much more cheaply made than I remember, but it is enough to make the kids happy	-1
I purchased this on Amazon as a Christmas gift.  My 3.5 yr old son took to it instantly, even though it had a broken fish from the start.  If i was rating it as a %100 complete product it would receive a 4 out of 5 (seems cheap, but my son likes it).  But since it is cheap, and broken prior to playing with it, it receives a 2.	-1
What I received and what is pictured are 2 completely different things. The one I got was a smaller, cheaper version and I returned it	-1
it's such a classic game and have been around forever, but the quality of the material is so bad.  the fishing pole fell apart almost immediately.	-1
When received the box was previously opened and closed with something similar to clear packing tape. clearly not as the manufacturer had intended. The battery mechanism was broken, with the spring bent downward to where the battery was undetectable. After fixing that part, I discovered that a fish's was broken and inoperable. This is item is in wore condition than if I had found it at a yard sale!	-1
A lot of fun, but it doesn't last.  Our first one lasted two months before the motor died.  The second one was DOA.	-1
Be sure you are ordering from Amazon if you want the actual game pictured. Mine came through another company, is different than pictured, and plays the most obnoxious music, it's like a 5 second loop on continuous repeat the whole time my 3 year old plays. The game works well but I'm praying for it to break so I can replace it with the real, silent version.	-1
Very small and a little dangerous for little kids due to little pieces	-1
It is cheaply made and came with a broken fish.	-1
Like many reviews I'm echoing that the speed with which these spin is quiet fast that it's difficult for adults to catch the fish. They should provide multiple adjustable speeds of rotation. Cheap plastic	-1
We bought this for our sons Birthday. It worked for 2-3 minutes and then died. We sent it back for a refund.	-1
Cheaply made but it works	-1
This game is of very poor quality.  My 7 year old bought it with her own money a year ago.  It hasn't had very intensive use, and my children are not hard on their toys, but it stopped working.  We took the back cover off, and found a loose wire.  We repaired the wire, but once it was reassembled, the game would not go around once the fish were put in it.  I would not recommend this game if you're looking for something that will last very long.	-1
The game spins too fast and the fish's mouths close too quickly, so it is really frustrating for little ones (even me and I'm 33!).  Maybe when the batteries start to go bad, it might be better.  It would also be better if there were 4 different colors of fishing poles (like the 4 colors of fish), so you could do a variation of the game where the kids can only catch the fish the same color as their pole, and the first one to get all 4 fish, wins.	-1
The plastic base to this game is completely hollowed out and very cheap looking.  I bought this as a gift and was very disappointed after setting it up and playing with my nephew.  I remember playing a lot better version of this game when it comes to quality.  If a kid tripped and fell on this, or stepped on it I could see it breaking into sharp plastic shards and being quite dangerous.  I would not buy this again!	-1
I loved this toy as a kid so bought it for my son's birthday. It is made super cheap now and really loud. He doesn't seem to mind. I'm just annoyed that it's not the same quality as it use to be.	-1
Kept about 15 minutes before returning. The poles seem really cheap and the tip that goes in fish mouth can pop off too easy.	-1
I was excited to get this! Loved it as a kid, but first off the whole fishing pole is plastice, what happened to the string!? And it broke within a month. Cheap!	-1
very cheap.  the fishing rods were not included.  BUT i went and got a C battery because we used some other magnetic type poles from another game. i put a brand new battery in at 7 in the morning and my kids played with it for about 45 minutes and then it just stopped working!  i thought it can't be that the battery was used up that fast so i put another battery in , and it just plain doesn't work!  very cheap and VERY disappointed!  DO NOT BUY!	-1
The fish go too fast to easily catch and the stiff rod (as opposed to the flexible string rods the older versions had) makes for an even more difficult time playing it. The fish are smaller than the 80's version and a couple of them have already had their heads snapped off while trying to put the game back in the box. It won't be too much longer before this sadly becomes part of a landfill and all I was hoping for was to share a game with my kids that I enjoyed as a kid and have fond memories of. What a fail!	-1
I was very excited to get this and yes it came on time and was very fast with delivery but it was broken. As soon as I opened it I put in a battery and it did not work so I went to Walgreens and bought a new battery, came home and it still does not work. I'm very sad about it. I don't even know how to contact anybody about it because with all of my other items that I have bought there is a contact seller part but I do not see it for this	-1
So obnoxiously loud and annoying that I hid it in the attic. My daughter couldn't be less interested in it anyway.	-1
This is not like the game I grew up with. The fish break VERY easily which is almost impossible to do with younger children. I would look for another game!	-1
When my 3.5 year old saw the box he immediately wanted to try it out and go fishing.  He first tried it without a battery installed and was able to manage it ok.  The fishing poles like to swing a lot when you move them, so he had to hold the rod at the midpoint just to keep it still enough to get it in the fish's mouth.  Now, once I installed the battery (1 C battery) and turned it on, the difficulty increased dramatically.  The game spins fairly fast and the fish don't have their mouths open for very long.  Trying to hook one on a swinging fishing pole can become a little frustrating, even for me.  Now I love a challenge, but if the playability of the game is more of a frustration than it is fun, then the game has lost its appeal.  The parts are cheaply made and I wouldn't be surprised if it didn't last very long.  Out of the box, a number of the fish's stickered eyes had either fallen off or were missing.  It's a good game in that it helps to refine motor skills, but the application and construction of the game is a little too frustrating and disappointing to make it a worth while game.  and he had to hold them still This game is a little frusThere are four plastic fishing poles that pivot and rock when you move it.  You lower the pole over the fishes mouth and wait for it to open, but the fishing pole  To clear up a few things: 1) The game uses 1 C battery, not 2 AAs. 2) There is no music as stated in the product description. 3) The fishing pole and fish are not magnetic as in other, smaller, wind-up versions of this game.  My biggest complaints are that it spins a little too fast, which means that the fish don't keep their mouths open for very long. And because the fishing pole is two plastic pieces with a small cone/cup shaped plastic knob (which is only a little smaller than the fish's mouths) instead of a magnet on a string as in the small, wind-up versions, catching fish isn't all that easy. It's not terribly hard, as I got the hang of it in a few minutes, but it's definitely not as easy as in the magnetic versions.  Lastly, the reason some people have trouble putting the game back into its box is because some of the fish are still in their "up" positions (sticking up, with their mouths open). You just need to rotate it manually until all fish are in their "down" positions. But be sure to only rotate it the way the thing normally rotates, though, otherwise you might damage it.	-1
Product was returned. Tried many different batteries and still would not turn on. The child I bought this for was not happy.	-1
This is a cheaply made game! The plastic part that suppose to open the battery holder, doesn't open, it is broken in some way.  waste of time and money!	-1
This game was fun for my child while it lasted. The problem is after only a few uses, it started to fall apart.  This toy would of rated higher for fun had it not started to auto-destruct from use. Sadly, it has joined the rest of the inferiorly made games at the dump.	-1
We had the old version, shown in the first two photos, and it was great fun for our two year old.  We had several broken fish and eventually it just stopped working after a small plastic piece under the switch died, so we decided to replace it.  This new version has several flaws.  1. Fish are smaller than the previous version and much harder to "catch" especially if you're 2 and using your fingers.  2. The old one started slow then speed up as the game went on, this new version is on faster speed the whole time.  Even I can barely catch any fish.  3. It's overall smaller and less durable, it came with two fish already broken and several of the eye stickers were missing. The old fish don't fit properly in this one so we can't use those as backups.  Overall it's a bust.	-1
okay for kids but Adults don't waste your money...the first time you go to sharpen them, the lead breaks off- and by the time you finally get the lead to not break off anymore the pencil is about 3 inches long..... big waste of money	-1
As expected	-1
Another one that was a waste of money kids cannot balance on it nor can adults it's for decoration only	-1
Kids fall off this too easily.. too high & rounded	-1
Impossible to ride or stay on. Frustrating for everyone. It flips too easily. Unbalanced and dangerous when near steps	-1
Pencils arrived outside of box and leads broken.	-1
Was cool while it lasted. Which was about 2 weeks. Out of all the rafts i bought this year this one was the most ignored. Adding to the surprise that it didn't hold up to the non use	-1
They break really easily- when you sharpen them they break while sharpening. I guess I didn't expect much from them, but I'd like just a little bit of use from them. (These were purchased for mindless coloring, not serious art.)	-1
This float works ok but it has a huge warning label on one side of it that makes it look cheap and ridiculous.  No other floats I own have this.  I notice it is only a problem with Intex floats and a lot of people have been complaining.  Are they defects that they are selling??	-1
This float is too heavy and tips over....be careful with small children	-1
Item was great.	-1
We returned this item.  None of my daughters were able to sit or ride on this whale comfortably.  The area with the handles is too wide and too steep to see around.  Would not recommend.  If you tried to sit up by the handles, then it became top heavy.  Also, it is too tall for the kids to get onto by themselves.  Every time they wanted on it, I had to lift them on.  My girls are 5,6 and 8 years old, ranging from 42" to 54" tall.  None were able to ride it without looking like they were fighting for their lives.  haha.	-1
Good colors, but they don't sharpen up well.  They are cheap and they crack easily.  Save yourself some money: Buy Target.	-1
This toy is enormous and extremely awkward for kids to climb up on. Neither of a 4 yr old or a 8 yr old can climb on it unassisted and once helped on it, have a hard time staying on it because its quite tippy. Needs to be deflated between each uses because it is SO big.	-1
Somehow the turning part got in the way of the wheels.  It is much worse than expected.	-1
cute but kids can't stay on it.	-1
Good idea, but almost impossible for my kids to stay on this. The gecko has a nice "seat" so they can stay on, but this doesn't. Also arrived with a hole in it that I had to patch. Hopefully, the patch will hold. This might be ok for teens, but not 5 or 6 year-olds.	-1
the boys were unable to float on whale. thought it would be fun but they it kept turning over	-1
Was a bit disappointed because the color is very light, not as intense as I would like.	-1
It's really useless unless your kid likes to roll off and climb back on over and over again.  No one can sit on the back of this thing without an adult actively balancing it.  We had more fun with it on the grass.  It inflates and floats and looks like an orca so they got that part right.  But it should be able to stay somewhat upright when a small person is on it.	-1
sits to high and tough balance	-1
Rear Tail fin doesn't hold air	-1
Leaked at tail after two months now i have a whale with no tale	-1
I saw these and thought they were neon considering in the picture they are! But when you get them they're just plain colors this could easily just be bought at any store.	-1
Cheap cheap cheap junk! I guess that's what you get for $3 right? The lead just falls out, literally. I have to constantly sharpen them, and then after a few minutes, the lead gets wobbly, and bam - falls out. The colours are pretty dull as well. I wouldn't recommend these for any purpose other than elementary school, but even then I think that would be too generous.	-1
This is HUGE! It is very back heavy as the front is high. More important...It is BLACK. In the hot sun, the orca turns into a dangerous animal, scalding to the touch and completely unusable. It is very well made however!	-1
It is a sturdy toy but my two granddaughters were unable to ride.  They just roll off.  Good thing it was less than $10.00.  Agree with previous review.  Don't waste your money.	-1
this is horrible unbalanced... my 7 year old had a horrible time trying to keep it upright. It would have been a better design if it had an indented saddle to sit on like some of the other ride on toys.	-1
Just okay	-1
Despite the picture on the box, this thing is absolutely HUGE. I swear it's the size of a real dolphin. It came in a tiny box, so I never thought it would be so big. Because it's so big, it's extremely awkward and hard to get in your car once it's blown up. Once in the water, it's very, very tippy. Even with two adults holding it, my daughter still immediately rolled off into the water. There's really no way to ride on top of it without it rolling. And because it's so big, the wind easily tries to take it. If it were half the size and less tippy, it would be perfect. I feel this will spend the summer on our porch instead. Unless you want something this ginormous, don't get it.	-1
Well this was a disappointment.  My husband purchased the Intex Dolphin, it arrived quickly, we blew it up and it lasted just one day before it developed not one but two leaks.  With two leaks we figured it wasn't even worth trying to keep on top of this situation.  So can't recommend this float.  It looked sturdy enough but couldn't survive being used by one 12 year old girl :(  Pam T~ (This product by Intex, which doesn't cost much more, was far superior -<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Intex-River-Run-Tube/dp/B000PEOMC8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Intex River Run Tube</a>)	-1
I am dissapointed and very surprised to say that this toy has not captured my boys interest at all. I've had it for a year,and the boys are now 2 1/2 and 3 1/2. I thought it would be a huge hit, but it has just sat gathering dust. It is very sturdy and has great eye appeal like all Little Tikes toys. My personal complaint is that I think it is VERY noisy-perhaps this is what makes it so unappealing to my children. My kids have loved push toys of all kinds (even a doll stroller!), but this mower has been a total flop in our household.(I had first tried the FP Bubble Mower-way to messy and very poor bubble output/ quickly returned.) At least I'll get a decent price for it's like new condition at a yard sale or as a donation. I'd suggest giving the mower a good trial run in the store and make your own opinion of the noise it makes before purchasing it. Recently while shopping at [a local store] my child was inseparable with a [less expensive] plastic mower-go figure!!	-1
BUT for my baby cousins who like princess leia, it is perfect as  a collector i go for the more rare, limited, unique, etc star wars items	-1
My son has been collecting these little Star Wars figurines for some time and has about 20 of them. This c-3po is not the quality of what he as collected. It is made of a lighter weight plastic, poor details, spotty metallic paint and most of all his arms and legs are not mobilized like the other figurines. Only his shoulders and hips move. My son was pretty disappointed with c-3po but is glad to have him in the collection.	-1
Very disappointed with the cheap plastic. The price of the $25 was very expensive for the cheapness of this toy. I would not recommend this toy.	-1
Bought a 2nd one of these 4 years later for another grandchild, as they all fight over the 1st one. but apparently "why this current model is reduced in price" is NOT that it's on sale, or a reduced price because Company wants to generate sales, no, unfortunately it's because it is a cheaper-less quality-lighter weight toy to my great surprise and displeasure...  I would have gladly bought it again at the original price, or even at a higher price 4 years later, understandably, but what I "hate about RETAIL in general" it that items are "never better or at least as good"... The price may be lower or maybe not, but the product and customer satisfaction always suffers, and that's the way of the world.  Product quality take an initial hit when manufacturing is transferred out of the US, and yet again when the Corporation gets even greedier and later on cutz the general quality at sub's-manufacturing site to make an even greater profit margin on an overall lesser-quality duplicate clone = so we're DUPED as consumers....always!! Thanks Dirt Devil...	-1
I have a huge tolerance for noisy kid toys. Really. But this vacuum is the worst. I don't understand why the wheels have to click. There's no reason and it's a maddening sound. Grandma got it as a birthday gift, at my suggestion of a vacuum cleaner. I've been around other toy vacuum cleaners, they don't make this awful noise. I just need the wheels to stop and it would be fine. Just. Make. It. Stop.  This is the first time I'm hoping my older boys either manage to break it or this thing might suffer an untimely death.	-1
Looks cute. Vacuum makes some weird noise resembling nothing of a vacuum. My daughter actually prefers the old style push and ball pop up vacuum. This one just sits in the corner.	-1
Too cheap.	-1
Hard to store upright, falls backwards. Not realistic as button is on base, not on handle. Too noisy and clicks when it rolls.	-1
Sadly I am changing my 5 star to a 1 star.  The item no longer works.  At first we figured he burned through the batteries but quickly figured out that wasn't the problem.  If we pushed on the battery cover it would help but even now that doesn't and the unit is worthless a few months after purchase.  I know he played with it quite a bit but it seemed to be an issue with the battery connection as opposed to him breaking it from using it too often. **********************************************************************************************************  This was like the 2nd or 3rd toy my 20 month old opened at Christmas and as far as he was concerned Christmas was over.  He wanted it out of the wrapping right away and then played with it  for almost 2 hours straight!  I couldn't believe how much he loved this and still plays with it every chance he gets. I do believe it is his favorite toy!  And now that he has it he doesn't bug me to vacuum all day long since he's got his own to use :)  This vacuum does have a more realistic sound to it than his old one and it's more realistic looking too.	-1
Came banged up. Not happy.	-1
terrible i will be returning	-1
My 2 year old son tripped and stepped on the handle and it snapped in half, thankfully he was wearing shoes	-1
Doesn't work more than 2 times. My son still plays with it though.	-1
The handle broke off after about a month. Cheap enough to get a replacement for my son if he misses it.	-1
Poor material break easy I bought another vucum ,I don't recommend	-1
Cheap and stopped making sounds after 2 weeks.	-1
its ok.	-1
I bought this TWICE for my 18 month old son. Both times the handle broke off at the same spot. The second time he only played with it for 10 minutes before it broke. Save your money- this is junk.	-1
Very disappoints product.  Plastic piece of garbage	-1
Piece of junk!! Disappointed with it. Very cheaply made. It arrived with the handle completely broken off. Grandson so upset. Went to ToysR us and bought something much better and he plays with it all the time.	-1
My baby loves it, but less than an hour after he received it, he tripped and the handle snapped right off. I hot glued it, which didn't last, so I screwed the thing on with a few short screws I had around the house. My little guy was in full on meltdown mode while I fixed it.	-1
I bought this for my 19 month old son about a month ago. He is obsessed with vacuuming. Firstly, it seems like all kid vacuums have these obnoxious noises when rolled. Why? I will never know. At first he loved this thing, it rolls and he can emulate me while I am vacuuming. He was in heaven. Fast forward to now.. the handle has snapped off. He is not a rough child, he is very good with his stuff. So, now I have a distraught little buddy. I guess I will replace it with something else, but this time I will research brands. I grabbed this one off the shelf at a brick and mortar store without much thought. I regret it now as it's flimsy plastic, not well made at all. I can't believe it gets 4 stars on here.	-1
This wouldn't work when we got it but I didn't want to deal with the hassle of sending it back. My 2 year old still played with it but it didn't last long.	-1
The batteries often move around when my son plays with the toy, despite the battery cover still being closed.  The wheel has already bent.  I did not realize that this model doesn't have active bristles like other versions.	-1
Very flimsy. My year and a half old broke the handle after about a month. Not impressed. Pretty disappointed bc it is super cute. Wouldn't buy again.	-1
That handle broke in a couple of days! My husband had to drill a screw in it just so it would stay on.	-1
My son loved it but I guess after 5 months it breaks. Amazon did an amazing job replacing it. Now the new one is broken as well, after 6 months. It's made of plastic so it breaks easily I guess. If we can't return we'll buy a different kind.	-1
Very disappointed it's nothing like the one I already have.  I should have shopped around more. My other dirt devil is a lot heavier made and has a hose on it and the on and off switch is better.	-1
My son loves to vacuum so I purchased this toy and this toy is noisy as ever and the wheels keep falling off.	-1
Cheaply made and water was in the bottom part and battery compartment.  I returned it and bought a Dyson.	-1
Arrived broken. Returned, then arrived broken again. Save your money and buy the Dyson for kids.	-1
Kid's love them....parents want to throw them outside!  NO OFF button!  Clicking on both wheels at the same time.....  too hard on NERVES.	-1
Not worth $22! I bought this for my son at a second hand store for $3! It was well worth $3 he had his fun with it for a while but it broke not too long after he got it. I would have been very disappointed if I paid $22 for it. Pay a little  more and get a better quality one. Or pick one up like this at a consignment shop.	-1
Vacuum very cheaply made.  NOT WORTH A DOLLAR at a garage sale.  Do not waste your money on this one.	-1
Toys r us sells this exact same toy for $19.99 so amazon is a total rip off selling it for $34.99!! In addition the version we received clearly showed signs of wear, it looks used. Amazon does this over and over, repacking and selling used products as new.  Aside from the price, the actual product is great for young toddlers. it does roll on all floor surfaces, rubber tiles, carpet, or even hardwood.  Its a great toy just don't buy it from amazon	-1
My son is so obsessed  with or vacuum, so I got this hoping he would be  able to hold it and push it around, since ours is to heavy. the noises are silly and it's  cheap and not realistic, bummed I bought it and paid$12 shipping!	-1
I bought this item because it had a brand name on it and it looked more like a real vacuum than other items. But just because it says Dirt Devil doesn't mean it has 1/2 the quality of a real Dirt Devil. This broke after 2 months of basic toddler play. The part that says "dirt devil" popped off, exposing things toddlers should not touch. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone.  Instead I would recommend spending a little more money for a better product.	-1
This board came with it bent it took me like two months of setting things on it to to fix it. Overall though it does what its advertised to do. It will have you talking to spirits in no time. Unfortunately the spirits get upset that the board is all warped.	-1
Never took it out of the box.	-1
This is NOT a toy,and it's very real! The "ghosts" you think you're talking to,are nothing but demons from the pits of Hell who are trying to mislead you. Parents. PLEASE educate your children with the truth about these things. Read Deuteronomy 18:10-13 in The Bible. I'm speaking the truth as a Christian. That is why I probally will catch alot of heat for writing this review. If I had been a Muslim,I would be overlooked. That's lovely religious "tolerance" for ya.	-1
I have always been a Christian but there was a period of time as a teenager where I strayed from God. During the time I decided to try one of these "things." MY sister, I and our next door neighbor all tried it more than one time. It does work! We all moved our hands and it still moved! You can feel a force while it is moving. We let bad spirits into my mother's house and I feel so bad about it. I think the last time we played it was when we asked its name and it told us Niveah and then it said I miss you mommy. My sister had a miscarriage not to long before that and that is what she said she wanted to name her baby. We freaked out and quit playing. But I remember my sister was told she would die at 18 in a bathtub; it never happened. And one time we talked to one which kept making us laugh over and over with jokes. Saying that one of was going to be a stripper, one a drug dealer and I forgot what it said for me. Anyway, it is real but it is evil. As many times as I played with I am glad nothing serious happen- only it may have been related to me cutting myself and other issues I began to have as a teen.	-1
Don't waste your money on these. I bought this set to replace a Jenga set I had. These pieces are not sanded smooth or finished with any kind of coating so they are very rough. When you pull them out, the roughness catches on the other pieces and knocks the tower down with the first or second pull. They also aren't cut appropriately so they don't line up straight. I bought these through Amazon and will be returning them.	-1
Anyone who gives this more than 1 star is either 1) a bot or 2) appreciates the joke value of this gift. Many laughs were had after we opened this piece of junk, but unfortunately it doesn't actually work as a Jenga game.	-1
Wish I could give it zero stars.  I bought it while Christmas shopping and didn't pay attention to the picture on the front good enough because I did not realize until I took it out of the box that the pieces do not line up square. This is so ridiculously hard to set up. So after a few attempts we tried to play it. It does not work the same as Jenga. Guess I should have looked closer when i bought it. Threw it out and went and bought the original Jenga...so much better. Maybe this is fine for some but it was way too much work. Also, the pieces are real light as well. I wonder if that has anything to do with the play as well, that I am not 100% sure.  Sometimes it does not pay to by cheaper brands that try to be like the name brands. This is one of those time.	-1
What a disappointment!  We were so grateful to receive this at a baby shower- it was something we really wanted.  However, it did not live up to expectations.  The sound quality was awful- very, very quiet even on the highest volume setting and, even worse, extreme static.  I exchanged it for another one thinking that maybe the first was defective but had the same problems.  For such an expensive item the quality is very poor.  We ended up ordering the Fisher Price Tape Player online and it is really wonderful.  We love it- buy it instead, better quality and cheaper!	-1
This item is not top quality.  I don't have too many of this company's other products, so if this is an example of their quality than I don't think I will.  First off the cover does not open without popping off the hinge and needing to be reattached, the batteries only lasted through two cd's, the volume doesn't get very high, and it doesn't even fit on the side of our crib.  Being in the baby business they should know that not all crib's are made the same.  You are much better off just getting a simple boom box that play's cd's.	-1
I thought this would be a great idea. So when we found out we were having twins i ran out and bought 2 of them. We started to put the nurserys together and when it came time to put these on they wouldnt fit. I didn't want to stratch the crib rails up so we took them back. When we did try to play a cd in them it skipped. We ended up just buying small cd/radio players for each of their room because this is something they can both use for a long time.	-1
Yup, FOUR times!  Thank goodness Babies R Us has a great return policy!  I recommend saving the box if you do indeed decide to buy this piece of junk. There was nothing good about it in our opinion.  It's a cool concept, but cheaply made.  It's flimsy, it skips 9 out of 10 times, it eats batteries up within a few hours.  It also has a lowsy volume control/speaker system.  Yes, I know it's a babies CD player, but for $50 (which is ridiculous), shouldn't it have some stereo sound to it? SO, thumbs down for this product.  And if you must buy it or get it as a gift, save that box so you can keep returning it to Babies R Us!	-1
I hate when kids toys don't turn. The point of the toy is to ride it and crash into everything in your path and then not be able to turn around? Sounds miserable! And yes, my son hates it.	-1
Do you enjoy assembling EVERY piece of things?  Then this is for you. Literally every single piece needs to be assembled. The box says "made in the USA" but they just mean the parts are made in the USA. The toy isn't made at all. I thought we'd have to connect the wheels or maybe the handlebar. No, you have to make the toy. It should cost half of what you pay given this. If it was t already half assembled, I'd send it back. As it is I need to finish doing what the manufacturer should have done so I can give my child her gift. Don't buy this. These are many that are already assembled.	-1
I'm pissed. I have it half way put together and some of the pieces don't fit right- enough to where I can't finish putting it together. I would rather request new parts than send it back- I like the toy for my one year old.	-1
I purchased this and four other little tike toys for Christmas. They are for my 19 month old grandson. His father is 24 and these are the same toys we purchased for him at the same age. The little racer , very disappointed in the quality. It once had a round steering  wheel and seemed better constructed. Hopefully he will have fun with it.	-1
DON'T BUY THIS! It's horribly flimsy. It broke when we - very carefully - put it together. I then called Little Tikes to complain and was put on hold for twenty minutes until I gave up. Tried again later and this time after 10 minutes of hold music enter in my phone number for a call back. I then received a call back but was put on hold again for 10+ minutes!!! I finally spoke to an agent named Alison who was rude and threatened to hang up on me when I tried to explain my problem.  Just an awful company with ZERO customer service. Will never do business with them again.	-1
This arrived missing three parts, with a hole in the body of the toy. It looks like the holes for the wheels, but is no where near where a hole should be.  It is very difficult to assemble and the small caps for the wheels and handle bars could fall of very easily.  i think this is a safety hazard and this product should be recalled.  Even if my son loves this (I haven't let him play with it because I don't have the parts to put it together properly),  I couldn't give it a positive review.  I can't believe the sloppiness of little tikes.  They obviously have no quality control at their factory.  So as an update,  it took two weeks, but i finally got a package from little tikes with the missing parts, but they sent the handle parts for the doll walker rather then the racer, so they didn't match (they are different colors).  I email the company, and they told me they were sending me the correct parts.  Another two weeks, I got the package, but they had again sent me the wrong color.  This company is incompetent.	-1
I registered for these "bugs" online, so I didn't actually see them until I opened them at my shower.  They are scary looking!  Naturally, they went back to the store!	-1
the title says it all. My 2.5 yr old son played with it once in a while, was never that interested from the gecko. I think I played with it more than him. Finally gave it away since it was just taking up space.	-1
I bought this on the spur of the moment which was a mistake.  This toy is frustrating, it is easy for a child to put the balls in but hard to get them out.  My daughter never crawled after it and more than once both my children have loaded it with other toys which were then incredibly difficult to remove.  This toy looks appealing because of the bright colors and the music and lights (the volume control is good) but overall is a waste of money.	-1
This was a gift for my son's 3rd birthday...it was great for about a day. When he tried using any of his hundred matchbox cars, we found that most of them are too big to race down the track. So if you only use the two cars that came with it, it's great. Also, the race sounds are very annoying (loud) and it's touchy- if you just pick it up to move it, it makes noise- even if you don't tip the top up. This went to Goodwill less than a month after he got it.	-1
This was a must have on the wish list for xmas last year. After we got it and the kids played with it a couple times, it was just kinda boring. You just launch the cars and they roll down the ramp. Not sure why we or the kids thought it would be more interesting. Just one of those toys that isn't worth the money. Maybe for a very young child's first kind of race track toy.	-1
I am confused about the good reviews. Maybe our track is the only one with issues. The cars that came with it NEVER make it past the second turn. They either just stop or the top of the car gets stuck on the turn above. Anyhow it is a total disappointment. I should have kept the packaging to return it as it is now just taking up space. Don't waste your money.	-1
We bought this for our 2 1/2 year old for Christmas.  He played with it a few times the first couple of weeks but has not touched it since.  It does not seem as sturdy as our other Fisher-Price toys, although it has not broken, probably because it is not getting any use.  He really loves the FisherPrice figure-8, motorized track - although it got so-so reviews, ours has worked perfectly and he uses it all the time.	-1
What a boring toy.  Here you have a sturdy dual twisting set of ramps.  The slightest touch sets off an irritating electronic noise (presumably of race cars whizzing past) that you cannot turn off (Fisher-Price seems to have a thing against on-off switches on its toys).  Placing two plastic race cars at the top of the ramps and starting them sends them spiraling downward at a rapid pace with the said noise reverberating around your eardrums.  If your child is playing with this on a carpet, the cars roll ahead about 4 inches; if he/she is playing on a hard floor, they roll a whopping 8 inches forward.  If you are not careful, the lightweight cars will end up underneath the sofa or TV stand, making them impossible to find again.  Doesn't this sound exciting?  I tried very hard to get my son interested in this playset.  I set up the cars, "revved" the engines, and asked him to race my car.  He ignored me and continued playing with his Mega Blocks.  On the rare times he paid attention to this dud, he would try and race his Matchbox and Hot Wheels cars down the ramps, but they were too large.  Only the two cars that come with this set work.  Most of the time, this toy sits in his playroom unused.  It is marked for the garage sale pile this spring.	-1
I saw a demo of this at a local toy store sometime after my kids pointed this out the TV commercial. It looked even worse than the commercial and there are too many moving parts for this to work reliably. From my vantage point, even the commercial seems to barely show the thing working... If you want good Hot Wheels toys, you should stick with the basic building sets (like the Hot Wheels Starter Kit) as they don't employ all of the special effects gizmos that cause the toys to be too hard to use.	-1
We got this for my almost 4 year old who is truly not overly rough on his toys.  My husband put it together, and both he and my son had difficulty operating the thing (particularly the "elevator" on one side, which was VERY stiff) and the pieces easily come apart.  This is very frustrating for a little kid, as well as the parent who has to constantly put it back together.  Even my son said he didn't like it!  (...)!  Fortunately we still had the box, and I was able to return it to the store.	-1
Ok....This thing has a cool look to it, but that's about all. It's not too sturdy. It's not all that much fun to play with. My two year old son got bored within a half an hour and my three year old nephew continued to play with it, but he constantly knocked off the plastic suports at the top after he sent every car down the ramp and wanted me to fix it. (which I did for about twenty minutes) You're better off buying the hotwheels track set and setting up a ramp from the top of the bureau and have a jump over styrofoam cups.	-1
After lugging around books and cartridges in a Ziploc bag, I thought this bag would be the perfect answer for my daughter's LeapPad.  It is a great concept, but the bag we received is just a bit too small to hold the LeapPad comfortably; the flaps barely close and my 5yo can't get the toy out on her own, the fit is so snug.  It has been very frustrating to her (and all of us) that she can't manage on her own.  An extra inch is all I ask!	-1
Tea sets made since 2007 have holes in the cups and unless you find a way to safely patch them with foods safe materials - they cannot be filled with water, tea, or any other beverage.	-1
This tea set was fun for about one week.  It's been a year and the teapot finally recently fizzled out.  I finally put it outdoors and could still hear it's annoying tunes for weeks.  Skip the sound effects!	-1
Disappointed that wheels did not turn as expected. Stiff and not much fun when won't go along.  Not good!  Sorry and disappointed child.	-1
I really wanted to like this product. I was so excited to get my package, but the first bolt we screwed in to assemble split the wood and a chunk fell off. I think the quality of Radio Flyer products has decreased. Some grippers on the wheels would have been nice as well. Went to toys-r-us to find a replacement and ended up finding the y pewe walker/rider that I'm going to try instead ($25 less on amazon than toys-r-us so I'm waiting for my shipment.	-1
UPDATE:  The sides and rear sidings come off (as designed), but they can cantilever, hinge and collapse and squish anything caught in them (like little fingers).  This is dangerous, and combined with the screws sticking out this product now gets a 1-star.  Radio Flyer: Please redesign with safety in mind, and have your manufacturing subcontractors execute so the end product is in fact safe for the babies who will use it.  We bought this for a 9-month old starting to walk.  This toy was difficult to assemble.  The parts and pieces are not well built and of poor quality.  Screw holes were off, and screw ends stick out presenting a hazard to a small child.  This is not the quality we would like.  We plan on getting silicone and putting it on the screw ends to make it safer.  Updating to 3 stars only because our daughter loves it so much.	-1
We got this push walker in hopes that the weight and bulkiness would give my daughter who is cruising the confidense to start walking with it. Unfortunately the non swivel wheels combined with the weight make it nearly impossible to turn for me, let alone my 11 month old. It is really sturdy and well built but the 'clickers' that are supposed to give it resistance are to soft and they really don't work at all.(i think with all the complaints of the clickers breaking off and becoming a choking hazard they changed the compasition of the plastic to soft plastic so they cant break and in turn fails to its job.) I really do like this as a wagon to have the older, stronger kids play with and put things into but not very good for babies who are just starting to walk.	-1
Not the best choice. I've used three baby walkers with six kids (mine and my sister's). My favorites - the Galt Baby Walker - well balanced, easy for the child to stand up and push - manuvers well. I've also used and love, the new Plan Toy Baby Walker - beautiful piece, all wood - easy to manuver - well balanced and easy for the child to use. We found the Radio Flyer Walker too heavy for a new walking toddler and impossible for the child to turn. Also not thrilled with the quality of the Radio Flyer Baby Walker now that it's made in China - the wood finish is a bit rough on little hands.	-1
This is my 3rd Rody the Pony and this one is dramatically smaller than my other 2. Not sure if it is a defect or a fake Rody but the size is supposed to be standard. Very disappointed.	-1
Too small to get good height.  Very hard to get fully inflated.  Doesn't get used at all.	-1
This was our second purchase of the Hopping Rody. We purchased the first one for our daughter's second birthday. The molding was done incorrectly on the rear right foot which made the Rody unstable and my daughter kept falling off to one side, every time she tried to bounce. Our daughter loved it however ,and so we decided to give it another try after six months. This one had the same problem only this time, it was both the front feet. Our daughter kept falling forward and fell flat on her face and we have a tile floor. If the molding can be done correctly, we would definitely recommend it but, we are more concerned about the safety of our little one. Therefore, we recommend that you actually go to a store that sells Rody and check for yourself whether the molding is done correctly.	-1
Made out of pvc plastic! Very bad! Do not buy this product. I returned it for a full refund when I received it and saw the warnings all over the box. This should be in the description. Please do not let your children play with this harmful toy!	-1
My grand daughter had a hard trying to bounce on this Rody horse. It suggest holding the ears, like handles. You try and bounce and you flip over the back. She would hold around the neck and get a couple of low bounces before the same thing happens. It is very small, even for a 2 year old. I would not recommend, just a waste of money.	-1
Smells like a chemical weakens factory and looks great in the corner since no one cares to play with it. Plus totally freaky looking when you wake up in the middle of the night. But that might be what you're after?	-1
This is an update to our original review (which was 4 star). Rody is so tiny and cannot be inflated past a 27 inch middle or he will get lumpy and ruined!  We bought for a 1 1/2 year old and the size was ok then but it is supposed to be for a 3-6 year old!  NO WAY! She is now 2 1/2 and Rody is way too small for her and has been for awhile. She has only ridden him a few times when new but honestly he's tiny and unless your child is super tiny, it will be too small for any 3 year old....and maybe even 2 year old as it is for ours. My husband tried to remedy by blowing up a little larger but as soon as it is overinflated (past 27 inches in the middle seat area) the horse is lumpy and ruined and will not go back to the original shape so do NOT try more air to make it bigger.  We had to toss ours and replace it so we are on Rody #2.  There is a Rody Max that has a 38 inch middle that is supposed to be for an older child but would probably be the only one that would be big enough for a 3 year old.  We also bought the rocker base but took it off when baby was 2 because she would never ride on it and now it is several inches shorter and no way can she ride on it!  Just a ridiculous waste of money in our opinion.  We love Rody and think this horse will be a hit for a very long time.  One thing that we don't like though is the smell!  We bought weeks prior to Christmas and inflated right away but here it is after Christmas and we can still smell it a room away.  So far the baby will ride for a few seconds and get right off so we're thinking the smell bothers her too.  We have also soap and water washed Rody several times but there's still a pretty strong smell coming from the vinyl.  Hopefully it is not giving off toxins in that smell which is a concern of ours.  Would recommend washing Rody and letting the horse gas out in a garage for a few weeks before bringing in the house.	-1
This is probably the biggest disappointment from Christmas presents this year.  I had such high hopes for this toy and it has let me down.  It's cute, but that's where the positives end.  To start, it's ridiculously hard to inflate fully.  Every time we get it blown up, it looses so much air when we pull out the valve to inflate to insert the plug.  Very frustrating.  It is very unstable to bounce on. I figured there would be some sort of adjustment period where my son would have to figure out how to balance, but my 4 year old daughter was struggling with this and she does great on those bouncing ball things.  The kids always seem to topple over on the horse or fall off the back.  Cute idea...very poorly executed. I am surprised there were so many good reviews because I can't see how kids can bounce on this toy for more than a few seconds before falling off.	-1
A friend of mine has one of these and her kids love it!  So I ordered one and it has a very strong chemical odor that won't go away and it doesn't inflate all the way (the legs, tail and ears don't fill up completely). The company and Amazon have great customer service but the product is flawed.	-1
So sorry I purchased this hopper.  The product is bright and seems durable, but the design is very unstable, causing dangerous tumbling over the top of the horse when hopping. Will not allow our little one to use for anything but sitting due to risk of head, neck or facial injuries.  Would not recommend.	-1
I have an 18 month old, 3 year old and 4 year old.  They love to bounce on this toy.  We received it as a gift without the base.  If it was stationary it would be great.  As it is - no matter where I place the toy they bounce to a wall fall off and hit their head.  They bounce toward a table, fall off and hit their head.  They fall off over the head and land on their head.  This toy spends a lot of time in "time out" for hurting people.  I have finally convinced the kids it will be more fun to take the toy to Kid to Kid and exchange it for a safer toy. I hate taking a Nana gift away, but there is no amount of supervision that makes this toy injury proof.	-1
I ordered a Rody horse for my small children for Christmas 2010. It was really cute and looked like my little ones were going to have a great time with it, but I immediately noticed the plastic smell. I didn't know what kind of plastic it was made out of, but it was hard not to wonder about it after noticing the smell.  I knew, from the toxic awareness we have today, to look for the small "recycle" triangle with the number inside of it and that the numbers you want to stay away from are 3, 6 and 7. Now, because I'm writing this review 4 months after I looked at the number, I cannot remember which number it was, but it WAS one of those three numbers whose plastic does have components that contain "known potential health risks". I'm wanting to say it was the number 7, but I just can't remember. Regardless, it was one of the three you don't want to see.  Some people argue these warnings. Some say the amount in these plastics isn't enough to cause real harm (although they are saying that they ARE in them, which I just have never understood) or that these chemicals aren't released unless heated (in this case I was going to let my kids play with the Rody outside this summer), but I say, why debate this? Why not just avoid altogether what little we can? Even if it's a tiny bit of exposure, none that could cause real "big" harm, why add even that little bit of exposure?  I haven't studied this issue and there are plenty of things that others know more about than I, so when it comes to things lke this, especially around children, I just assume that rhyme that goes for questionably fresh food: "When in doubt, throw it out." (or in this case, "return it"....or "don't buy it")  I also want to add that in my case, even had I not been able to find the little triangle with the number and didn't know it was made of a more unsafe plastic, I would have had to send it back anyway. My youngest often chews on toys and I just couldn't handle the idea of him chewing on plastic that smelled like this toy did, even had I "aired it out" and if the odor had lessened. It was pretty strong and you could just smell the chemicals.	-1
Broken this summer. Read reviews that plastic pieces just snap back together, not so. Made for a very non abusive child. The kind of child who would be gentle and caring with his toys. Plastic parts do not function smoothly and it causes frustration, which leads to breakage.	-1
Not great product at all. You can't even fit all of the items back in the case. Great concept but poor made. Skip it!	-1
The stethoscope only makes a brief, broken noise when the button is pushed. I thought it may just need knew batteries so I spent another $5.95 on 3 of the little circle batteries the stethoscope uses and it still doesn't work. Super disappointed.	-1
Opened the box it was shipped in, pulled it out, took the plastic off, gave it to my 3 yr old son and he opened it and the handles broke off.  If you look close at the picture...you'll see that the handles only open part way so a child...any child doesn't have the delicate touch to only pull open so far.  Also, the stethoscope was REALLY hard to hear.	-1
The box for these toys doesn't close well, the toys don't fit back inside the box and the closure on the top of the box broke after about two hours of normal play. We returned this and bought the classic Fisher Price version.	-1
Good concept, but so poorly done I wish I had bought another one: the blood pressure cuff pieces will not stay together for more than a couple minutes. The pieces will not fit back in the box after the first time you take them out - no joke, you'll spend five minutes trying different ways to put them in before realizing if it takes that long for you, your kid certainly will not succeed. The lid of the box comes apart easily and won't stay put back together. The stethoscope doesn't really reach the ears.  If this toy was durable and the box wasn't a throwaway, it would be a good one!	-1
My daughter was thrilled to receive this gift. She immediately went upstairs to fix her sick stuffed animals and her brothers.  However,within 10 minutes of playing with this doctors kit the case top fell apart. The stethoscope does not fit my petite daughters ears and the heart monitor did not work. The head mirror does not fit on her head or even around her one year old baby brothers head. The blood pressure monitor does not stay together.  We will be returning.	-1
We purchased this for my daughter for Christmas 2006. The kit really is cute and she plays with it all the time. BUT... The doctor's bag that it comes with broke, one of the two plastic handles cracked off (so I had to reattach it with band aides, since it had a boo-boo). There also isn't enough room to fit all the pieces in at the same time. The blood pressure cuff had never stayed together, it was even apart when we opened the box on Christmas morning. The stethoscope doesn't fit, the ear piece part doesn't fit under her chin, so she has to wear it over her face. The stethoscope also makes sounds (heart beat and coughing) but the batteries only last about 2-3 days and I need to buy new ones.	-1
This toy didn't keep the attention of either of my kids.  The letters on the ball are way too small (and hard) for little fingers to press correctly in order to hear the letter sounds/songs.  It also calls you back to play by chiming out a little ditty.  This is enough to drive you crazy.  When the child is done playing (which is rather quickly) it will do this little song, over and over.  Also it is way too heavy to be off the sttionary platform.  A kid can roll it, but watch out!  Don't use too much power (this is reasonable with an adult or a baby, not so much with a two year old)	-1
The Discovery Ball toy is the perfect example of why reviews can be misleading to shoppers.  Parents read the reviews, the particulars, and they think, "WOW, this toy is developmental, it will teach my kid the alphabet, and letter sounds.  My kid'll be a genius by 2!"  To be honest, had I reviewed this toy soon after my son received it, I would have given it 5-stars and gushed about its developmental qualities.  However, time has proven reliable, and I have deduced after 2-years and 2-months that it is, and was insignificant to my son's development.  By that, I mean the toy was of no consequence to us. The concept is first-rate, however the delivery is lacking.  I mean, what kid wants to roll a ball when they can throw it?  The Discovery Ball is designed for infants and toddlers, but it's probably more appropriate for preschoolers.  Firstly, the buttons are too difficult for an infant to press; also, they are too close together.  Secondly, it's too sensitive.  For example, let's say the toy is in "music" mode and its playing Old MacDonald, if the ball is touched midstream the music will stop, and revert into 1 of the 2 very annoying intervening songs.  It's like punishment, rather than play.  Can I say without it sounding too harsh, "WHAT'S THE POINT?"  LeapFrog should have decided long ago whether they were designing an educational tool for preschoolers, or a plaything for infants. William received the Discovery Ball for his 1st Christmas.  He was 8-months old at the time, so I took the ball off the stand so he could bat it around on the floor.  He'd roll it, the lights would flash, the music would play, and he'd giggle.  After a few rolls, he lost interest.  The toy has a musical prompt, which occasionally got a look, but most often, he was onto something better.  Soon after his 1st birthday, he discovered the ON/OFF switch.  He'd sit on the floor and repeatedly turn the thing "ON" and then "OFF".  It would play the ABC Song for 3-seconds, he'd slide the lever to the "OFF" position, and then back to "ON" again.  It was enough to drive me nuts!  He didn't care about the phonics, or even the music, all he cared about was that darn ON/OFF switch.  The sound quality is good, but the woman's voice grated on my nerves after hearing 3-seconds of the ABC Song 1000-times in an afternoon.  Fortunately, there is a volume control, although my son usually wants to HEAR his toys.  As if the lower level isn't loud enough.  UGH!  Oh, and this toy is one of those irritating playthings that goes off in the toy box, if you fail to turn it "OFF". After his 2nd birthday, William gained enough strength and proficiency to throw the ball.  I suppose I should have attached it to its base right there and then, but dummy me thought he'd grow out of that phase. Later, I realized the throwing phase was here to stay, so I put the Discovery Ball back on its base.  My attempts were futile, as my crafty little one figured out how to remove it a week later.  The toy is sturdy, especially considering how many times it has been dropped, and thrown.  We've only replaced the batteries twice, which is an event all its own.  Let me just say, its not overly difficult, but more complicated than most. The Discovery Ball can be tricky to wash.  LeapFrog recommends you clean the ball with a damp cloth, but that doesn't always produce the best results.  You see, the letters and musical notes that cover the surface of the ball are raised, so grime can become lodged in, and between the grooves.  I've resorted to spraying Lysol on a rag and wiping it down.  It doesn't completely remove the dirt, but it disinfects it, which makes me feel better. In conclusion, the toys more annoying than enjoyable, so it collects dust, until my son finds it, and then it's transformed into a heavy, throwing ball that hurts when hit.  My advice ~ avoid it. Mary :)	-1
I bought this toy for my 8-month-old daughter. Right away we discovered the most rediculous feature imaginable in a toy: namely, that in "music" mode, when the child pushes one of the letters that plays a new song, the child then naturally wants to spin the ball-- but doing so makes the song stop! The toy then reverts to one of 2 intensely boring melodies. For a child as young as mine who can spin the ball well but has difficulty pressing the letters, the toy only plays a couple of dull songs-- not much incentive to play with the toy. For a somewhat older child who CAN press the letters, there is a different tune for each letter-- but the tune stops as soon as you spin the ball! So, the child is punished for spinning the ball! I HATE this toy. In order for my daughter to hear a song, I have to prevent her from spinning the ball, and hold it still. More like punishment than fun. She has entirely stopped wanting to play with this toy.	-1
The overall product and idea are great, but the most educational part of the toy needs work.  When baby moves the ball, it starts the alphabet and goes to a certain point.  Unless it is moved again in a very short period of time, it will start at the beginning again, hence, baby/toddler and parents get tired of "ABCD" and "ABCD" and "ABCD."  My son would never know the latter part of the alphabet if we relied soley on this to teach him.  Also, the 26 different songs it claims to play are really just different organizations of the same computer tones, with the exception of a few well knowns like Mary Had a Little Lamb and B-I-N-G-O.  Finally, when pressing the letters to hear the sounds they make, you have to move the ball and so 80% of the time you'll get the start of the alphabet again before you get the sound of the letter you have chosen to hear - it's just confusing and needs a little work!	-1
The pieces are so tiny you can't even realistically use them	-1
These are really small! Do not buy unless you have a tiny horse or a really good sense of humor.	-1
My mother-in-law got this for my daughter when she was either 2 or 3 years old.  Sadly, this was one of the only Leapfrog toy that was not a hit.  She played with it only a little bit.  It did not hold her attention at all.  In order to use it, we have to insert the cartridge that goes with the book into the machine.  That necessitates keeping track of the cartridges and books and then lugging everything and the machine with us.  Tag is much better.  Everything is loaded onto the pen and all we need is the book.  Besides, the stories on Tag are much more interesting and there are more activities.	-1
My daughter likes her My First Leappad, but after several months use, the pen has wires showing! I called Leapfrog and after a series of frustrating phone calls, I find out that they don't make the replacement pen for the My First Leappad anymore! At first the customer service agent told me they have the pen and I paid for it. The package I recieved in the mail had an old leappad system that doesn't work and 2 pens that don't fit my leappad. When I called back, it was a 2 hour ordeal. Finally, I spoke with a supervisor who told me that despite the fact that it was their mistake, I had to pay to ship everything back to them, then they would refund my money! Not only am I upset by this treatment, but I can't believe they don't make the pens anymore. I have invested in a lot of books for this leappad and now it is useless. What a waste of money! I cannot in good conscience buy from LeapFrog again!	-1
I am overall a HUGE leapfrog fan!  I love the educational value of their toys and systems.  We received ours a few years ago and it has never been a big hit beyond the first week.  The catridges often gave errors, the books never seemed to stay in well. and the kids often ended up frustrated within a few minutes.  and my kids outgrew it very fast, it has a short lige span in childrens ages In my opinion.  We recently recieved Fisher prices power touch and it is more age versitile and the kids are not frustrated with it at all :).	-1
This LeapPad system is very frustrating.  My daughter got this for Christmas and played with it once or twice, and then got disgusted with it, and so did I.  The biggest problem I had is that half the pages of the book that came with it don't work correctly.  I touch the green go circle and it either starts telling the story on another page, or just makes a funny sound and does nothing. Or, even if it does read the info off the correct page, sometimes if I touch one thing, it will say it's another, like on the page with the parts of the body, I would touch the mouth and it would keep saying nose!  I know I'm doing everything correctly because my son has the big LeapPad, which is the same principal.  I should have just let my daughter play with his LeapPad and saved some money.	-1
My two year old son was very excited when I bought him the desk, but he quickly lost interest. He had to use the awkward pen to touch the green go circle on each page and sometimes the pen didn't work correctly. We tried replacing the batteries, but to no avail. We bought the Fisher-Price PowerTouch. It is much better. Not only will it last longer because of the expanded age range, but it came with 2 books, instead of 1. It is much easier to hold and operate. I highly recommend you spring for the PowerTouch. The extra $10 more than pays for the 2nd book alone.	-1
I debated on whether to get my 3 year old the My First or the original Leap Pad.  I went with the My First, but when I received it, I realized that my daughter was way too advanced for most of the material.  I really think this is more meant for age 2-3.  It is things like, counting from 1-10, learning body parts, colors and shapes.  These are things my daughter knew by the age of 3.  There are some good things for her age, but I learned that the original leap start has the red books called pre-math, pre-reading and etc. These books are the same level as the My First, so there really is no need to even buy the My First in my opinion.  I gave the My First to my 20 month old to play with and bought my three year old the original as I should have done in the first place.	-1
We received this drum as a gift, and we feel that it has two big flaws, the first one being the most serious.  #1 The drum shuts off when it is not hit for 30 seconds. The drum should not shut off unless we turn it off!  Our son is frequently frustrated by this toy. He'll get distracted by another toy for a minute, and then return to the drum - and then it doesn't respond when he hits it. We also have a Fisher Price Bouncin' Bongo, which he likes much better. It is always on, and so anytime he likes, he can walk over and hit it and it responds.  #2 The drum talks too much. We really wish there was a setting where it just played sounds, and didn't talk to us. I have no problem with the learning settings, where the drum recites numbers and letters. But even on the music and drum settings, it is constantly talking, saying things like, "Play the drum! It's fun!" and "Play the drum, everyone, play the drum!" We really don't like the constant chatter.  We wish we could combine the educational features of this toy with the more practical design of the Bouncin' Bongo.	-1
This seemed like a good idea, but it is just an annoying toy that does little for our son.  The songs are annoying, it continues to play once it is put down and I fail to see this as a good teaching tool.  He enjoys banging on pots and pans much more - so we do that and sing the ABC's ourselves.	-1
I love leapfrog toys and we have purchased several different things for our son and for others as gifts.  Since our 10 month old loves to bang everything he can get his hands on, we thought he would love this.  But, we've had it for a few months and so far he has shown little interest in it.  Also, even the "quiet" music setting is pretty loud.	-1
We bought this last Christmas for our 6 month old.  She played with it that day and hasn't looked at it since.  Our 4 year old however loves it.  I consider this to be a waste of money - I'll be lucky if I get $2 for it at a garage sale.  (I did find that our daughter liked the traditional drum better!)	-1
From our point of view, the other reviewer is correct, alot of small children will learn nothing from this drum because to learn something you have to pause long enough for the drum to 'say something complete'. Certainly my little boy wouldn't stop whacking it. (I was afraid he would learn to stutter from the frequent repeats-lol).  And I know it's supposed to have won awards, but my two children (girl and then boy) just didn't get it.  My daughter, for example, just didn't like the noise, even at the quieter setting.  And my son... well, when he was old enough to sit up and play with this toy, he wouldn't stop making it repeat the first few syllables, over and over.  And later, when he was older (15 - 24 months) he found it boring, having moved on from any stationary playing position. He was action-guy, and far more into Thomas, mega-legos and watching the Leapfrog videos than he was into sitting with a drum to learn his alphabet.  Two Stars for us.  It just didn't work as an educational toy at our house.  During the timeframe in which it would and could have been educational the children were too young to absorb the information; and by the time they were ready, sitting down was the last thing on their agenda.  **Note:  For alphabet learning, we highly recommend Leapfrogs videos.	-1
My daughter got this toy when she was 14 months old.  I can't figure out why she gets bored with it so easily.  She won't pay attention to this toy for more than one minute.  It's great in concept, but didn't work for us.  My daughter is now 2 years old, and whenever I get this toy out, it still does not capture her attention.	-1
I first saw this toy online and then went to BRU to check it out with my 6 month old daughter. She seemed interested but I was hesitant because the toy seemed annoying. I didn't really want to spend 19.99 on a toy I couldn't stand to let her play with. Well I found it secondhand yesterday for less than $5 so I thought why not.  This toy has got to be the most annoying toy Ive come accross!!!!!  There are two volumes LOUD and EXTREMELY LOUD! Why a toy company would make a toy so loud that a child will be playing with that is a foot away from their ears is beyond me.  This teaches ABC, 123 and a kind of simon says. The music that it plays along with these teaching sessions are short tunes that are looped over and over for our enjoyment.  My daughter is into whacking things right now so that is why I bought this for her. She gets enjoyment from whacking the drum and seeing the lights and hearing the sounds.  I hate this toy, its louder than it needs to be and it doesnt have enough variety in music. Im glad I didn't spend the $20 on it.	-1
I was very excited to receive this toy, my son is crazy about train crossings for his Thomas the train wooden railway. However, the gates don't open or close as advertised. I would return them but I'm just keeping the toy because my son is 3 and was very eager to play with them. He has to control them manually since the magnetic function is not there. He doesn't know they were supposed to function by themselves. I'm disappointed in these gates.	-1
Even filled with water, these don't stay in place.  Net is too long as expected, but almost impossible to adjust without creating a tangled mess.	-1
Did not last through the summer, used it every time we were in the pool and kept falling down when the ball would hit the net.	-1
Poor quality.	-1
I purchased this vollyball set for our pool. I found that it is not very sturdy. When the ball hits the net either one of the blue bases tends to fall in the pool.	-1
FOR SOME REASON, I thought 3 tubes came in the package.  No biggie.  You don't get to choose the design.  This tube is for fun, not for safety.  Keep that in mind.	-1
Product was ok but both tubes didn't inflate completely/correctly. One has a slow leak, but season is almost over and will patch it for next season and ok for kids to use now.	-1
Nice, but I thought I was getting 3 rafts not 1.	-1
my dd got this for xmas.  we both very excired because she loves to dance to the wiggles.  it was very hard to use.  she couldn't dance ON the mat.  everytime she moved, either the song would start all over again, or another song would start.  the spots where they have to step to make a song go are very close together due to the mat being so small.  the colors on the mat are great and bright.  the sound is a tad bit loud, could use a volume switch.  i ended up returning it because it was too frustrating for my dd to the point where she no longer wanted it (she's 20 months).  even the sound was too loud for her.  plus she couldn't stand on the mat to dance without changing the song.  if your child doesn't mind dancing NEXT to it, then it's great, but loud.  i would say that is very durable, but it's not worth keeping just for that.  everything about it was very disappointing.  i will still buy wiggles products, just not this one.	-1
I expected to be able to share this with family while floating down the river every day for a week in yosemite. It had a hole in it, didn't figure out where.  Luckily we have spent a bit more for 2 other floats for me and my husband that were fantastic. We were being asked by everyone where we got them. They were the Intex River Run Sport Lounge. They have drink holders and handles and are a much better value.  Went over rocks, etc and no holes. Brought them home and still in good shape, also good for different sizes of people. I would have rated it higher on fun probably if it worked.	-1
I bought this toy for my son because my friend's son has it (or what I thought was it) and he just loved it.  I am in the airline industry and thought it would be a fun addition to his other Little People sets.  I was unaware that Fisher Price had discontinued the "Little People Discovery Airport" and had replaced it with a much less expensive "Little People Airport" which does not take any batteries, so therefore, makes no noise whatsoever.  Unknowingly, I bought it as it looks EXACTLY like the battery operated version.  I brought it home and my son was so excited upon seeing the box because he had remembered it from my friend's house.  We unpacked it and set it all up.  He played with it for about two minutes, he was bored with it.  It doesn't do anything at all, just sits there and takes up tons of space.  I'm not sure why Fisher Price would take all of the best features of a toy and take them away.  It just doesn't make any sense to me.	-1
It came with the rear right tire in bad condition. The detail on this model SUCKS, it has the corner light painted and the engine looks like a cheap Jada model. The interior is full plastic with no detail.  If you are a model enthusiast don't buy it, look for other versions, the car is heavy but the detail is really bad!	-1
The front wheel tire is off	-1
The title says LARGE but it is VERY TINY.We were shocked when we pulled it out of the mailbox. Maybe your shouldn't put large in the description if it isn't. It broke the first day as well. I don't reccomend it.	-1
My son has had this mower for 2 years.  The wheels fall off all the time, and he CANNOT push it in the grass.  It's fine for playing indoors when he was younger, but now that he wants to "help Daddy" outside with the lawn, its a pain!  Please consider this when looking to purchase this item.	-1
This toy arrived broken.  Unfortunately I did not examine it carefully, so that was my own fault, but when I did and my ability to return it was 2 days beyond the limit, I realized that this is a toy that could never hold up to any sort of toddler use.  It is made of the flimsiest plastic on earth!  The handle has a little mechanism that is supposed to snap it in place during operation.  On mine it was ruined just from being folded (as it's supposed to) during shipping, making the toy impossible to use.  Even if it had not been broken, I would have been ashamed to give such utter junk to my child!  It's dime-store value.  Really, it's rare that I come across something this shabbily made!	-1
My 13 mo grandson liked this little mower, but the handle broke after very little use.  From the reviews I've read, none of these hold up to even ordinary use.	-1
Wish I would have gone with a trusted brand.  I went with this because it sounded like it was a taller mower than the other ones. NOT SO. It's short - works for my 22-month old. My 4-year-old has to hunch over a bit.	-1
Cheap, lightweight plastic that begged to be broken.  No way my toddler could ever have pushed it without the handle snapping off or the wheels breaking.  No real axles, just little nubs holding the wheels in place (which would not turn).  Very thin plastic overall.	-1
baby didn't like it much	-1
I just bought this mobile tonight because I was in the store shopping and seen it for 6 dollars.(on clearance) Well, I am so glad I didn't pay full price because it's not worth ... dollars at all. First of all the music is way too loud, I don't know what people r saying that theirs is too low but this one is so loud. Second of all the remote control is useless, u might as well just walk over to the crib to use it. So I am gonna be returning it even though I got it so cheap. I would not recommend this mobile at all. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!	-1
My grandson liked this toy but it's construction was not worth the price. I liked that the handle folded down to store flat, but when you pull up the handle, it wasn't completely stationary making it wobbly and hard for him to push smoothly. It kept catching on little ruts, causing the front wheels to stop and the back wheels to go up in the air.	-1
Not so good as was described.	-1
This lawn mower is hard for a 1.5 year old to push in grass, even mowed grass!  It is also cheaply made.  I feel as though if try and show her how to push it on the grass I will break it.  Nothing else seemed to get good reviews either, so I guess we are stuck with this toy.  Luckily it was only 11.79!	-1
My granddaughers love Calico Critters and own numerous pieces.  But this isn't one of the better ones.  The cradle broke immediately.  Some of the other pieces are quite small, too small really.  Other sets are more fun.  This one got set to the side pretty quickly.	-1
Poorly made. The wood on the top os splintering! My husband will have to sand it before mt son can play with it again!	-1
Ours looks nothing like the picture don't waste your money.	-1
fun product. My grandkids love it.  a two because part of the top sign end piece was missing and one tail light had a chip. that took away from the new look.	-1
Pretty cheapie	-1
Ordered these for my son and the ones a relieved looked absolutely nothing like the picture. Completely different Not happy at all	-1
This is not a real abacus.	-1
The buttons were broken and the spotlight is stuck on. Husband has had to do some re-wiring to fix it. Would not buy again.	-1
i bought this for my son for Christmas and I pray he isn't as disappointed as I was. I would not recommend.	-1
This is essentially just a flashlight attached to a pair of binoculars. My 4 year old didn't seem to mind, hence 2 stars instead of 1, but $20 is overpriced for what you actually get.	-1
Greetings, no purchase excellent product with any problems, not good, I thought it would be more comfortable, and would illuminate more, hardly see night, my son this unhappy, but the selected product, 100% responsible, would recommend.	-1
These do NOT show up anything in night vision in fact when you turn off the lights it doesn't show up anything its pitch black no matter if the top light is on or off they just don't work.	-1
Not worth the box it is shipped in. I would not recommend this product. It is cheap and mis-leading. It doesn't work at all even in slight darkness. It is a disapointment.	-1
I realize these would not be very realistic, but they did not last through Christmas day.  The lens broke and then were thrown away A waste of money	-1
totally terrific item !!!!! my nephew just loved it. great construction, durable for little tykes. will turn back to this company again.	-1
This toy did not come with batteries. I got this for Christmas and my son upon opening it had to put it aside because it didn't have batteries in it. It is n0t a night scope.  Without the red light, it is just like looking through a 99cent binocular toy. It would have been cheaper to go to the 99 cent store, get a binocular toy and a flashlight coz thats what it is.	-1
I generally do a lot of research into the product reviews before confirming to purchase them. I chose these for the novelty concept and was very disappointed. They fell apart the time my son used them and seemed to be merely a cheap set of binoculars with a small green light on it. You get what you pay for in this case. Consider spending the extra money if you are looking for quality.	-1
For a child's abacus, this brightly colored wooden toy is nicely made.  However, consider the "very similar" :D&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Melissa-Doug-Classic-Wooden-Abacus/dp/B00005BVRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Melissa & Doug Classic Wooden Abacus</a>; compare the difference in value for yourself.	-1

I was going to write a review chastising myself for having been stupid enough to have overpaid for their Sunshine Symphony.  Since then, I see Amazon has dropped the list price to $35, and has discounted it further, down to a sale price of $9.98.  I have noticed other Neurosmith products with similarly high product mark-ups, and wish I could be a shareholder of a company that is so adept at exploiting the pocketbooks of new parents.  While trying to research some of their other overpriced toys, and those toys' declining price histories, I found the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission has recalled a Neurosmith toy (the Pet Me Platypus), and that the manufacturer is no longer in business.  So, Amazon is giving you a 71% discount (complete with free shipping!) on a toy that is leftover from a manufacturer who no longer exists.  Buyer beware.	-1
My 12 month old daughter received this for her birthday.  I was initally thrilled with the welcomed new classical tunes (all of which are very pleasant to listen to).  The toy has two modes, one that plays the whole song(s) and one that plays part of it and stops until the baby moves the toy again to get it going.  THis mode also will make sounds if the toy is not jiggled within a minute or so.  Sadly, I was disapointed in this toy because it doesn't automatically shut off which I thought was very silly.  Thus the toy will remind you that it's still on FOREVER!!  So it doesn't make a nice crib toy becasue she can't turn it on or off by herself (you have to flip a hidden switch to get it on and off)and will play all night if you let it. Finally, my daughter wasn't particularly interested in the toy anyway.  Thus I had to give low stars on fun & education since she wasn't drawn to it to play or learn, though the music IS very nice. As for durability, the thing is like new since she doesn't touch it.  Didn't do it for us.	-1
It was a mistake buying the Nerf Rapid Fire 20. The air tank is not big enough to shoot 20 darts. Also, it is hard to pump it. I DID NOT BREAK THE AIR TANK. It kind of works...  I should've just stick to my magstrike WHICH IS A LOT BETTER because it is easy to pump and it can shoot all 10 darts without running out of air. http://www.amazon.com/Nerf-N%252dStrike-Magstrike-AS%252d10/dp/B001Q4BWPQ/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1289942156&sr=8-2	-1
not as fun as we remembered:(	-1
Big piece of junk! very cheaply made...don't waste your money. It may look the same as the ones from the 70's but it is not! made of all thin plastic, even the ring post won't stay in place, head does not pop up when hit....junk..junk...junk! I wish I could give no stars, but then I would not be able to write this review. I bought two for Christmas gifts. I am so embarrassed!	-1
This toy do not deserve to be in any toy store is very crappy, everybody should get together and call the company who makes it so they can take it out of the market, don't even think to try it like I did.	-1
My son was in love with this toy, but only the display card worked.  Once the toy was out of the box we found out all of the other cards didn't function.  I called Fisher Price and after following the suggestions of the Customer Service Rep, it still didn't work. We are now returning the toy to the store.	-1
If I could give this ZERO stars, I would.  Being fans of the original Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots when we were kids, my husband and I were excited to give this to our 6 year old twins.  What a HUGE disappointment.  The plastic is cheap and flimsy, the robots are constantly popping off (and next to impossible to reattach), the heads randomly pop up without ever being hit, and .... the ropes.  They are the bane of my existence.  I don't know who designed them, but all four pegs do NOT fit into the holes enough to stretch out the ropes evenly around the ring.  Push one in and another pops out.  Someone said to stretch out the ropes, but it doesn't seem to help much.  This had the potential to be a very cool toy, but ends up being nothing more than a cheap wannabe retro imposter.	-1
Flarp is fun and good for laughs but don't get on clothing or you will be sorry. Also too many sellers out there selling it without including original packaging or colors shown in images.	-1
Like many other reviewers, I have to say that I am disappointed in the quality of this toy.  It's not anything like the original.  I'm actually the child of a Baby Boomer and remember playing my dad's Rock 'Em Sock 'Em game as a kid.  I was thrilled to find this so my son could play it (he had seen it in Toy Story), but it was very disappointing.  It is made of cheep plastic, the poles for the ropes don't stay in place, they are smaller than the originals and it is missing the sound that the original made with a head pops up.  Unlike my dad's, I do not expect this toy to last long enough for my son to pass it down to his son.  I wish I knew what happened to the one in my Grandma's basement!	-1
This stuff is destructive! First, it is funny, sounds just like a fart etc . . but my daughter constantly took it out of the plastic ( the only way for it to work is to be used in the container and with the air bubbles, it sounds like a fart) but first my daughter dropped it on carpet and it stuck and clung to every fabric thread and will not come out.  Permanent flarp stain on my carpet.  Then my daughter thought it would be funny to plop on top of her head and as she said "look daddy" all proud, he screamed for me to run in and see what a mess this horrible slime caused on her hair!  It took 2 hours and a jar of mayo to carefully pull out every little piece of slime chunks that cling to hair or anything it can, it literally had to be removed one strand at a time.  I refuse to buy this ever again.  So not even worth the dollar we paid at the store.  Yeah kids shouldn't put it on their head, but mine did and who knows what else a kid will stick it on.  The car seats, carpet, the wall etc . .it leaves a residue or if it's fabric, forget it - it's ruined.	-1

This toy is definitely not worth the price.  My boys played with this for about a total of 5 minutes.  It's pretty much a piece of plastic junk, not fun at all.	-1
Came in open and broken	-1
So disappointed. Got to the beach and the raft totally would not inflate. Not at all.  We used an electric pump and it lay completely flat.  Obviously can't recommend.	-1
Not as good (quality) as the one I had growing up. It's smaller and not as well made but it dos what it is supposed to do.	-1
The fittings and machining are so poor that it wasn't fun for 5 seconds. My son was so disappointed and that leaves this father feeling angry that any company would dare to market such a poorly manufactured product.	-1
I bought this for my kids for Christmas. They liked it but, they don't play it. The blue robot's head is easily popped up so he always loses. All you have to do is shake it slightly and his head pops up. Not fun for kids. Bummer. They were excited about it at first. Now it's to late to return it. It sits in the closet.	-1
This was a gift for my two boys for Christmas. My kids were excited for this game and so were my husband and I due to us having this old school game when we were younger. As soon as we took it out of the box and got it together, the blue robot's right arm wouldn't work. First time trying it out and it wouldn't move. The kids still tried playing with it (of course it wasn't a fair game anymore), after three rounds, the red robots head wouldn't stay locked down. It just stays up. So.... it was trash from the start. It looks like the old school game that I had when I was little, but I swear it's made with cheap parts. I would not suggest buying this.	-1
Worthless.  Disappointing.  Frustrating.  Falls apart with any use.  Rarely able to make the desired connection.  It's a shameful waste of $13/14.	-1
Not like it used to be. They don't seem to move very well, it's hard to knock the head off. The arms don't really move very well either. Totally disappointing. My son was disappointed, going to return them and use the money to buy something else. What a shame. They used to be fun back in the 80's.	-1
The kids never really enjoyed this toy, and it has already started falling apart.  I wouldn't recommend it, unless you want it for nostalgic sake.	-1
Seriously.  This is definitely the worst toy I have ever bought my kids.  They were sooooo excited when they saw the box (I mean, the box does make it look fun!)...but once we got it put together and started playing, the excitement turned to annoyance.  The robots barely even reach each other and every couple of minutes only the blue robot ever popped his head.  The red one's head never popped unless we physically hit it hard with our own hands.  Our hands hurt after a while.  Just is NOT fun AT ALL.  I packaged it up and returned it right away.  This was a piece of true junk!!!!!!!!!	-1
Isn't it just great on Christmas morning to easily put this together and then it doesn't work.  The controls were opposite of what it was supposed to be and the game is very cheaply made.  Do not order this-more expensive than in Walmart and when you return it, it costs even more money.  Totally disappointed with the purchase and the supplier.  I will never order any items from this company that is part of Amazon.	-1
Easy for a child to master, lots of noise and excitement, but play gets old fast and the game soon gets set aside.	-1
Quality looks good (especially for the price) but I only got one out of the three!!	-1
I was expecting something similar to what I had as a child. I ordered this and when it came I was really disappointed. First off, it is a lot smaller than the real one, a lot more flimsy and doesn't make the signature sound like the old one does when you knock its block off. This may be a cool toy for a little kid that has never had one before, but if you are an adult looking to relive a childhood memory, steer clear, it is not like you remember.	-1
I was excited to buy this game for my 5 yr old grandson Tyler.  We played with it on Christmas Day.  Boy, were we disappointed!  It was the most boring game we have ever played!!  We even though maybe it would be better for 2 yr old grandson Jackson, but we were wrong.  He pushed it away after less than 1 min.  What is the point of this game?  The heads pop off but that is it! What a waste of money.  I should have bought a jack in the box instead.  I wish I would have checked into this game before purchasing it.	-1
I've never played with the original set, so I have no basis for comparison, but the 2 sets I have bought (the first as a gift for someone else) are utter trash. The robots are difficult to manipulate, and even if you have one person hold one robot down and the other punch it repeatedly it still takes an absurdly long amount of time for the head to pop up. No play value at all.	-1
This toy doesn't work like it did when we were kids.  In fact, one of our robots doesn't work at all.  The head only pops on one robot and the robots detach from their base almost immediately after you begin play.  Don't buy it.	-1
Product came with only one tool!  Now I'm having problems returning it.  Toysmith is making this purchase very difficult.	-1
Don't bother wasting your money on this.  Someone gave my 4yr old son this game for Xmas.  The title is classic and nostalgic but the modern version is a cheap showing.  Small characters, flimsy controls, difficult to actually "box" each other, and most importantly it is not at all fun to play.  Not very durable either...characters keep popping off the board.  My son played with this game for 10 minutes, declared it was a bad game, and then put it away never to be seen again.  They need to increase the quality and game play of this toy so the don't deceive people based on the nostalgic name.   - JT Clark / San Jose, cA	-1
Like many baby boomers, I had the original toy myself as a kid.  As much as we may like to believe it, the old classic one was not perfect either.  It always seemed like one robots head popped off much easier than the other, or the rubberbands came off underneath.  Time has tended to make us look back on these toys much more fondly than we did when we actually owned them.  That said, these "new-fangled" versions are extremely poor quality.  First of all it just feels flimsy.  It certainly is not as durable and heavy as it used to be.  Second it seems that one robot is always overly sensitive while the other needs to be hit with a sledgehammer to get the head to pop up.  And of course you don't have the trademark, "ZZZZZZZZZZ" sound that the old metal teeth used to make when the head popped up.  Our kids must have thought we were nuts to have enjoyed this so much and we have to try and explain how it "used to be better!"  The designers who made this should be forced to play it non-stop for 8 hours a day.  Shame on Mattel for ruining a classic toy.	-1
Very cute, but they ended up ruined because we left them outside.  They are outside toys afterall...  The wooden handles got moldy from sitting in water.  Tossed them after a few months.	-1
Honestly, I think it's not worth getting. It does not stay put - has no ties or closure on sides - and is pretty widely open on top/neck and sides. My son is 5 now and not considered small. The smock is mostly loose on him.	-1
for babies	-1
These are metal which could harm young ones if they fell or smacked their sibling with it.  The metal does allow them to dig and do actual work but I'm more concerned about safety.	-1
We bought this for our granddaughters 4th birthday. It got great reviews and since she has a 4 month old baby brother, we thought she may like playing with her own 'realistic' baby. Although Chou Chou is very cute, after batteries were installed, she sounded and acted more like a baby from The Exorcist movie! The doll made very strange noises which are not at all realistic baby noises, and the eyes, instead of closing slowly while being rocked to sleep, fluttered wildly the entire time. The breathing sounded like a grown man snoring! This doll is scary! Her mother suggested taking the doll back and exchanging for another as she said there must be something wrong with it. We watched the online video of Baby Annabell and it definitely sounds more realistic, appears worth an extra $5.00, plus her mouth moves while eating.	-1
Not as advertised. No string closure, no pouch. It's okay.	-1
They do not tie at the side like the picture, so they just flop around and are otherwise thin fabric and very small.	-1
This should clearly be stated as "My First Art Smock" which is what it is...it's for babies and toddlers.  I was buying it as a school art smock for a third grader!  It would look like a bib on him!  I will have to find a baby somewhere and donate this....	-1
It's super flimsy about the same durability as a plastic bag  I guess I should  have  examined the photograph because I didn't  notice it's 24 months.  Kinda small for my 7 year old.	-1
Not as effective as I thought it would be. Unfortunately. It's too flimsy.	-1
This is a basic plastic art smock - I guess I figured it would be more heavy duty, but it reminds me of a cheap plastic tablecloth from the dollar store.  It serves its purpose and was inexpensive, I am just disappointed at how flimsy it is.	-1
I'm pretty sure i threw this away like 2 weeks after we opened it. it's not much of a smock. my 3yo couldn't put it in by herself and she is very capable. it's thin and is probably more suited to ages 12-24mo because of it's size.	-1
It's not expensive, but I was still surprised at how cheesy it was. I'd use an old t-shirt, would be just as good!	-1
Poor quality!! Thin and doesn't cover arms. Get the 2 pack at Ikea instead.  Much better quality and price!	-1
There are no ties on the sides to keep this in place. I probably would not recommend to others....it slides around her neck and before I know it  her sides are protected and the open area is in her front defeating the purpose	-1
This apron would be great if it had a tie! By bc it doesn't it's all over the place and get in the way.	-1
This is the most comfy puppet ever! Details are adorable. It goes with the lady bug glove puppet I already have. I will use at church. Seller was great.	-1
No string to tie the sides..and No pocket!  This is not what you see in pic!	-1
I bought this toy hoping it might help my 6-month old fall asleep on his own. I've tried it every night and every nap time for over a month, but it hasn't helped a bit. He does seem mildly interested in playing with it as a toy, but he has never fallen asleep while listening to it. For one thing, the volume is WAY too loud for a soother and there is no volume adjustment. Also, the light bulb is non-replaceable, so eventually you'll lose the lighting feature. Finally, it's not safe to keep anything in your infant's crib due to the risk of SIDS - so what use is the remote control? I do think this is a cute toy- and the music is nice, not annoying like many other infant toys- but it just didn't work for my son. Guess I'm back to singing him to sleep every night myself!	-1
This toy is a blast but, unfortunately like so many things today, the quality is very poor.  We bought this for our 4th of July picnic and it was super fun.  WE all enjoyed it from ages 5 to grandparents.  It soars and flies wonderfully.  However, the string didn't last as long as the picnic and we were left holding a pull-string toy with no more pull-string.  Really, how many brains does it take to realize that if you're manufacturing a toy reliant on a pull-string that the string needs to be strong and durable?  We liked the toy so much we're going to try to fix the string.  But it would have been nice if it was made to work and last in the first place.	-1
Years ago, my now-ten year old had a great helicopter toy from Discovery Toys -- you pulled a string and the propellor blades would go 20 feet or more in the air.  I know have a three year old and the ten year old wanted to create the same experience for her little sister.  This is not the one to do it.  The blades would go about 5 feet tops and it was a little hard to pull.  I will continue to search for the dream flying toy!	-1
Disappointing because there are no ties or pockets, I guess you get what you pay for and I should have looked at the uploaded customer pictures beforehand and not have gone by the description.  It's a basic smock, it won't protect much since you can't tie it in place.	-1
Art smock is of a very cheap flimsy material.  Don't think it'll hold up too well. I bought it to use as a full coverage bib for a messy eater.  Wish the fabric had more of a plastic feel that would clean off well when dirty.  Also wish it had some velcro tabs on the sides to hold it in place.	-1
This is not as described. There are no pockets and no ties. It's just a bib that fits over the child's head.	-1
They seemed like good quality tools for a great price, but mine arrived with one of the tools missing from the box.  I had to return it. There was no way to simply have the missing tool shipped to me.	-1
My 4 year old loved it, but unfortunately the string broke after only a few pulls.  My husband re-strung it and it broke again.  When we told him to pull it lightly the copter wouldn't fly but if he pulled it hard enough to make it fly then it broke after a few times.	-1
The 4 new globes came defective and all needed replacement batteries. One globe worked for almost 30 days... when we went to return it to Amazon we were charged a 20% restocking fee. These globes are very good if they work! Leap Frog has stopped making them and I wonder why?  I would look at the Oregon Scientific model even for a child... This globe is a waist of $ based on quality.	-1
The propeller blade fits very poorly into the spinning base.  Just an awful design.  Also, one of the propeller blades was wildly warped right out of the box (though this is not my primary complaint).  Junk.  Returned to the store.	-1
A little more difficult for a 3 yr old to operate than I had anticipated.  Perhaps should have waited til 4th birthday.	-1
We bought one of these and played with it for 1 day.  I instructed my children to be gentle, and supervised them at all times.  After 1 turn (by me), I realised how fragile this toy is.  Let's just say that I am very fussy about being gentle with toys - and I just can't see how this toy was ever built to be robust, given the build quality.  After 30 minutes of supervised use, the string won't retract - and has frayed (but not yet broken).  I'll be staggered if this toy survives a week of gentle use.  I almost certainly will be returning this one - given that it wasn't cheap, and that it's about to fall apart.  I am certain that a replacement will be just as poor quality.	-1
Broke the first day	-1
I bought this as one of my son's Christmas gifts for use with an easel. It's very short and only covers my 2 year old's chest and half his belly. I wish that it were longer and that it tied on the sides or something. This slides around on him as he moves during craft/art time. I gave up using this smock and have just taken to putting one of my tshirts on him.	-1
