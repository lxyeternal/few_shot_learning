blueish green color.  can be used on beading hoops or as chandelier dangles.  color does not appear dyed like some turquoise you find.	1
Awesome!, Beautiful!!	1
I love it	1
These are really cute. Exactly as described and really beautiful in person. Would buy again.	1
BEAUTIFUL BEADS. Ordered these to make wrap bracelets.  Not disappointed! Have ordered 7 strands.  Each strand has been great quality.	1
Great beads , awesome reusable package (really Nice)	1
They were pretty pieces. But the 4mm is very small	1
very nice, the color is a little lighter than I needed, but will work nicely.	1
Earnuts are earnuts are earnuts are earnut.  Not much to say beyond it.  These look fine and do the job.  I have been using them for a while and they didn't tarnish yet.	1
Nice beads!	1
i live it	1
Ok	1
I do like these beads. They can be used with other beads I just haven't found the right project for them yet. Nice size to work with. Recommend highly!!	1
These beads were just what I was looking for!  They have a full, rich, uniform color which will add greatly to the beauty of the piece I'll use them on.	1
I took these to a professional right after I got them because I was skeptical that I could get Sterling Silver earring backs so cheaply. I was informed by two different people that they were indeed sterling silver. I am very impressed and happy! I would advise being careful when you open your package after you order these though. They come from China and the seller that I ordered from did not bother to put them inside a little baggie inside the padded envelope.	1
excellent earring back whether in silver or gold. Holds earrings in place and good value.  Good replacement for when earring backs get misplaced or lost	1
I just bought these extras because I have a tendency of losing them. If you do too, you need to get a pack.	1
Not as described as these are not sterling silver as described. They are metal colored silver and when attesting that the jewelry I make is SS this is not a good thing to be fooled into believing that it is SS.	-1
What a huge disappointment!! The quality is surprisingly great but the holes are super small. I don't think there ANY earrings that would fit these. I have a small hoop silver earring and it bent while I was trying to fit them in. Oh well, I am stuck with it!!	-1
Product described as "STERLING SILVER". They are NOT sterling silver. Not even stainless steel. They stick to a magnet! Seller needs to change FALSE DESCRIPTION. At best, they are a silver-colored metal of unknown content.  They are cheap earring backs of okay quality. Shipping, delivery, etc., were as described/predicted.	-1
I thought these were a good deal until I unfortunately discovered they are not solid sterling as described. They're fake. I spent quite a bit of time looking thru different sellers to find the best deal. I wasted my time and money on these. Move on and don't waste a single second on these. There's nothing worse than being misled and ripped off. The really sad thing is that this these are a low dollar item. A seller destroyed their reputation with me, and anyone else who reads this, for almost nothing. They sold their reputation for less than $3. Just a sorry thing.	-1
Given as a gift and the person who recieved them said the color was very nice.  I am looking forward to seeing what they make with them  I am considering making a purchase of these to use myself.	1
I could have sworn I already reviewed this item ??? As always I love the stones that come from these sellers ! Always quality, and good energy to them.  I deal with them when ever I can !	1
Very beautiful little spacer chips. Also great for earrings. I used them with onyx and silver spacers to make a bracelet and it was beautiful.	1
Tiny. Some gold appear to be fading fast.	-1
Very nice for the price.  These will be a great addition to a necklace.	1
Very good quality.	1
I will definitely repurchase.  My designs require the best products available and this product meets my demands.  I highly recommend.	1
When I got into beads,  I didn't understand about wire.  Good wire is like great lingerie,  you don't see it but without it the dress doesn't fit right.  The draping of the wire,  how it lets a necklace lie against your skin,  that's what makes your jewelry work or not,  and without it,  the most expensive and beautiful beads will just sit there,  uncomfortably.  I've used several rolls of wire and then a beading buddy put me onto Soft Touch,  and I won't buy anything else.  It just holds the beads beautifully, and once you have confidence in that, you can focus on making your beautiful designs.  It does cost a little more,  but it's well worth it,  it really makes a difference.  .014/Fine is my favorite wire width - thin enough to drape well,  thick enough to crimp easily. .010/very fine drapes even better,  but is so fine,  that it doesn't crimp easily and can break more easily.  If you are using larger/heavier beads, esp in bracelets,  use .019,  which is the thickest wire I use (but I don't generally use many heavy beads,  if you do,  you might have to go up to .024) and is much stiffer,  but bracelets get banged about much more than necklaces and need to be made of sterner stuff.  I use the .010/very fine to make earrings.  But it's all soft touch,  they're a reliable and excellent beading wire.	1
I purchased this from Beadaholique.  I appreciate Artistic Wire as it comes in so many varieties and is very affordable. Non-tarnish means that the wire is covered in a thin coating that prevents tarnishing. The coating itself is like a varnish. When you are careful with how you handle the wire, the coating stays put and protects the wire. It's best to use nylon covered pliers and take care when hammering. You could re-coat the wire with a similarly protective substance but it's very easy to damage the plating when the coating has peeled off, since the silver plating layer is VERY thin.	1
I LOVE THIS WIRE!  The beautiful deep, rich color makes jewelry projects look so expensive.  It is very strong while being extremely pliable.  I have used it in many gauges and never had a problem with it.  If you are practicing a jewelry piece and don't want to use expensive precious metal wire, this is a wonderful substitute.  I highly recommend this wire.	1
This wire is the first wire bought . I will learn how to use it. This is a good supply to start out with.	1
I love rose quartz, have used it for years and I saw this item and thought I'd try it since the pink was a lot more distinct, but the order I received were not as pink as the photo and more like the very faint pink I usually find.  But, of course, I will still use them, but mine weren't quite as pink as the photo.	1
I ordered these for my best friend as a gift...  She is very happy with them, so I am also very happy... Thank you  @}->--	1
Very pretty color, looks better in person. Use these on a necklace with silver spacers and it was beautiful, also done up a pair of earrings to match !	1
Nice pinkish color to these stone chips and looks great paired with Amazonite !	1
Never my first choice, Craft Wire by the Beadsmith is far more durable and definitely lives up to expectations, also much easier to clean.	-1
Nice fine wire. I use it for sculptures, so I am not positive about its jewelry uses, though it seems like it would work great. I like its malleability and strength.	1
good wire	1
I like this wire. This is a new hobby for me and I am enjoying the different type of jewelry wire out here.  The wire gauge is just right for what I want to accomplish.  However, I was surprised at how small the spool of wire was when I received it. However, the wire does go a long way and I still have enough on each spool that I've ordered.  I ordered in different gauges.....20 and 24; copper and silver.  I am  enjoying all the projects that I have completed with these wires. Delivery was excellent.  I love Amazon Prime.	1
Holds up really well with wear.  I test-drive my jewelry, and have been pleased with this wire.  It keeps its shine.	1
Very pretty beads.  Each one a little different.  Has made some very pretty jewelry.	1
This thread is a DARK gray almost black which will work perfect with my black beads very good buy....love fireline its the best beading thread!!!! Definitely will be buying more.	1
We ordered four different colors of this 22-Gauge "Artistic Wire", including the Green, Copper, Brass, and Silver. This is good thickness for most of my jewelry making needs and overall I am pleased with the strength and "workability" of the wire.  I will likely continue to use this brand since it works well and it is good quality.  Highly Recommended!  CFH	1
Pretty wire, will use well.	1
As described, good price	1
consistently good product.	1
good product!!! I recommend it!!!!	1
great	1
Great wire	1
Love copper and have been using much!	1
nice wire but the gauge was to thin for my eye pins but that was my fault.	1
great transaction.  great product	1
good	1
good purchase!	1
Quick shipping; product as described.  Thanks.	1
Great product! Fast service!	1
I had bought some other wire to use to make earring hooks.  It didn't work well because it was just silver-plated over brass wire.  My fault, I didn't pay attention to description when I purchased it.  I was very careful when I reordered to avoid this problem and ordered this wire.  This wire was a smaller gauge than I thought I wanted.  I originally wanted a 20 ga wire to make ear wires.  This wire works very well for that purpose and I prefer it over the 20 ga I ordered before.  It also works well for knotted headpins, just be sure to use nylon jaws straighteners to harden it up a bit.  I find three swipes with the wire straighteners is about right for the head pins and I hammer the wires a couple of times to set them.  I really like this wire and recommend it highly.	1
nice wire	1
Aaaaaaa	1
Great wire!	1
Wonderful wire to work with. I make wrap earrings, and it fits through my pearls beautifully, and wraps easily too. Two thumbs up!	1
This is grate wire to work with and would recommend to everyone who is making jewelery. Very good and quick service. :-)	1
Have not used yet but this is a great brand of wire. This is used in jewelry making and will be ordered again.	1
This wire is silver for ever, easy to work with and bends very nicely.  I recommend it highly for anyone who makes wire wrapped stones.	1
Purchased this wire because I couldn't find it locally.  It arrived as expected, is the gauge that was advertised and the finish was also as advertised.	1
I love Artistic Wire!  This is the highest quality wire next to precious metal wire that I have found on the market.  The color is the closest to precious metal, too.  I use it for wire-wrapping and wire-weaving jewelry making, so it is put through a lot of twisting and bending and stands up to that.  I highly recommend it.	1
Best prices I've seen on nontarnishable wire, have searched lots and lots of sites but this has been the best price fast shipping	1
I really like this wire. It's brightness is a good substitute for sterling silver wire. The finish is consistent and looks great even after a bit of being shaped with the pliers. The wire is strong and looks great in general. Also, the 22 gauge is great for wire-wrapping stones.	1
Exactly what I needed in order to fit into some of my pre-drilled pearls for some jewelry I am making!	1
Works easy, looks good, so far no tarnishing problems.  The silver is my favorite, gold color is second runner up.	1
This is my favorite wire to bead with! It is also great for wire wrapping! I would definitely recommend this wire!	1
New to the jewelry making craft.  This wire is perfect for child jewelry.  I also ordered 20 and 18 gauge more for adult jewelry.  I would recommend it and this company.	1
I have to say that the vendor behind this product is the real deal. I have had my share of not so above board vendors in the past so when I discovered my SS wire was not 5 feet but 2 inches shy, I blew a gasket! I felt like I was going to have to deal with yet again another "problem" vendor. Well to my delight and surprise, I spoke to Janice the owner and she was GREAT!! It is so refreshing to speak to people who are honorable and care about what they do. Her sincerity was palpable and it was just a mistake. A mistake that is rare but nonetheless it was NOT intentional at all. So, Janice took wonderful care to my situation and now I have a vendor that I trust and respect because of their customer service ethics. This mistake was a blessing in disguise in that I was able to feel more secure with this particular vendor for any all future purchases.	1
i like this silver and seems to work well,  but it is quite expensive for the small amount htat you actually  get	1
Shiny and silver and wiry.  Very happy with it!	1
This is beautiful silver wire that I have used in every gauge available from this Seller for my wire-wrapping, wire-weaving and other wire-jewelry making.  It makes my jewelry look expensive, and I have never had a problem with it.  Beadaholique is a dependable Seller who ships merchandise quickly.  I recommend it.	1
The dead soft silver is easy to work into intricate shape without tools.and it seems to hold its shape well. I had only used half hard silver before, which can be difficult and usually requires tools to get a good fit around stones.  Using tools invites tool marks.	1
I am very impressed with this chain. Great price by the foot, but I just haven't decided what I want to make with it yet. Its so petite and - for lack of a better word- soft. The pictures on here don't give it justice. Would make a great chain for any small pendant, since it's so small itself, but I'll use it for pom-pom like earrings I think.	1
Excelent	1
It seems a little stiff for "Dead Soft" but that may be my ignorance since I am just learning to use wires.  Very good price, though.	1
Great!	1
Nice would buy again	1
Just what i needed	1
As expected.	1
Good	1
alright	1
Perfect!	1
Exactly as advertised	1
Happy with it	1
great wire - seems to be very tarnish resistant too!	1
as expected	1
Love this wire ! Easy to work with. Durable and Pretty ! Came in a timely manner and packaged well.	1
My favorite & a great price	1
I always need wire,glad to come across this deal.	1
Item looks to be good quality. And though these are listed as jeweler's pins, they are great for various sewing tasks too. I like to use these to pin a garment down to make a pattern out of. And since these are curved at the top they are great for that. Thanks!	1
These chains were disappointing as they were pewter in color rather than the silver plate expected.  Had to use some parts of chain due to order. Package came on time.	-1
this was very nice	1
Nice chain and price	1
Wonderful chain for jewelry making:  great quality and great deal.	1
Good quality 20 gauge round - dead soft - wire.	1
I bought this product and it was great !!  Good price	1
This wire is perfect for creating bezels, bails and adding embellishments to handcrafted jewelry. I would not hesistate to purchase again.	1
As described.  Works perfectly for the project I am working on.	1
I've not opened it yet but it arrived quickly and undamaged. Thanks!	1
This is a nice delicate chain and being able to buy by the foot is very convenient. The way my arrived wrapped around a plastic holder is the reason for the rating. Both the beginning and the end were taped on the side of the spool. Neither end unwraps without tangle and I find it wholly aggravating each time I want to use this chain. Won't order again.	-1
The chain is perfect for using between wire wrapped beads.  It is a little fine for using a a single chain with a pendant, unless you are looking for something very delicate.  I used it in multiples between wire wrapped beads for a 50 inch necklace and it looks great.  I combined it with the same chain, in gold, with another necklace and that looked great as well.	1
Perfect for keeping my jewelry neatly displayed while in transport and doesn't interfere with the aesthetic value when on display	1
Very Very tiny	-1
Long pins. Sharp too.	1
I use these pliers for cutting soft wire, copper and gold wire. They do their job, and at a great price!	1
I love how delicate this chain is; it works great for the necklaces I made. I also paid less than I was expecting, so that's always good.	1
love the chain style. I wanted to by some chain for some creative designs worked great and helped with the work	1
perfect	1
A little small but sturdy. The size was probably posted I just wasn't pay attention. I needed u shaped floral pins to stick balloons into a foam wreath for some birthday decor:) These work well.	1
I used these for a shadow box project, and they worked great and have so far held up great.	1
exactly as described, works well with styrofoam covered felt to display pendants or whatever.  holds pretty heavy items and would look okay to use two pins if needed	1
Happy with the quality. They'll work just fine.	1
Good product	1
What to say about this product, it works as expected, it is comfortable and easy to handle. It is sharp and it gives even clear cuts. It is also reasonable priced perfect for beginners who needs practice tools.	1
i've had them a few months and so far they've remained unscathed.  i use them with medium gauge wire. i'm pretty sure that anything over 16 gauge and memory wire would definitely end them. they are however, well built and reliable. i'm happy with them.	1
These are tough to work with, and not what I expected from Beadsmith. They aren't sharp enough to begin with, and that's tough because the wire is already hard on the nippers.	-1
I needed something like this for small cutting and this did the trick for me!  I thank you very much	1
not good at all. im beginning to think I got someones returned cutters. and I was only trying to cut very very thin wire with it. it didn't even want to score the wire. I feel ive wasted my money on these. I don't like to waste time sending back items to amazon unless its a very expensive product with high value, so im stuck with these. I may find time someday to research how to sharpen them. that might help. but until then....wasted.  quick shipping.	-1
I had no illusions about what I would get for the price.  These work just fine for simple wire cutting when beading. They are not great for very close cuts with beading wire, but they are definitely useful day in and day out for most of my jewelry making tasks.  I definitely prefer side nippers given that my motor skills are not the greatest.  I find them very maneuverable.	1
These beading needles have saved me alot of grief when it comes to stringing beads. They are small enough to easily work with and long enough to gather enough beads at one time! The eye is easily threaded and they pass through every bead, reguardless of hole diameter.	1
I'm new to these needles, at first I did not know how to thread them, but then I figured it out, and the thinness of them is fenomenal.  I love working with them as it makes it very easy to bead thin beads. They make your work easy and fast.  I recommend them highly.  And they are sturdy too.  Bend every which way and do not break.  Nice strong good qualitly product.	1
This glue works well.	1
Perfect size for beading I do every day.	1
perfect	1
bead smith needles	1
they are very thin, but great for what I need them for. Need a magnifying glass to thread.	1
Worked great for what I used it for.	1
I have a lot of different glues to use on my wire and macrame projects, but this one is my favorite so far. It dries pretty quickly and is clear, which I really appreciate. Easy to use; doesn't come out too fast so I am able to control the application better. This is the second tube I've purchased and am sure I will purchase again.	1
Haven't tried it yet, but if it's as good as other adhesives of this brand, it should be great! Fast shipping.	1
was the producuto I wanted and arrive on time	1
Great Product!! I would buy it again!! Great for making jewelry!	1
I bead as a form of therapy and a lot of my work requires the use of needles.  I buy these every couple of months.  Since I reinforce my stitch through out my work, I have a habit of breaking these.  They do last longer then most.	1
work great	1
They're sturdy but flexible!	1
The smallest size needle is wonderful for delica seed bead projects where you have to thread through the same bead numerous times.	1
Love it!	1
:D	1
great beading needles	1
I like them a lot.	1
Thank you!	1
Have a set for every embroidery and bead box I use, never know when you need one....;-}	1
These just fit most beads and are easy to use.	1
These are quality needles.  I would buy them again.	1
I love these needles! They are great for the hand work that I am doing on my crazy quilt!	1
product arrived timely and intact	1
love	1
GOOD	1
My favorite bead needles.	1
helpful to make my items for sale	1
They're good.	1
I love it. Product as described. I was just bummed out because of the size of the eyelets I don't have thread  small enough to go through them.	1
Perfect	1
I received the item on Sept 19th as stated. They are very nice to work with.	1
Good Variety, but hard to thread!	1
Great beading needles. Long enough to accommodate a lot of beads in two convenient lengths. Thin enough to go through freshwater pearls.	1
Just as advertised and expected.	1
Nice assortment	1
Good	1
They are great needles. No issues at all.	1
Love the different sizes provides options for bead creations.	1
Great !	1
These have been so helpful to me especially with my looming projects. Less flimmsy than the big eyed needles! I will definitely order these when needed.	1
It can be difficult to thread a needle so thin, but if you are in need of a thin needle, this is your product! Works great. I worried that it was a tad flimsy, but it has held up even to a pair of pliers pulling it through beads.	1
I find these a must to keep in my craft tool box. They come in handy for a variety of projects and the longer length makes them easier for young and old hands alike to hold onto. They work especially well for me with seed bead projects and the add-on price feature makes them more attractively priced. I am happy with them for sure!	1
This is the best items man has put out. Nothing is harder then string beads on crochet thread. These needles every crafter needs to have them.	1
I have been stocking up on needles and these will be a wonderful addition to my collection. These are easy to use and I will use them up with my beading and Soutache.  Thanks	1
These needles will come in very handy for my beading projects that I make for all of my grand-children for the holidays.	1
These are so much easier than traditional needles since my eyes are not as good as they used to be.  Work really great and the thread doesn't slip out like I thought it would.	1
These babies are excellent, in fact I wouldn't be without them. I use them for beading natural products like freshwater pearls and semi precious gemstones onto my silk flowers that I sell on Etsy. These beads usually have a really tiny hole and a regular, fine needle is always too big. They are quite flimsy and can break so you might have to replace them from time to time, but that's to be expected. Love them!	1
had to learn on how to use these i had never done something but since my eyes are getting bad i love these thank you	1
These beading needles are great! Just the right size for the seed beads, and flexible. Very happy with them. Nice strong good qualitly product.	1
THE NEEDLES ARRIVED IN EXCELLENT CONDITION. THEY ARE A XMAS PRESENT FOR MY WIFE VIRGINIA. WHEN SHE CHECKS THEM OUT XMAS I WILL GIVE FURTHER COMMENTS.  THX  JOHN ELDRIDGE	1
I use a zillion Japanese seed beads in my jewelry business.  I go through needles very quickly.  These needles met my need for a high quality product.	1
Young people may not need these, but they do make the beading easier.  Similar items can be found in craft stores, but the ease of shopping online made this purchase simple.	1
The eyes on these needles are easy to get and some "good' size and weight thread can easily be threaded.  Be warned, the needle on these is fairly thick, so if you are using a small bead, these may not be as good a deal for you as the "Big Eye Needles Beading (Set Of 4)" from the same company.	1
I made a beautiful necklace out of these and will make several more. I am very pleased with the quality of this product and will continue to use this product!	1
I love these things, I use them for all of my stringing ends, they make the piece look more professional, and ok easy to use, and I am experimenting with them with other things I need a professional look. So far so good. I wish I could get them in larger quantities. But couldn't find any. They will not work on anything but wire and S-lon though, so don't try, the holes are tooo small to get them through unless a bigger size, buy hey, we can only hope for larger ones now that these are so cool. I will buy again, and I will tell everyone how great they are for finishing necklaces. I use a crimp before I put them on, though I don't think I would even have to.	1
These are small enough for tight spaces, yet have a very large eye to make it easier to add ribbon or larger cord, or just for those who can't see as well.  They seem to be well made and should last.	1
I think they make beading a lot easier, but the only think I didn't pay attention to is the size of the eye of the needle. It is so small that I have to use a magnifier to when getting ready to use the needle for beading..	1
YOU TAKE YOUR THREAD PUT IT THROUGH THE EYE AND START YOUR PROJECT THE PRODUCT IS AS DESCRIBED AND IM A GUY SO THIS IS THE BEST I CAN WRITE ABOUT NEEDLES.SORRY IF I COULD NOT BE OF MUCH HELP.	1
I am giving the item 5 stars - NOT because it met my expectations - the product EXCEEDED my expectations.  The photo DOES properly represent the product.  It arrived on time and undamaged.  Excellent price.  Excellent value.  Excellent product.  PERFECT for sead beads and silk thread!	1
These needles work wonderfully well. I love how inexpensive they were, and that they came in multiple sizes. I also like the length, it makes beading easier!  5/5  Well worth it.	1
They are good and strong needles.  The eyes are somewhat small but easy to thread.  They hold several beads at a time.	1
great needles for beading, 4 different sizes and light weight. If you bead...this makes things easier...but if using seed beads..make sure you have right size.	1
Well made and received sooner than expected.  Would order again.	1
item was as expected and arrived on time	1
Very nice! Handy for protecting wire when making necklaces and bracelets , saves wear and tear on wire, makes it last longer!	1
This is everything I expected and more	1
What I expected but haven't used them yet I find them a little tricky to use but they do prevent kinks in the wire	1
One of these items was supposed to be in silver color. I may have been my mistake, but I am not sure. It also took a long time to receive these small elements.	1
great	1
I don't make or create any pieces of jewelry without using wire protectors now.  I feel much more confident that there will be no breakage due to thread or wire friction on the clasps.  These are a beautiful color, uniform in size and sturdy.  They give any piece of jewelry a polished, finished and professional look.  I get peace of mind knowing that my jewelry won't have clasp failure and customers can wear their purchase with confidence.	1
It really is not for the  type of work I do so gave it to a beader and she loves them.	1
I paid $1.36 for these 4 English Beading Needles and they are a distinct improvement over some I've use from fire mtn.  I will order more in the future.  Makes threading beads easy and they hold up well.	1
It is so wonderful to be able to purchase such fine product on line! They are great quality needles! Thank you again!	1
These are great for beading.  Have purchased before, and will continue to always order these. Great selection of sizes to work with.	1
What can i say?  They're needles - they do what they are supposed to do.  Perfect for what I needed them for.  No complaints here.	1
A must have for all beaders, you never know what size you'll need for any project, so these are always great to have all the time!  Another great item and inexpensive from Amazon!!	1
I've already made several necklaces with my granmother's beads using this kit.  It's great for the value.  I would recommend ordering a beading needing in conjunction with it.	1
they work for the 4mm and larger beads I still have all of them as i needed ones for 2mm	1
Not a whole lot to say about needles---- they did the job, nice that they were assorted. They do hold up good, and nice sizes.	1
I love these because they keep you thread and wire safe and in place. Looks so much better then seeing the wire and or thread attached to your beautiful creation	1
These wire and thread protectors are very nice quality. They are consistent, which is a big deal when making jewelry.	1
Exactly what I needed , to make my jewelery complete and look great ! Great buy for a quality piece , I will be ordering more in the future .	1
Perfect for the intended use in jewelry making.	1
I like using these as an added precaution against breaking due to normal wear. This is plated cheap metal, so I use it for cheaper work. Does the job. If you have no idea what this does, let me explain briefly. Using a wire strand to make a bracelet for example, you need a place to add the clasp. If you just crimp the end you run the risk of friction causing wear and premature breakage. These fantastic little things allow you to thread the wire (I suggest a minimum of 19 strand wire) through, then cramping. First add your crimp bead, then thread up one side and down the other with the wire resting in the groove at the top. Then back through your crimp bead, hold the wire snug against the loop and crimp. It takes a bit of practice to get it snip enough. I started several lengths of bracelet so I could find my technique. Then when I was ready to assemble and finish them, I was good enough to do it with beads in the way(the more challenging side). Plus I had several started so my creative juices could just start building....a head start if you will. I do recommend a crimp cover ( a clamshell shaped thing that you simply close with your mangled looking Crimp bead inside , so allow a tiny bit of room for that so your work is not too stiff).	1
I've been beading for quite a while, and while shopping for parts, have noticed these thread/wire protectors, but never really considered using them.  Over time, however, I began to have concerns about the durability of my necklaces, especially the heavier ones.  It just seemed to me like there's potential for wear and tear where the beading wire connects to the clasp.  So, the other day, I decided to give these a try.  a)  they are easy to use b)  they add a nice, professional "finish" to the clasp area of the necklace c)  seems to me like they will add some protection agains possible beading wire abrasion  I think it's worth it to use these;  I certainly will use them on everything I make from now on.  NOTE:  These protectors will not fit over HEAVY DUTY beading wire (I couldn't give you a full breakdown of all wire sizes, but I have a .024 diameter wire that does NOT fit;  no problem with the .014 diameter).	1
I am giving the item 5 stars - NOT because it met my expectations - the product EXCEEDED my expectations.  The photo DOES properly represent the product.  It arrived on time and undamaged.  Excellent price.  Excellent value.  Excellent product.	1
Great	1

Came quickly and in great shape. Very pretty little beads,love them. They will make the perfect spacer beads for my jewelry.	1
I loved these tigers eye rounds right away, even before I created a chain pattern for them.  They have very clear and vibrant colors and blended well with glass beads and charms. Thanks!	1
These beads are so beautiful...they absolutely glow with golden tones amidst a dark brown sphere.  The beads were uniform in shape and they look gorgeous paired with gold spacer beads!  Enjoy!	1
Love it!	1
I am finally able to use these on my earring so I can wear them all day.	1
I don't even want to use them for jewelry just sit and look at them! Nice buy and fast shipping and helpful, Ill def be doing business with them in the future!	1
I love these earring backs. I have already made a few earrings with them.	1
good	1
great price.	1
Great product. Thank you	1
Quality item , just what I Needed	1
Not all were perfect. Some were missing the little ball at the end lf the earring. Maybe 7-8 were not able to be used but for the price, you cant beat the quantity. I would order this product again.	1
Good	1
very pretty	1
I l ove them beautiful plus they came earlyalso thx	1
Beautiful beads and very versatile. I was given this item at a reduced price in exchange for an honest and fair review.	1
Great for beading	1
These are beautiful just beautiful! I would definitely recommend them. I just wished they were a Amazon Prime item.  Because they took so long to arrive, but worth the wait.	1
love it!	1
Works well, my crimps look much better now.	1
Really works great for me I'm very happy I bought them.	1
nice and sturdy	1
Very cool its got that gunmetal industrial look to it	1
Happy	1
good quality	1
the tigers eye was perfect and went fast on a bracelet	1
Real Tigers Eye at this price, they are great!	1
Beautiful Thank you	1
This is my first time purchasing tiger eye beads. They are amazing! The authentic color and detail and the small but not too small size makes these perfect accent or stand alone for any jewelry item. I have already made one new bracelet and working on another to give as gifts. A great new addition to my stash. I highly recommend these beads!	1
Very nice	1
Works great - awesome price.  Use to make jewelry for our relay for life team.	1
Very good deal.	1
Thank you	1
My daughter loves to make jewelry and is loving her new items from this vendor.  THANKS!	1
These hooks are easy to work with and sturdy.  I use them to repair my earrings whenever I mess them up.  I didn't need so many but these were so inexpensive that it did not matter.  I have enough to last a lifetime.	1
Good price for surgical ear wires	1
I am so glad I decided to buy this tool kit. It has everything I really need while making my jewelry. I really love the scoop for the Delica seed beads. I cannot tell you how much time I have spent in the past trying to pick up each tiny bead. This is a great deal because each tool is under $10 and are pretty sturdy. For this price this item cannot be beat.	1
The beads I got were not 6-6.5 .  It took a long time to get them and they are small but nice.  Will still use but not as I invisioned.	-1
Beautiful!	1
Perfect, fast shipping and as pictured.  beautiful beads	1
great stuff.	1
Good quality. Very pretty.	1
Larger than I expected but very beautiful and great quality.	1
Always loved tiger eye and these don't disappoint!	1
Package arrived well ahead of the estimated arrival date. 4 stars only because hooks are much  darker then I expected, almost gun metal in color. I was expecting the usual hint of gray you see on surgical steel wires. I can still use them but will still have to find normal surgical steel. These are too dark for most of the earrings I make, I use a lot of silver.	1
Thanks	1
I have very sensitive ears so nickel free earrings are the way to go. I wore a pair of earrings that I made yesterday and did not have an allergic reaction. Great hooks!	1
I can not wait to use them on my earrings.  They seem to be strong and won't cause my ears to hurt.	1
They do what they're supposed to! Great deal. If I still made jewelry, I would order them again. No doubt about it!	1
These came quickly,  simple spring and summer earrings are on  the way.  Thanks for being apart of my crew. again thanks	1
Love them	1
Just as described and good quality.	1
Good	1
Shipping took a while. But the product is exactly what I was in need of. They are more of dark silver though, not a bright silver.	1
Very nice. Took way too long to get here.	1
Very nice paired with ceramic beads	1
Great - Just as described - Thanks!	1
Need fishing line to use this with para-cord...	1

I would have given this 5 stars but one of the tools was missing. Can't say that I'm heart-broken over it, but still. Love the fit, the feel and the heft of the tools & the zip up case looks sharp. Overall I am very pleased.	1
Perfect!!	1
Just what I wanted, good quality, good price, good shipping.	1
This is my second Beadsmith tool kit. A girl just can't have enough tools, and Beadsmith makes my favorite. Got my order quick in perfect condition. Thanks, Beadsmith!	1
It's great to have a good supply of earring hooks like this on hand; these are good quality and early to work with.	1
I received my order of the  surgical steel ball and coil earring hooks today and they look pretty good.  Thanks a lot.	1
When I searched for hypoallergenic hooks on Amazon, this was one of the first things that came up so I put it in the top of my to buy list because they were only .94 cents plus $1.38 for shipping.  Unfortunately I didn't read the reviews first, otherwise I would not have bought them.  I tried to cancel my order before they shipped, but the drop down menu for giving a reason for canceling my order didn't have any options making it impossible to cancel.  All I could do was wait for them to come which took 3 weeks.  Before I started making earrings to sell on Etsy, I wanted to try them out and see if they would give me a bad reaction or not, well, within the first minute I my ear lobe started pulsating.  I should have known that that was a sign, but I wanted to give them a chance so I wore them for 6 1/2 hours.  I had to take them out because my head was tight and my jaw is in agony and now I'm feeling really sick.  If I can't wear these, I refuse to make earrings with them to sell, so they are going directly in the trash because I'm sure it would cost me more than I paid to return them to China.  It's not worth it.  Buyer beware.  If you require hypoallergenic earrings, these are not for you.  Trust me.  You get what you pay for, so pay a little bit more and get good quality hypoallergenic earring hooks.	-1
Beautiful beads. Will buy again. Didn't care for other styles from this seller, but these specifically are gorgeous.	1
Good quality for price, attractive.	1
great	1
GREAT	1
Very pleased	1
Love them!!!	1
These are very nice tiger's eye gemstones. Some of the other ones going around are some type of colored glass but these look legit. Very beautiful and for the price, definitely worth the wait (which was 2 - 3 weeks). The holes are drilled in good locations so that they are aesthetically pleasing.  I am buying more and I would recommend these to others. In my home town the cheapest strand of tiger's eye is at least $5 plus tax.	1
very pleased	1
Very nice for the price.  Will be using the product for a craft group. Thanks for the good value that you give the customers.	1
everyone can use surgical steel I am now just beginning the marketing of my earrings I LOVE them and recommend them highly	1
I am allergic to most metals so I can't wear the cute earrings you find in stores, I can't even wear silver.  I found that I prefer making my own earrings, I can make them to match anything and it doesn't even take very long.	1
Being a small woman, sometimes pliers are too darn big to use and end up hurting my wrists.  These fit nicely in my hands and work well	1
I purchased this tool set 8 years ago and they are still in great condition. I teach bead-making to adults and children. This is the kit I recommend to my students and I don't make a profit of any kind off the sale.  The quality is one of the best on the market. The price is fair.  The tips of the pliers are the perfect size.  They are easy to grip.  The sets they sell in the Big Box Craft Stores may be cheaper with a coupon but the quality is poor and the heads of the tools are bulky and do not line up well.  I have seen the same kit for sale on other sites and in stores for $50 to $65 so the Amazon price is a bargain.	1
Stailess steel might be good enough for some people with an alery to nickle but not me.  I had to coat them with clear nail polish.  I have ordered ones that say they are hypoalergentic but do not have them yet.  I looked up "stainless steel" online and it does commonly have nickle in it so it realy is my fault for not doing a little research first.	-1
Absolutely great ear wires!  These were far less pricey than most other places I've found, and are perfectly uniform in size and shape.  I am beyond satisfied with these for my jewelry-making.	1
It took about 2-1/2 months before I actually received my earring findings, and they were shabbily packed and not in great condition.  I sell jewelry and had orders to fill, so actually had to buy them elsewhere to finish. I have to share the blame unfortunately, I was trying to save money. Never again though . . I'd rather pay a little more and get a better quality item, & in a timely manner. There were quite a few bent & they were just put into a manila envelope with no inner packaging. When I opened it, they all fell out. Also, you can't open the bottom loop without it breaking, at least on over half of them.  If I'm attaching anything, I have to be able to open that (the dangle part) instead. They were a great price, but not completely worth it in the end. I've always been told  'You get what you pay for' . . . you do!	-1
will look great with the antique fossils  I bought	1
thanks	1
Don't let the picture fool you.  You will get a single strand of beads that are between 15-18 inches long - they are pretty beads.  I was a little disappointed that I got so few beads but decided to mix them with a lapus bead and create a different design.	1
Good Price	1
great	1
Having tools is a must when making jewelery. I haven't tried any other but these work good for me. Try it!	1
I have been making jewelry for around 10 years. When I first started beading, I bought a couple of cheap tools that did an OK job, not knowing what I really needed or how much jewelry making I would be doing. I realized this year while making jewelry to sell that I needed better tools. I read very good reviews about the BeadSmith jewelry tools and knew they were the tools I needed.  I have used every tool that comes in the kit several times since I purchased them and it makes my job so much easier! Everything from opening jump rings to wrapping metal and shaping copper wire, these tools live up to my expectations and more.	1
These completely suit my purposes.  I first ordered&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/22K-Gold-Plated-Surgical-Steel-Hypo-Allergenic-Earring-Hooks-100/dp/B003OXPAFK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">22K Gold Plated Surgical Steel Hypo-Allergenic Earring Hooks (100)</a>&nbsp;and I was happy with those, so I decided to get the (silver) surgical steel ones as well.  These are not perfect, but at the price, and given some of the other reviews, I wasn't expecting perfection.  Where do they fall short?  Well, they aren't all exactly the same; some are shorter than others, a few ball & coils are missing, the way the hooks are bent varies somewhat from one to the next.  The coils on a portion of my hooks aren't tight, but I am able to mash them together with pliers without much trouble.  These are small criticisms.  There is no question in my mind that the hooks are in fact surgical steel as I've purchased other surgical steel hooks and the distinction (from say, silver-plated brass hooks) is in how hard they are, which is a quality I like.  Bend this into the shape you prefer (I habitually bend the ear wire closer in to lessen the likelihood that it'll fall out when in someone's ear) and it'll stay that way.  The order took awhile to come but I knew that going in.  And not only did I get the 100 I ordered, but found a bit more than that in the tiny ziplocked bag.  (Oh yeah, I count 'em!) Quite satisfied.	1
Great price. Just as it shows 100 hooks, way more then what you would get in the store for that price.	1
Got them quickly and in very good shape. This is the 2nd time I have ordered these and will keep on ordering them. Out of the package of 100 pcs I only find like 2-3 that are missing the ball on them and like 1-2 that are missing ball and coil. Which for being mass  produced and packaged isn't bad. But I like them because they are solid Surgical Steel and won't break your ears out ! So they are perfect for making my earrings.	1
I purchased a 100 Surgical Steel ball & coil Earring Hooks with good and fast services. Very good price. Would buy again.	1
Well packaged, shipped in a reasonable period of time. Good earring hooks at a great price. I like the fact that they are surgical steel so I think that they should be hypoallergenic.	1
beautiful gems	1
Lovely	1
Absolutely beautiful	1
Great product, prompt shp/pkg, hi quality, Thanks.	1
Beautiful ,  can't  wait  to  use .  Thank  you ,  Linda	1
This kit has all of the starter tools that someone needs to do beading and wire work, plus a few extras.  The quality is reasonable for the cost.  You save money by buying a set over individual tools.  I have not had any problems using any of the tools, and the cutter is very sharp.  The case makes it easy to carry the tools with you if you are doing a "mobile" project, such as during a long car trip.  Overall, I am very pleased, and would buy this set again.  That said, there are more ergonomic tools available with better padded and/or longer handles, and if you are doing bead work professionally, it would be well worth it to invest in ergonomic tools.  This set is perfect for hobby beaders like myself.	1
This is a great assortment of tools. The quality is fine. I forgot my tools at home in NY, and I am at my Condo in Florida, so I needed a set. I am delighted with them and even have some things that I didn't own before, included. It comes with super case to protect them and it can slip right into your project tote. Do not hesitate to buy them. I don't know what is the beef about the quality, they are Beadsmith's, same as I bought from my favorite bead store for a lot more money but prettier (these are purple pliers and blue crimper and knot cutter). So, I don't get what the negatives are. Enjoy them because the price is right.	1
This is a very nice set of tools and the case is large enough to add a few more tools.  I can carry this kit with me and if I need to change an item at a sell I am able to do so.  They fit my hand well and hold the wire and rings tightly.	1
Good quality 20 gauge round - dead soft - wire.	1
Excellent product.	1
perfect	1
Great item...	1
I received my pack of this item in a small zip bag, but the quality of the metal was formal and no discoloration or any sort. For the price to get 100 pieces of surgical steel ball and coil hooks, I think it's a great deal!	1
I purchased these for a daughter and she's very happy with the quality-- I'm very happy with the price.  They are all bright and shiny and of very good quality. I'll be ordering again!	1
Great coloring in the beads. Would order them again.	1
Excellent	1
Thank you	1
This was a good purchase. The quality was perfect!	1
i like it	1
Beautiful beads! So many compliments	1
Beautiful gems. It gives a special touch on my Fashion Jewelry making.	1
These Carnelian chips are very nice..They have really great color variation and feel good to work with. I am pleased.	1
The photo does not give this product the credit it deserves. These are beautiful and are so colorful and refreshing.	1
Perfect.	1
Wonderful beads. Looked lovely when finished into a bracelet.	1
The strand of beads I received are genuine tigers eye but the size was smaller than what I ordered. The quality of the bead makes up for the size and since I make jewelry all the time, they will serve their purpose. I won't use anything less than the real deal in my craft and these are real tigers eye beads perfectly polished and great energy! I would 've given 5 stars if the size of the beads would've been correct but I have full confidence this was just a mishap and if I had the time to spare I would've sent them for the correct size but they are to beautiful to send back. I am very content with the product and quality	1
Tiger Eye is one of my favorite stones and these are perfect for what I need. They're perfect and don't look cheap. Thanks	1
bellisimas!!	1
Haven't had a chance to use these yet (waiting for more spacers) but they look really nice. Well rounded, well centered holes. They will look nice with other small beads and spacers. Or as spacers themselves for larger beads. I don't know anything about beads or beading, but I like these.	1
I ordered these beads with the intent of making something for my mother and upon receiving them I had to make something for myself first. These beads are wonderful and I will definitely order more in the future.	1
I would recommend this product to everyone the durability and ease of holding then gems attaching them so very happy I chose this product !! I will be returning to purchase more and the same !	1
These beads are beautiful and are easy to use and make jewelry. I made many gifts from these beads for Christmas.	1
When I received these beads I was thoroughly impressed by the quality. These are around 6.5mm but somehow appear a bit smaller. However I am still very delighted to use them and will definitely be purchasing them again.	1
I guess , since this was my first time buying beads over the net like this, I took the pictures at face value. I was expecting several ropes of beads. If I thought about it at all, I just thought we were talking about several strands, not 1 15 inch strand. The price was still good, and the beads were beautiful, but a single strand doesn't give me a lot to be able to do with them. I am going to have to find a new way to buy many more strands before I can begin using them.	1
I have yet to use the Tiger Tigers Eye Gem Round 6-6mm Beads, but, again, look forward to using them	1
It was so hard to find a dark green bead like this and be as pretty as these beads are.	1
I am very happy with these chips. The Green is gorgeous and the feel is smooth and cool. A great stone and living up to its reputation.	1
I love the energy that comes from crystals, no matter what size they are. Crystal chips have energy also !  Gentle Light   Jo	1
These pliers are sturdy and comfortable to use.  Don't worry about the quality--they are a terrific buy for the price.	1
This is a nice product but I should have gone to the mother site since it was combined shipping there and individual on Amazon	1
Even prettier than pictured. I was surprised and happy when I saw how beautiful these beads are. They are very nice and will work great in my projects.	1
Nice beads for making men's' jewelry. Thanks & I am sorry it took me so long to give you feedback.	1
better then expected...will shop again without a doubt.  i will be ordering lots more of these...they are absolutely fabulous  they have great for bracelets	1
the pack we received was as lovely as the picture suggested. My daughter made a gift with it that was well received.	1
Ha! sometimes I forget to  make sure that the stones i buy are an appropriate size. I still enjoyed the energy and I enjoyed the stones, just wish I'd purchased larger sized stones. Price was good for the value and product..  Susan pharis	1
I decided I wanted to start making chainmaille-style jewelry.  I am not sure which metal I will eventually settle on (right now I am just playing around with copper since I have a lot of it and it is inexpensive) so I wanted a separate set of pliers that I could dip in Tool Magic in case I eventually start working with anodized or enameled metals.  (I also got some bent chain nose pliers from the same brand.)  These didn't break the bank and I can always use them for my other jewelry-making applications if I end up not liking chainmalle (though right now I find it pretty fun).  Anyway, as I said, I've been using plain, bare copper (while I wait for my Tool Magic to arrive).  It has a hard temper but I do all right bending the jump rings open and closed using these in my right hand (the bent chain nose pliers, I use in my left hand).  I think these work for me because they are relatively small.  I have small hands, and I can get a good grip on these, and that makes it easier to manipulate the metal I am working with.  These are smooth but I have marred the surface of some jump rings as I get the hang of using them.  It doesn't bother me much because I am just doing practice weaves right now and I do have a protective coating on order that should prevent that problem in the future.  I would probably stick to using these on softer metals -- copper, silver, brass, maybe niobium or aluminum.  I think using them on hardened steel would not work very well.  (I certainly can't use them to bend loops in memory wire, for example.)  I would also stick to using them for jewelry applications and not put them in a general toolbox for household work.  Anyway, I was looking for a set of economy pliers to try with a new craft and that's what I got with these.	1
great product	1
My new favorite tool.	1
Just what I needed.	1
Very well made for the grade of tool that they are; I will purchase other Beadsmith pliers.	1
Great pliers.	1
Broken in a month of use. The spring bars between handles are not reliable.	-1
The pliers are great. It pays to have a good set of tools.	1
Very nice product	1
I've used Beadsmith products for jewelry and craft making and they always work perfectly. They are great quality and last a long time. This is my 4th pair because I always end up giving them away to my fellow crafty friends who try mine and inevitably say that they work so much better than the ones they are using (which they usually spent more on).	1
They seem like they are made pretty sturdy but only time will tell. Only complaint, I feel I have to use alot of extra pressure to get the tips to touch or even clamp down on very thin wire.	1
Love them. They work extremely well compared to the tool I had before. I will be getting a regular Round nose plier with a bigger end, but for smaller projects this is a wonderful tool!	1
perfect	1
Great for wire wrapping!	1
Good grip. Small round nose perfect for crafting.	1
Excellent product Just the right size	1
Great for what i need them for	1
Use it all the time to start my spirals	1
I love these pliers great for small places	1
Awesome tool, really handy in closing my memory wire bracelets. :)	1
Smaller than my other ones but get the job done.	1
WORKS REALLY GOOD	1
Just as described and works great.	1
Love these! Sturdy and nice size for different size rings -- even pretty small ones. I would buy again and recommend.	1
Great for the price.  Handles are small and can be uncomfortable, but you get what you pay for.  These are perfect for casual jewelry making or chainmaille type crafts.	1
The pliers feel great, and are an improvement to what I had, but I wouldn't recommend them because of small notches on the tips, and a deeper small cut on the other side.	-1
Good quality pliers.  Just the addition I needed to complete my beading tool kit.	1
metal is soft and they get gouges easily and burrs too! Craftsman seems to make the only Real tool that can stand up to my rough demands and high expectations!	1
I'm happy...the right tool for the right job!	1
Quality round nose jewelry pliars. Nice size and comfortable handles	1
good quality. reasonable price. needed for fixing and making jewelry.	1
I bought several pairs of these for a workshop I was giving at work.  They worked fine.  Good find for the price.	1
Good sturdy tool. Nice grip for my small hands.	1
works like a charm, for certain wire work. would buy again	1
Great little pliers for someone who is only a jewelry hobbyist. Great price, too.	1
Love this! So easy to work with. Makes jewelry making easy. I wish I had bought it sooner. Seems well made. I would buy again.	1
Works great!	1
I enjoy working with these round nose pliers. They are very comfortable in my hand. I can naked the perfect size loop with them consistently, every single time. They are very sturdy end have held up well. They are light weight yet very strong.  I highly recommend these.	1
While certainly not the top quality available in jeweler's pliers, they are fully adequate for bending little pieces of wire-- which is what we buy them for, right?  I don't really understand paying $30-40 or more for round-nosed pliers; at least not as a hobbiest.  If I were carefully mounting sapphires with gold and platinum wire it would be different... but I'm not.	1
These. Are. Awesome!! I had a cheap pair from a kit I bought years ago...what a difference. I wish I'd bought these years ago!	1
Perfectly sized for my hands; in fact, I wish the handles weren't sprung quite so far apart. The jaws are true (not offset diagonally), and I can get exquisitely tiny loops with these -- very important with fashion doll jewelry, but also with some full-sized mechanisms and jewelry.	1
hard for me to use, I guess I am just new at this	-1
Great jewelry pliers!	1
These are so perfect for wire wrapped jewelry.  they are small and easy to hold and use.  They are also well made and good quality.  Great price, too1	1
I have not actually started manufacturing with these yet, but soon I shall. I'm sure these will work well for my needs based on how they look and feel.	1
These pliers were exactly what I needed to work on my jewelry. The size is perfect and the craftsmanship is excellent.	1
Very nice pliers. Seems to be well made and it really fits nice in my hands. Perfect for working on watches!	1
This is a must have for a beginner in jewelry making. It makes the loops so perfect. I'm glad I purchased it.	1
Designed for jewelry making and they work well with tiny fingers manipulating them.  It is what we expected when we ordered them.	1
These pliers are the best, so much better than the ones I had been using. They arrived in great shape and before I expected them. I would recommend them.	1
I ordered a bunch of really inexpensive necklaces that seem to break within seconds of wearing them sometimes. I bought a bunch of replacement jump rings and have used these handy little pliers to fix them easily each time. For the price, it's easily worth it to fix necklaces I've only worn one or twice. Totally worth buying even though I don't do any kind of jewelry making or beading.	1
Just what I wanted/needed.  It is exactly as described on Amazon.  Arrived promptly, and in perfect condition.  I would recommend this item.	1
Very nice tool, exactly as described. It works just like I need it to and I consider it to be one of my primary work horse tools.	1
Sterling Silver Wire, guage 20 (half round half hard) was exactly as pictured and described. Again, reviews are personal, relative and selective.  This was what I needed to do what I wanted to do.  The wire was well packaged, and shipped quickly for a reasonable price.  When you get what you've asked for and paid for, there's nothing but good to say about it.  (Richard's wife.)	1
Good	1
I have bought a lot from this provider and am always pleased. Be careful with other providers it may look good on your browser. Rest assured your safe with this one.	1
I like the color, very delicate.  I'm just starting to work with gold, this was at a price that makes experimenting less inhibited.	1
perfect	1
I will buy this again. I make custom jewelry and it works great!! Buy it!!	1
As always, a wonderful transaction! Love Beadaholique products and service!	1
works great	1
Arrived fine and dandy, and appropriately packaged.  Thank you.	1
Good wire to do earrings and pendents and so much more with this wire, I will order more when needed	1
I bought wire from this site many times and was very happy. You won't be displeased with any wire bought from this provider.	1
I am trying to purchase as much of this as I can, it's a great deal for gold wire which I use to make rosaries for priests.	1
YES YES YES	1
Great Product! I love the products this company makes and will continue to buy them.	1
I am buying this again! It's less expensive than using up all of my headpins.	1
Love the shine and quality.	1
Just what I was looking for!	1
used to make earrings, I've actually worn them in the shower all week, just too lazy to take off. No green, no tarnish, yet. Love it!	1
Good	1
Fast shipping, good quality.	1
Fabulous! What more is there to say? I absolutely love it ... I could only love it more if it were more and free..: -)  Thank you, and, I WILL BE BACK FOR MORE!	1
Nice tone.	1
For Sterling Silver, this was a good price.  The pins are straight which is rare and I was happy  about that.  The only draw back is they are extremely thin.  Other that that, I have no other complaints.	1
Am pleased with this item	1
I liked it.	1
These are wonderful high-quality sterling silver head pins!  They are durable and pliable.  It is nice to deal with this dependable, reliable Seller, too.  I recommend them.	1
Great needles.  I tend to be very hard on needles and bend them all up, like corkscrews.  These seem to be able to take my abuse and generally bounce back into shape.  They are also very easy to work with.  Not sure why that is or why they should be different from other needles.  But there you are.  Just my opinion.	1
It em as described. Fast service.	1
Can't wait to try these.	1
Pretty good product, just very small for covering a crimp.	1
If you are stringing beads on wire, you need crimp beads! This lot of 100 sterling silver tube-shaped crimp beads measuring 2mm wide by 2mm long should get you through a bunch of projects.	1
Can't tell you how many of these tiny crimps I've had to buy because they're so small and they always end up mixed in with other larger beads.  Still, they're a "must" for so many beading projects that you know you'll need a bunch.  I was very happy with the crimp beads I received and would definitely order from this company again!	1
These are small but easy to work with and connects small items very well, very sturdy yet opens easily to use and connect your chains or other items.	1
22k is alittle darker than 14k, but I still liked the product.	1
Good quality	1
nice jump rings come already open	1
Great product and good supplier.	1
good jump rings	1
Right size and could finish my project	1
The seller accurately advertised these findings. I have used them to make many new jewelry pieces for my collection. Nice and strong. Thank you for a great transaction.	1
Very good !  I will probably order larger ones.	1

These are great rings for holding charms.  I had 3 charms I wanted to keep together on a necklace and this would be the perfect kind of ring for all three. It's also great for keychains if ever needed.	1

If you want to throw your money away! These are the cheapest jump rings ever and my package was short over ten jump rings. The color was that weird off color gold that doesn't match the other gold components that you have.  BAD... CHEAP... GARBAGE	-1
Very happy with the product!	1
fix my own necklaces	1
Nice product.	1
love	1
Product is fine but took a long time to arrive.	1
love	1
As described and suited to my project, exactly what I needed.	1
Useful for jewelry making.	1
Change color after single use	-1
I thought 4mm would be bigger. I can't use them.  If you are looking for tiny jump rings they will work.	-1
These jump rings turn black from one day to another. they loose the gold plated and turn black very quickly.	-1
I had hoped for a lighter color. This is nothing like the color gold I use. Gave it away. Sorry, but would not recommend.	-1
I did not like this product.	-1
This Size Gauge Wire Is Another Staple To Have On Hand When Designing Jewelry. Great Price, Easy To Work With And The Item You Make, Makes It Look More Pricy!!	-1
1 star mainly because the photo showed does not match the product. The natural-looking figure shown on Amazon is what I wanted. The product I received was hideous - she looked like a monster that had fake boobs. Scary and vulgar. This product might be just perfect for someone drawing superheroes and the like. But it should not be presented as natural-looking. I'm one of several who made this comment - why is the vendor not updating the product photo? Also, paying $5 shipping plus $9 return shipping was super-annoying. PS. If it weren't for the false photo, I would give this 3-4 stars. Not because I would order it ever, but because the joints are moveable and it actually seems to be decent quality, in a quality package.	-1
It wasn't exactly the size we though. Not bendable enough.	-1
I feel as if I were short changed. Whenever I received my wire, I was excited until I realized that it was less than 5 ft, and it is not sterling silver.	-1
shorted me almost foot and half silver will not contact me told me eat it basicly	-1
Over priced but ok wire	-1
Incredibly difficult to use because poor machining has left most of these duller than a spoon, and the dental tools (hooks and picks) have burrs and other flashing on the tips rendering them nearly useless without some prior work. I would not recommend these.	-1
Not stainless steel. This keeps popping up in my search for scientific grade stainless steel carvers, and this listing has no warning about CA Proposition 65 warning in main description. I only found out after I received them. This is the second set of tools I've ordered like. You are probably better off paying the higher prices for a single tool if possible. These things are not only not worth the money, but a waste of time to deal with for me and for Amazon. Someone needs to check these before selling them. I tossed them, as well as the other set. I've been reading about people using them on as dental tools on the comments. Yikes! That's such a bad idea!	-1
Metal is so soft that several of the flat blades bent significantly just trying to shave off thin edge of a new micro-crystalline wax block. One more bend and they will fail. Tapered necks are poorly designed and way too thin. For the cost as an Amazon add-on item (<$8) I didn't expect too much... but I did expect to get a little longer use than I anticipate I will actually get. These are not in any way strong like dental picks. They are made in India. They will work on soft/ leather hard ceramics... I would personally not purchase again... Of the 24 tips on 12 tools... I can see that with care several of them will last making this a reasonable purchase for a very careful craftsman	-1
These tools are not finished well at all. Don't waste your money.	-1
Rusted, not stainless	-1
Toxic??!!!	-1
I bought these and didn't realize they had the California cancer warning on them . I had originally bought them to use for my weeding of vinyl. I did return them	-1
Cheap made, smells of chemicals ... Health hazard warning on label (chemicals). Not a high end product at all.	-1
I hate leaving low star reviews, but if this helps one person avoid what I went through, I'll consider it worthwhile.  I would highly recommend not purchasing these if you are new to sculpting.  There are plenty of heads available in this set, but the biggest problem I faced is that there are no tools to subtract clay (the medium I was using) from the model.  All of the tools with this set allowed you to cut, form, shape, etc, but nothing for removing clay - you're basically pushing clay around.  These were the first tools I purchased when I learned how to sculpt, and I got extremely frustrated, almost to the point of giving up.  If you are attempting to sculpt miniatures with this set, save yourself the headache, and don't.  Another issue is that they are metal, rigid, and pretty sharp. Therefore they leave a lot of undesirable tool marks in the sculpt.  I was able to get most of them out, but I could not finesse the clay I wanted because it was just pushing the clay around, rather than subtracting it from the model.  When working with softer clay, this can be extremely frustrating for beginners.  You see all these really clean sculpts online, and when yours looks like a hatchet was used, it can be very discouraging.  I didn't realize how big of an issue it was until I purchased a loop tool and ball stylus.  Talk about a night and day difference!  These are good tools to have around if you need them in a pinch, and the cost affords you the ability to purchase, try, and store until needed.  But if you are just starting out, use the money on some good loops and ball stylus tools.  Hours and hours of frustration can easily be avoided.  P.S. The HUGE warning on the side was also very discouraging as I wanted to sculpt with my 8 year old daughter.  But after that warning, um, no thanks!  How is that even allowed?	-1
What can I say.  These are made in China and made with cheap materials, but they will work fine for carving candles and soft materials.  A good value for the money.  The will rust if allowed to get wet.	-1
Simple review- my dad loved carving, but i bought these for cleaning. He found them and loved em, kept em. The tools are very sturdy for being so affordable, also come very sharp.	-1
I ordered these to sculpt polymer clay and they arrived today. I was not expecting much from them, considering the price, and I was right to be skeptical. At least 7 of the tools in my set have small black pock marks or other visible signs of wear.  They most definitely are not shiny and new. Almost every single tool has scuff marks on the tips like they've been rubbed with steel wool (see the product photos I added). The tips are supposed to be mirrored and shiny. They are not.  I am a little hesitant to even touch them because I do not know where they've been. I hope they have not been recycled from a dentist office and re-labeled for sale to the hobbyist market. The thin plastic roll-up bag say India on the outside and smells like a latex glove. I am going to throw away the bag and disinfect the tools in rubbing alcohol as a precaution.  I recommend against this set strongly.	-1
I should've looked at the one star reviews - these are magnetic and not soft, they're not sterling silver.	-1
I ordered them didn't get them so I reordered. Got empty package this time . Want order again buyers beware	-1
I paid for 100 and got maybe 30. These are ultra micro, but there is no way there are 100 in this bag.	-1
So tiny can't imagine them holding a bead in place .  This product packing says Sterling Silver .  Wish product was described better .  Maybe if they were described in American Measurements, I would of known how tiny they are.	-1
I like Liquidtex products and some of their other knives. The metal is usually very good. The long sides of this particular "painting knife" are not straight. The long sides are bowed out. Curved. This makes it very limited for knife painting because a straight thin edge of paint cannot be reliably applied to canvas without rocking the knife to compensate for the bow. This one slipped through the QC cracks. For the price, it just wasn't worth shipping it back. I trued the edges in my shop.	-1
About half didn't work after using once or twice.. Not a good product	-1
Sorry to say these were horrible. They are cheap, flimsy and a terrible color. Very fake looking... so I'd be interested in knowing what "gold" they used to plate these. Don't buy, they're craptastic.	-1
These are really small, so if your ears are tiny, they will work great.  I will use them for gifts, but they don't work for me.	-1
These leverback ear wires break too easily.  The metal is too thin for earrings.	-1
Too cheap, they broke easily while making earrings with these pieces.	-1
didn't like - looks cheap	-1
I opened 10 of them and none of them sprang back to original form.  Wish I didn't waste my money.  They are very thin and poorly made.	-1
when I received it, the color is way off from all my sliver. I cant use them at all. have to buy all new ones.	-1
not working well at all. Will try to return	-1
cheap and break easily	-1
Very disappointed with this order. These are not sterling silver as originally described.	-1
The quality is very poor, cheap findings	-1
These are very cheaply made. I can't even use them.  Waste of money.	-1
Awful, poorly stamped, unusable because all the edges are sharp and will cut the skin! The "post" part was too small to fit normal sized piercing	-1
They are too small for adult, and very flimsy and fragile,	-1
These are really small, too small for me, but I will use them for making earrings for young girls with little ears!  If I try to use them, they end up pinching me before I can get them fastened.	-1
they are ok. its pretty but very very cheap. i wish i could have seen it in person. they don't line up right when you shut them.	-1
I have medium ear lobes and they actually cup my ear lobes.  This makes them very difficult to put on.  The curved part, instead of coming out the back of the lobe, starts threading down into the lobe itself.  They need to be twice this size!	-1
Since I'm not making these earrings for myself I have to think of those who have a problem with metals. These are cheap and after reading the reviews I cannot honestly buy these and open heartily give or sell these to people. I've been looking for lever backs that are on the reasonable side but I decided it won't be these. So many ask for them but I can't do this to them. I sure there are better ones out there and Amazon will have them. The three stars are for the honest reviewers. We'll just say I'm getting old and don't know what I doith. Yeah I bought these and all I can say is I should have listened to the others reviewers. Like they say seeing is believing and it hurts. A year later. I've had customers bring them back saying why did you buy these they break too easy. One woman who likes lever backs and had me put them on 7 of her earrings I had made. She brought them all back asking me to put on new ones as these had all broke. I told her I didn't have any new ones and wouldn't put these back on. I should  have listened to the reviewers and I wouldn't have this problem. She settled with the hook kind but wasn't happy neither was I.	-1
Ok...so I never give bad reviews, however these are total CRAP!. First of all if I would have realized they shipped from China I would not have ordered them because they took forever to get. Second, they DON'T OPEN WITHOUT USING NEEDLE NOSE PLIERS!!!. I guess the saying you get what you pay for is in order here.	-1
I had to fish through the earring hooks to find matches among the pieces. Many of them had defects such as balls or springs missing, or busted hooks. I know they were cheap, and maybe consistency is something that was sacrificed to deliver the price point. Lesson learned.	-1
Nice but not happy that I got some without all the parts. 5 unusable	-1
Poor assembly. Half the ear hooks are missing spring and bead before the loop.	-1
I have had this item for almost two months.  It is suddenly un-treading itself via the needle every time I use it.  I have checked the tension in bobbin and ensured it is properly set at the top.  What use is a sewing machine that does not sew.  When this happened it was to late to return it.  I will take it to a Singer dealer to see if it can be repaired.  I bought it for portable use and cannot use.  Very dissatisfied.	-1
Had to return it. Couldn't get bobbin to load properly	-1
The photo shows the flat area of the French Wire Earring Hooks flat, clean & clear; however, that isn't what they send you!  I received crappy little ear wires with WRITING ON BOTH SIDES OF THE FLAT AREA!  I can't use this in my jewelry!  That is plain dishonest!  They should be made to either change the photo in the description or agree to send the ear wires that are in the photo!  We customers HAVE to trust the Sellers or Amazon won't work!	-1
These did not stick very well.  I used them to hang battery style tea lights from a dollhouse ceiling.  Whenever I would pull them off, the Velcro came off also.	-1
The "S" size Faber Castell black artist pen was only used for a minute or two at most and is already dried up. I always cap my pens when they are not in use. The other 3 pens are fine but this one is apparently defective. Will you please replace it with one that works?	-1
how many stars are appropriate for a product where one of the items doesn't work? the Small nib-pen is dry. so now i have to buy more. so for that i am only awarding 2 stars. otherwise it seems like a lovely product.	-1
Pens dried out upon first use.	-1
Ran out too quickly for me.  I'm going back to my ink pen with filler.	-1
I can live without this. The round and the oval bead part do fine, but the third one (can't remember which shape it is now) just doesn't do the job. I tried it out but that's the only time I've used it. i thought it was such a great idea and it is -  just didn't pan out the way i wanted it to.	-1
POOR QUALITY! This is the second DEFECTIVE Craft Clay Machine that I received. The metal in front of the machine (near the roller) is separated. The separated metal is extremely dangerous. It is possible to accidentally slash your hand on the exposed metal edges while trying to condition the clay.	-1
It was broke when it got here.	-1
I should have listened to the reviews here. I bought this piece of junk at Michael's using a 50% coupon, thinking that it should last at least 6 months or so. The handle falls off constantly. After just a few weeks of using it, it starting making a funny noise. Then, it started to jam, now the gears are stripped.  Save your money and buy a better brand.	-1
I thought would be a better product considering Amaco is a pretty good brand, but this has been a disappointment. When you roll something, it leaves a mark on the product and also makes this raspy sound that makes me believe is not working properly. It's not "soft" like the one I use to have, which by the way, was any pasta machine with no brand at all and it was pretty cheap. Also, the handle seems to not fit well and it never stays on the machine, I keep bothering my neighbors downstairs because always falls. Honestly, I believed I was going to have a better product. It makes the job, but could be much better.	-1
The description said "Like new". There is no manual and the roller is dirty. I know it was very inexpensive, but I assumed the product would be described honestly or I would have been happy to spend more money.	-1
I wish they were minus  stars.  I purchased this machine in may but was ill and wasn't able to use it until a few days ago, September. My chance to return it was up in June so I'm sick with this non functioning piece of junk.  One lady said it's easy if you read the directions and that the machine is really self explanatory.  I agree, BUT understanding how it works is not the problem.  The handle falls off constantly and the thickness dial won't move at all.  So the thinnest setting is the only one usable.  Upon discovering that, I didn't even waste clay going any father.  It is an inferior product.  I am on a limited budget and thought I was getting something usable.  Now because I wasn't able to use it within a time limit I'm stuck with a  useless item that has never been used that will have to go in the trash can.  It would be nice if companies still took pride in making quality products and not just pushing out junk to make money.	-1
Don't buy this! This is the third clay roller I've bought all the same brand, had the first one for about 6 months, second 3 months, and the third one 2 days! I am going back to Michales to return it and get my money back.	-1
This really doesn't create smooth sheets.  it comes out chunky and broken.  Plus the vice used to secure to the counter for stability does not work well at all.	-1
Nice try but really,you'll die of aggrevation. Great price, of course. ok for experimentation with pasta machines but you will not get a quality product from this machine. Too many problems. Appreciate the effort on the part of this company to sell an affordable pasta machine in case you don't want to make a large investment but mostly helpful for knowing what not to get and in what ways you should upgrade/invest if you're a serious artisan. Shop around	-1
This machine was terrible for polymer clay. The spacing wheel was hard to turn, the rollers themselves were defiant at best, and it turned out a fairly rough-looking piece of clay. It felt cheap, in that it made all kinds of noise while rolling the clay, and I wasn't impressed with how difficult it was to adjust the spacing wheel.  I returned this machine and found a gently used 1987 Atlas 150 pasta machine on Ebay, and it is sublime.	-1
Waste of money, broke after 2 months	-1
I bought what I thought was a new machine. It is horrible, it came to me dirty. Black and white clay which got on my product. Grrr and the handle keeps coming of with little effort. I would never ever recommend this product and if I could I'd get my money back. Didn't even come with any paperwork. Very disappointed customer!!!	-1
Do not buy this cheaply made inferior product !! I read the negative reviews and still bought this product, and returned it because it was even worse than reviewed previously.	-1
I rarely write a review but I felt I had to this time.  I purchased this at my local Michaels Craft store and it lasted about 10 minutes!  I rolled one small piece of clay after getting it conditioned cut it was so uneven an had deep ridges on both sides.  I then tried another and it would not even roll through no matter what I tried.  I boxed it up and returned it today.  I purchased a different brand from Hobby Lobby that was twice the price but well worth it. So far so good	-1
This thing is trash.  It squeaks, creates lumpy product, and the gears shatter easily.  I've got two of them (gifts) and the first one is completely unusable now.	-1
I also bought this from a craft store.  Bad product!  Poor quality; handle falls off, you could cut yourself on one of the edges.  Will return, but wouldn't you know I can't find the sales slip?	-1
So far disappointed...waiting on replacement that is due tomorrow.	-1
I purchased this while out on vacation to have something to do, I have a different brand at my home. For 26.99 I think it was cheap, I pulled it out of the box and it stopped working. So I took it apart to figure out what was wrong with it; bottom line it is too much of a pain in the butt to try to fix.	-1
I also bought this machine at Michael's craft store, The handle falls off every time we use it, even multiple times during one roll. The dial doesn't always change the thickness in the rollers. It's total crap.	-1
I bought this the other day at Michael's because I wanted a way to get SMOOTH, EVEN sheets of clay. When I took it out of the box, and inserted the crank, I gave it a couple of turns and it made an awful clicking sound, which already had me worried that it wasn't going to have a smooth enough action to achieve the result I was going for. I was right! I sent my clay through, and it came out the other side with little ridges 1/4 apart from each other all the way up and down the sheet. I returned it that night.	-1
This machine is cheap and, as the old adage goes, you get what you pay for. These are made for polymer, but doesn't mean anything more than the name. I've gone through these like tissues before I woke up and ordered a pasta machine to dedicate to my polymer. The rollers often have tiny streaks that you don't see until you run clay through them - one side of the clay sheets always has fine lines. These are also not meant to be taken apart to be cleaned, which, no matter how careful you are, you will get clay building up inside the machine! Take it apart, put it together again and the thickness settings are never what they used to be. At the very edges of the rolling tubes, they must oil the mechanics before putting it together, but because any clay that touches the edges of the machine usually comes out of the machine with smears and flecks of black muck.  This is a good tool for a beginner or children who just want to play, but I would not recommend it for more than that.	-1
Reasonably priced--good for a beginner, but brushes are stiff, bushy and fall out--even on the canvas while you're painting.  If you get this, best to find a better set.	-1
Cheaply made and limited variety	-1
I was very disappointed with the contents of this kit. The wire and string included were cheaply made and barely enough to do much.  I wouldn't suggest investing in this product.	-1
As a 4th grade school teacher, I had high hopes for this product!  The first sharpening worked great!  Whoo hoo!  The second one worked great!  Then they went downhill from there.  I didn't even take this to school!  The kids didn't even touch this. This sharpener is worthless.  Thankfully, Amazon gave me a full refund.	-1
I didn't like the way it was set up.	-1
The picture shows what happens when I wet the 1/2" wash brush and drag it across a surface. These brushes don't hold their shape at allor some of them are at the other extreme, and it's like trying to paint with a fork. To say nothing of the hairs shedding all over the place. Even for cheap, you can do way better than this.	-1
broke in couple months.	-1
Brushes are low quality and bristles come off regularly on canvas when trying to paint.	-1
worthless, bristles fell out of 3 of them after first use and rinse! surprised loew-cornell would put their name on such a poor product	-1
Please spend just a little bit more on better brushes. Most of these are small round brushes, which is okay. The few large brushes that are in the package fall apart, the ferrule falls off, the bristles fall out...you will HAVE to buy new ones anyway.	-1
ok for an in-expensive set	-1
I would say a good half of the paint brushes the tips were hard and unusable. At the time I had no option but to use them. The ones with the blue handles were perfect, but the rest I pretty much ended up having to throw away because it was like there was glue on the end of the brush.	-1
these are crap	-1
I use their gold and works really good but this sliver color is very dull	-1
TINY TINY BOTTLES.	-1
There are less expensive sets for beginning artists, which I assume this is the target market, because there ISN'T ENOUGH PAINT to do any serious work.  The paint is a standard and the colors are nice but it is grossly overpriced for what it is.  A person interested in painting as a beginner or otherwise should look else where.  Amazon is making a real effort to provide a wide range of economical supplies to artists and is presenting a real challenge to the other online vendors of art supplies.  I am well pleased by my purchases of art supplies from Amazon and this product should be dropped to keep up the high standard.	-1
The paint is clumpy when you try to use it as an acrylic, the paint doesn't go far AT ALL, you put paint on the brush and you can only make a stroke about an inch or two. You HAVE to add water to them, and when you do, it doesn't even look like a nice watercolor, the paint still doesn't spread well and it's still gloppy in some areas, I HATED THESE, WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY! I'm sticking to good old Apple Barrel acrylic paints!	-1
They're don't like the picture. I can't find a special bead like a golden ball, like a snow or a red flower. Also I didn't see those beautiful beads like other buyers received. They're just very common round beads. So I am very disappointed! I think I will not buy them again.	-1
A bunch of unusable ugly beads thrown together.  Was very disappointed.	-1
I just wanted to mention that if you get some red shiny beads... they will discolor on your skin. The whole mix is a bad gamble.	-1
I have order this product several times.  The last two times I have ordered it, I was very disappointed. There were broken beads and things in it I don't even know what they were.  I will not order from them again	-1
my beads were ugly...like 2 that I've actually used	-1
Wow wish I had read the reviews a little closer, This is the most unusable  pile of junk I have ever seen, looks like the bought yard sale jewelry and broke it up. large pieces of melted glass that I have no idea what it is. so don't waist your time.	-1
the bag broke and my beeds are scattered from the wear house to here . Supose to be half pound got three beads the package will not hold loose beads	-1
This used to be a good mix and a good quantity when I ordered in in the past. I just received a very small baggie (filled by Uncommon Artistry). It was about 1/4 the amount of beads that should make up a Mr. Kitty Big Bead Bonanza. The baggie included: heavy strand of chip beads - that was more than half of the total bag size and weight, gold colored cheap earring wires, clear bugle beads, and maybe 100 misc. beads mostly cheap rust colored, and a hideous monkey charm that looks like it came from a vending machine. What you expect with Mr. Kitty is the fun of sorting through the beads, culling a few good glass beads, maybe some metal beads, or pendant. And, then you figure you get some kind of less spectacular filler beads and some stuff to throw away. Of course some of it will be junk and that's the fun. What isn't fun is when ALL of it is junk and that's the case now.	-1
I bought these out of curiosity. Not curious anymore. If you are experienced in the art of beading, stay away. If this was a gift for a young person interested in a hobby I would say good start. Around 12 or older, not recommended for younger children. It's a inexpensive way to see if they will like it or not. You seasoned beaders, definitely not for you. Hope this will help everyone!	-1
My bag was full of broken glass beads, a lot of plastic beads, wooden beads that have seen better days, odd ear wires that didn't match, purple cord, cheap-looking metal dog-tag-like beads, mismatched seed beads and other unusable items that the Seller could not sell.  I understand the concept of random, but there should be some system in place to make sure that when you take people's money they get at least some satisfaction from their purchase.  I feel completely ripped off.	-1
I can't believe I wasted $8.99 on this! It's a ziplock with a million of those teenie tiny beads! That's the first problem but before I get to that the way this was described it sounded so nice inside this bag of junk are about 6-8 misc stones and to be honest there. Not to nice! I'm not wasting anymore money to send these back. What kills me is reading the description one would think this would be nice. I'm really bummed as I thought I'd get something nice. It says they have such fun and they pack each bead by hand! I don't believe that! This bag looks like someone went to the dollar store and bought cheap trash beads and dumped them. If I posted a pic y'all would trip!! UGLY!!!! If a proper order replacement would be sent and if it looks nice I will take this post down!	-1
only a few good beads in here, most of the others are just plain crappy. I've had these about 4 months and have only used 4 beads from the lot!	-1
I am very disappointed with what I received. There are a lot of plastic beads, a piece of hemp string, some plastic faceted type beads resembling flowers or diamonds that are all scratched and just generally junk. Lots of tiny beads too that can not even be used for anything. Do not order this if you expect anything of value. It might be good for kids but it is more suited for Mr. Kitty's litter box than anything else.	-1
Most of the beads were broken and a lot of them were plastic. I gave them 2 stars because there were a few beautiful beads, but mostly it was junk.	-1
I ALREADY HAVE ENOUGH JUNK BEADS. I SURE DID NOT NEED MORE! LOOK AROUND FOR BETTER QUALITY BEADS. PLASTIC?? NO THANKS.	-1
I received several baggies of these.  I am throwing most away. Dozens of vinyl butterflies, little plastic multicolored bicones, vinyl "millifiori" TONS of ugly plastic globes that I found out are called "Evil Eye".  The majority of the glass beads are "cane" or "tube" beads, not cut off evenly at either end! Not smoothed, more like snapped off.  Every time I plucked something up that looked promising, upon close inspection it had problems. Holes not throughly drilled, or crooked, bumps, dings. Look at the beads that jewelry is comprised of today, and these stones are not what is popular... they are outdated. The semi-precious gemstone beads were all imperfect in one way or the other.	-1
I really had high hopes when I ordered Mr Kitty's assortment, but I must say I'm very disappointed in the mix I received.  There were several broken beads and very few matches to be found in the entire bag.  I think I salavaged about 20 items (including earring hooks!) and the rest of the mix is just sitting in a refuse pile waiting for a suitable project.  Considering the cost and what I managed to use, this mix was not a good bargain.  It deserves the same fate as what you'd scoop out of your cat litter box!	-1
Crumbles, does not remain on paper. Only dust! It is dangerous, because you breathe! I did not like!	-1
I found out they were not the round sticks with pointed ends.  I will look better next time.	-1
I received my pastels yesterday and immediately tried the dark brown one. I used a plain piece of regular paper. I was extremely disappointed to see that the customer reviews that stated the color pigments did not stay on the paper were true. First I colored on the paper using dark brown then I used my finger to smudge, wanting to see the effect. The result was that there was no color at all left to see. Will return the product.	-1
First of all, when I purchased them the box contained only 35 sticks even though it was sealed and brand new. I contacted the Reeves customer service which never responded to my email. But I also don't like the pastels or the color assortment. Maybe they change the color selection but I only got several really bright and unnatural green shades so I have to try to mix colors constantly just to get a natural green. I also don't like the pastel quality. They barely adhere to the paper even though I use paper recommended for pastels. The pigment and pastel particles are all over the place but not on the paper so that I get only very light colors on the paper. For me, this was a total waste of money and a very frustrating experience since I had pastels before that I loved and these don't give me any satisfaction. I will order Faber Castell now and donate these.	-1
As others have said, not quite what i wanted.  Finger holes to small, and they have a rough thick feel to the movement.  We have a pair that i thought we were replacing, but our pair even though the same size are smooth as glass to operate and have much larger finger holes.  These seem to be the same sharpness but that is about all.  Trying to figure how to return them.	-1
I tried these scissors and had to return them ... well, exchange them (at my local jo ann) ... they are really uncomfortable to use. The blades are much thicker than they appear and don't seem like embroidery scissors to me. Besides that, I bought them, against my better judgement, at full price (maybe that's why I didn't like them :).. I took them back two days later when I found out my local store was having a 50% off sale on scissors (and other stuff) and got the 5" knife edge pair ... eh, still not real impressed, but do like them better. They are like mini-duckbills. Still they are awkward feeling in my hand.  Generally speaking, I wouldn't recommend these scissors. If you can get to target, go to the scrapbooking section and get a pair of pink or yellow ones they have. You want to talk SHARP scissors and FINE POINTS ... and CHEAP. I have two pair.	-1
I'm so disappointed in these scissors.  I thought they should be good, but they don't cut evenly or cleanly.  I'm not sure what I'll do.  I need to try some other scissors.  They are, at least, better than the other scissors I have.	-1
Just awful!!  The blade were dull as a butter knife, had a huge gap between the blades when closed, and couldn't cut fabric at all.  I just couldn't believe it.  The box said they were made in Italy, not Mexico, so I was surprised by the problems, but I sent these scissors back.	-1
these where great when I received them the nut fell out in the middle of cutting out a light cotton fabric thought maybe they just needed sharpening after replacing the nut took them in and the sewing shop said they where not able to align them so I am just  out thought that because they where gingers they would be good Buyer beware.  Also this pair was made in Mexico not Italy did not notice this until the nut dropped out have not been able to contact seller	-1
I'm a self taught newbie to the world of quilting/sewing (about 2 years into it :-)  I depend so much on reviews of products and I must say although excellent reviews from various sources on Gingher shears and having had the opportunity to borrow a pair from a girlfriend and being impressed.  I'm highly disappointed in this purchase thru Amazon.  After spending (literally) days going back and forth trying to decide on the best pair of scissors/shears  and fallen in love with the pair of Gingher dress makers that were borrowed to me to try.  I finally decided on these Gingher Knife-edge Dressmaker shears and was so excited that not only did I find a SMOKIN' deal but that I was able to get them the next day (paid for expedited 1-day shipping)  MAN WHAT A BIG FAT DISSAPPOINTMENT!  Although I was careful to read reviews and description carefully to be certain I was getting the exact ones that I'd been fortunate to borrow and that were rated so highly even by the professionals .  Now to the details...  these Gingher Knife-edge Dressmaker shears were considerably lighter than the borrowed pair I'd had in my hands(and fell in ' with)  the weight difference was enough to compare to a cheap reproduction :-( they are extremely rigid and tight making it difficult to cut ANYTHING with out grabbing, pinching and binding the fabric.  I tested on several fabroc scraps including  TULLE- - what shears can not make a decent cut thru these?!?! would have been a decent cut if the scissors were not so difficult to open and close. Which just tore the fabric up.  QUILTING COTTON- Again so rigid and just grabbed and held onto the fabric.  However I could cut thru with using the tip and making several cuts in a straight line.  DUCK CLOTH-  Just the normal (on the cheap side) Duck was to thick for these shears which resulted in again having to only use the tip or opening the scissors and placing fabric in the V of the blades  SKIN/MINKY- FORGET ABOUT IT!  PLEATHER- Which was just a bit thicker than the cotton. And the scissors were so rigid and tight that when trying to make a test cut it just tore it up.  I'm sorry guys again I'm new to this sewing "thing" and no up to date on the lingo.  I hope that my details in this review makes sense :-)  Conclusion-  While I was so excited to have a pair of these to call my own I'm NOT one but impressed and I'm not hard to impress.  I can not think of a single good quality on these shears and would highly recommend looking into other options for the money.  These are going straight back where they came from and I will resume my quest for a good pair of shears.  Also note that these came in extremely cheap packaging, what you'd expect from the dollar store or big box retailer.  Upon further review of packaging looking for warranty contact information I discovered these are "Manufactured for FISKARS BRAND INC. 2537 DANIELS STREET MADISON, WI 53718 1-800-348-5661"  Please see photos for visual packaging	-1
Returned these they weigh more than I do	-1
Did not last very long when using daily. Too lightweight.	-1
Gingher has a good reputation for fine shears, but the ones that I ordered were definitely not an example of their better workmanship.  The shears arrived with scratches and burrs on the blades.  The scissors are not usable - they don't close properly and the defects in the blades make it impossible to cut, shear or trim anything. When I contacted the seller to return the shears they refused to address the problem or provide information on returns - they stated that their products have a fine reputation.  Buyer beware - by all means, purchase Gingher shears, but be well aware that if you receive a defective pair, this seller will take your money and run.	-1
I had asked the country of origin on these. I received different answers (Germany, Switzerland and Italy) but all were acceptable.  After receipt I find that they are marked "Made in China".  That is not acceptable to me so I will be returning them.	-1
My Gingher 8 Inch Knife Edge Bent Trimmers stained or rusted (can't tell). They're fine other than that, I suppose.	-1
i don't think i've ever written a negative review on something purchased on Amazon.  I've had my Gingher scissors about 3 1/2 years.  I used them for applique for one project about 2 years ago.  They have been stored in my studio far away from water.  When I pulled them out for another applique project this morning, I found that the blades had rusted. I was stunted.  I've had them too long to be able to return them.  My loss.	-1
I decided to try this kind of applique scissor since it seems to be a popular type and it had great reviews. I also love the brand Gingher, so I was hoping I would like these. Unless your applique design is rather large with nothing but straight lines, I found them nearly impossible to use. They weren't easy to use when cutting 95% of my applique fabric, as they were just too big.	-1
Ideal for applique work and rug making. The paddle-shaped blade pushes away the bottom layer of fabric for flawless controlled, cuts close the stitching. The offset handle allows for a comfortable hand position above the work surface. A double-plated chrome finish over nickel is both handsome and durable. Scissors come in a beautiful tin storage case with a burgundy mold fitted to the scissors' profile. My ginghers are special scissors I do not buy them without a case. It clearly states they come in a tin. Where is my tin?? Mine came in a molded plastic box, not the type you can store them in, protect, or treat as special. This puts them in the same category as the disposable ones (I've probably have 20-30 of them lying around the house) That is way too much to pay for one of them. I am disappointed in Amazon for not advertising something clearly not as represented.	-1
I am actually a little bit disappointed about the quality of this product. Gingher has a great reputation, but the scissors do not seem all that high-quality. The thumb/finger opening is tiny. I do not have "sausage fingers" yet I cannot comfortably hold these scissors. I think I will go with the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Gingher-01-005271-Large-Handle-Embroidery-Scissors-4-Inch/dp/B000UUABHM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Gingher 01-005271 Large Handle Embroidery Scissors, 4-Inch</a>&nbsp;instead as the reviews seem so much better. Frankly, these stork scissors will be passed onto my 9 year-old daughter who is learning to sew/embroider.	-1
Very disappointing. I have a different pair of Gingher scissors that I've cherished for years. This pair doesn't cut well, and the tips are curved right out of the package. The very first time I used them, a piece of metal from one of the blades was apparently shorn off by the other blade. The handles cross over themselves as well. Very uncomfortable, too small, and just crap quality. I agree with other reviews, these feel like a knockoff.	-1
Appears to have been sitting around for a while ,scratched and glue dots on back won't come off	-1
work on the design  did not make a Dresden plate match had to work on the circle and tried the seam allowance to get it right and was not happy with the end results.  So I would not recommend this unless you want to spend hours making samples.	-1
The picture showed it would come with a bamboo tool; I ordered two for my members of my quilt group, Mahogany Thread, and when the product arrived it contained only the acrylic templates. Needless to say I was disappointed to hand them half of the expected product!	-1
Yeah, it's thick, but is 100% polyester.  Not sure it will work well, as poly thread easily breaks.  Hence two stars, pending usage.	-1
This machine has already stopped embroidering. I have only had it since March of this year, (2013). I sent the embroidery unit in for repair and the service guy I had to ship it to said it is in the machine. I thought that Singer was a good product! Boy was I wrong! Don't buy this machine!!!!!!	-1
I ordered this machine to replace my old Singer CE-150 when it died. I figured that I would go up one level with this one. When I received it, very quickly I must say, I tested it all out. The sewing quality seemed to be good and I loved all the decorative stitches it had but when I got to testing the embroidery it failed.  I have been using a very similar machine for 5 year so I know how to get good results out of one of these machines and I just couldn't.  There was nothing I could do to adjust it so that the bobbin thread did not show a lot on the top... I really tried because I wnated it to work.  Sadly I finally had to accept the fact that this machine was never going to be "right" so i sent it back. I am very happy with how easy it was to return it to Amazon and that is one of the reasons I continue to shop at Amazon.com.	-1
All I hear from this stupid thing is beep beep beep!!  I think I know what I'm doing as I've been sewing for quite a few years.  And then the stupid thing doesn't even tell you what's wrong.  All it does is beep and then stop, beep and stop.  OMG!  I hate this machine.  And the plate under the needle is raised up and provides a wonderful "bump" for you to move the fabric over.  I'm going to get rid of this and go back to the basic machine.  I wanted an embroidery machine, but this one sucks!!!	-1
I was disappointed to find that removable meant, it doesn't work for much. I grabbed it as the first "adhesive" i had on hand, to make a gift bag... And the whole thing fell apart, I had to reglue everything	-1
This only works with thin slick paper.  It did not work on cardstock.  If you want to do card making, pick the Elmer tape version with high tack.	-1
It broke after 1/2 a use....	-1
First, let me say that I have a great deal of respect for the Tombow brand having used (and loved) a great many of their art products, but this was a huge waste.  The tape guard doesn't really guard anything as there's a gaping hole behind the cover itself which allows dust to get in. Plus it barely stays locked in place when closed.  But the biggest disappointment was its use: it doesn't actually hold two pieces of paper together, much less a photo to scrapping paper.  I tried several types of paper, including plain printer/copy paper, and everything either fell apart or could easily be peeled apart. I figured maybe it needed to cure overnight. Nope--if anything, that only made the bond weaker.  On a positive note, it is incredibly easy to use.	-1
Never worked.	-1
Falls apart easily.	-1
I don't know how it does adhering paper to paper.  I mostly adhere card stock to card stock and it does not hold.  I am not talking construction but putting decorative panels of card stock onto boxes made with card stock.  I use the Tombow liquid glue and tear tape for construction. I used a layer of this product all around the edges as well as in the center of the card stock panels, pressed firmly and left them to cure before messing with them.  When I checked them, I could see all the corners were lifted off the base paper.  I easily pulled back the panels and used the liquid glue to re-adhere.  I will go back to using Crafter's Companions roll on adhesive.  I liked how smoothly the glue rolled on but if it doesn't hold, it doesn't matter how it applies.	-1
I use adhesive rollers for making greeting cards.  I have given Tombow a try twice with bad results.  It seems to clump coming off the roller, when you can get it to roll!  Sometimes the roller gets stuck and attempts to unstick it usually results in the "tape" getting twisted.  For me, I'll stick to the Scotch dot roller, even though it costs more.	-1
Am not at all thrilled with this purchase.  I have used Tombo adhesive for years and I thought I was purchasing the same kind I am used to buy.  This one is different.  The tape most of the time does not have much adhesive on it and it is a pain to use.  I wish I had returned it sooner so I didn't have them here being wasted.  Maybe I will try to return and see  if I can get the original kind I used to purchase.	-1
The applicator is good, but this adhesive is very tacky and sticks to everything, above and beyond your project.  Leaves a residue which is annoyingly persistent and hard to get rid of.  Moving back to the green version.	-1
adhesive is good. dispensor doesn't work well	-1
This product is not all that sticky.  Papers I try to stick together (cards, envelopes, etc) tend to fall apart. Fairly disappointing.	-1
it is ok	-1
Works well for temporarily holding items in place or holding very light items permanently. Must use a lot of product for heavier card stock. Tape is long gone with only one small project. Wasteful and too expensive.	-1
Worked great in the beginning but by the fifth time the tape got tangled and then it would no longer advance. Can't get it to work and I only used a little of it.	-1
This product disappointed me because it kept breaking and I had no choice but to throw the cartridge away.	-1
I was a loyal, and I mean LOYAL buyer of this product for so many years I can't count. I've been scrapbooking for 20 years. Tombow changed their permanent adhesive maybe 2 years ago, and it was never the same. I would create a page and the next day, everything had popped up. It did NOT stick. I was sooooooooo disappointed. My Tombow items I made over 10 years ago are still intact but the new ones? Nope. I contacted the company numerous times and never received a response, which was disheartening. I've heard the same complaints from long-time users as well. Now, I haven't bought one in well over a year now, so maybe they've improved it back to the original formula. I hope so because this one is pathetic.	-1
I'm trying to get into scrapbooking and needed a permanent glue without the mess of using a liquid glue.  Thought this would be a good option.  Was very conservative using the Tombow tape only applying glue on the edges of 4 pieces of scrapbook papers 8X11 sheets and then the glue RAN OUT!  I know 5 bucks is not much for many folks out there, but I would have expected this to last longer than it did.  I should have bought the Scotch ATG tape glider - last longer and has great reviews.  This applicator is convenient since it is small and fits in the hand BUT the glue ribbon doesn't stay in the center of the dispenser, it glides and bunches from one side to the other side (and then jamming) not applying the glue evenly on the paper.  If you need a permanent adhesive, keep looking...I'm sure there's something better out there.	-1
No matter how I hold the dispenser or what pressure I apply, this skips and the adhesive pulls back up more often than not.  I love the Tombow glue in a bottle, but can't recommend this adhesive applicator.	-1
the glue is bad! it doesn't glue cardstock paper, each item i tried to glue fall apart. it was a big disappointment.	-1
I'm probably one of the few people who hate this product.  I like the way the tape dispenser feels in my hand, and it IS very sticky, but...  The tape kept twisting so the sticky stuff that went on my card was a very skinny strip. After having this happen to me with THREE different runners, I determined what caused the problem: it doesn't work when trying to go around curved shapes. Specifically, I was using the runner around a circle - every single time, the runner messed up. On one of the dispensers, I was able to straighten the tape, but it wouldn't wind properly (I had to use a screw driver to manually wind it - a big waste of my time.) With a new dispenser, I am able to do straight line gluing only; I don't use it for going around curved shapes - problem solved, huh?  I will never buy this product again, no matter how sticky it may be! I love the Therm-O-Web product and will go back to using it and save this one for "straight line gluing."	-1
When I first used this dispenser, it worked great but the more I used it, the adhesive would not come out of the dispenser.  It got to the point where the wheels wouldn't even tighten  the ribbon anymore and would just unravel.  I do not buy this product again.	-1
I would not recommend this product.  It breaks very easily.  And i can't figure out how to fix it.  Initially it worked fine and I loved it.  But after a few tries the tape broke.  To bad it seems like it would be a great product.	-1
Yikes! This stuff is hard like string..not exactly yarn...like dried up kite string...lol! Nope, I do not reccomend... except to tie to a kite maby. I will use it to tie up tomato plants I guess.	-1
Color Runs or Bleeds!  I made two dish/wash cloths and when I used them the red color bled or ran into the cream color making it pink and the dishcloth left my wash water pink!  I like the yarn weight and it made up nicely but gave it a one star because even after several washes and then actually soaking in bleach water the red color runs.  It's very faded looking now because I bleached it and it still turns the water pink.  So I surely can't give anything made with this "holiday stripe" as a gift since it could ruin their laundry if thrown in the wash.  I also ordered two other colors at the same time as I ordered the "holiday stripe" but don't know if they will run or not.	-1
After reading some of the reviews here, I decided to purchase this. The ball is the size of my fist (was expected a full-sized product) and it lacked the softness others were stating here. It's very wooly and grainy.	-1
I ordered a hip curve ruler I don't know what this is	-1
sooooooo smalllllllllll omg	-1
The outside box was broken when I received it.  It was not worth the hassle of returning it.  I have several of the same box which really works quite well.	-1
Love the painting. The only thing that is kinda a pain is all the mixing of colors you need. But other than that it comes with everything. When I received this kit and opened the paints most of them were so lumpy it made it very hard to paint.	-1
I am used to Venture Tape but bought this brand because it was on Prime and I needed foil right away. It is so thin and tears easily. It easily folds into itself. All in all, I wouldn't ever buy this brand again.	-1
I tried this foil as well as the silver backed one because it was easier to get a hold of at hobby lobby. I should have just paid the expense of ordering a different kind online as this stuff is crap.  It does NOT stay stuck to the glass during soldering. I made stained glass snow flakes and had to end up telling people to just supper glue pieces back together after they came apart. It was VERY embarrassing when people pulled me aside at a unit function for my husbands unit in the Army at Christmas to tell me about the issues with the ornaments that where given as gifts to our fellow soldiers.  I followed all recommended steps for using this specific type of foil and it just does not work out well.	-1
For some reason the copper does not stick to the glass.  My other copper does.  Would recommend purchasing at a stain glass place.	-1
They are relatively inexpensive and generally useful, but tend to bow and bend with use. If you are a dedicated knitter, rosewood or another harder wood is a better bet.	-1
I purchased this item cause I thought it is smaller according to the picture. Size in photo shows it like a small one but it is big.	-1
Too small	-1
I was so excited to buy this. A friend gave me a $100 Amazon gift card for Christmas and I used it just for this. I didn't realize it was a third party though so shipping took longer than my Prime account and it came from UK. I tried reading instructions but that didn't work so well so I watched u-tube videos. Unfortunately, Prym is popular in Europe and most videos were in Italian or another language I didn't understand. I did find that there are other knitting machines that are very similar and the videos were in English so I watched about 10 of them. Still the machine kept dropping stitches and sticking occasionally as if it were starting to break. When I decided to return it I found out that shipping would be $280!! Thank goodness Amazon is such a great company and did stand behind me with their A toZ Guarantee. I would not recommend unless you are SURE you want this brand, from this manufacturer and that you live closer to the UK.	-1
Wouldn't order again	-1
too hard to use	-1
I guess the quality is in line with the price, but I would not recommend this wood grainer.  The handle did not stay in the hole at all; not for one minute.  I ended up tossing it and holding the "head" of the grainer and rocking it with my thumbs slightly as I used it.  The rubber "grain" looked fine once mastered, but overall it was a one-use, low-quality item.  If your project is anything more than simply for fun, purchase a better grainer so you don't have to fuss around with it to make it work correctly.	-1
These are not as firm as I expected for the application I am using them for. A Q-Tip would work better	-1
While these definitely won't cut clothing or hair they are hard to use even on paper.  You can cut through one piece as long as it's not a thick piece of paper.  The children don't like to use them	-1
All pans where broken to dust not happy returning	-1
These don't look like watercolors at all. Just your basic brush tip marker. They bleed though paper quite easily, The colors are not your standard range either. While they do look nice, and are easy to use, I was not really satisfied.	-1
Seem great until the run out in very few uses. there is a reason they seem like the best deal ever for tho style brush pen	-1
markers arrived dry	-1
It doesnt seem to want to stand up, tips over easy.	-1
pins for thread not long enough had to return it.	-1
Falls over often spilling the spools all over the floor. I wish there was a way for these people to put a little more effort in their design so that the spools could be secure if the rack were to lose it's balance and fall (like this one does often). Do more research for DIY options of storing your spools and you will have a head ache free solution.	-1
Threadart (seller): you really need to redo your measurements & fix the item description/photo. This review is for the 120 spool rack, now the listing is only showing the 60 spool rack. When it was the 120 spool rack, it also showed a photo of many 1100 yard spools on the rack, all fit nicely side by side, bottoms not overlapping. So I took a chance on ordering this. My review: minus one star for wrong measurements, minus one star because you say it will fit the 1100 yard mini king spools, minus one star for sloppy workmanship. The item stated "...15" x 24", with 1.5" between wood dowels". My rack is 15.5" by 26.25", with no more than 15.38" between dowels, most having only 1.25" between. Granted each thread manufacturer has small differences in the size of their plastic bottoms for the 1100 yard spools, but since I've tried 3 different brands & none of them can stand side by side on your thread rack... your rack is not made adequately spaced to hold these. The wood dowels are not all installed straight, & this rack cannot stand away from the wall due to one leg being a little shorter than the other. So it must lean against the wall. I'll add my voice to many other reviews: please remake this to incorporate a way to hang it, while I can figure out a way to do this it would be ever so much easier if you included a crossbar at the top from which to nail or screw this in. Even a set of triangular metal picture hangers on the back at the top of the vertical bracings would be an improvement. I am keeping this, see my photo on how to solve the thread storage problem: alternate the threads right side up & upside down. Not as pretty as all right side up, but it works.	-1
I don't need this item and don't like the idea of having to pay to have it returned. I will be careful NOT to purchase anything from this seller.	-1
My order arrived with some spool holders snapped off.  I kept it but wish I had gone with a hardier unit. My spools frequently jump off and the legs don't extend back quite enough for the unit to want to remain upright. This might be fine for regular sewing thread or bobbins but not at all for large spools or embroidery cones.	-1
It does the job.  I wish it was hangable.  I looked for ways to hang it, but I might need really big hooks for that.	-1
The pegs on this thread spool holder are too thick to allow spools to be put on it.  I returned them for credit.  I don't know what kind of thread this outfit that made this was anticipating using, but doesn't fit the normal of any thread spools that I use.	-1
I ordered this because it seemed like it would be helpful and allow me to organize thread. It does do that, BUT, it falls over very easily scattering spools of thread all over. There should be some way to keep it from doing this. I have tried string on both sides hoping this would help solve the problem but it isn't helping.	-1
Shipped quickly, which was nice, but a few spool ends were broken off which made it impossible to use for my 60 pack of spools I wanted to fill it with. Disappointed, but not worth the time and effort it would take to return it and get a different one.	-1
it like to forever to get it it was like a day or 2 past time,,an then when i opened the box the top shelf was on up side down an half broke off,,i don't think i will order things like this again from this place an no i would not reckamend it to anyone,,an if ya do hope you have better luck than i did	-1
I think I see the cause of the problem with this rack. I just noticed when I put this 66 Large Cone/ Spool Thread Rack into my Shopping Cart, what ends up in my cart is NOT this item, but a 60 Cone/ Spool Thread Rack that holds smaller cones (like the 1,000m to 2,000m cones). I have tried to put BOTH of these thread racks into my Cart during the same shopping session, but the only one that shows up is the "60 cone" one.  See below for the 60 Cone Rack that goes into the Cart when you WANT to buy the 66 Large Cone Rack:  http://www.amazon.com/60-Cone-Spool-Thread-Rack/dp/B000W6YMEW/ref=rsl_mainw_dpl?ie=UTF8&m=AL9OWV9BXEZKZ	-1
After one year and six pieces in figurative sculpture.  I have attempted to paint this in Latex and Acrylic . The paint does not adhere well. I can still push the well cured paint off with a firm finger. This does not meet professional standards for polychromed sculpture . The sanding method , detergent method ...none work. The paint does not stick well ..no matter how long it sits. The paint adherence is minimal. IMHE Coating the paint afterwards with a sealer makes no difference since the paint is still weak mechanically where it meets the epoxy. Water , handling and any light abrasion will ruin the paint finish. I am a professional sculptor and artist.  * Primers make no sense...it is an epoxy . Rough sanding makes no sense..it ruins the piece. Light sanding makes no sense , the epoxy polishes to a sheen with a rag.  I feel I cannot work this material anymore for polychrome ,  since once a complete piece goes to a buyer , if the paint fails , it reflects upon my work. * As a sculptor's clay it is very strong in general , proves to be brittle were thinly modeled and takes detail reasonably well. Fine detail must but cut once the clay is cured . I will use the white for sculptures , but no paint is planned , it mimics alabaster quite well. The natural mimics pot metal.  *  Prove me wrong , take one of your pieces and polish it , tell me which paint you use.	-1
I 100% thought that Tropical Glow meant that the floss would actually glow.  This is NOT the case.  Although the floss is brightly colored and quite pretty, it does not glow in the dark like I expected it to.  I wish it was reasonable enough for me to return this, but return shipping is nearly half the cost of the product itself.  VERY disappointed.  Only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because the colors are pretty.  DMC should really re-label this product so that people know it does NOT glow in the dark.	-1
I have purchased both normal and italic fonts. The size of italic fonts of Fiskar is perfect for stamping but this one is way too big. Good for poster work but not cards. Cant even return it. Shipping cost too high.	-1
Letters were larger than expected. They do not cling to my Fiskars Stamp Press.  If Amazon would give a full and complete description of the item I would have known in advance that this set didn't suit my needs. The capital letters are 3/4" high, and the small letters are approximately 2/8" high depending on the letter. I measured an "m".	-1
broke right away	-1
I am 21 and couldn't get it. NOT FOR CHILDREN	-1
the punch was faulty from the beginning but returning it is not worth the bother, money wasted. big disappointment because I thought Fiskars was the best in punches! hope I was the only one to receive a faulty tool...	-1
I used my Transfer Pen on canvas instead of regular material so I'm not sure how it would work on material. On canvas it was sort of splotchy. In some areas the ink was dark and in others it was lighter, but about half the image didn't come off at all no matter how hot I got the iron, or how long I left it on the image. I also had to use the whole pen for just one image (a large one). In the end I switched to regular iron-on pencils which I was able to purchase locally and got two pencils for half the price of the one pen and they worked much better on the canvas I was using. I would suggest trying the pens and pencils both and seeing which ones work best for the specific projects you're working on.	-1
Its too thick and it doesn't make nice thin lines. I wouldn't recommend it as I didn't like it..	-1
The ink dries out pretty quick and the transfer is too light.	-1
It makes a thick line and bleeds.  I'm not happy with it.  I prefer a finer pencil-like line.	-1
I just opened this seam ripper from its package and poked around in the seam I was trying to open, and the tip of this seam ripper broke off into the seam!  It was wedged in there, so I had some trouble pulling it out.  But in under a couple minutes from opening, it went in the trash.  Cheap!  Cheap!  Cheap!	-1
Very thick handle but sharp cutter	-1
I bought this seam ripper because of the ergonomic handle. It is a comfortable handle to grasp if you have arthritis in your hands as I do. However, the blade is not very sharp, and worse, the item does not come with a cap for for the blade. You can't carry it around in a sewing bag, and it is a hazard on your sewing table if you have little ones around. I'm sorry I bought it.	-1
Worst pipe cleaners I have ever used.  I bought three packages and used only 3 or 4 cleaners before throwing the rest in the trash.	-1
I have made many, many stockings and this one was the worst. The face is small and needs to be pre printed so that no embroidery is necessary on it. Very hard to get the mouth right. I will never make another one of these. I have always been very good at embroidery but this was difficult. I was so sick of it by the time I got it finished it wasn't even pretty. Hope you have better luck with it than I had.	-1
Very poor quality, not happy	-1
Thread kept breaking in my machine.  I thought it was made in USA but was wrong, it's made in China.  Oh well.	-1
It got torn as I was embroidering. Not as good as described.	-1
We've been buying this brand and product for several years and like the product. However, this order is a failure.  The product smells like dryer sheets or some perfume and there are many crinkled sheets.  Not happy with the strong odor and wadded sheets.  We'll be considering a different brand when ordering again.	-1
Thin and flimsy should be listed as light weight tear away.  Had to use two pieces for medium weight.	-1
way too thin, have to use double sheets making it not such a great buy.	-1
It was referred to me by a friend and since it was on sale, I went for it. I don't like it at all. I prefer Sulky brand. This brand leaves "poop" all over the back when you try to peel it off. Sulky brands pull off very clean. Uggghhh and there is such a huge amount of this to use.	-1
I thought there would be more to this.  It is just a piece of very light plastic that holds the strings down.  The rest is up to you.  It does come with some cheap string, a fair amount of plastic pony beads, and some plastic toggle ends.  The directions were not that easy to understand.  I had to do some trial and error to figure it out.  I thought this might be fun for my kids, ages 6 and 7, but they'd be reduced to screaming fits of frustration in no time.  I quietly got rid of it without them knowing I ever had it.  There's nothing here you couldn't buy more cheaply at the craft/fabric store, and with better quality.  I'm sure there are better instructions to be found online as well.	-1
I used this and it is suppose to be tearaway.  It is not easy to tear this material.  I had a problem with stitches ripping out.  To me it feels more like a heavy weight.	-1
This is the absolute worst cut away stabilizer I have EVER used. It is super thing and stretchy, almost like a WSS. It had caused my current project to wrinkle completely and now it has to be trashed. I am returning this product & caution you not to purchase!	-1
I was a little disappointed in this stabilizer as it did not seem to hold its shape very well when trying to hoop it.  It is suited for the small hoops seemed a little underweight for being advertised as regular weight.	-1
I bought the regular cutaway sheets from this listing & it is horrible, I will never purchase this brand again! It's advertised as regular, but it's way to thin! What it looks like after washing is trash & left a ton of "lint" all over my shirts! I'm so glad I only used this on my families personal shirts and not any of my paid orders! Added photos to show what it looked like after 1 wash (no dryer), of course my designs now I can't get the designs to stay flat either. What a waste of money! I'll stick with buying my sheets from World Weidner, they have quality stabilizer!	-1
I embroider for a living. I have always thought a tear away stabalizer was of the same quality. That is until this one. It is very poor quality. Normally, I can pull the paper away from my design with ease. This stabalizer requires alot more time and effort to successfully remove. I have an almost full roll of this that I cannot use.  Needless to say, I give this product one star.  If I could give it a negative rating I would. Very displeased with quality.	-1
It does not do a clean tear away..... Had too many edges after tearing.......	-1
This does not tear away. It leaves a residue. It adheres ok - not as well as other brands. Cannot recommend.	-1
seems a little thin for medium weight	-1
It did not fit my 4x 4 hoop. Thats my fault. I needed to go to larger 8 x 8. Not sure what I cam do with this one. Maybe save it when I buy the cap hoop??	-1
What a bad product. Thin as cheesecloth. I had read the reviews and so I ordered 15 yards. Can't use it for anything. No flannel to it. Seller takes returns, but the cost to ship 15 yards back is prohibitive so I'm stuck with it. I cannot recommend this product.	-1
As soon as I took this out of the packaging I noticed all the holes! I counted three, but they were near the bottom, and since I order more length than I needed, I trimmed them off. It wasn't until I went to attach the tulle to the comb that I noticed all the others! They were much deeper, about 20" from the side. Every hole was about the size of a nickle. I decided to trim the side to remove them, and see what the veil would look like. I wanted a 108' wide veil, but now it's only 80" due to all the flaws in the fabric. Luckily, the defects were on the same side, or else there is no way I would have kept it.  It doesn't wrap around me like I wanted, so I haven't decided if you should keep it or try again (with a different seller).	-1
I'm looking at it on the window right now. It is not even close to 100% light blocking.	-1
It was dirty!  I should have returned it but didn't.  But I have not used it due to poor condition.	-1
This wasn't what I was expecting. I was thinking the material would be more plush, and soft. This is very similar to terry cloth. It's actually quite thin, between the rows of chenille. This fabric is ok, I ordered 6 yards so I will definitely be using it on my burp cloths and bibs. But probably won't order again. And this material sheds like nothing I've ever seen!!!! See the photo I attached, that seriously came out of my dryer vent trap. It was like 2" thick!  Update-I'm pretty disappointed in this material. It is not soft at all!! I really don't want to use this for any type of baby product. Now I have a 6yd heap of this stuff	-1
Unfortunately the paint is old and dried out.  Returning.	-1
Unfortunately the paint is old and dried out.  Returning.	-1
ONLY for machine embroidery, I guess.	-1
Yuck.  Poorly wrapped and dirty Would not purchase  again	-1
These pens do not flow as smoothly or evenly as another brand. They give a nice fine glitter. I won't buy this brand again.	-1
v good i am sure but they did not say copic and they aren't that great for the price ..dissapointed .. but a great return ..poloicy	-1
Not much color.	-1
...Because I read the reviews before I purchased. I order about $200 in pens of all sorts a month. I try to keep the price down. So far my favorite for the money WERE SargentArt Glitter metallics. But they have been discontinued :{. Next are Fiskars. Always clear running ink. So when I saw these, I thought "Oh, these are a bit pricey, but hey! Maybe they are really impressive and I will treat myself. BIG NO!!!! These pens run dry VERY fast. As a matter of fact, they dried out afer about a square INCH of covered area. There are so many good reviews here, maybe the ones I bought have been on the shelf for a while (makes sense since they are twice the amount of fiskars and with fiskars you get 48 pens, this package was only 12 pens so they probably do not move as fast) So, truly, even if they ran great, and didn't run out, the colors are not so impressive that I would make the same mistake again.	-1
Thankfully, I bought only two of these overpriced pens (Gold and Clear) because both of them are awful. As opposed to Sakura Stardust glitter pens, the Copics are scratchy with bad ink flow. The Gold tone is a strange sort of 18K-type color, totally lacking in expected richness. The Clear one is truly clear because the mica concentration in it is very low. If you're looking for dazzle, these overhyped Copic pens won't deliver it. Normally, I use a combination of fine-nib markers: Copic Original, the excellent new Shinhan Touch Twin and Sakura Micron.  Sakura Microns beat pricey Copic Multiners as well.	-1
Sorry, but I wish I had better luck with these pens.  They are OK for the most part, but the Silver one is the worst of all because I barely get any glitter out of it at all.  The other pens I do get some color, but I was expecting some flow out of the pens.  I have to push really hard to get any glitter out of any of the pens.  All I can say is that I will not be buying these again. I really was expecting better for the price.	-1
Not sure if this is good chalk due to the fact that it arrived broken into little peices. I would advise you to buy at your local store is at all possible.	-1
Case	-1
This was a gift. Unable to comment.	-1
OK.	-1
Reviewed one that looked used and had a strong perfumey odor. Had to return it.	-1
This is the biggest piece of crap I have ever gotten off of here. I opened the package and 5 minutes later returned it. the handle doesnt look like this picture does it looked like it was inverted...I didn't see any singer branding on this either. I don't believe this is Singer product. Anyway, its pretty thin in the plastic department too....the bottom was beveled....I just wasn't going to pay for something that looked like that..	-1
I sent back three of these because it wasn't assembled properly and parts were missing. This could have resulted in dropping the machine on the floor.	-1
Took a month to ship it out and it didn't work.	-1
Not happy, this was faulty on receiving, it wasn't replaced, part refund was given, and I still lost a lot of money, sadly.	-1
I sent the product back when I learned that the only software for can't be used to create individual designs.	-1
I got the pink on instead of this green one I order, But that was not a big deal, wihat was it that i didn't come with the Cricut Cartridge it said it  come with  the pink one  was not happy with that and I try to contact them and still no Answers	-1
Yeah very bad company. I purchased the Silhouette Cameo and the eClips. Both are really good and alot better than the Cricut. I can design whatever I want cut. I can't imagine how anyone could buy and stay with the Cricut company. You CANNOT design your own cut....	-1
You cant print off of SVG images. Or ask it to print anything for that matter unless it is an image that is on a proprietary "Circut" cartridge.  The expense of this along is well over $3000 if you were to buy the cartridges at a DISCOUNTED price!  Next major issue is that it requires 'sticky' mats to cut.  which works great for the cutting... not so much for getting your project off of said mat.  Overall, there are better products that offer more options and cost less. Especially long term.	-1
I don't really scrapbook. I might start after this, but making artsy layouts of personal photos (half of which were taken against my will) is just not how I would like to spend my time. I collect dolls, mostly Barbie, and I like to make little dioramas and backgrounds for them with various props and scrapbooking elements. (Yes, I'm one of *those* people.) I mostly wanted this for the Disney classics images and decided to get this to see if I liked it before I jumped into a&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Silhouette-Cameo-Starter-Kit-Bundle-Cutter/dp/B007R83VKE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Silhouette Cameo Starter Kit Bundle Cutter</a>. Unless you are dead set on using specific licensed images, many of which are only available on the secondary market at inflated prices, you may just want to go straight to the Cameo instead.  Whoever tagged this as a throwback to printers and tech in the 1980s was spot on. The display and the cartridges make this thing look like some kind of dot matrix printer/Atari hybrid. A good systems analyst probably has all the parts to make one of these things stuffed somewhere up in his attic. They have a more advanced LCD touch screen on the Expression 2, but I read too many reviews citing screens spontaneously dying to risk it--especially with so many customer service horror stories.  I think this is meant for people who are not very computer-savvy. The promos and descriptions seem to emphasize its use as a stand-alone product. What gets me is that if you can keep track of what you've printed and where it's going to go on the mat, you should be able to figure out the Cricut Craft Room software. I suppose the up side of this is that if you're taking it with you, you wouldn't necessarily have to lug around your laptop as well. However I bet I could run the whole kit & caboodle on a tablet or a Dell Mini 9 with little or no hacking, maybe even wirelessly.  That said, the more they overtake the plumbing, the easier it is to stop up the drain. I tried using it without the computer, but it was slow and it still doesn't make efficient use of paper. I'm comfortable enough with computers and have no plans to start schlepping this machine all over the place for show and tell, so I'm using a Windows 7 PC. Craft Room software (available from the website) will be a breeze for most people to learn, even those not technically inclined. To me, having the layout in front of me on screen is much easier than trying to remember what I've input into the keypad, which shape is where, or what color I should load next.  Draconian DRM: I knew about this going in, and it's been discussed already in other reviews, but it bears mentioning again. Not only can you not unlink cartridges, but you can't import your own images. I see where this has already ticked off a lot of business owners who bought one of these to make their own logos and signs. When I've gotten tired of the same Disney images and generic shapes that everyone else has, and chasing after retired cartridges in the hundreds of dollars, a different machine and parting of ways seems inevitable.  The secondary market on some of the retired cartridges is kind of puzzling. I can understand this when there is absolutely no other way to get an image set you want, but Cricut sells digital versions of some of their retired cartridges at a fraction of what linked and non-linked physical cartridges go for on auction sites. When you buy a digital copy instead of a cartridge, you're tethered to a computer and you must have an internet connection. None of that bothers me, but I guess it bothers the people who want to use this computer-free, or who aren't comfortable with purchasing digital files. Even brand new, cartridges are heinously expensive. I expect to pay more for Disney, Hello Kitty and other licensed images, but for generic stuff they scanned out of a Dover catalog, they should not be gouging people like that.  Like other bugs, some Cricuts just need to be stomped. Just opening the box, it was easy to understand why some people hate this company so much. They included a power cord, and that was about it, besides a couple of cartridges that no one wants anyway. There are instructions too, but I don't know how they expect technically challenged people to be able to figure it out. They skimped on everything else, and I do mean everything. They didn't even include a cable for the computer, and that ought to come standard. I mean, I didn't expect wireless, but that's inexcusable whether they're pushing this on the computer-impaired or not.  If you already do a lot of scrapbooking and paper projects, chances are you already have extra tools to get started. If not, and if you get nothing else, get a paper cutter and a spatula. The spatula helps you get paper off the cutting mat. A paper cutter is useful for splitting sheets into halves so that you don't have to cut an entire sheet at once.  Because all I had was a pair of scissors, and because I saved so much by getting an Amazon Warehouse Deal, I got a&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Cricut-Essentials-Kit/dp/B000NTBNEA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Cricut Essentials Kit</a>. This kit is overpriced and should have been included with the Cricut. The box set of tools kind of resembles a medieval torture kit and I'm not sure how to use some of them. I have to wonder if they took them from a dentist's office. I didn't realize the 6x12 mats were not for use with the Expression, and the 6x12 paper included in the kit is lackluster to say the least. A lot of paper crafters will find it redundant and probably already have better quality stuff. I am going to take a thorough look at all of it, but I have a feeling that I may send it back in favor of buying better tools or just getting individual pieces. Get the machine with the starter tool kit bundle if you really want to make cuts the minute you de-box it.  A couple of extra 12x12 mats will come in handy for getting more paper ready to go while one sheet is cutting, but I don't think I would get any more than 2 spares. They try to DRM you with these mats, too. If you use spray adhesive on them to get more use out of them, it voids the warranty. (Apparently just owning the Cricut voids the warranty.) Well, according to a lot of what I've read here, they don't stand behind their warranty anyway, so what's stopping you? I say once you've passed the 30 day return window with Amazon, if you're loving it, get a can of spray adhesive and cut those shapes till the blues go away. You'll spend enough money on replacement blades without sending these mats to the landfill every single time.  I guess the big question is, does it cut? Yes it does, and it does it well. I got great shapes on my first try on scrap paper, and I was quickly making shapes to keep. This is the sharp, precise stuff you would expect to find in a package of cutouts at the store. I will probably have all the Disney classics shapes that I want and few resources to keep buying cartridges for other things. In a few days, I'm going to be bored, and it appears that Cricut likes it that way.  Through litigation with extreme prejudice, Cricut has managed to crush third party software that allows you to make your own images or use anything that you didn't buy from Cricut. They can forget about cottage industries that would have made crafters happy and ultimately contributed to their own bottom line. Rude responses, stupid answers and avoiding warranty obligations are all over the place, and there are too many of the same kinds of complaints for it not to have some basis in fact. They want you to use all of their products, but they take none of the responsibility when something goes wrong. I keep seeing rumors of imminent bankruptcy, and it's not hard to believe.  Finally, I bought this as an Amazon Warehouse deal. The description said that the outer package might have some damage. It looked to me like the original Cricut seal had been broken, but everything inside had remained untouched. It worked just fine and you can return it within 30 days. Amazon is a 5 star retailer-- it's such a shame that this product is not.  Overall, I am happy with what I set out to do, but it leaves me wanting too much more. I cannot recommend this machine in good conscience. Unless you have your heart set on images you can't get anywhere else, do not buy this machine. Check out the Cameo, and if you do buy this, know what you are getting into. They don't back the quality of their work and they have business practices that would make Bernie Madoff blush with shame. They should call this machine the Suck Cut, because it sucks as it cuts--- mostly from your wallet, but especially from your creative spirit.	-1
I was dissapointed that the company has made it impossible for you to use their product with anything other than their own overpriced cartridges.  I returned the one I purchase and bought a very similar item from another manufacturer with a less greedy business model.  I did use the machine once after I bought it and it did fine, So if you want to be restricted in your creativity by the availability and price of the cricut carts, buy this.  I have told cricut and now I am sharing with all of you that I would not support this company unless they change their policy.	-1
I had two duds before I got one that worked right. Customer support is a joke. :( But when you do get them, customer service has delays and runaround patter down to a T.  I only bought the machine to use it with Sure Cuts a Lot. Fortunately I bought my machine before the lawsuit, but... I can no longer update it for fear of it no longer working with my third party software.  Just not a good value, I gingerly use it for occasional projects, as it intermittently make weird noises now. When it dies I am getting something that works with third party software.  Oh, and they have the most ridiculously restrictive 'Angel Policy' in the world. Totally full of unenforceable bull crap. Why they would lie to us, their customers, on this stuff is unclear, but it lets you know they don't value us.	-1
UPDATE: I originally gave this machine 5 stars, but I no longer can recommend the Cricut Expression. They sued the Sure Cuts A Lot company (Craft Edge)and won, so now you can no longer get the program for your Cricut unless you already had it before the settlement. You are now forced to buy the expensive cartridges and their software which is in no way comparable to the Sure Cuts A Lot program. If you aren't computer savvy and prefer the cartridges, this is the machine for you, but if you are comfortable with computers, this is NOT the machine for you. I just ordered the Silhouette Cameo, which offers their own software for $50 that is very comparable to the Sure Cuts A Lot software AND it can cut 12" x 10ft! I will definitely do an extensive review on that machine once I receive it and play with it a little.  Original Review: This is a very nice machine and can cut 12x12(the mat it comes with)or 12x24, which is large enough for anything I need to make. I love that it has the flip feature on the machine. The personal electronic cutter does not. This is useful if you need to flip your words, when making stencils, etc. This one comes with the 2 basic cartridges. So, I think that this is the best deal on the Expression that you can find anywhere, so get it before it's gone. I also wanted to mention that I purchased the Sure Cuts Alot program to use with this machine. It allows you to use ANY image that you can find on the internet. The program costs just a little more than one cartridge and the possibilities are limitless. I hope this helps=)	-1
Do not purchase this product. There are many cutting machines available that allow flexibility in using computer software to be creative. Provo Craft does not... you're virtually strapped to using their cartridges only. And they constantly inflate the prices on those cartridges. Their customer service leaves a lot to be desired!	-1
I just bought a Cricut Expression yesterday at a local store.  It was marked down to $99, with a 20% coupon on all craft supplies.  I couldn't believe I scored it for $80!  My joy was short-lived though.  I had previously owned an Expression a few years ago, using it mostly to make lettering for my store's signs.  I had always planned to buy the Sure-Cuts-a-Lot software, as I could never afford to spend $60-90 for a cartridge that usually only has a few designs on it that I like.  But I had to close my store and I sold the Cricut for financial reasons.  Yesterday, I finally was able to get a Cricut!  But then I got home and did some research, and found out that Provo Craft, the company that makes Cricut, sued the companies that make Sure-Cuts-a-Lot and Make-the-Cut (a similar software)to prevent them from making their software Cricut-compatible.  This software makes it possible to use free fonts and dingbats off the internet to create your own designs to cut, for free.  Hey, Provo-Crap, think you're going to force me to buy your over-priced cartridges?  Think again!  I might have bought one occasionally, when I saw one I loved.  Now you won't get my business at all.  With more research, I found SEVERAL competing machines, most of which worked with at least one of those cutting design softwares.  Black Cat Cougar Cutter looked the best, but was expensive (it etches metal and glass, and embosses leather--cooooool). There are a couple of new versions of cutters coming out this fall (2011) that are better than the Cricut. I'm leaning toward the Sizzix Eclips or the Silhouette Cameo.  Some of these machines might be a little bit more expensive than Cricut, but far, far, FAR cheaper in the long run!  The Expression I just bought is going on craigslist.  I'm not the only pissed-off Cricut buyer.  I've heard of many others packing up their Cricut stuff and selling it on craigslist or ebay to buy another machine.  Count me as just one more, Provo Crap.  I bought my Cricut Expression for only $80, and it's STILL not worth it in the long run.  Even at that price, buying 3 cartridges in the future would put me right back up in the price range of the competing machines, which all allow you to use the money-saving design software, without restricting you to their proprietary cartridges.  Even at $80, the Cricut Expression just isn't worth it!!  Five years ago it would have been worth it, when Cricut was the only game in town...but now, with (superior) competition out there?  Forget it.  P.S. the fact that a store had it for sale at $99 and didn't exclude it from the 20% arts and crafts department sale should tell you something...the stores are having a hard time selling them, it seems.	-1
Cricut has decided that you are to be cartridged bound.  Personally,  I find this very limiting and expensive as it will require you to continue to buy new cartridges all the time.  Sadly this is what Provo Craft is wanting.  There was third party software companies that allowed you to create your own images and creations.  Provo Craft has begun suing these companies.  A machine with so much potential and options gets very limited very quickly when you are forced to to use only cartridges all the time.  For my money I will focus on a cutter that does not require cartridges and will allow me to make my own designs.  In my eyes Cricut has potential but the company is choosing to limit the product.	-1
I got this as a gift for Christmas.  I bought all the accessories, including the deeper blade.  I found that the machine does not cut chip board as the product claims.  It also does not cut quilting fabric.  Both of which are demonstrated on the DVD provided.  I spent another $40 attending a class at a local scrapbooking store using the Cricut Expressions.  I am glad I did this because it reassured me that I was not a slow learner.  The instructor also had problems trying to get the machine to perform, and the instructions provided were very vague and poorly written. When I have called the customer service at Provo Craft the "tech" did not know how to use the machine, and was not helpful. On the up side, I did buy the software package, on sale.  The software has been essential for me to be able to use the cartridges.  I agree that all the Cricut products are way over priced, especially when there is little or no customer support.  Save your money and buy ready made die cuts.	-1
I don't know why I didn't send this back.  It didn't really work for what I bought it for and it smelled so badly of smoke. I don't know how or why it smelled of smoke.  I don't think it came from someone's home...but it reeked.  If it didn't smell like smoke and it works for what you wanted it for then it would be a great product.	-1
I didn't realize the size. I was hoping for a case that would hold all my Tulip crochet hooks but this was a monster of a case, more for knitting needles.	-1
I loved this bag. However I have two small issues. One, I wish the top had a zipper so that if I use this while traveling I would not have to worry about anything flying out of it since it can't fold very flat with things in it. Second, one of the best things that I liked and made me order this bag is that it can stand freely. While the outside pockets have nice vinyl plastic,the bottom of the bag is canvas. I often knit and crochet on the beach, or decks/balconies or docks so I need something waterproof around damp sand or wood. To try and solve the issue I bought a sheet of craft foam, then measured and cut the piece to fit the bottom of the bag when open. I have yet to try it, but hopefully that works. If not, then this bag will not travel with me and stay at home. Update a few months later: I loved this bag so much that I ordered another. The first one was the natural color. I used it on vacation, it was so handy during a few days of use on the beach and in our hotel room that I decided to use that at home and bought a black one to use only travel,because it should stay cleaner. A few days ago at home the first bag completely broke. The metal screws in the rods that crisscross under the bag and on the sides, not only popped out on both sides, but BROKE right out of the holes. Bag would not stand up freely anymore, was unfixable and had to be tossed You can't still use the bag if the metal rods are flopping around because there is no way to get the bag off of the metal unless you cut it off. Now I am using the second bag at home, I don't trust it for vacations and expect this one to break sooner or later. I did not overstuff the bag. It was not even folded much. It did not get wet on the beach. After one use during traveling it was mostly on the floor all day by my knitting chair, sometimes I would pick it up and fold it to move it but not often. The metal is cheap and ruins an otherwise nice bag. Cannot recommend this bag now.	-1
I don't like it.  I found the cutter dull and did not cut very well at all.	-1
The needles are to long, I cant use them. The small metal anchors that hold the needles are to long,  Doing any kind of  knitting is not possible	-1
I waited for a few months to really try these out and am glad I did to let the public know. I can't stand these. The needle points are so dull, the stainless steel needle paint comes off easily and you're left with a rough needle. The cables that are included are really stiff and your delicate yarn gets stuck on the  connections. I'd ask for a refund but know I payed for these in November. Please take my advice fellow new knitters. :-(	-1
Best price you'll find online for these. Great that this comes with so many needles but the connector cables suck! They pretty much always want to stay twisted and this makes it hard to knit with. I got these because I needed circular knitting needles but I honestly don't use this kit at all because the connectors and cables constantly become untwisted from each other and the needles. I'd have to always stop every so often to check  them. Plus side is that this comes with a nice case and the needles are color coded. That's about it.	-1
This is an attractive set, the needles are a nice texture, I thought I liked it very much.  But I am 1 skein into the first sweater I am knitting with it, and the needle just separated from the cable.  I thought it had come unscrewed.  No. It broke, with the screw in the needle.  The needle is ruined, the cable is ruined.  Un-useable.  Incredibly cheap.  I want a replacement, but they say it's already past the point when I can return it. I don't recommend this!	-1
Cords are horrendous, gave the set away.	-1
Unfortunately my needles were not in the best of shape. The #2 tip were bent and I couldn't even get my #4's on the cable because they were bent. I was able to fix them well enough to use but I was very disappointed.	-1
It's really sad to see how poor the quality of Boye products has become. I bought this set because I wanted a large range of needle sizes in a small case to take with me when I knit away from home. The first set I bought, had 2 needles with deep gouges in them, was missing a cable, and the case didn't zip completely closed because of the way it was sewn in. I exchanged it for another set. That one had some weird sticky substance on several of the needles, and the size 2's were rough and had a few sharp bumps on them. There's no way sock yarn was going to slide down those things. They also had a kind of mottled, corroded look to them. I took that set back to the store as well, and apparent glutton for punishment that I am, I exchanged it again for ANOTHER one. Today, I unzipped the case and the zipper slider broke into 2 pieces and fell off in my hand, rendering the zipper useless. I have had the set for all of 2 weeks.  I don't think it's possible for them to use cheaper, chintzier, materials. From the case, to the needles, to the cables, it's all junk. The case is plastic, and all the tools inside are held down with loops and pockets made out of pieces of thin, clear vinyl (the kind my grandma used to put over her tablecloths to protect them). The cables are rock hard and stiff, and there are only 4 included in the set. I have an old set of (really nice) Boye needles with soft cables that came with 5. The needles themselves don't compare in quality to the old ones. I'm debating whether I should return this set or not. If I do, it'll be for a refund. I won't be wasting any more of my hard-earned cash on rubbish.  When Boye sold the company to Wilton, they should have not allowed them to keep using the "Boye" name unless they agreed to keep the quality up on their products. Now all they're producing is inferior, made-in-China crap.	-1
Totally disappointed! The item i received visibly had damaged needles so I did not open or use it yet. Maybe if simplicity would send me an undamaged item, I can make a better review...	-1
These needles are horrible. I'm very disappointed with boye company. I would be careful before getting these.	-1
The size 7 needle broke the nylon cord after using it for 1 week. Returned it	-1
Arrived dry and very little pigment.  the stamp itself is very very small,	-1
Gave them away.  Join on three of the needles was turned up like a cuff which caught on everything.  Very cheap, not made for smooth knitting.	-1
Come unscrewed very very often and the cords are very rigid. I've had them about a year and I'm ready to pitch them and move on. If you don't knit often, or are new and not sure you want to spend the money for decent needles yet, these are passable and will work in a pinch. It will make the next needles you buy seem like a dream.	-1
A nice sized set with the full spectrum of tips from 1 to 13, and three cables that can be put together or used separately to create a variety of sizes.  The trouble with this set is that the joins are not clean, and come apart frequently and catch on the yarn.  When using this set, I usually have to tighten the joins after every round.  Not fun.  I invested in a higher quality set and now only use these when I need a size i can't find among my other needles.	-1
I had to tighten the tips onto the cables after every row.  I Gave up and bought an Addi set.	-1
I bought these because they are inexpensive.  You quickly learn fear because they unscrew very easily.  AND THEN, one attempt at tightening the out of fear, and the soft metal of the needles, lips when you screw the cable in - and you can't get the yarn over it without a fight.  Plus, the kit had one bad knitting cable connector, so in-between projects... I had to work around my lack of enough resources.  fine, for a first purchase, but one thing goes wrong in your projects and you are in trouble.  I expected more.  I would recommend investing in at least a $60-90 brand of needles.  It's a step up, but you won't waste cash.	-1
My daughter purchased these for me as a Christmas gift. I have used them maybe twice and have lost one size of a needle because of spuring of the aluminum. I use the tools properly to attach and tighten them to the cords, but the needles still come unscrewed. Reattaching them constantly is what causes the spurs. My husband had to actually sand down one of the needles so I could finish a project I was working on. The cables are VERY stiff and uncomfortable to work with. I won't be using these needles again unless I absolutely have to.  I would not recommend them at all.	-1
While this kit looked great the needles work themselves lose from the cord. I followed the sketchy directions on how to make sure they are tight but didn't help.  Also the joint between the needle and the cord is rough and the yarn gets stuck. Miserable waste of money. I ordered a couple individual needles from another supplier. Don't waste your time with these.	-1
the needles don't stay together no matter how tight you make them and yarn will not move freely on needle extensions	-1
Love the variety of sizes, but the needles keep unscrewing while I am knitting and the needles themselves don't say the size so if you place them in the wrong spot in the case, you can mistakingly use the wrong needle, especially the smaller ones.	-1
My first set of interchangeable knitting needles were the Denise brand.... plastic needles and plastic connecting parts.  They kept disconnecting while I worked with them... completely unacceptable.  So, I purchased these aluminum needles thinking they would be better and stronger.  One use, they also disconnected!  Second use, I used their included tools, a gripper and a key (similar to an unbent paperclip) to tighten them.  The female end of the needle fanned out of shape when I tightened it!  Size no. 8, now useless because the needle will snag the yarn!  Third use, size 2 for a pair of mittens, the blob of plastic on the wire connecting to the male screw piece is bigger than the needle.  So all the work must remain on the needle and cannot be moved down onto the wire!  Just very disappointed and now in the market for another set!  I cannot recommend these.	-1
I was knitting a blanket in the round, it didn't even get to lap size before the size 5 needle just snapped at the threading, lost a bunch of my stitches. I'm not an "aggressive" knitter and I've never broken interchangeable needles before. It was extremely frustrating, I don't trust the rest of the set now and the size 5 is my favorite anyway.	-1
The price reflects the quality, which is poor.  Knitters will quickly outgrow this kit as they move on to finer yarns and more demanding projects. If you are the sort of person to take up knitting just to make a dishtowel then this kit will suffice, however you would be better off just buying the set of needles you need for that individual product and saving your money. Boyle's Interchangeable Needlemaster System is very clunky and very clumsy and tends to ensnare the yarn. The needle tips themselves are ok but the wires quickly unscrew and are inflexible and can cause a lot of damage to your project.  If you intend to sit and knit for long hours or do any intermediate to advance projects these the Needlemaster kit will hold you back. A better buy at a similar price would be Knitpicks Harmony, Metal or Sunstruck options or better yet, Knitter's Pride as they have 16" circular options. The 16" circular option on the Needlemaster barely bends to make a full circle. If you knit Magic Loop style you will find yourself constantly laboring against the stiffness of the wires. The larger needles (US 10 and up) are hard to work even when placed on the 24" options. The smaller needles are even harder to control on any of the cables. Only 6-9 are really usable on the 24" cable and up.  Save your money, the strain on your hands and nerves and invest $10-20 more in another kit. The resale value of the Needlemaster is practically worthless due to the fact that both amateur and professional knitters quickly outgrow this kit and buy better quality ones.	-1
Didn't work that great!	-1
A clumsy little device for which I ultimately found no use.  It's stashed in my craft room awaiting a child who might like to tinker with it.	-1
I have a lot of circular needles, various materials & cord lengths. I wanted a neat, zipper case with interchangeable needle tips for travel. I had a 50% coupon from a big chain store,and was very happy with the set.....until halfway through my first project the tip unscrewed from the cord and I had to pick up lost stitches.  I retightened the tip to the connector with the included tool, and used the rubber grip pad to secure it, only to have the tip loosen time and time again. Then, I found that tightening the tip expands the bottom end of the aluminum tip and make a ridge that snags yarn. OK, I flattened the swedged end by rolling the base of the tip on a hard surface, snugged up the tip and continued my project. But I'm really unhappy with the tip connecting system!!  I thought I was saving a lot of money by getting the Boye set ( and on sale, too!), but I have since taken the expensive plunge to an Addi Click system.  I knit for relaxation, not to fight my tools. PROS; compact kit, neatly organized, nice sharp smooth tips, colorful, extra parts included. CONS; the connecting joint is horribly designed and loosens no matter how carefully you follow the tightening directions.  I have no idea how some of the reviewers here can put up with this flaw--it's a deal breaker. FYI; don't try using a temporary thread locking liquid like blue Locktite to keep the tip and cord screwed together. It works once, but is impossible to clean off the inner threads of the tip.	-1
I purchased this for making jewelry with wire. For that purpose it is not very good. It may be better with cord or thread but if you want to make wire jewelry stick to the spool knitters made for yarn. Might work ok if you are using elastic thread that has a lot of stretch,  As far as I am concerned it is a waste of money. It is also very small. Good size for kids but adults not so much. Would not recommend.	-1
Does not work well for soap felting. Takes forever to felt and even then it still won't felt well.  I waiting a long time for this to arrive too.	-1
I am giving this set two stars because it's at least somewhat usable.  But every single time I complete a round/row I end up re-tightening the cable.  There is no way to tighten the ends so they stay.  I have forgotten to tighten and had my cable come undone several times, which is very frustrating.  Plus, the cables themselves are not very flexible and twist all over the place.  The set really should come with 16" cables since they are used for hats.  I had to order this size separately.  I thought this would be a good entry level set because I'd have all the sizes, but I soon learned that it's not worth messing with.  Don't waste your money.  Invest in a better set or buy your needles as you need them.	-1
I started a hat using in super bulky yarn and the size 13 needles.  I did my cast on of 78 stitches and worked 8 rows of k2p2 ribbing when the cable broke off of the connector.  At first, I thought that I hadn't screwed the pieces together tight enough.  However, I discovered that the plastic cable had actually broken and there was no way to work with it.  My stitches fell off the needles and I had to restart the project on straight needles and seam the hat.  This was a waste of money and time.  I returned them and ordered a different brand of needles from another manufacturer.	-1
I received these needles as a Christmas present which I specifically asked for. How great to have every possible size circular needle I could ever want all in one place! I was extremely excited to try them. My hopes were soon dashed when I pulled the needles/cables out of the package.  The needles themselves are of great quality and pretty colors as others have noted. However, the cables are so incredibly STIFF it is nearly impossible to knit anything small on the smallest size. Also, the bend at the join is so terribly rigid it extends the "needle" making it very hard to knit anything small. I also had to keep re-screwing the needles to the cable which I found extremely frustrating. I am hoping they will possibly work better on larger scale products as they are unable to be returned to the store where they were purchased since it is now an open item. I say save your money and just buy the needles singly as you need them as this is NOT worth the hassle.  One other note for anyone else who is experiencing these issues: I did find this link which seems to provide a nice tutorial on how to make your own cables for this particular set. You can find it here: [...]	-1
Horrible needle set. interchangeable needles are useless because it dislodges frequently causing the yarn to unravel! save your money and instead buy "ADDI TURBO" needles which make knitting much faster and does not dislodge!!!!	-1
Not loving it,  I used as directed and it seems to take off more fabric then just the "pills".  Also noticed that it degraded the fabric. Will not be using this product at all	-1
Easily comes apart.  the strip that holds the hooks in keeps coming off more and more.  Not worth it the money.	-1
does not  work	-1
I can't say how disappointed I am with this machine.  I had wanted to knit blankets for a charity and needed a quick way to produce the blankets.  After I watched the DVD twice, set up the machine, watched a Youtube instruction and worked an entire afternoon, I was unable to produce even five stitches.  The yarn knotted and jammed; I'd unwind it very carefully (those needles look really fragile); then, I'd go back through the process.  After approximately five times of jamming, never once getting more than five stitches cast on, I gave up and returned the machine. This machine is flimsy, and the concept is poorly conceived.  I have knitted for over 40 years and decided that while I'm not a fast knitter, I might actually get a blanket finished by hand whereas with this machine--it ain't gonna happen.  My advice:  don't waste your money on this product.	-1
The Ultimate Sweater Machine does not work very well.  The concept is very good, but the execution is not. The DVD was very informative and made it look very easy.  I love the yarn that came with the machine. The carriage gets stuck about half way across the first row.  After several hours of trying, we finally knit about 1 1/2 rows.  If there isn't enough pressure on the carriage, the keyplate pops up and stops making stitches. If you exert a little more pressure, the carriage jams and will not move in either direction..  If you take the keyplate out or back up a little to get it unjammed, it drops your stitches. We tried re-waxing the keyplate, re-assembling a few times, and also using different tables to make sure it was flat. We made sure the hem was not in the way.  Still not much luck.  It made beautiful stitches when we cast on using the "e stitch" and then moving the needles by hand. If we wanted to knit by hand, I would not have purchased a knitting machine.  My son's words were, " It's the worst present I ever got!"  I am seriously thinking about sending it back.	-1
I know many people posted a positive comment on this product.  However, I found it quite rough on my pure cashmere sweater, even though I quite gently applied it to the surface and barely pulled it across the surface.  It may be better on blended cashmere/wool or some other ingredient combo of yarns.	-1
It was my fault that I ordered the wrong product as I thought this was crochet yarn.  But the colors were very pretty.	-1
This only fits one large hook and two standard size hooks.  The rest of the slots hold tiny thread hooks.  The material holding the hooks is stiff plastic that is very thin.  Use a hook twice and the whole thing rips out.  I've had it 2 days now.  It's just a zippered pouch now.  This item is junk.	-1
very cheaply made	-1
Don't waste your money! I have never worked so hard for so little - the most I ever got was 30 rows of knitting. I could have hand knitted 3 baby blankets in the time I've wasted on this piece of junk. If I had the option to give it zero stars, I would.  This machine is poorly designed. The yarn catches on the underside of the carriage causing countless jams and dropped stitches.  It usually starts to jam on the 3rd or 4th row.  By the time you fix the jam and pick up the dropped stitches, your work is horribly stretched out with uneven stitches. So you rip it out and start over.  The table the machine sits on cannot move or wobble a millimeter or the machine will drop stitches.  The table must also be absolutely level and plumb otherwise it drop stitches.  The clamps used to fasten the machine to the table are inadequate - there are only 2 of them (a third in the middle of the machine would help to stabilize it more) and they loosen frequently causing the machine to move when you're knitting a row and then, more dropped stitches.  The joints where the 2 halves of the bed join together are uneven and often snag the yarn causing jams and dropped stitches.  The instructions tell you to wax the plates but you must generously wax the whole machine to get it to work at all.  That includes the underside of the plates, the bed, the green strip that the carriage rides on, the spaces where the bed sections meet.  I'm done!  It goes back to the store tomorrow.	-1
Didn't like	-1
The plastic tabs in the inside tore immediately. I expected elastic tabs inside to hold the crochet hooks. Cannot recommend.	-1
I really love the idea of things that don't need batteries, but I did not like this stone. Initially I thought it was pretty cool, BUT I have learned that brushing fabric with something coarse like this upsets the fiber and creates more fuzz, more wear-and-tear, and eventually more pills. It was slow work using this on my sweaters, and often the stone would flip out of my hand. Yes it removes the pills, but it also removes other fibers from the surface of your knitted fabrics and creates the problem I mentioned above. And, the stone itself sheds tiny grains as you use it, making a little mess.  CUTTING (shaving, clipping) is the best way to remove pills without damaging the surrounding fabric.	-1
doesn't hold crochet hooks very well.. the space for the hooks is very tight. Smaller hooks are held great, but nothing over a 6mm I would say	-1
What a huge waste of money.  It leaves black pieces all over the place.  You can only use it outside unless you want to spend time cleaning up after yourself.	-1
Shredded the shirt as it crumbled apart. Absolutely terrible! Don't waste your money.	-1
I was excited to have a "knitter" that would be more compact than the current popular "round looms" which I have been using.  The instructions that come with this are very vague.  I do not know how to "knit" but have had lots of fun with my round looms but I cannot figure this one out at all.  Product is probably great if you have previous knitting knowledge.	-1
I was not happy with the stitch counter has the picture shows that it had a pendant with it and when i got it it did not have it so very unhappy with not having it .	-1
Followed the surprisingly extensive and detailed directions to perfection. I even used three different sized scissors to get everything just right. After opening the device, the Pom ended up looking like an odd sort of flattish poorly shaped standard Pom, let alone a heart shaped Pom. With the amount of shaping I had to do with my scissors afterward, I might as well use a standard clover Pom maker and shaped a heart on my own! I would have saved so much time. I purchased several clover standard Pom makers and those don't require nearly as much detail. This heart shaped Pom maker has teeth you need to wrap around just right and bring the yarn up to the exact height before moving to the next. Disappointed and I would return it if it weren't just a few bucks.	-1
needles broke after one push! returned for refund!	-1
Doesn't work as well as I had hoped.  My pom pom came out looking more like a regular round pom pom than a heart shape.  I will admit, the first time I did do it wrong, however even after watching the instructional video on Clover's website, and trying again, it still doesn't really look much like a heart.	-1
New order, hoping it cuts we'll! Price was good & hoping the quality is as well. Have no other issues.	-1
Too complicated for me to use.  I can knit, and I can crochet.  I should have stuck to the real thing.  Because this is complicated to me.  I tried making something and it looked terrible, not a nice tight weave, and had difficulty following the directions.  Just not for me.	-1
I was pretty disappointed with this spindle.  The varnish was a little rough, the notch on the shaft would not hold my yarn - no matter how lightweight and the whorl was too heavy - I wish I had noticed the shipping weight (although the seller having noted the weight of the spindle in the description would have been more helpful).  As it is, I'll make do by inserting a cup hook on the 'wrong' end of the shaft and use it as a top whorl drop spindle.	-1
This case might be useful for something, but not circular needles, unless they are very small.  Made well and has a good closure but my circulars will not fit in easily.  Needs larger pockets. But, I will use for something.  Price was right	-1
It's stiff not soft.  Over priced	-1
It seemed fine but in less than a month the metal legs, which seem thin for their use, simply separated at the connection.  Not what I would want to order again.	-1
It is ok to hold needles, but still too small to hold my 15 size bamboo set. Both covers of the top and the bottom are not very easy to open, it doesnt fit well, so it is not very handy if try to reach to something in the bottom compartment... especially small items, when try to open it hard and the stuffs inside just fall out....	-1
Hmmm, seemed like a good idea, and it does protect my bamboo knitting needles. But it's just too tall to store laying down in with my other knitting stuff. The accessory case on the bottom of it seems like a good idea, but I can't imagine I would ever be able to remove it without everything shooting out of the case. It's just too hard to remove the lids to be of much convenience.	-1
Returned as the ends were flattened due to size markings, making them useless for insertion into knit edges. These wires must be a welding product not altered for blocking use.	-1
Was pleased with the variety of lengths and widths, however, the ends were rough and will take some sanding to smooth them down.	-1
Ok...so I know the measurements are on the website.  But still this things is too small.  I tried using it for eye shadows...too small.  Then I tried to use it for my sewing stuff...one drawer only holds about 4 sewing threads and maybe two smaller sized ones.  Not enough drawers for my sewing stuff.  Then I attempted to just put it in my craft room but thought the drawers would open and spill to easy with any type of beads or anything like that.  So now, last resort, I'm storing small spools of assorted ribbons in it.  I still have more spools that can fit in the four drawers though.  This might end up in the workshop for nails and screws or something.  Which means my hubbie gets it and I got no use out of it.  Oh well.  I could send it back but I figure I'll find something eventually for it.	-1
this was not at all what I expected.  It is a stiff dial that you have to turn manually...but be careful not to turn it too far past the number (sometimes it doesn't even stop on a number).  Not useful at all.  There are times I am knitting and look down to see it has moved to in between 2 numbers.  Horrible product :(	-1
Did not work, too cheap to do anything with it or even send it back.	-1
Do not like these, and ended up putting them in the trash. There is no opening in order to put it through the yarn to mark the spot. Maybe I was using them wrong. Won't buy these again.	-1
This bleeds through many types of paper and I need ink that doesn't bleed. I am not going to buy Color box "Chalk" ever again. :(	-1
The blades do not cut the threads.	-1
Don't get this	-1
It is a wonderful idea in theory and I imagine perfect for sewing machines but for yarn, no so much.  I had to keep hacking at the yarn which frayed the edge.  Binding off was harder, since I had a hard time putting the end in the darning needle. But for thread it is great.  Also great for removing those plastic things that hold on price tags	-1
The idea is good, but the production is too fragile.  The stem snapped off from the counter before I finished the first project.  I'm back to the old fashioned design.	-1
Cheaply mades .	-1
I was thrilled when I first got this - I could use it on any size circular needles. Working in the round, I could treat it just like a stitch marker, and knit right past it.  Unfortunately, it has a design flaw: the stem with the needle loop is attached to an inner cylinder which ought to rotate freely, but it doesn't. It does turn, but very reluctantly. The result is that after I had used it for a few small projects, I had twisted it so often to get the numbers turned upward so I could advance them, the stem began to break away from the counter. It's now just barely hanging on, and I expect the next time I use it, it will snap off.  Another problem is that it absolutely requires two hands to advance it: one to hold the cylinder, and one to twist the end rings. Very awkward.  I'm going to order the Clover green Mini Kacha-Kacha next, so I can hang the counter around my neck and advance it with one hand.	-1
The idea is good however after a few months the plastic ring splits. A metal or rig might be slightly more expensive to manufacture but it would last longer.	-1
Not really "universal"... the loop is jus oversized so it fits on any needle, but because of this, it just continuously falls off of the needle if the needle is smaller than the hole, unless you have something holding it to the needle, which is very annoying!  The counter is really cheap plastic too so the numbers aren't even clearly printed either.	-1
I recieved BLACK row markers and it is way too much trouble to return them. I am not happy as I already had black and although I could always use more, I was thrilled to have the GREEN as shown in the picture. That was why I purchchased them	-1
I love these pens, but I am very unhappy with my order from Amazon.  Do not be confused by the "BULK" in the description!  It is only one pen. I don't know why they have the word bulk in the listing.  Two weeks ago I ordered this directly from Amazon for $5.94.  Before I bought I contacted them to find out how many was in the "bulk".  They couldn't tell me.  So, I decided to find out, so i could post a review and let everyone else know.  I figured there would be at least two pens, considering that you can get it from many other websites for around $3.00.  This does not reflect on 123Stitch.  I've ordered from them before and love them.  The item came directly from Amazon drop-ship is no longer in the main items, it has moved to the other new for sale box in the right hand margin.  So, I wasn't able to leave a comment on the specific item listing that I ordered from.  At the time, the only listing for this pen on Amazon was for their drop-ship.  If 123stitch's listing had been available I would have gone with them, or to Ritz Camera's scrapbooking site.  I've gotten good service from Amazon many times before, but this instance has left me very disappointed.  So, now I have to pay to ship it back to them, then I will order from a site with a reasonable price.	-1
Great idea and the nib is excellent.  However, mine appeared to have dried out after using it one time.  I pulled both nibs out and they're juicy inside, but the ink doesn't seem to flow to the nib.  Although the instructions say to store the pen horizontally, I'll start storing it so the ink drains to the nib and see if this helps the flow.  When it seems dry, I gently press the side of the nib on my versamark ink pad before writing with it.  And I'll have no problem putting a drop of reinker on the nibs when they actually do dry out.	-1
i like this but the brush tip is weak. i have used it only once and the brush side is already frayed. i am not rough with this as i own other felt-tip brush markers so i'm not sure why this is so bad. i wish there was an embossing marker made by tombow.	-1
I ordered this pen and have tried many times to use it. I even dipped it it liquid versamark to see if that had any effect. It did not. I will try one more time to get another....I think mine was completely dried out in the package.:( ...	-1
tried to iron on and it didn't work.  got only the outline of a letter instead of the letters themselves.	-1
Difficult to remove the white letters from the white sheet, causing them to tear, and there were only 2 of each letter.	-1
No good they don't stick.	-1
Sent back.	-1
Received With cracked & broken case, but i could live with that. Purchased because i needed a second one. The blue handled original works great! This one is terrible! Crushes all of the eyelets. Not with it. Bad purchase on my part !	-1
It is very small, but that really is not a problem. The problem is trying to open it. There is nowhere to grip it. You have to turn the box away from you to get it to open, and then it opens roughly. If you had loose beads or findings in it, they would pop out all over the place.  Really, really difficult to open.	-1
I paid almost eight dollars I believe then I saw them at Michael's for $1. I would have returned them but unfortunately, in a rush, I cut the tags off. They are very thin material and flimsy.	-1
In the picture this ink pad looks normal size (meaning large enough to hold and ink a stamp).  In reality, this ink pad is literally the size of a postage stamp. Very hard to handle. Definitely not worth the price.	-1
I ordered this kit in Lime with 400 eyelets. It was out of stock so I waited. Once in stock, a three week wait, shipping took 4 days, not the 2 day prime shipping it was advertised with, & that I pay yearly for. What I got after all that wait for it to come back in stock was a pink one with 100 eyelets in a smaller case. I was still charged for the higher priced Lime in the case with more compartments & 400 eyelet.  I will be sending this back & buying the one I ordered but from another store. Really annoyed since I've waited patiently for over three weeks for this & really needed it, now my project is on hold again while I search elsewhere for the one I wanted.	-1
Pitch black is very green. I actually did better with the "slate" and "pumice stone" for gray and black tinting of resin.	-1
Pretty powder.  Too bad the lid was on crooked and it spilled all over inside the box. What a mess.	-1
The embossing powder is excellent. However, I was very unhappy upon receiving the jar; the headline size is misleading. The product description clearly states it's a 1-ounce jar. Upon receipt, I noticed it's the same size as the one I purchased locally, .74 ounces. The cost is $3 more than my local Hobby Lobby for the same size jar. If you're happy paying $3 more, buy this. If not, stick to Hobby Lobby or Michael's and get it cheaper.	-1
It doesn't melt as a solid holographic finish, as I'd hoped.  What you get is a clear coating over little round pieces of colored glitter.  Disappointing.	-1
I had a very hard time getting this color to stick long enough for embossing. There was also glitter stuck in more places than where I was trying to emboss.	-1
Got here quick enough and I like the embossing powder but when it did get here the container was busted and a lot of embossing powder on the outside of the container but it's wrapped up in the wrapping.	-1
There is no where that I can see that it says it is powder.  I was hoping for liquid.  I have tried mixing it several times and maybe it is user error but I'm not coming up with the best mix, it continues to be gritty.  They need to mark it as POWDER and clearly have that on here.  The price for this tiny amount of powder is nuts. I can get a pound of the powder for $18.14.  which is about 6 times LESS per ounce than this is.  So, now I will take my 50% off coupon to MIchaels and go get the better brand (Winsor & Newton Gum Arabic) of 2.5 ounce liquid  for about $2 more than this 1 ounce of powder and not have to waste a bunch of powder praying for the perfect mixture.	-1
are worthless for syicking stars on the ceiling	-1
when i was reading comments, i was thinking: I'm lucky, I will get what i gonna order... Instead i got on time 2 round and 1 heart punches at least the heart punch doesn't cut well... that is not so big money but i prefer to help someone then just throw away any money. I'd turn back this special item, but unfortunatelly to pay x4 times more than the cost... so if you need only disapointings so buy it... or think twice before do it.	-1
I SPECIFICALLY bought THIS item because the description stated, "1-inch pre-measured strips with CLEAR [emphasis added], perforated liner for easy placement".  That is not what I received; the liner is opaque and non-perforated making it impossible to place the strips where I want them.	-1
The dots don't come off the roll in dots. I've had to pull on them to get them off and it distorts the shape. They do not come off your finger easily either. Maybe it's because they are so thin? I've donated the box and will not be purchasing them again. I do not reccomend this product.	-1
Not fond of the colors. They look dim on paper. I was really disappointed	-1
Roll was loose and the adhesive is really bad.	-1
not a clean cut.	-1
What i received were not the small glue docs I expected but these long gummy hard to use sticky things.  I am sure there is a skill to learning how and what to use them on but I have not had the time yet to experiment	-1
Dont expect this to be super adhesive like the packet indicates.  The strength is only strong enough for paper, at most cardboard.	-1
Glue dots do not stick. Save your money. You're better off picking your nose and using that--that's how ineffective these little buggers are.	-1
bent easily and didn't last long.	-1
I am not sure if I am doing something wrong, but I followed the tips on Tsukineko's website as well as youtube and others, and could not get anything to stick.  I was looking forward to stamping images and covering them with ultra fine glitter, but no matter what I did the glitter just fell off.	-1
Well, I really wanted the 3 shapes as advertised but got three circles in different sizes.	-1
I was disappointed by this product.  The glue is not very adhesive and it dries out very quickly,in Houston!  I can't imagine how it would be in a more arid region.  I got it specifically to use with some beautiful metallic flakes but it hardly worked at all.  Very disappointed.  Tsukineko is usually such a great company and they make other adhesives that are fantastic.	-1
I found these glue dots not only very difficult to see but also very difficult to use.  They were hard to get off the paper in the shape of the glue dot originally because by the time you get it off the paper, the glue dot has become a little glue ball,  then to use it you have to flatten the glue ball out so it can glue something.	-1
This ink is horrible! I had gotten some metallic inks in the past and hadn't had issues. I don't know if something is wrong with the pad that I got but it is illegible and uneven. I've tried it with a few stamps (that do well with other inks) and it still has no definition and is very uneven.	-1
Ok	-1
These are quite cheap quality. One of them does not even align the punch mechanism enough to work. They are rickety, stiff and not sharp. They stick and get stuck. Compared to others I've used,these require way too much pressure for even a couple sheets. They are frustrating to use. I kept them because I use them seldom. If my hobbies ever require frequent use of hole punches, I will give these away and buy a quality set. I would never give these to my kids, if I could afford better ones. These are the kind of tools that fail to provide the kinesthetic pleasure that makes working with our hands far more rewarding than staring at a screen.	-1
I bought this product at a craft store, not on Amazon.  I was disappointed to find that the ink was rather dry and does not create clear images.  Also, each ink pad is not removable, so it is difficult to use the middle color.  I am disappointed because I have read good things about color box.  I don't know if I am doing something wrong or if this particular product is just a dud.	-1
They don't work properly. I don't know if it was only my pack, or if they are all deffective, but it's incredibly hard to ounch holes with these punches, even in normal sheets of paper, and the forms don't really come out nicely. I had to get a refund on this...	-1
very stiff and hard to use ,don't buy if you have any sort of hand problems	-1
Broke after 2/3 uses!!! Had to get refund	-1
OK	-1
Broke after a couple uses? oh well.. still 1 left .. I would not bother.	-1
Doesn't seem to take off all sticky stuff.	-1
Wasn't too impressed with it, but thats just me, when it comes to crafts everyone is different on what they like to use	-1
Would not buy it again.  Worthless to me...but it may be me.	-1
A lot more porous than I expected. I was looking for more of a magic eraser effect but this is a stiff rubbery sponge with large pores. It seems a little clunky and not really for delicate detail work. It feels like something from the paint aisle at Home Depot as opposed to a detailing tool for specialty scrapbook papers/stock. I would be careful with it. Seems like it would be easy to tear or damage something. Probably would be great for removing labels but it's a square blocky chunk that is not so easy to manipulate around the edge of a project.	-1
These ere very cheap. I bought a few packs for an event. Non of them lasted the whole 4 days. They kept breaking and unhinging. It was a nightmare.	-1
I had the hardest time getting the stuff to unroll. Then I couldn't find the adhesive part.  I think it's dried out.  Not sure.  Just a waste for me.	-1
I thought it was just MY galaxy maker that dried out really quickly and was going to order another one because I need something just like this...until I saw the previous review that said their markers either arrived dried out or dried out soon after.  Bummer	-1
Firstly, I had problems with the order in general. It specified 8 dollars plus shipping for *five* markers. I was sent *one* marker. The marker was even totally dried out upon arrival! I contacted Amazon, who told me to keep the marker, and the correct order would be shipped out. Again, I was sent *one* marker. This marker wasn't dried out, but still dried out quickly soon thereafter with minimal usage (so I'm highly recommending against purchasing this product). I again contacted Amazon about the quantity issue. They stated that the listing should have been for a single marker, and that they would correct the error on the page. I noticed a couple of weeks later the page was flagged as having an error in the listing, but not actually corrected. These markers generally go for less than two dollars each at most arts and crafts stores, so no way should one marker have been 8 dollars PLUS shipping. I was instructed to return the marker in the package it came in (a single marker came in a box the size of a shoe box!), but I had to take it to a UPS drop off location (they wouldn't even give me a return pick up, just a return drop off). It would have cost me more in car fare to take it to the nearest drop off location than I paid originally, so I just gave up on this product altogether. I can't complain about Amazon's willingness to resolve the issue (although the UPS drop off thing ticked me off a bit), but I really can't recommend this product at all.	-1
FAKE! RECEIVED SOME CRAPPY MADE IN CHINA ITEMS INSIDE THE PACKAGE! DO NOT BUY!	-1
Good price but low quality product. Have to pull open after every punch. Handles fall off. If you are not doing a lot, OK for the price.	-1
This is not red, it's pink!  I've never seen a pink ruby.  I want the product, but I trusted that ruby red meant ruby red. I'm now having to buy another for the project in which I need red, not hot pink!	-1
This was disappointing. The glue didn't come out very well and I had to keep poking a straight pin down the opening every time to make the glue come out.	-1
It's pretty, I like the color and the shimmer, but it is really difficult--and seems to be entirely a matter of chance--to actually make a pearl shape out of this "liquid pearl" stuff. Maybe there's a trick to it I don't know about (please, by all means, leave a comment and let me know if there is!), but mostly I get misshapen peaks and little blobs. The smaller I try to make them, the worse they are, and that doesn't mean the larger ones are necessarily good either. I'm not sure what I'll use it for now, but hopefully I can find some way to use it. Oh, and by the way, if you put it over dye ink, the color from the ink will seep into the pearl liquid, but it will be a distorted color. This can be a cool effect, if you are expecting it. I came upon it by accident, but found that over the cocoa CTMH ink, it kind of looks like mother of pearl. I may do something with that, but it doesn't work well to make your own pearl-like accents.	-1
This thing stinks! Doesn't work AT ALL! Waste of money and time.	-1
Sad to say, did not work at all for the person intended. She had better luck rolling up some of the Xyron glue bits and using that to get up the rest of the glue. This just smears the glue over the photos or paper. (I tried it myself with the same results) Glad it works for others, but I thought I should let others know it doesn't work for everyone.	-1
It arrived in a timely manor but I found it doesn't work up to expectations.	-1
I love Xyron products, use many of their adhesives in my scrapbooking and crafting projects.  But these just don't work well for me personally, although many people rave about them, so they are working for many.	-1
I must be the hulk because the handles bent on the first use, rendering the circle punch completely useless.  I tried to bend them back and go figure they bent the other way.  I used the heart one instead and no dice with that one either.  I was only punching 3 sheets of normal flimsy paper... and yes I am sure it hadn't gone through hence the pressure I applied.	-1
I will try it, then give different rating.	-1
Was not the right refill for my machine even though it stated would fit my machine	-1
More than 3-5 pages of paper and this tiny wretch binds up immediately. When you do cut, it leaves a clear machining mark where the corner begins, so it looks sloppy unless you go back with a knife and clean it up.  It's small, maybe 3-4" small. This isn't bad, until you factor in that it's plastic and uses pressure to cut.  Needless to say, my top pink bit broke when I tested 7 pieces of paper.	-1
The whole machine doesn't work very well.  The "stickem" tends to get stuck to the plastic and then the whole thing is lost.  I have to take it out and do it by hand.	-1
The one I got did not work right and had to just throw it away,  Threw the original macine away too, cheaper that trying to send it back, and I had to open it to see if it was the right thing, it was but there was something wrong with it.  So I chuncked it.	-1
I don't think this refill cartridge correctly works in my Xyron 500	-1
I still have a shoe box full of tiny rolled strips paper that has not been seal as I have no idea what product to use. I was also teaching my 8 year old granddaughter this craft.	-1
I had seen the item with the "don't lose your cap again" style bottle and I avoided it because I disliked how the band would get in the way and how it did not come with a clearing pin. Once my glue bottle arrived I was disappointed to see that I received the one I had purposely avoided. Picture is now listed as well. Very annoyed. Contacted seller and have not heard back yet. Will update this review if an when they correct their mistake.	-1
I don't like them. They look weird!	-1
The bamboo is very nice and smooth, but the cable is so stiff that I can't do anything with them! I even tried soaking the cable in hot water and straightening it out to loosen it up but it immediately coiled right back up. Useless for magic loop knitting	-1
I have never left a review before, however, sitting here working on my granddaughter's blanket I am so frustrated with these needles I felt it would be a great disservice to those of you out there considering this product, the cord is so stiff and unmanageable, it keeps twisting and there is no smooth transition from where the cord and the needle meet (the join) plus one of the tips of the needle is already starting to split.  I feel like I am constantly wrestling with my work and cannot even concentrate on my pattern.  GRRRRRR!!  I am so relieved I only purchased one and not the whole set.  I also purchased one of the addi lace circular needles, unfortunately not in the size I need for this project, however these needles are so awesome I  purchased the Addi click Interchangeable set, and as soon as they arrive I will transfer my work onto the one I need.  They are a little pricey but you get more than your moneys worth.  For me I probably would have paid doubled, they are that pleasant to work with.  It's a little like driving a volkswagen then going to a cadillac.  It comes with 3 interchangeable cords that you can actually connect all 3 together to make one huge piece if need be.  The best part though is the cord and the join, the join is so smooth you can't even feel your work slide from the cord onto the needle, plus the cord is not that stiff straw like material, it's loose and wiggly, like butter.  Like I said earlier, I don't write reviews, as you can probably tell by my ramblings, I just hope you will take heed in my advice and save yourself some heartburn and frustration.  Happy knitting!	-1
Every knitter is different. Some prefer bamboo needles and some metal. After receiving these needles and trying to knit rows of 235 stitches I found that they are horrible! You really have to work to get the stitches to the end of the needles. It's very hard on the hands and you can only knit a couple rows before you have to stop because your hands hurt too much. Bamboo may be alright for very slippery yarn in smaller guages so the stitches don't slip off. The Addi turbo needles are the way to go for me. They are worth every penny extra you spend. Anyone who suffers from carpal tunnel's should stay away from bamboo needles. I hope this review helps any new knitters out there.	-1
The cable is much too short. I didn't like these at all because the cable is so short that the needles get in the way of each other. Very poor design. Buyer beware! Everything from this brand is measured from tip to tip and the lengths stated are the length of the whole product, not the cables. This is a very difficult product to use due to the extremely short cable length. I bought these to make socks and found myself struggling to make anything at all with them. I am an experienced knitter. I'm now very happily knitting with a set of needles that come with adjustable cable length. Those are worth the money.	-1
I wish I liked them, but I just don't like knitting with bamboo needles. They are just too soft and sticky for me.  I prefer the polished woods ones, like Norville and Dreamz.	-1
needle is to short	-1
Disappointed with this.  The bamboo separates from the needles and there is no way you can get it back on.,  I would never buy this type again.	-1
They work, but my yarn sticks at the joint of each needle. I find it easier to knit on metal tips with smoother joints so that the yarn moves smoothly and easily.	-1
The needle were fine.  One suggestion would be that if the points were sharper.  It would help with certain patterns	-1
I was under the impression that each needle was 16" long and attached at the end. However the needles were actually 4-5" long, with a total length of 16". Wasnt able to knit anything with these.	-1
The needles were about 3"long  and were extremely difficult to hold. I would need a longer needle to use the magic loop method. I cannot imagine a use for these needles.	-1
Last week I needed size one knitting needles in a longer size (in this case, 24 inches) -- and quick. So I ordered these bamboo needles even though I dislike the feel of the yarn on them. They were the only ones I could find that day. After knitting 4 rows of ribbing on the bottom of a sweater, they snapped. In the middle of a row yet. Even if I do manage to get my money back for these, I'll never order another pair of bamboo needles again.	-1
I use circular needles almost exclusively, the cords on this brand of needles is so stiff that it is irritating to work with.	-1
It does its job but I think I may switch to a piece of foam instead. Remnants of the roving kinda stay on the bristles and transfer sometimes to the next project which is annoying when it's a different color. Also when trying to finish one side the bristles kind of grab the other side creating a bit of fuzz.	-1
This is has too small a work area.  Tried it once and put it up.	-1
I was not expecting a high quality as they were inexpensive, but a friend really likes these brushes - kind of a disposable brush. The other set I received came well made. This set was not well made already looked really worn - and they new. I hope they will simply replace them without any hassle. I really want to try them.	-1
The brushes although stylish handles the brissles in the brush were all too soft for acrylic painting.luckily they were cheap enough.who knows maybe sometime I'll need a softer brush.	-1
Disappointed the picture is deceiving was expecting to get the product as shown expecially for the price was shocked when it arrived that it was just a square box no containers included.  Was a gift so I had to  either give it and be embarrassed and explain or have no gift. Of course when she recieved it and saw what it cost it was an immediate I want to return it. As normal with amazon it was a easy process to return it	-1
I loved these clear boxes SO much that I bought more, and more. Then I realized I could buy the wooden doc to house them in and I was thrilled. However as others have mentioned, the clips that close the boxes don't stay on at all. I have 20 boxes and I've lot about 15 clips. Ok, you think, not the end of the world. Except it is the end of the world. Because in order for the clear boxes to adhere to the rails inside the wooden box, they NEED TO BE LOCKED WITH THE CLIPS. If you don't have the clips, you can't slot the boxes into the cubby. The whole thing is useless.  I have emailed the company twice and gotten no reply at all. I noticed another customer asked a question about the clips also, and for some reason there is no way of answering it. I cannot believe the stupidity of this company. All we need to do is buy more clips. But it seems we can't. Waste of hundreds of dollars and a pissed of customer.	-1
has to be put together, just the box is all that is included, no plastics.  I did not catch that in the details, my mistake.	-1
Very deceptive description. I read this and assumed that the pegs referred to the rails. Instead this comes in pieces, requires assembly and the instructions indicate that in addition to screwdrivers, there's a need for a power drill.  This was far from the snap together set-up I expected. Moreover, the pieces are made of particle board, very heavy and not my favorite, and though they had seemingly smooth enamel-like finish, on closer inspection it proved to be less than uniform and wasn't particularly attractive. On the other hand, it was $46.  Notwithstanding, I thought I was buying a cube for storage boxes, not a construction project.  Fortunately, Amazon has a very forgiving return policy. The boxes are great by the way, but the storage cube leaves much to be desired.	-1
This art bin works but its far from the best. Upon receiving the item I was instantly disappointed in the quality. The plastic is VERY thin. I bought a $2 bin at Target  (with no dividers) that felt more sturdy than this. The dividers that came with it are slightly different sizes and will only work in their appointed sections (which is inconvenient ). The plastic tabs that keep the bin closed are so thin they fall off sometimes and am afraid this thing will break one day. With that being said, the design is practical. It will fit a good amount of things..and the customization feature is nice . If you don't care about quality, this will work for you. However, I do not believe this bin should cost more than $5	-1
How can something so simple be such a pain??? There was a wooden dowel piece missing....fortunately I had a dowel very close to the same size which I had to "rig" so it would fit properly.  The little covers (for the holes to give it a finished look) were also missing. Because the "wood" is particle board it's pretty heavy. Don't think I will buy any more of these all things considered. I really do prefer real/solid wood!	-1
This is cheaply made, parts made not fit properly. Not worth the money and looks cheap. Assembly is cumbersome. Try a different system. Also pricey for such a mediocre product.	-1
There are 2 different sizes of dividers in this bin, but the large dividers do not fit properly.  When I inserted the divider into the slot, it fit securely on one side but there was about a 1/4" gap on the opposing side allowing the divider to actually pop out of the divider groove.  Returned for refund.  Would not purchase again.	-1
Nice concept, however the clips fell off within 2 minutes. The dividers are nice, the box is sturdy, but the clips to keep everything secure are useless. If turned upside down, everything gets mixed up, the lid is not tight enough to keep everything in their compartments. Be better off buying a Stanley storage box.	-1
I have many  Brittany sets and I was very surprised on the first time I was using one of the needles snapped and broke just below the middle section	-1
Nice looking needles but they have no "polish".  They stick and really slows down the knitting.	-1
Disappointing.  Poor quality, including rough finish at the end with the hook. Not useable at all.  I will have to try to sand it smooth. It's not worth the hassle to return it.  Guess I learned my lesson.  You do get what you pay for.  Should have sprung for a quality brand.	-1
Not impressed.	-1
It felt great in my hand, but it's difficult to actually hook the yarn. My work is dramatically slower using this hook.	-1
Very pretty, not well made. These hooks simply don't work. They miss yarn overs, split the yarn and the throat is so narrow only the smallest thread will fit! I have had to carve and sand them extensively with a dremel just to try to salvage this purchase.	-1
Beautiful hook. Was so excited to get it. Couldn't wait to use it, but as soon as I opened the package I noticed that the mouth and neck slope are not condusive for crocheting. The opening of the hook is so tight/small it won't accept the worsted weight yarn I have much less a bulkier weight yarn. And the edges are rough, snag the yarn. This hook is beautiful but absolutely NOT FUNCTIONAL. This is more suited for a decorative item. Very disappointed. Calling to see if I can return it and get my money back.	-1
I bought this hook because I was enamored with it's detail - the sleek wood, the carved handle, the length. In this regard, it did not disappoint - it is truly a beautiful hook at a reasonable price. Using it was another story. It felt good in the hand, however it is almost impossible to hook yarn onto. Even after several separate attempts, the hook passes right past the yarn without hooking it and takes a far more tedious hand to achieve said goal. Another qualm I have with the hook is that it tends to snag at the yarn, fraying it during the crochetting process. In the end, I went back to my aluminum hook and never looked back.	-1
Really did not like this hook.  Very difficult to work with. The way the tip was designed made it hard to catch the yarn. The yarn did not glide easily. Dragged.	-1
Very brittle/fragile and much longer than I'm used to!	-1
Gave as a gift t o a young friend, was broken before she ever got to use it. Not very sturdy. I'm disappointed, I had bought one also so I gave her mine which wasn't broken. Hope it holds up for her but I'm not impressed.	-1
It was a lovely hook with a innovative shape however it's very prone to splintering right at the top of the neck, which snags the yarn constantly. This started happening after a couple days of use and no matter how I try to sand it away, it continues to happen :(	-1
Not impressed.	-1

Difficult to use done they are so small and often not completely punched out. Will use other methods	-1
Too difficult to pop out.	-1

This bag is very shallow and flimsy, not good for projects or holding things in.  It does not stand on it's own like in the picture and none of it is reinforced. Possible good for kids whose supplies are smaller, like small packs of crayons and small scissors.  I only paid a couple dollars for it, but I feel I wasted my money.	-1
This was almost a joke, it is practically made of paper. I bought mine thru Jo-ann fabrics for Clearance for under $3. and I still don't think it was worth the money.  It is so tiny ( I would say it would be fine for a child )something I would expect to see in the local dollar store.  The picture is so deceiving, it looks like tough burlap material and it is more like a heavy brown paper bag with a plastic coating on the inside.	-1
I didn't have good luck with this product.  I wanted to add gold and silver leaf to some complex cloth.  I may have been the problem, but this just seems more work than it should be.	-1
useless	-1
Not good at all. Very frustrating as the tape came apart from the tape runner and I had to throw it away. I had the same problem with the refills I purchased. I would not buy this again, ever.	-1
It's just ok. It's really inconsistent to work with. I'd have some that was perfectly pliable and easy to smooth, and some that would not mold or smooth out no matter what I did, and some that just fell apart. I like how light it is when dry and it seems to take pigment and paint okay, but overall the inconsistency is just disappointing.	-1
I was excited to get started on my projects today when this came in, but found I was terribly disappointed. It came in a massive box, -- completely unnecessary for the small size of the punch (could have saved a lot on shipping). The punch itself is small and light-weight, but the edges of the punched material are not clean. The metal that forms the circle is not well made and is fairly dull. Punching just regular paper the edges are a bit fuzzy. Card stock didn't punch well either, and it hardly made a mark in cardboard.	-1
