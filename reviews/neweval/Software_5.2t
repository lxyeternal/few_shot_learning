...that hasn't already been said?  If you're on a Mac (and you wouldn't be looking at this if you weren't!), Office for Mac is the software to use to insure compatibility with the rest of the world. The question is which version is the best for you...  If you're working at home, the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Microsoft-Office-2008-for-Mac-Home-Student-Edition/dp/B000X86ZAS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac Home & Student Edition</a>&nbsp;provides most of what you need.  If you need to tie in to the Exchange Server at your office, then the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Microsoft-Office-2008-for-Mac/dp/B000WR2F2M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac</a>&nbsp;will do it.  It costs roughly $60 more than the Student and Home version and can also be upgraded when a newer version comes out.  The Special Media edition adds in Microsoft Expression Digital Asset Management software.  It's a useful addition if you need to keep track of large numbers of files across many different storage devices.  Most large companies, however, already have (or should have) a digital asset management system, leaving this as an odd duck product...99% of users can get by just fine with the standard version of Office.  That's the one I'll buy for my other Macs.	1
I have a MacBook Pro and previously owned the MS Office 2004 edition.  When I first converted from a PC, I found myself stumbling around the 2004 applications looking for things.  The 2007 release of MS Office changed to a "ribbon" interface that is similar to the toolbar setup of MS 2008 for Mac.  It should make for a smoother transition for new MS Office for Mac users.  But besides that, the interface for 2008 is neater and more organized.  I've also found the performance to be much faster than the previous version, and not as prone to crashing.  At home, I use MS Office 2008 for Mac for editing and reviewing work files.  I also use the Excel to keep track of personal spreadsheets.  I find both of these very easy to use and love having the ability to have these programs on my Macintosh.  A student version of the program probably would have been sufficient for me based on my past use.  While I do not need the functionality at home, the stripping of the VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) is an issue for some users that they should consider before upgrading.  There is also no Analysis Toolpak, which again is only a concern for higher-level users.  However, the Microsoft Project Gallery is a great new application that I did not have on my 2004 student version of the MS Office software.  You can create business cards, brochures, flyers, calendars, stationary, resumes, envelopes, labels, etc.  It's kind of like a bonus "PrintShop" being bundled with the software... but with some very professional - and also some fun, sleek -templates.  The 2008 version also adds Microsoft Exchange capability to the e-mail program Entourage - a huge plus for those who use Microsoft Outlook at work and what to sync their e-mail at home.  Overall, I highly recommend this product.  I would recommend that you research the differences between each version of MS Office 2008 for Mac prior to purchase.  This will ensure you are getting all the features you need.  If your budget allows, this version is great to give yourself some features that may take a while to grow into.  But once you do, you will be happy to have them.	1
It's nice to have Office 2008 for Mac.  Things aren't where you're used to in Windows, but it's still easier to navigate than any other version of Office.  This flavor of Office is fully loaded with lots of extras you will probably never use, but is great to have as a backup.	1
You can tell right away that Microsoft Office 2008 has had a massive overhaul since the previous version (Office 2004).  It has an improved interface and now has Intel processor compatibility.  However on the downside, Visual Basic has been dropped plus the new version needs a lot more processing power so you need a PowerPC G4 processor at least.  This Media Edition is what used to be called the Professional Edition and it includes Microsoft Expression Media which replaces Virtual PC.  Microsoft Expression Media is a media management / presentation program and in its own right a top product.  Office itself is Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Entourage and Messenger.  I am sure I don't need to explain what these are.  The new interface looks amazing and the changes are immediately obvious. You now get new integrated toolbars instead of the floating ones and everything looks neater and more organized plus you get the 'Elements Gallery' feature which is a new way to browse and insert document objects.  There are also updates for all the individual programs within Office.  These new features and improvements make Office 2008, a big advancement over Office 2004 plus it is a lot more user friendly and easier to use.  Overall I would have to say this is definite worthwhile buy and a must upgrade.	1
I have already reviewed and voiced my concerns about the actual programs like Excel, Word, PPT et al, and their problems in another review.  In short, this edition is only for children, people who have never used MS office before, or those using it only for the most basic of functinoalities.  Professionals, those used to versions 2000-2003, and those who need expert control of the program (i.e. macros and the like in Excel), then do not get this program, you'll have a tought time finding the same functionalities as in v. 2003.  But, since this is the special media edition, I did enjoy this one part of MS Office 2008.  It really does an excellent job of organizing all of my HD videos and photos, hence I give it 1 star over the regular version (which I rated a 3).  The visual interface of being able to see what files you are actually organizing instead of just icons and numbers really helps group the pictures and videos into exactly what I need, this is really a neat feature.  You can actually "preview" each media file without opening it, again saving you the time of figuring out what you are organizing.  Make sure, however, that you have more than the minimum system requirements for this special part of MS Office.  I put this version on one of my computers, I had more than enough RAM and processing speed, and the preview part would take up a lot of RAM, slowing down my computer quite a bit!!!  I'd reccomend staying with an earlier office product, and waiting for a new one to come out that is hopefully better for business professionals.  Creative individuals or those in the creative work profession will probably not have ad tough of a time with this edition of office as I did.  Those who need hard-core number crunching capabilities of Excel will have a very difficult time with this new version.	1
Man, Ubuntu just keeps getting better! It's easy to install. It includes a LOT of extra software including the awesome OpenOffice.org office suite. You get a lot of games including Aisleriot Solitaire which includes TONS of different solitaire games from Thirteen to Klondike to Golf and so on.  You also get the award-winning Firefox web browser for virtually worry-free web surfing.  For the multimedia lovers, Ubuntu includes a nifty iTunes-like music player (Rhythmbox) and a nifty movie player (Totem), both of which can play popular multimedia formats - including MP3s, AACs, and DVDs - once you install the necessary multimedia codecs.  Ubuntu installs easily with just a few clicks and a tiny bit of typing (you have to supply a user name and password for your user account), and it is easy to install Ubuntu on a computer already running Windows, giving you the choice of either an easy-to-set-up dual-boot configuration or have Ubuntu take over the entire hard disk.  And if you have powerful video hardware, Ubuntu comes pre-installed with Compiz-Fusion for nifty desktop video effects such as minimize/maximize/restore animations as well as a view of your virtual desktops as a 3D cube.	1
This version 7 isn't the latest. There's new version available!&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Ubuntu-8-04-and-Linux-Training-Library-2CDs-set/dp/B0018KUB6Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Ubuntu 8.04 and Linux Training Library 2CDs set</a>&nbsp;I tried before many other Linux distros but Ubuntu is my favorite by far! It is friendly, complete and compact. Great OS, great design!	1
There is a widespread problem with EXTREMELY slow wireless networking on this release.  Download rates may not even reach 10 % of what other operating systems can provide.  Many users also report slow wired networking.  Canonical has basically blown this problem off, apparently you're supposed to go to the Ubuntu forums and dig through the huge mound of material there, and spend your free time solving their problems.  Unfortunately, this is just more proof that Ubuntu and Linux are just not ready for prime time.  When you have a MAJOR bug and you just blow it off, well, you don't deserve to stay in business.  (Maybe Microsoft can get away with this, but nobody else can.)  I'm going to reinstall an old copy of Win 2000, at least the networking is functional.  I really dislike Windows and Microsoft, and was hoping that Ubuntu really is the wave of the future.  But the fact that 7.10 was released despite months of reports of this exact problem, and their attitude towards the whole issue, says that it's just not a winner.  I have hobbies, and none of them are Linux.  If you don't want another hobby, I suggest that you look elsewhere.  UPDATE:  The wireless problem is fixed, and it now works quite well.  The latest release is even better.  Now highly recommended.	-1
I use these all the time and have been very happy with them.  The finished cards always look great. Recommended.	1
I've used these cards for some time and the quality of the photo printing is very good.  MY primary complaint is the cost, even at Amazon prices.  My other two complaints are the paper is a bit thin and the cards tend to curl, as well as the ink does need more time to "dry" on this paper than others I now use.  I started with this brand because it is one of the few half-folds in gloss, most others are matte.  It's a great package if you do a few cards here and there.  However, I recently made holiday card sets (12 cards per box) for 40 people.  At nearly 500 cards and wanting a better quality card stock, I bought bulk boxes of cards and envelopes separately through Desktop Publishing Supplies. (Actually is sometimes available through Amazon.com.  For small runs or a card once in a while, this is a good product.	1
This is an easy to install and run accounting package for small businesses.  It has all of the tools necessary to manage inventory, accounts (rec. & pay.), as well as payroll (for an ad-on monthly fee).  SQL 2005 is installed on the backend as the database.  This wouldn't be a good solution for larger shops that have database know-how, but is great for the non-techie.	1
This seems to be an excellent product, but it is clearly designed for the business user and not individuals, thus, I am not able to really evaluate it fully.	1
I've read the other reviews of this product here, and there are clearly a lot of negatives. Some people find this program too big, some find it too small. I found it just right. When I contemplated self-employment, I had several concerns, including whether or not I could actually keep the wolf from the door that way, but my largest was the thought that I would have to keep records of some kind. I don't have a talent for that. When my sixth client sent me a contract, I searched diligently for a book called, say, "The Smallest Amount of Accounting Knowledge You Need to Avoid Getting Thrown in Jail," but didn't find such a thing. All the books I could find seemed to imagine that I was -- well, an accountant. Office Accounting Professional 2008 doesn't assume this. It is bossy software. You know what I mean about bossy software. It reminds you to apply payments to invoices and nags you about putting in people's names correctly and won't let you charge people for "June." In general, I don't like bossy software. Bossy word processing programs often just don't understand complex syntax and don't have as large a vocabulary as I do, and I really don't need my computer to warn me that I haven't been properly introduced to websites. But the bossiness of this software means that someone like me can put her data in correctly enough to send it off to the accountant -- and there is a system for doing that, too. I scoffed at the set-up poster, by the way, but it was nice to have some large paper showing all the steps in order. I had no trouble getting the software installed, everything was done by wizards, and overall I found the whole package reassuring. Now, I have no employees, and I have no interest in eBay, so I sympathize with those who felt that there were more parts to this than they needed. However, I found that this package has just the amount of power I need for keeping track of hours, jobs, clients, income, and expenditure. If I have employees some day, I won't have to learn new software. I can foresee needing to use the banking features, so I'm glad they're there. The extra features don't hamper my use of what I currently need, and I've had the experience before of spending more on trading up than I would have if I'd bought something more powerful to begin with. I would strongly recommend this package for small businesses.	1
Microsoft Office Accounting Pro 2008 would be a great tool for small business.  It's easy to use and hasn't caused any burbs on my system like most products I install.  I'm just now starting my business so I don't get a lot of use out of it but it would be great for businesses that have actual employees  :)	1
It does do the basics well enough and plays well with the rest of Microsoft's products. However, save yourself a lot of stress and stay away from this. Installation is a pain, it's extremely difficult to share between computers and don't get me started on the constant need to reenter information.  Office Accounting Express is available from Microsoft as a free download. It has a lot of similar features and even it is more than my family (read: not buisnesses) needs.	-1
Someone mentioned it was your typical Microsoft software and they were right.  It is what you expect. I had no problems with it. I used it for my own small business and made out fine. I have a friend who used it to organize their online Ebay sales and manage their income that way.  Easy to use.	1
This is a highly functional accounting software designed to do both cash based and accrual accounting. It is more than sufficient for small businesses and probably ideal for businesses with less than 100 employees. But please note, this particular version is only for a single computer (non Client-Server). If you want a scalable solution that can handle multiple connections in a client-server environement, this product is not the answer.  Its main drawback is its speed. I installed it on my laptop (Intel Dual core 2.0Ghz, 2GB of memory, and 7200 rpm hard drive), and the speed of transactions are noticeably lagging. It is, however, still very much usable.  Its best feature is its intuitive GUI. Clearly, the GUI was designed to meet the needs of accountants and non-accountants alike. If you are an accountant who likes to use journal entries to balance debits and credits, you can do so. If you don't know the difference between debit and credit, then you will still be able to do basic accounting with this software.	1
As someone who has used Peachtree for my small business accounting needs for years I always felt that while Peachtree was a good program, it was far too comlicated and bloated for the average small business user.  I wanted something that, quite frankly, made doing my books a snap -- as easy as writing a letter -- and I found it with Microsoft Accounting Professional 2008.  First off, let me state this -- if you are an average user of the Microsoft Office suite of products then Accounting 2008 is going to be a snap for you to use.  They have went to great lengths to make sure you don't need an Accounting degree to understand it.  A lot of the features not only integrate extremely well with Office 2007, but will remind you a lot of using Office (minus the ribbon interface).  One of the really nice features of Accounting is the ability to add third-party add-ins.  Out of the box you get an integration module for Paypal, so your invoices can automatically generate Paypal requests and Accounting can automatically classify and deduct the fees for it from the appropriate accounts.  As your business grows, and you decide that you need to do direct credit card processing, Accounting 2008 lets you integrate with CC processors directly -- again, handling managing the costs and fees for you.  Dashboards are another strong feature of this product.  How is my business doing?  What is my accounts payable looking like?  How much cash do I have on hand?  All that information and more is available through quick, convenient dashboards.  You can drill down into the dashboards to pull up reports to see more detailed data.  If you use Business Contact Manager for Outlook then you are in for a treat -- it integrates directly with Accounting to help you track not only customer information, but also communications and marketing camapaigns!  No more having to hunt and search for emails sent months ago or wondering if your marketing campaigns via e-mail are working.  All in all, I couldn't be happier with the product.  I think it has been a welcome upgrade from Peachtree and thanks to its integration with other products really brings my business into a 360-view.  I know immediately how well things are doing, what my customers are up to, and what needs my attention.  If you own a small business then do yourself a favor and give this a try.  I think you will be pleasantly surprised.	1
This is an excellent source for keeping financial records at your fingertips.  Perfect in organizing all important financial records.  It has become the one place I keep my necessary information and I feel it securely registered and plain and easy to access.  I recommend this to anyone needing to store business records in an easy acsess secure place.	1
I have purchased Peachtree and Quickbooks Pro, but I must say this is the easiest of the 3 for a non-accounting/bookkeeper home based business owner to utilize. Besides the basic tasks of invoicing, expense tracking, budgeting, etc., it also the capability to set up an eBay account ($9.95/mo.), utilize PayPal, buying and selling in foreign currencies, and processing credit cards. Granted those are several features I will not be using, but one never knows when business will expand! It integrates w/ other programs so if you want to also share this information with your accountant. If you want a powerful yet easy to use program this is one to try.	1
I operate a one-person consultancy. Microsoft Office Accounting Professional 2008 has a template for consulting firms with no employees. Sounds great, doesn't it?    Well it is and it isn't.    I can't speak for other consultancies. Mine is very simple and this program is overkill.    Installation is relatively straight-forward, although non-accountants (like me) will find the set-up just as mystifying as with any other accounting program. Operation is kind of on the slow side, but the user interface is good.    I found no negatives in the application,but I suspect that is because my business needs are so minimal. Judging from the help files, the application is very capable, but I question its adaptability to very small business environments like mine.  Jerry	1
I haven't had a chance to grab into all the features but it is immediately apparent that this is a highly functional product. For the hobbiest who just want to shoot a few family flicks, this product may be a little too challenging and not worth the price but for the individual who wants the feel of a professional operation, this is an ideal offering. It does have a rather steep learning curve and I would recommend using either the available tutorials or looking into a purchased instruction. It will be difficult to get the most from the product without some help.  Read through the other reviews before you purchase. They were right on!	1
This program is a let down after Apple's much simpler program, iMovie. I've used Adobe Premier Pro and liked it, but I needed something akin to it, perhaps more like Premier Express, for the MAC. No way! This is one unwieldy program.  It seems like I spend half my time rendering and rendering before I can play the final result. Many of the tools are hard to use and somewhat unpredictable. It has a lot of advanced features, but I find that the learning curve is just too steep for the occasional user.	-1
Final Cut Express is your bridge to serious video editing.  It has most of the features of the $1,000+ Final Cut Studio for a fraction of the price. It is a big jump for an iMovie user.  Final Cut opens up a new world of expanse playground for creativity. It has a learning curve but very exciting and a joyful one.  A big difference between version 3.5 and 4 is the omission of Soundtrack (similar to Garageband but designed for videographers) audio software; but at the same time the price was slashed from $299 to $199.  FCE is a nondestructive video editing program.  Clips in Final Cut Express are just pointers to the original source material and do not affect the source files themselves in your original footage on your hard drive. It can also import multiple formats and merge it in a project; DV, AVCHD, and even NTSC or PAL.  It might be worthy of upgrading from 3.5 if you have the new AVCHD camera.  Otherwise, you may want to think again.  Check out the official Apple forum for tips and tricks.  I also recommend to check out lynda dotcom for some great tutorials.  Mac only; If you want a good Windows video program, check out Adobe Premier Elements.	1
This is easily the best solution for non-professional video editing on a Mac.  It's much more flexible (and in my experience, much quicker to work with once you've gotten used to it) than iMovie, and not nearly as expensive as Final Cut Studio.  In my opinion Apple has created a very nice balance between versatility and cost with this exceptional piece of software.  I'm very happy with it and it has everything I need (at least for now).  I upgraded from FCE 2.0 (I also have FCP 5) and so I don't really miss the Livetype and Soundtrack content that others are complaining is missing in this set.  As far as I can tell, FCE 4 has all I'll ever need until I make the leap to Final Cut Studio.  I am very impressed by the ease with which FCE 4 will capture AVCHD video content and by the fact that Final Cut Express allows me to take all of the footage I've captured in other formats (DV, HDV, H.264) with various camcorders and place it all on the same timeline.  I had Final Cut Pro 5 and it wouldn't allow me to do that - I would have had to upgrade to Final Cut Studio 2.  What I've realized in playing around with FCE 4 is that it has all the functions that I ever did in fact use from Final Cut Pro 5, so I've been very happy with it and it will allow me to finish work on a small documentary project that I'd put off because it was such a pain to manage the different file formats in FCP 5.	1
seems to be ok I have not had time to use it but my wife seems to like it not bad for the price.	1
UPDATE 11/11/09 TO ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW: Fluenz just provided this f2 update to those of us that purchased the original.  I've since gone through the first two disks.  Most of my original issues with editing inconsistencies and poor dubbing have been fixed (though, there's still one typo in the first disc that won't accept the correct answer), and now they show you what's in each session and where you left off. Other than those items, everything else in my original review still applies.  ORIGINAL REVIEW: I investigated a lot of "Learn Spanish" programs before purchasing this one.  I took all of the free demo and sample classes available from each of those I investigated before making my final decision to purchase Fluenz.  The two I ultimately decided I liked best were this one, and Rocket Spanish.  For those doing their own comparisons, here's why I chose Fluenz and the upsides, downsides and tips I've found in using it, as well as whether I think it's worth the money:  ROCKET SPANISH VS. FLUENZ: Rocket Spanish is much cheaper and operates very similiarly.  You can take a free weeks worth of courses to see how you like it. Like Fluenz, there's a bite size conversation in each class that an instructor walks you through (though it's all done verbally, no graphics).  Rocket conversation classes are interspersed with grammar classes. They can be downloaded to your ipod, and they have a pretty good internet support system.  However, what is lacking with Rocket is the "game like" interactive exercises that reinforce your learning and help you form the building blocks you really need to speak it well, that Fluenz provides so abundantly.  Ultimately, I ended up choosing Fluenz because I wanted to be sure (after having previously bought some very dull french programs I couldn't force myself to stick with)that it would engage me enough to want to keep at it each day, and give me conversational skills I could use immediately. Fluenz delivers upon this well!  FLUENZ UPSIDES: - As easy and engaging as playing a computer game: Works fine on my memory-challenged vista computer. (Sonya, the instructor, does some weird speaking where her mouth doesn't line up with what she's saying during introductions - but fortunately that doesn't happen when she's actually teaching the classes).  - Built for adults with a focus on getting you to be able to do the fundamentals well! Challenging short exercises that move quickly from one to another.  - Lots of repetition and review of previous material built into engaging interactive exercises that make you constantly improve your pronunciation, writing and memorization of the material.  - Pretty much everything you need for a trip to Cabo or Tijuana, you'll learn in Spanish 1: Spanish 1 is perfect for someone who has never had any spanish.  It covers greetings, estar/ser verbs, geneder agreement,  basic conversational needs for restaurants, airports, shopping, taxis and getting around.  It also covers telling time and numbers from 1-999,999.  - By the end of Spanish 2, you'll be able to hold a pretty good conversation if you practice with real folks enough: Spanish 2 takes you into simple past tense, more complicated phrases, and for some reason,  they hold off teaching you the more familiar form of "you" until here.  - Helpful accompanying CD's: CD's that can be loaded on your MP3 Player supplement the classes and are a great way to practice pronunciation. They also often provide a more structured approach to verbs and other issues.  - "The record it, then listen to how it should be pronounced" exercises have been helpful. It's given me more confidence to speak to people.  I bought a $9 mic when I bought this - and it works just fine for the purpose.  FLUENZ DOWNSIDES: - Could use a better supplement book: Arrives in a huge box with expensive packaging and glossy fluenz brochures that don't really say anything. Would have been better applied to developing a guide with an index of what each class covers, some of the basic verb conjugations and a summary of the better key points or tips offered in the classes (e.g. when to use ser vs. estar, a+el=al, adjectives follow nouns...) - Could use some careful editing! There's a fair amount of mistakes in the exercises. Occasionally, english translation phrases are missing words they're supposed to have, phrases you hear don't match the written form, and minor inconsistencies abound. For example, an exercise sometimes requires "veinte y dos" and other times "ventidos" before accepting your answer as correct. Other times, it won't accept an answer because you added a space at the end of the sentence. It can get a bit frustrating. (There tend to me more of these in classes at the end of discs. Maybe they thought noone would make it that far!)  TIPS: - use the F3 button during exercises if you want to hear a phrase, but click the PLAY button if you want to rehear it without erasing what you already have typed. - On exercises where you match written spanish to written english translations, just look at the english versions and try to translate it before looking at the spanish ones.  I found I learned a lot more that way - because the matching was so easy. - Until Fluenz gets around to including an index or posting one on their website, jot a note as you go through each class on the general things it covered.  This will really help if you want to go back and refresh your memory on something without having to wade through multiple classes.  BOTTOM LINE: All that said, and even with the few downsides or enhancements I'd like to see, I highly recommend this program for any adult with little to no spanish ability who wants to be able to hold their own in a conversation relatively quickly, and have the building blocks to grow their Spanish capabilities.  Living in Texas, I've had ample opportunity to practice what I've learned and have really been delighted I've been able to both understand and to be understood.	1
Good basic file cleaner, also functions to do a drive format. I use it mainly to clean up deleted files within a system and freeing up drive space.	1
This product removes inportant system settings, files, and information and causes your syetem to crash....it also picks up spyware parasite that only it can see and I found out why....iolo's SM is the parasite!!! That's right folks..it see's itself as a parasite invading your system that's why only SM picks up that one parasite every time you run a scan.  This software sucks and it nothing but a computer killer, I already lost a Compaq presario laptop to this useless software.  Use Windows Live One Care it's all you need.	-1
froze up my computer but I got a refund no problem	-1
This is a pretty good computer maintenance program.  It is not an antivirus program but windows has a tendency to get junked up by programs that are careless in their installations and perhaps worse if removed.  Most browsers leave a lot of flotsam and jetsam on the hard drives which this detects and removes.  This also does some additional house keeping to optimize memory usage and minimize hard drive fragmentation.  Seems to work well.  I was a long time user of PC Tools System Mechanic which has been discontinued and this seems to be a capable replacement.	1
This is a great program to clean up problems that crop up in your computer.	1
Iolo's System Mechanic is a great software package.  I have been using it for years now.  My computers have never run so well since I first installed System Mechanic.  I highly recommend it to anyone with a Windows PC or laptop.  It is a must have item on all my computers.  Just give it a try and you will see how it works.  ( 5 STARS )!	1
I have been using system mechanic at least 5 years. A few months ago I renewed on line and was offered version 11 free upgrade. After the download is when problems started to happen. IOLO top notch tech in India told me that Install Shield was a virus that was stopping the downloads and he could fix that for $200.00. I also us Norton Internet Security. When update definitions don't download, system mechanic really slows your computor down, I have XP,Vista and Windows 7 computors. Windows 7 is the only one that is working correctly and I have removed system mechanic from my XP and Vista systems . I suspect that version 11 is not compatibly with XP or Vista. And so far IOLO has not admitted it. Bottom line is I am looking for another software for my XP and Vista.	-1
System Mechanic is a great way to check your computer for an possible problems that it could have that could cause you computer to run slowly or to stop working.  It checks youe system and tells you the problems that it has found.  It then ask you if you want to fix them.  It is one of the easiest ways to check your computer.	1
I have used System Mechanic for a few years and it seems to really help out my older computer running XP. It is faster, less prone to lockups or crashes, and keeps the junk off my hard drive. It scans my computer automatically and tunes it up. Periodically, I run the scan and fixes manually. I believe it keeps my older computer running better than it did without this fine program. Great Program and the price is right!	1
Take this as a WARNING!. This software has been plagued with bugs causing shutdown errors and disabling Wanted startup processes. If that is not bad enough, Customer support is  Non existant. After 5 problem reports, Iolo doesn't even bother to respond.  How this product ever got Editors Coice Awards is suspect.	-1
I have been using SM for nearly 5 years now. I first purchased it when my primary computer began acting sluggish -- it was in need of maintenance but I had no idea what. For me, SM was a god-send ... it breathed new life into an aging machine and allowed me to keep it up and running for 4 more years. I love the product so much that I've used the trial version on my elder parents' machines. I also use it on my DH's machine ... and he's an IT professional. I now have new machine, and one of my first installs was ... you guessed it, SM 9 for Win7.  That said, some words of advice when using SM.  --> Back-up your registry & system before the first install. --> Check online for updates, especially after the first install. --> Always, always, always back-up your system & registry before any major changes to you computer, including the ones that SM makes/suggests. --> Don't use Active Care. Instead, use the individual tools or tool groups. --> Make changes incrementally. Reboot after making a change & re-analyze for recommendations. Evaluate. --> Before you make a change, do some research and understand a bit about what the change/fix is. Just because a program suggests a change/fix, doesn't mean that you should make it. --> SM Standard is probably sufficient. I've previously owned SM Pro and never used the additional features. However, SM Pro is non-subscription pricing but SM Standard is yearly subscription (at least as of the last I checked). --> Price the SM 3-PC license versions. I've found this to be one of the best values -- only problem, the clock on all the licenses starts ticking on the first install & activation.  That said, SM is a great all-in-one maintenance utility -- it's a worthwhile investment in your computer, and it just might improve your knowledge about PCs. That's what it's done for me.  Highly recommended!	1
I have only owned this product for a short while so I haven't experienced any problems.  Two years ago my computer ended up with a worm which sent out bogus messages to friends to infect their Windows computers.  It was embarrassing and upsetting.  I had always bragged that Macs were immune.  I purchased a version of Norton Anti-Virus and within a day, the troubles stopped.  Since then, I never leave my Mac unprotected.  This version seems to be an improvement over other versions and I feel better having it on my computer.  I now have Leopard OX so I wanted to make sure the program could protect it.	1
I have several of their products. None work well for either a PC or a Mac - and for a Mac, forget it! They have no support. You have to go with a "live" chat to India. The person in the chat room doesn't know Mac and doesn't understand what you are saying. All they respond with is "Yes," then nothing. I was also billed on my credit card several times for the same thing. I tried to get it corrected, but decided it was easier to just pay the bills as I spent several days trying to get somebody to understand me. The wait time for phone or live chat is hours.	-1
Bento is fun, cool and very useful.  It is easy to use and friendly.  Great for keeping track of almost anything and getting better organized.  All Apple Mac users need it. A must have software.  Highly recommended !!	1
<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Bento/dp/B00123WD40/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Bento</a> I wanted a database that was easy to use and Bento fit the bill.  I have used Access (UGH) and Filemaker in the past and at times found them daunting.  Bento was so simple to set up a club database it made me want to do more.  It is surprisingly comprehensive for such an inexpensive database.  Now it won't do it all but it does enough for most users.	1
Bento was released by the makers of FileMaker Pro with a very specific purpose. Interestingly, Bento was the name given to a layer in Apple's visionary OpenDoc architecture launched with System 7.5 in the mid 1990s.  Bento is a personal (as opposed to "enterprise" or networked) database that's meant to be as easy to use as the Mac itself. It has a carefully-identified set of features. These run parallel to those of iWork's Pages and Numbers. It could have been called i(Data)Base to aim at a comparable niche in the market. Bento complements Pages and Numbers nicely. The criticisms that some users (and reviewers) leveled at Bento, that it lacked, for example, scripting, Automator and network support, miss the point. It was never intended for those sorts of uses - or those types of users; look at FileMaker Pro for such extended power.  Bento was specifically designed and released without such features in order to concentrate on the less-experienced consumer and SOHO user. Some missing areas of functionality might be useful to the non-specialist user. On the whole, though, the balance between price and feature set, not to mention features, means that Bento can be safely recommended.  Bento is designed to accomplish everyday tasks using a pleasing and straightforward template-based interface The very fact that it is simple, has only one window, and just the right number and design of a few uncluttered menus adds to its accessibility and effectiveness as a flexible and powerful tool.  It only takes a quick glance at the lively, comprehensive and very well supported and moderated Bento forum to see how easy it is to achieve sophisticated date calculations and many-to-many implementation; Bento's apparent simplicity can be deceptive. Bento Users is another useful site. The documentation that comes with the product is excellent.  Everyday FileMaker has compiled a list of some of the more likely projects that Bento can handle. These include:  * what FileMaker, Inc. calls "virtually unlimited" contact details * coordinating events, parties, and fundraisers * tracking projects, assignments, and deadlines * prioritizing tasks; Bento has been used successfully in a Getting Things Done task management context * inventories, donations, and items for sale * track hours worked, payments due, invoicing * rate service providers and sellers * libraries for music, movies, and media * store files and photos related to projects and events  and, rather cryptically, since this ought to be part of any good data model:  * connect related information together to see more details.  There are ample standalone products to achieve many of these tasks - Project Managers like OmniPlan and task management - the same company's OmniFocus. Bruji's outstanding BookPedia and CDPedia. There are dedicated time management and billing/invoice suites like TimeNet Pro - though none without some flaw; and iPhoto, Address Book and iCal themselves, with the last two of which Bento integrates closely.  It is what it is So the criteria for MyMac's evaluation must not be, What's missing from Bento? Rather, how well does this reasonably-priced and robust Leopard-only product do what it's been designed to do?  First and foremost, then, is a courageous - and largely successful - attempt to make database design and management accessible to those who are not specialists or experts in such software, but who still have demanding needs such as some of those just mentioned.  Bento's main window consists of three panes:  The leftmost pane is the Source List of all your data Libraries. Libraries are Bento's top organizational level - like iPhoto 7's "Events." One Bento Library is for one set of data or project. Under these in the Source List are Bento's Collections; these are like iTunes' Playlists - subsets of the data in the Libraries. Then Smart Collections behave just as you would expect: they're Views updated in real time and as your filter criteria - or the records that matches them - change. You might, for example, want to create a Smart Collection of all unpaid invoices - as they get paid, they disappear; or of all unsold artifacts in a craft store - as they are sold, they disappear.  The records area is in the middle and is the largest pane. Data can be presented as a form (an individual record) or table of as many records as will fit into the space. You can have more than one form for any Library (each may display different fields - in different orders). This is emphasis on the user experience again; it drives the way you work. Each view is satisfactorily editable - columns can be dragged horizontally for display; you can chose which you will view too. The principles, of course, are analogous to those in FileMaker's "Align" routines and fit well with the sophisticated controls that Bento offers.  The Associated fields list for each Library is on the right. Fields are created here and dragged and dropped onto the Records area. There are only three attributes for each. There is also control over how many of these three panes will appear - you can focus on what you're doing.  This is a familiar interface; and it preserves the metaphors for data handling on which Bento rests. Similarly, searching, sorting, and summaries are all swift and intuitive. Searching can be very sophisticated and saved as a Smart Collection.  Note, though, that this means that there's no concept of separate datastores in Bento. All the data which you use Bento to maintain is managed in one place. You can still share Libraries with other users. Yet if you organize your data according to "domains" within your life (household, work, hobbies, friends, you may find it a disadvantage to access it all in and from one place by launching the Bento application itself as opposed to separately-located data files. On the other hand, this is very much in keeping with current Mac practice: it is the way that iCal, iPhoto, iTunes, iWeb (though not Pages or Numbers) all work. More evidence of the perceived target audience; for them it is assumed the task in hand is more important than file names, file management.  Data Types Given these intentional restrictions, the substantial variety of data types (nineteen of them) which Bento handles is impressive: basic text, numbers, dates, drop-downs, Booleans, graphics, sounds, movies, ratings, addresses, phone numbers and e-mail addresses and more. There's also a FileMaker-like calculation field which can, for example, concatenate text and multiple fields values as well as perform simple mathematical operations. Inevitably there will be some function missing for someone, but on the whole it's comprehensive - and very easy to use.  Templates For all its transparency, Bento is not a glorified Wizard. Fields can be controlled - use drag and drop. Fields are rearranged and resized with the mouse - usual Mac style. Some positioning and alignment of text is possible using a toolbar - though probably less than most people will come to want: five text sizes, no choice of fonts. One of the biggest hurdles that the marketing of Bento has to overcome is to make it plain that these are flexible means to an end - although the (new) user's first contact with the program will be the 20 templates that come with the software. These templates are shells; they are not one and the same as the data which they are used to present. If the designers of Bento have understood just what it is that a majority of users want in terms of the payoff between interface and ease of use as opposed to in depth functionality, then they have surely got a winner on their hands. The number of downloads (a quarter of a million) in the first few months since Bento became available suggests that is the case.  Address Book and iCal integration By default Bento has Libraries for contacts, events, and tasks. These are the same as those in Leopard's Address Book and iCal; they are not synched. Although these Libraries can be removed - "Disconnected" - from Bento in its "Home" menu, to do so is to lose access to those applications' data. What's more, to edit in Bento - or worse delete - data that's derived from Address Book and iCal is to lose it directly from those same applications actually outside the Bento environment. Integration is tight: you could drag and drop a set of contacts from the Address Book Library right into Bento's Source list to create a Collection. This "disconnection" could usefully be supplemented by a preference letting you work from a duplicate and/or advising you that you could conceivably lose permanently (unless backed up) data of which you might have thought you were only working on a copy.  Import-Export Bento supports only CSV (Comma Separated Value) for import and export of data, although there are ways aplenty to convert that after or before the fact. So that's a limitation only inasmuch as you may need another utility and two steps. The importer is drag-and-drop then Wizard-based and worked very well in testing. The Wizard asks which values from the file to be imported should correspond with which fields in Bento.  Relations The way that Bento handles relations - the fields in other tables whose data you need to appear in the current one - is one of the program's main limitations: it's not a conventional relational database. But, again, it's an approach designed to give the greatest likely desired power with the simplest steps.  In your "local" Library you create a field of type "Related Records List"; then you indicate from which Library you want to use data. Dropping that field on your form displays a small empty table corresponding to the "remote" Library. You click the "Add related records from a list" icon at the bottom of the inset table to see actual data. Bento displays the corresponding list of records from the associated library. Changing records in the one changes them in the other. Deleting a record in the "local" Library only deletes it only from the Related Records List (the "local" dataset) and not from the associated Library. This more closely follows the practice of removing a record from a Smart Folder, Collection or Playlist. It's a way of preventing mistakes - although not entirely logical, until you're used to it. It's also another example of ease of use; accessibility takes precedence. Note, too though, that Smart Collections cannot include data from related tables. That may be a significant restriction for some.  What is likely to be a real drawback, though, is the fact that by "Related Records" Bento means essentially a "Portal" to all the records in the "remote" Library. There is no concept of a "Join" using Primary and Foreign Keys. This means that you cannot be selective in the way you relate and view such records.  Conclusions Bento is a package. A compromise. MyMac's advice is that - after reading this review - you match what it can do against your needs. Almost certainly you may have requirements which Bento seems unable to meet. But look closely. Sure, its interface is user-friendly - and more important, perhaps, Bento itself is easy to use. But this doesn't mean it's in any way crippled and "less than" comparable databases of this level of complexity - relational features aside.  It's much closer to Pages, Numbers, iPhoto, iTunes in feel and scope than it is to FileMaker. But prolonged use for this review has revealed that Bento can easily be made to do more than might be apparent even from glancing familiarity with the delightful sophistication of the interface.  Given some of the things that Bento can do, there's a remarkably high ratio between effort and result. Whether or not it's for you will depend firstly on whether you have Leopard. Then on your data handling requirements: total size of data set, complexity of relations and perhaps the way (or whether) you use iCal and Address Book. Then you should decide whether one of the absent features (scripting, full control over template fonts, a missing calculation, say) rules it out.  For many users the extremely pleasing appearance of Bento will be a winner. How nice to be able to work in a fully Mac-like environment using an inventory of - car parts.  A balance has been struck: users with complex, evolving and intricately relational databases may still be best with FileMaker Pro. Those for whom the lure of an elegant user interface is important and/or who want a direct equivalent of Numbers, Pages and iPhoto/iTunes and/or seamless integration with iCal and Address Book should look seriously at Bento. Download the trial, use it carefully and draw on the many sources of online help, remember its very reasonable price, decide whether you'll be able to make Bento do a variety of things for you larger than the dedicated software mentioned at the beginning of this review can do - and see!  Pros: the interface - it's good-looking, simple and easy to use; many data types supported; integration with Address Book and iCal; templates work with many types of file; works with iPhone and .Mac  Cons: the interface - the changes you can make to its appearance are somewhat limited; poor relational capabilities; mass updates to records not supported  MyMac.com Rating: 4 out of 5 Originally published at : [...]	1
Bento is not a pro's database. If you expect the features of Filemaker or Access you'll be disappointed. But the last time I looked those programs were more than 4 times as expensive and targeted to an entirely different audience. For what it is and what it costs, Bento is pretty (expletive deleted) good. It's easy to use, easy to learn and well integrated with Address Book and iCal. With that integration it can quickly be massaged into a capable project management database. For those missing the database in Appleworks it is a definite upgrade.  I wanted a bird watching database that would include photos, recordings of songs, places, sighting dates, descriptions, related species and miscellaneous notes. I'm collecting information, not doing calculations this is a nice fit.  Within 45 minutes of installing the program I had my forms ready and was entering data. Being a designer, I went back and prettied up my forms a bit but that wasn't necessary. I went back and looked at the tutorials later and they seem pretty good.  My first inclination was to build the db in MySQL and put a web front end to it but that would be a lot of work. Bento was just what the doctor ordered. Bento is a little funky in the way it does joins but is a kind of relational database. But then I didn't want to mess with SQL anyway.  I would like to see some Applescript capabilities and a bit more flexibility in printing reports. I haven't tried to integrate Bento with Automator. With no Applescript dictionary, I'm not hopeful. But scripting a database is not something I would expect the target market for this app to even think of, or if they did, they would run screaming in terror.  Looking at the negative reviews all I can think of is that people were looking for a bargain Filemaker and not considering Bento on its own merits and in light of its intended market.	1
I was very excited to get this product and create some cool designs. However, after installing it, I found that this product isn't for the casual user. I like software easy enough to use, that I don't need a book to enjoy it. This product comes with a large book and unless you invest the time into learning, you won't enjoy this product to its full potential.	1
CorelDraw's Graphic Suites do the work of several graphic programs (both pixel and vector based) combined, and although they might not be as fancy as Adobe's graphics software when combined with each other and a host of add ons, they give you more than what most people--even graphic professionals like myself--would want at less than half the price. CorelDraw just keeps getting better and better, and this version is the best one yet.  I've been using CorelDraw for years, and for years my fellow digital artists have told me I need to "upgrade" to Adobe software. I studied computer graphics on Macs using Adobe programs at a digital-art school, but when I came home I practiced the same things using CorelDraw. There really wasn't much of a difference, except that the Adobe interface was prettier but oddly a little less intuitive.  All my friends pushed me to buy a Mac and get Adobe software. "It's the only thing artists use," they said. "We just don't use PCs. Macs are designed for creative people, and so is Adobe software."  "But Adobe programs cost more, and you have to buy several to do the same things as one CorelDraw Suite," I replied. "Some things that come standard in CorelDraw require add-ons in PhotoShop or Freehand, and that means you have to pay even more."  They pointed out deals for students. I could get Adobe software for about half the retail cost. That made sense for something I needed, but what I already had for less than half the price of one of those programs was already fulfilling my needs. Did I really need to spend that much more to be like everyone else?  I talked to a friend who ran a graphics studio. The artists working under her all worked with Adobe programs ... and she would fix their mistakes in CorelDraw. Then I went to work at a newspaper, where I created illustrations on my PC using scanned images and CorelDraw's Photo-Paint from the CorelDraw Graphics Suite. I exported my images in PNG format, and the layout artist had no problem putting them into pages in the software on his Mac. They looked fine in the newspaper when they were printed.  So while Macs and Adobe might be the industry standard, you won't be left out in the cold if you save your money and choose not to join the crowd.  Two last things: 1. As with all graphics programs, there is a learning curve. However, if you already know one kind well, like PhotoShop, it shouldn't be too hard to adjust to another, like Photo-Paint, which is a part of this suite.  2. CorelDraw tends to try new things with odd numbered releases, so the odd numbered ones tend to be a bit buggier than the even numbered ones. It's usually best to wait for an even numbered suite before you buy.	1
This sort of software comes with a significant learning curve, but Corel's habit of including tutorials puts a dent in that difficulty.  This title comes with a lot of design art; borders, clipart, design elements, fonts, etc.  This is an excellent program for design layout and vector editing.  If you're new at this sort of software, work through the tutorials and you will be pretty amazed at what you can accomplish.  I particularly liked the option to modify each individual portion of the image.  For example, I tried painting a few Kanji (Japanese written language characters).  Each stroke was individually adjustable, so if I flubbed the proportions a bit, I could fix the parts rather than start over.  I also enjoy the option to work in separate layers for similar reasons.	1
I started using CorelDRAW on a Mac 512, back in the late '80s, as an improvement over MacDraw.  As the years went by, the reality is that most of the world is on PCs, not Macs.  I wasn't doing enough graphics work to justify a good package, so I made a lot of graphics with Visio, PowerPoint, or (eeeek!) "Paint".  Finally, I moved up to Adobe PhotoShop -- What a headache!!!  It took a week's worth of classes to learn how to use the daggone thing!  Remembering how much better CorelDRAW was on the old Macs, I was eager to try this -- and I am NOT disappointed!  I have been using the PhotoPaint part of this package a lot, and it is - relatively speaking - intuitive to learn and easy to use.  Now, no graphics beginner is going to say that -- it's still a complicated package, but for someone with a decent graphics background (though by no means an expert), it's straightforward.  I have used the help file to find things, but once I find them, they are intuitive to use - I need the help file, but not a textbook or a class to teach me what the help file means!  PhotoPaint is POWERFUL, yet fairly direct.  A HUGE improvement over Adobe PhotoShop.  I would definitely choose Corel over Adobe here.  The products are a significant investment, though, so I would weigh how much I'm doing graphics before spending to upgrade to Corel, if I already had PhotoShop.  However, for any new "seats", licenses, computers, etc., I would definitely go Corel.  I also used the CorelDRAW part of the package, and for how I use vector graphics, it may be a little better than Visio or PowerPoint, but not a big difference.  I might choose it over the others, but I wouldn't bother with the expense to upgrade to it.  Note:  The Suite also includes "Trace" and "Capture", but I haven't used these, so I can't review them.	1
I was happy to upgrade my corel version 12 to the new corel x4 and .to be honestly after 3 days of stragling with this new version I starting to give up ,it suck . the program crash many time for any change aplying affect's  to your work , or you  have to wait until 1 0r 2 minutes to screen set up and keep working with a proyect. complete dissaponted. better corel come up with a update solution to this problem and even adding up the memory  from 25 to 75 still pretty slow.	-1
I have to admit that I've bad-mouthed Corel more than once in my life, especially back before my employer saw the light and dumped WordPerfect Suite for Microsoft Office, but I have nothing but praise for CorelDRAW Graphics Suite X4.  Not only is this an impressive, powerful suite of graphics design tools, Corel doesn't throw you under the bus as soon as you install the software.  If you're like me and don't have a single artistic bone in your body (I can't draw a straight line with a ruler), you would expect a fancy-pants software package like this to leave you dumbfounded from the start, with no clue on how to get started.  Much to their credit, Corel throws you lifelines as soon as you jump in the pool and makes a diverse set of rescue resources near at hand for you at all times.  I'm not saying you'll be a graphics design guru after a couple of hours - this is a really advanced,  powerful set of programs here - but you would have a hard time finding a piece of software with more impressive built-in support.  The first of several excellent video tutorials is available on the Welcome screen, and you can choose to have a built-in docket of usage tips available for every function you choose.  Users of previous versions of the software will have no problem recognizing the changes this upgrade brings with it, as you can choose to have every single change and addition from your previous version highlighted on the screen.  That doesn't sound like much, but it is a big help.  You also have What's New and Learning Tools readily available to you from the Welcome screen as well as from inside each of the featured programs.  Of course, you also have a complete help file available but you won't need to resort to using that very often.  As I'm sure you can tell by the price, you don't buy this program if you just want to take the redeye out of your vacation photos or create a cute little Christmas card to send to friends.  You can certainly do those things with this, but Corel Photo-Paint X4, impressive as it is, is overshadowed by the primary CorelDRAW application.  (If all you want is a powerful photo editor, I would still recommend Fireworks - my favorite - or Photoshop.)  I would like to have seen a few more built-in templates included, but CorelDRAW actually succeeds in making graphics design possible for even artistically inept folks like me.  This is one powerful program which actual graphics professionals should take to like fish to water.  Professionals may be the primary target audience for this software package, but Corel does a great job of making these powerful tools available and actually useable by anyone.  I also have to mention several additional software applications and features included in this suite deal.  Corel PowerTRACE X4 is of enormous help in turning traced bitmaps into images you can convert into editable vector images.  Corel CAPTURE X4, as you might guess, is a powerful screen capture utility.  The Bitstream Font Navigator is a comprehensive font manager that even helps you identity scanned fonts from an outside source.  You even get a Duplexing Wizard to aid you in optimizing the appearance of your document when printing two-sided copies.  Vista users will also welcome the integration of this software package with the Vista operating system, as the search and preview options by themselves should be of great convenience to them.  What about file formats and the age-old question of compatibility?  After all, the odds are that some if not many of your associates are working with different file formats in non-Corel software.  Well, Corel has worked to make CorelDRAW Graphic Suite X4 software as compatible as possible with other users and systems.  In this release, the list of additional new formats includes Word and Publisher 2007, AutoCAD DXF and AutoCAD DWG, and Adobe CS3.  I could go on writing paragraph after paragraph about this product, but I could never begin to describe all of its many impressive features.  Is it the best graphics design software on the market?  I don't know, as I have no experience using any comparable graphics design programs.  Even if I had, I don't think anyone short of a professional graphics designer would be able to judge the comparative pros and cons.  What I do know is that anyone who is serious about graphics design in any of its various facets would do well to give CorelDRAW Graphic Suite X4 a long and serious look.	1
Writing this review has been on my to-do list for a long time. That's because this is a wonderful product, with one big drawback. I've been hoping either to find other drawbacks that could justify a less enthusiatic review, or a solution to that one flaw. CorelDRAW Graphics Suite will do everything you want it to do, whether you're creating brochures or websites or scrapbook pages. The learning curve is no steeper that it has to be for a product with this robust a range of options. The images and fonts included will come in handy over and over. The only problem is: everyone else you work with will probably be using Adobe. You will have issues when you collaborate with others, you won't find tutorials that work for you, you won't be able to swap tips at the water cooler. If that doesn't matter to you, then this is pretty much the perfect graphics package.	1
I'm no artist.  I want to be.  But, I'm not.  I do, however, have a need to create and customize graphics, especially for websites now.  So, I picked up a copy of CorelDRAW Graphics Suite X4.  I've used Adobe Photoshop in the past, and although I know it is the industry leader among graphics software, I find it difficult for a novice like myself to learn.  When I call myself a novice, it is strictly in the realm of computer artistry.  I'm very adept technically, and work in the IT industry as a senior systems engineer.  I know software.  I figured that with the tutorials and help system in the CorelDRAW software, I should be able to easily learn what I needed to know.  Corel didn't disappoint me.  Not only are the commands a bit more intuitive than those in Adobe Photoshop, but the help system has quickly answered all of my questions so far regarding how to do anything I've needed.  Watching the video tutorials has helped teach me graphics concepts that may never have occurred to me to explore on my own.  The tools in this suite have aided me in creating custom banners, graphics, and editing pictures.  I've found the process to be easy and fun.  The program is a bit slow to open, even on a PC with a 3 GHz processor and 2 GB of RAM.  Once open, however, it responds very well.  The slowness to launch seems to be standard with such programs, however, so I am not sure it is really a fault with the software or if it is simply the nature of the beast.  There you have it - an amateur's perspective.  I'm not knowledgeable enough with graphics to review every little nuance, but for those of you who hope to be able to muddle your way through graphics creation, as I hoped, you will find this a useful and informative tool.	1
Long-time Photoshop user here, and I have to tell you that I am impressed with how far Corel has brought its suite of graphics software in the few years since I've used it.  In spite of it being a suite, it isn't bloated with a lot of specialized applications.  You get a good, solid image handling program, a vector-based drawing program and a screen cap one.  No website builders, 3D stuff or video applications which are likely to take up a ton of space on your hard drive and never be used.  In many ways I find the drawing program better than anything I've seen from Adobe.  The controls are far more intuitive.  And in fact, since one of the ways I judge how well a program performs is by how easy it is to get it up and running at a basic level without reading any of the manuals, I'd have to say that in many ways the whole suite is as good or better than Adobe's offerings in the intuition department.  If you can handle Photoshop, you can certainly learn Corel fairly quickly.  There's a lot I could say, but I'd prefer to recommend that you check the program info on this page and see if it sounds like something you can use.  I don't think you'll be disappointed in the quality, nor do I believe you'll be defeated by the learning curve.  I think you'll find this suite well worth having either on its own or as an addition to the graphics programs you already use.	1
CorelDraw Graphics Suite X4 is a very solid program. It does most of what Adobe Illustrator does (vector-based graphic design) and much of what Adobe InDesign does (desktop publishing) in one handy application.  CorelDraw would be an ideal solution for a small business or organization that does a fair amount of advertising-creation and publication design in-house. With one application (well-priced when compared to buying both Illustrator and InDesign), the content creator can achieve very professional results.  The app is also friendly to first-time users. It offers more than 80 customizable document templates that will be useful to newbies. While there is still a learning curve for new users, the app has an intuitive interface that will help get the user up and running relatively quickly.  The problem for CorelDraw is that Illustrator has become the default vector app in the design/pre-press community. Professionals should still start with Illustrator and Quark and/or InDesign -- they're the industry standards. While CorelDraw is very good, it would need to be awesome to unseat Illustrator, and that isn't going to happen anytime soon.  CorelDraw has new file formats that enable docs to be shared between CorelDraw and Adobe apps. This is handy, but also shows which format and apps are the most common -- Adobe's. If you're in a design situation where you're going to have to worry about your files working in Adobe formats, you should just go ahead and use Adobe products.  Another thing: Because the Adobe products are the standard, there are numerous training DVDs and books to purchase that can help you get the most out of your apps. With CorelDraw, not so much.  I feel bad for good apps like CorelDraw. I wish I could talk just about the app itself and not bring in a discussion about Adobe's competitive products, but given the way the design industry works -- or any technology-based industry, for that matter -- you always have to bring the front-running application into the mix.  That being said, if you're not a graphic designer or a pre-press operator but are instead a multitasking, Windows-based employee at a company or organization who has been put in charge of creating brochures, pamphlets and the like, CorelDraw will answer your needs very well. If you're someone who doesn't need to share files often with design colleagues, publishing clients or service bureaus (who are most likely using Adobe apps almost exclusively), then you have no worries.  BTW, if you're already using CoreDraw, it's worth the upgrade. The font-identifying tool alone makes it worth it, at least for me.	1
If you do any kind of graphics creation at all on a regular basis, there is one reason why you MUST have this program: Converting images to vector graphics on a budget. In a nutshell, this means that you can infinitely reduce or enlarge an image with NO distortion, and still have money in your pocket. Other reasons? I have about 2500 fonts, and the font navigator is fantastic for finding just the right typeface. The screen capture software is of little use to me, but for folks who need screencaps from games, movies, etc., it might prove very useful. For fontaholics, obsessive clip art collectors, and beginners, the program comes with fonts and a nice starter pack of clip art so you'll be ready to start playing right away.  I have to admit, I'm not crazy about the interface. It's about on the same level as Photoshop for confusion, but there seems to be a trade-off in graphics programs: The more a program can do, the more complicated the buttons and menus. I only caught on as quickly as I did because I have used other programs for years, and knew to keep looking when I couldn't find or duplicate a certain function. Fortunately you'll never really be on your own.  What's great about Corel is that they have so many tutorials and great product support. Even if you've familiar with other graphics programs, you'll find new features to explore, and if you're unsure of something, you can always find help for it. You won't find the plethora of third-party books, classes and online tutorials like with Photoshop, but with Corel's resources and/or a rudimentary knowledge of other programs, you probably won't need them. This will require more effort, but for me the end results were worth it.  While I don't feel that this program is a serious competitor for Photoshop, it's a GREAT, less expensive alternative. If you want something more than Corel's Paint Shop Pro (another great product), but you don't have an Adobe budget, you should seriously look at this program.	1
I'm going to do a short review here and say that Corel has some advantages over Photoshop for photomanipulation or editing. Where Photoshop Elements (a fine piece of software) has you estimate or use your monitor and judgment for fixing photos, CorelDraw's Photo suite has an Integrated Image Adjustment Lab --and it tells you how you are going to affect the data on a RAW image, losing image quality by various adjustments. Instead of eyeballing what you are doing, you can retain maximum detail in highlights and shadows using their sliders and suggestions. When you exceed the limits and start to lose detail, an exclamation point crops up on the slider, showing you that you have degraded the photo quality. This is probably the best photo editing software I've used for that reason.  While I like the competing PhotoShop Elements for ease of use and the fun effect, CorelDraw has more professional features and the interface for photoediting is full of information yet easy to use. Big thumbs up.	1
CorelDraw Graphics Suite x4 is a great program.  I'm no techie, but it is easy to use.  I use it for banners, manipulating pictures, or creating drawings.  The possibilities seem to be endless, but again, I'm no techie.  I would suggest this program for those who are interested in graphic design.  This may even be better than photoshop!	1
The Corel Suite X4 Installed on my Windows XP Pro system with Service Pack 2 without any problems.  Then I started the program and it loaded... and loaded.... and loaded.  It took several seconds for it to finally come up to a screen where I could do something.  While startup was very slow, I was satisfied with how the program ran from that point forward.  It appears that a lot of stuff has to load to get it started but when it is done it works fine.  The only problem I had with the program was that it hung on two occassions.  Unfortunately, it hung the system so bad that I could not even use control-alt-delete to get access to shut it down.  Nothing responded.  The second time it happened I pulled my USB drive out before powering it down and the system returned control to me!  I don't know the source of the problem but after some testing I could get it to hang consistently when the SanDisk USB drive with U3 was in the computer.  It did not do it with my Toshiba without U3.  So, maybe it is a U3 thing, maybe a SanDISK thing, or maybe the combination.  The first thing to note in the program is the very intuitive user interface.  The more advanced a program is the more cluttered the interface tends to become.  However, this Suite was fairly uncluttered given it's advanced abilities.  This is not to say there is no learning curve because there is one, but it was not as steep as I had expected.  This Suite includes CorelDraw, Photo-Paint, PowerTRACE, CAPTURE, Font Navigator and a few other utilities.  The two components that impressed me the most were CorelDraw and PowerTRACE.  The CorelDraw application competes well with Adobe Illustrator at a considerably lower cost.  It has the ability to do very advanced illustrations with multiple layers and  multiple pages.  It does a good job of page layout and allows different layers on different pages as well as master layers that are consistent across all pages.  Many professionally designed templates come with the system but it could use more.  The problem is that many of the templates are not much more than basic variations of a similar theme.  On the other hand it comes with a huge set of royalty-free photos, clip art, and fonts.  It even includes a large book of the available fonts that you can browse through to select the right one.  With strong import and export functions it can import over 100 different formats including pdf.  They have also included a link to the WhatTheFont Web site.  If you are trying to identify a font in a publication or graphic file you can copy an example and paste it into the web site.  The web site then tries to identify the font.  This is nice to have available with a simple click instead of having to open a browser, enter the web site address, etc.  CorelDraw also has an excellent preview function and live-editing that allows you to drag an image and see immediately how the text flows around it as you move it.  The other standout in the package is the PowerTRACE program for converting bitmap images to vector graphics.  I tried several logos and basic graphics with various levels of quality and found it to work very well.  Some of the conversions were not perfect but were easy enough to clean up to a really superb end product.  This was a really impressive product that performed better than expected.  The Photo-Paint product is a bitmap-editing program that has very few features that make it standout from other similar programs.  It is a solid intermediate to professional level product that does not have all the features of the high-end products but has much more than many other products.  One of the things it does really well is the support for the RAW camera format.  Other than the vendor's viewing program, this is the only program I have that supports the RAW format for my camera.  Interactive histograms also works well and lets you preview image adjustments.  In summary, I would highly recommend this program because it is priced as a middle level product but supplies programs that are at the upper end of the quality scale (CorelDraw) or upper middle level (Photo-Paint) and then throws in a great utility for those times when you need to convert a bitmap logo into a vector graphic.  It is worth the price for the CorelDraw alone so it is a great deal to have the other products added as part of it.  A great product with sufficiently high quality features that I can overlook the slow startup, and highly recommend it to anyone.	1
I use Photoshop CS3 and Capture NX to work with digital images. I welcomed the opportunity to work with and review CorelDRAW graphics Suite X4, during my short inclusion as an Amazon Voice member.  Let me start by saying that this is a very complex piece of software, not for the novice. As soon as I opened Corel Photo Paint (the software consists of two main pieces of software: 1) Photo Paint and 2) Corel Draw) the interface looked intuitive and simple. But when I began to try and do some things that I typically do in PS or NX, I was LOST! This should not be surprising, these are all different pieces of software!  That said, within a few minutes I had discovered some of the elementary image adjustment functions and really liked how they were arranged. To adjust color, saturation, brightness, and a few other parameters, open up the image adjustment lab and go.  The program runs VERY quickly on my Dell XPS 720, Windows XP SP3 box with 3 meg ram, fast HD, and decent video card.  The software is vast and this review only chronicles my initial impressions. It takes time to get used to new software but my initial impressions lead me to believe that I will be exploring this software further.	1
Pages sucks, small hard-drive Macs suck.  Maybe I'll go home to Windows where I started.  It all started with  Pages...  I have to get a book out or hit Google every time I want to save a document.  Why did they change something that has worked great forever.	-1

Its good.  Used in class room setting with H.S. students.	1
My software package says it's version 21 on the front, but the disk installed as version 20, still that's not what made this unusable. The package notes the Parent's Choice award for version 20 on the back so we still thought we'd be okay.  It says it works for Windows 7 and it did install (although I needed to input my administrator password), but then we got a shock when we started the software.  Instead of getting the menu shown on the box to take a lesson, play games or whatever, our menu said only 'teacher' or 'student'.  Turns out the software was for a classroom.  The password required to set up the 'teacher' option, without which the 'student' option wouldn't work, was said to be in the administrative manual.  Unfortunately no such manual came with the software. I can only assume the wrong software was on the disk so we are left high and dry.  Since the package is opened, I can't take it back to the office supply store where it was purchased and will have to mail the software and receipt to the company (address in 1 pt font which requires a magnifying glass to read) and the refund will take 4 to 6 weeks.  I tried calling the number on the website and got a ridiculous phone menu run around.  After listening to the options and choosing the one that seemed to apply another recording said a representative couldn't help and to interface with the web instead.  Surely I'd just chosen the wrong option and called again choosing the other option, but got the same message.  Why would there even be a phone number to call if they aren't taking calls.  Very annoying.  I can't speak to the software we expected to receive because we didn't get it, but potential buyers should know that if you have a problem, there is no support.  I'm willing to accept a mistake, but having the package say version 21, the disk say version 20 and different and unusable software actually install tells me this company has very poor quality control.  That coupled with no support  is a disaster.  I do not recommend buying this software.  Update: The website does not list the version 21 software as a choice in the technical support area but I tried another type of search and found it.  I had to email to get the missing password and was rewarded with a list of instructions to follow to get the software to work, including the password.  I'll try it tomorrow.  Hopefully this will help, otherwise the software is still going back.	-1
I bought mine for $23.00 at Walmart.  I used the USB cable that came in the box. I was moving from a Dell laptop with Windows XP installed to an Acer Aspire, with Windows XP and some other software already installed.  I was worried about duplications, so I deleted some software from the Acer before starting.  There's a long list of instructions to follow and the sequence is important.  They are presented twice: in the manual, and again on the screen as ysou go through the process.  It takes a while ( five hours), but in the end all software and files were transferred, even Quicken and Eudora (which I use a lot.)  Well worth the money!	1
I recently purchased a new PC from Dell, and I bought this software (from them) along with the computer.  Owch, what a mistake, I should have read the reviews here first.  I had pretty low expectations/requirements from this software actually.  Mainly I just wanted to move over my settings, email, and music.  How about 0 for 3!  Firstly, the software can only be used 1 time (owch!).  That is their ridiculous licensing agreement.  Second, you need to install it on both the machine you are moving from, and the machine your are moving to.  Alright, so I'm moving from a windows xp machine to a windows vista machine.  Surely that's got to be the most common configuration these days right?  Surely that's the one thing that would work right?  wrong.  Firstly, the installation crashed on *both* machines.  After downloading updates from the web, re-installing and uninstalling several times it finally seemed to install correctly.  Smooth sailing from there right?  Nope.  First, I tried to do the transfer over ethernet, since I have a home network and that is supposidly supported by this software.  That didn't work at all.  So then I grudgingly tried a transfer over the cable that they provided. The software had a lot of trouble recognizing the cable, but after fiddling with that until it worked, I finally set up a transfer.  Several hours later, my vista box had developed major problems, none of my email or bookmarks or anything had been transfered (only documents) and I was one cheesed off customer.  This software is completely (and I mean COMPLETELY) worthless.  It's a waste of your time, and a waste of your money.  Believe me, the way to go is just to get an external hard drive and drag the files over you want to keep, or do it over your home network if you have one.  You'll save yourself a lot of time and a lot of headaches doing it that way, believe me, I wish I had.	-1
PCMover is supposed to make moving your system from one computer to another as painless as possible. Unfortunately it doesn't work very well. First off the software is confusing to use, even for a tech savvy person. Second, each end of the transfer cable needs to be plugged in to a specific computer but THE CABLE IS NOT MARKED in a way that lets you know which end is which! I wasted an hour trouble shooting before realizing that I needed to swamp the cable around.  The transfer is a long, arduous process. Mine took nearly 10 hours. After the transfer completed, most of the programs that were moved failed to work correctly, including: QuickBooks, LightRoom V 1.3 and ACS Data Base among others.  I suggest avoiding this program unless you absolutely have to have it. It was a total waste of my time.	-1
Anyone as foolish as myself who bought Drive Idiot 1 will be glad to know that if you try to update it it will tell you you have to pay for Drive idiot 2 this is only 2 months after purchase of Drive idiot 1.  Drive idiot 1 sucks and doesen't do anything only mess up your MAC HD.  Use disk utility it has all the same options as this garnage software.	-1
There is a lot that this software simply won't or can't do.  I use it for some things but I won't ever buy it again.  Not even the upgrades are worth download time.  Get something else.	-1
Here is my beef.  The price dropped before shipping.  I asked Amazon.com to honor the price at shipment time.  I was told to take a hike and Amazon no longer honors its own prices.  I won't be shopping here again.	-1
I have PDF Converter Professional 4.0  I doubt if 5.0  is any more functional  or reliable than 4.0  Thus I would not recommend this program to anyone. Several features have never worked others work poorly. The interface is awkward.  The support knowledge base is very limited.  E mail tech support is $10.  This is a lot to fix a problem that never should happen.  I resent paying money for a program and then being asked to pay more money get the program to work.  I used to use Adobe Acrobat 6.0.  This worked every time.  My suggestion is that if youuse this program professionally and your time is important to you consider an Adobe program.  Certainly don't buy this one.  If you buy this program you will regret it.	-1
Update 3: 06-04-2010  My xp machine at work was having problems and before I did anything, I UN-installed PDF coverter pro 5. [as per Nuance instructions]  I ran a repair on windows and everything was running fine again.  I RE-installed pdf converter pro and crap!  When I went to activate, it said I had activated this copy of pdf converter pro 5 the maximum number of times....blah...blah....blah...  Here we go again.  Then it offered me a button to click on to BUY the program?????  I went over to ebay and picked up NITRO PDF 6, on a charity auction for like $40 (w/free S&H)  I tried a few pdf creations and a few pdf conversions with NITRO PDF 6 and so far it looks to work just as good, or better, than nuance's pdf product.  I'll contact Nuance about the problem by fax (can't seem to reach them any other way without PAYING for assistance. If their !#@!$$#@^%  product wasn't such a PITA, no one would have to contact them).  Needless to say, I downgraded this product's rating to a single star.  Update 2: 04-04-2010. Reinstallation of XP operating system CRIPPLED by nuance trying to revalidate license CONSTANTLY during the reinstall of XP.  My XP MCE 2005 operating system lost access to it's HAL.DLL file, requiring a reinstall of the OS.  This PITA pdf converter lost it's ability to validate it's license and CONSTANTLY preempted my XP reinstall attempts. Two attempts at removing the pdf converter still did not stop it from trying to validate it's license. Even used JVPOWERTOOLS 2009, to remove EVERY registry entry for pdf converter AND nuance; still invaded my reinstall of XP. It got so crippling that I simply used a new hard drive, initialized it and did a clean install of XP; then transferred data/user files afterward.  The validation process they use is a real PITA.  I'd gladly pay (...) or even (...) to just get a USB security dongle , so they can get rid of that USELESS license verification process, built into their product.  Nuisance (oops, nuance) has NO fallback for those times you must do a clean install on your OS, (AND are unable to access your OS in order to UNinstall their product "Prior to" the OS reinstall).  ------------------------------------------ Update 11-01-2009  Be forewarned about activation & loss of product usage.  ------------------------------------------ Attention !!!! WARNING !!!!  Nuance does things a lot different with their product's installation & activation. A couple re-installs of your windows operating system due to windows issues; and/or a couple hardware upgrades like new video card or new hard drive, and PDF converter 5 could cease to function.  My installation had this problem recently. At almost (...), you expect a program to function 24/7/365. When mine stopped working, it really interrupted my work production.  So, If you have this software installed and want to upgrade/changed ANY internal PC hardware, you MUST uninstall the pdf converter pro 5 software "BEFORE you make ANY hardware changes" !!!  NOTE: UNinstalling the program in effect "DE-activates" your pdf converter pro 5. Thus "releaseing" the license key and this doesn't count against your "5 license activations", before product QUITS working!  I work with pc hardware and do pc repairs/upgrades 40+ hours a week.  On my work PC, I have upgraded my mobo 3 times this year. My hard drive twice. (one of the perks of being the IT helpdesk guy) (last update was to an Intel i7 Core.)  Recently I had lost windows booting abilities, so I installed a newer, larger, hard drive. So I installed the brand new hard drive and did a clean XP Pro installation.  As soon as I loaded PDF Converter 5 Pro, it wanted to activate.  Then it went online a few seconds and then an error window popped up saying I had exceeded the 5 activation allowances that Nuance allows.  I emailed Nuance the details. I mentioned how I own 4 retail box copies of this s/w.  After going back and forth with support, they re-activated my license number.  But I could not make PDF files or about 2 days.  *****How to prevent this from happening again?****  If you are using PDF converter 5 on your PC, then ALWAYS, ALWAYS, ALWAYS do an UNinstall before changing ANY pc hardware.  The activation process takes serial numbers from the internal components and uses them for activation calculations. (probably the serial # of mobo and/or hard drives).  When a serial number changes due to new hardware, the s/w launches another activation attempt. Five activations are allowed before the s/w is disabled.  You MUST UNistall the software before doing hardware upgrades, to keep the activation counter from decrementing one of the 5 activation allowances.  This is the sort of thing that should be listed on a neon colored label, on the CD's paper sleeve or jewel case. And/or on the box it comes in. I told Nuance this, but I doubt they'll do anything about it.  Unforunately, it is not like there are a lot of choices for the combination software of PDF maker with a PDF converters.  You have: 1. Nuance pdf conveter pro 5 2. Nitro pdf. 3. PDF tools [by solid documents]  Adobe's acrobat pdf maker is pricey and has no conversion abilities. It only creates PDFss.  Other single function s/w conveters are:  Able2extract Docudesk PDF conveter elite  Oh, and as far as product functionality, this software does okay.  PDF to word conversions do okay with text; but sort of crappy with images. (But it seems to be this way with all pdf converter applications).  ------------------------------------------------------------ I'm on day 1 of using this software.  Creating a PDF is working fine.  Converting an existing PDF to MS Word is working fine, so far.  Converting an existing PDF with a table inside it; into MS excel is working OK, so far.  Annoyances/problems:  1. After installing software onto my PC, an annoying "activation" NAG screen keeps popping up everytime/anytime I launch the program and/or toggle between CREATING a PDF vs CONVERTING a PDF. Plus it decrements from 30 uses to none.  So off I went to ACTIVATE this whiner!  2. Activation:  a. I just went online, registered,  and then activated it, but apparently it requires further  MANUAL intervention by the enduser (lazy programmers at Nuance). Because I am still getting the pop-up about not being activated.  b. License key & activation problems: The setup/installation onto your PC works just fine with numbers and LOWER case letters . [For entering the alpha-numeric license code during installation of the software onto your PC].  But as soon as you get to Nuance's website and try to activate/register, by using their "Paste-serial-number-from-clipboard" button, you get an error! These boneheads keep kicking back your serial number as INCORRECT until you make it ONLY numbers and only "UPPER case" letters. (why doesn't Nuance spend  a couple bucks on a 5 minute programming "FIX"  and let the stinking webpage AUTO correct a small issue like these)  Next, trying to correct a serial number which was already "pasted" into the Nuance webform box [but contained lower-case letters]. Whenever I'd click my mouse next to a lower case letter and try to CHANGE it to an UPPERcase letter, a wretched pop-up window keeps WHINING about using "The PASTE button function only". For every 1 lower-case letter you try to change to upper-case; you have to answer 2 pop-up windows and make them go away. [Hey tightwads, fix your website's serial number entry form). [Go to Elance and hire a programmer for (...) an hour and FIX the problem with "YOUR" [NUANCE's] website]  I tried to be  nice  and contact Nuisance (whoops, I mean Nuance) about their problem. (Starting off an end-user experience like this is NOT going to endear me to rush out and buy any more NUANCE products; especially  if they can't make the registration & activation process easier, functional and more streamlined)  Here's a frustrating experience; Just try contacting these Tight-fisted pukes with a simple FYI, to tell them about a website issue of their's.  These pukes  expect you to shell out (...) per incident  just to contact them. Sorry dudes, I'm not paying to fix YOUR website problems.  SUMMARY:  Pros - products looks/acts OK so far.   - cheaper than Adobe  Cons - Just hope you NEVER need to contact NUANCE for ANYTHING. Or I should say; PLAN to NEVER contact them. [you can't even throw them a bone about how to improve their website without getting hit up for (...)]  -poor activation web setup  - Deceptive/hidden cost details about tech support :   - no mention on software box   - no mention inside box, nor in User manual  I bought this program for myself. Once I test-drove it awhile, I was going to make recommendations to a large client about maybe switching to Nuance (from Adobe). I really have my doubts now; especially regarding their "nickel & dime-ing" attitude toward their end-users.  09-24-2008 update:  I tried converting a bunch of pdf's to word, so i can work with the data within the pdf's.  The program goes fairly fast through the conversion process, until you reach 99%. Then it sits there for what seems like an eternity.  My core-2-duo is not pegged for CPU usage (only 25-50%), but the hard disk light is almost solid.  I found that this program really has a hard time with any text within a book's front cover. Mostly comes out as a mangled mess. The text pages are decent in the translation. But plan to run auto-format within Word, to get things cleaned up.	-1
This is my revised review of Norton 360 version 2.0.  I previously had given a positive review and my review was rated as "The most helpful favorable review".  However, after extended use of the product I have to remove my first review and mark this product as DEFECTIVE.  I believe that if the professional review sites that have given this product positive reviews were to run extended trials and followed a policy of revising their initial ratings that they also would drop their ratings after they find that the product starts failing after extended use.  I installed the Norton 360 version 2.0 trial edition downloaded from Norton's website and ran it for 13 days on my Windows Vista SP1 PC before activating it. During that time my system did not have any noticeable computer slowdowns and it ran in the background without any need for intervention.  It also ran just fine for another 7 days after purchasing a license and activating it.  Sounds great, right?  Well, in my second week of owning it, Norton 360 v2 suddenly started having "Service Framework" failures and told me I should reboot my PC to ensure stable operation.  I found that I better heed the warning and reboot, because my Quad core PC with 3 GB of RAM would turn into a brick that barely functioned. This is really, really annoying when you are in the middle of doing something and suddenly you have to interrupt your work to reboot the computer... oh and saving your work takes about 10 times as long since the computer suddenly doesn't want to function.  I went through tech support and they had me try a lot of different fixes, including doing a complete uninstall and reinstall of the product. Doing a reinstall actually seemed to make things better for a few days and then suddenly Norton 360 decided it was time to start failing at random intervals again.  I looked on message boards and found that some people claimed that there might be a corrupt file on your system that Norton was scanning and failing on.  The problem with that claim is that is 1) Reinstalling the product and doing a "comprehensive" scan didn't cause a failure so I don't think that is really the root cause and 2) even if that was the root cause, if a security product like Norton is going to crash when it finds a corrupt file, then exactly what value does the product provide?  Do you really want to go on a witch hunt for corrupt files on your computer every few days when Norton starts failing on you?  BOTTOM LINE: I wish I could recommend the product, but I CANNOT RECOMMEND.  It simply is DEFECTIVE.  When it works, it works great, but it is NOT STABLE and I believe that any installation of it WILL EVENTUALLY START CRASHING EVEN IF IT SEEMS TO WORK AT FIRST.  If you decide to buy anyway, here are a few notes:  - By default eavesdropping protection is turned off. You can enable it via the settings page. I saw in a professional review that they really recommended turning this feature on.  - You need to ensure that any other virus or firewall programs that you have installed are fully uninstalled before installing this product. Having multiple competing products installed can really mess up your system. I used the Norton removal tool from their web site to fully remove the trial version of Norton Internet Security that I was using prior to installing this software.  - If you are uncertain about this product, download the free trial from symantec first, but note that my problems with the product didn't show up until about day 20 of having it installed.  - If you choose to download the full version of the software from symantec, they place a copy of the full version under C:\ProgramData\Symantec Temporary Files on Windows Vista. Just grab a copy of the software and back it up. This way you don't have to pay to have an "extended download period". Or just keep a copy of the trial version around since it allows you to activate it using the product key that the symantec store gives you.  - If you are deciding between purchasing the shipped package from Amazon or Symantec, I would choose Amazon in a heart beat. Amazon customer service rocks. You also could probably download the trial version from symantec, buy the package from Amazon, and then just enter the product code from the Amazon package in the trial software once the Amazon package arrives.	-1
This was a great deal.  It was shipped fast, and it arrived as promised.	1
The list of things wrong with this POS is incredible...  This thing chokes trying to download its own updates.  The status bar freezes and I have no idea what is going on.  I click on the update option, and it says it is already running a scan.  1. No it isn't, and 2. that's not what I told it to do.  When I tell it to SCAN, it asks me to setup the backup program.  Which leads me to another complaint...  Norton 360 includes TONS of "features," and you don't get any option to choose what is installed.  You MUST install EVERYTHING, even though a lot of them are just low-quality versions of things you can get for free otherwise without being locked into a proprietary subscription.  Many of the "features" of Norton 360 are just reminders to use some of Windows included abilities.  Delete temporary files?  Defrag hard drive?  Thanks, I'd rather have bought the cheaper version.  I installed it, and Norton gleefully displays a green check to indicate that I am "protected" against viruses, even though it had not yet run an update.  WINDOWS had to tell me that my virus program did not have a recent update, and I had to manually tell Norton to update.  Apparently Norton thinks "protected" means that your virus program will be working TOMORROW, even though TODAY my virus database is over a year old.  COOKIES are listed as "unrepairable virus" in the scan results. Can we say "overkill?"  The backup utility cannot be disabled.  You can try, but it won't stop.  And it only includes 2 GB of backup space!  You have to "buy" more backup space, and 2GB is not enough for anyone's stuff.  For giggles, I checked the price of buying more storage from Norton.  It is literally 10 TIMES the cost of buying a hard drive.  Even more: Norton pops up a little window telling me I have a "threat" which is being "processed", and yet it won't tell me what kind of "threat" it is.  Apparently it could be anything from a tracking cookie to a virus/worm.  It doesn't show up in any of the history or logs.  I spent 30 minutes on the phone with tech support, and the final answer was "this product is not designed to provide that information" (pretty much word-for-word).  By the way, when I called, the first thing they tried to do was charge me $100 for a technician to "fix" my computer, even though I called for help using the software, not with any PC trouble.	-1
How bad is Norton 360? - I bought a copy and promptly uninstalled it the next day! It's extremely intrusive and prone to result in very slow operation on the PC it's installed on. Norton Anti-Virus 2009 is much, much better! I friend of mine had the same experience.  What an amazing screw-up of a product!	-1
Very easy to install and it has held up great so far. Perfect for a computer novice (such as me). But tell me again - why do these softwares have to come in such big boxes???	1
I have been an avid Norton Symantec user for over 13 years.  This is the worst product EVER. It slows your system down so much that I had to disable most of the features, which an average user will not know how to do.  My biggest complaint is that once the "virus update" expires.. it renders the entire software useless. I couldn't even go in and make simple changes to the settings, nothing to do with the virus update feature. PLUS  A pop-up comes up everyday twice a day begging me to buy another year subscription. That is false. What they are really asking is that I buy the software again. Once a year is up .. you might as well throw it in the trash OR give it to someone else OR wipe your hard drive and install a fresh copy.  I am not happy with it at all! I will never buy any anti-virus or internet security software from this company again.  I have heard of complaints that it will crash your system the day it expires.  Uninstalling any Norton products are difficult and you should find a good article on the internet on how to do this.  NOTE: You must uninstall any anti-virus software if you are installing a different brand.	-1

WARNING to anyone thinking about buying this product! Please understand that you will not be buying this product only RENTING it. If you do not renew every year the product stops working....COMPLETELY! I'm not just talking about updates, etc. It actually tells you that it has stopped working and it won't work unless you renew. I have just wasted more than 2 hours with Norton's online tech support. This is the case with ALL Norton products and I am quoting the tech.	-1
just what we expected to protect our computer and it has done a good job so far, nothing fancy and we still have some minor problems with junk that needs cleaning, maybe from norton	1
This Norton product works as advertised! I searched online and asked my colleagues for a security software product that provides more than simple protection you get from a single focus or category vendor. I(tm)ve been a user and fan of Norton for years, but wanted to ensure I got current information. I am very pleased my research led me again to Norton. This product is fantastic. Easy to set up, monitor and change if needed.	1
I ordered this and tried to have a 15 day free trial installed to see if it worked and how well it worked. I wish I had tried the free install before I ordered it. I still haven't received the package yet but now know I want nothing to do with it or Norton. It would not install from the free download from Norton's site. It gave me an error after about 30 to 40 minutes of grinding. It took me to an error message with a link from Norton telling me to install a Microsoft package VISUAL C ++ 2005. I tried, it failed to install. I tried about three more times. searched the net for answers. none to be found. After about four or five hours of this, I contacted Norton support group for help. After a wait of about half an hour, I had someone start a conversation with me and he asked to be given a minute to "REVIEW" my problem. He left me for about another half an hour and the screen said he left the room. I waited, waited and another guy comes on and starts to troubleshoot with me. After about an hour, during which he is helping other people by asking me to excuse him for a moment, he gets the same error messages. He says "CONTACT MICROSOFT, It's their problem". If you have ever tried to contact Microsoft you realize how this came across to me. I have lost about 6 hours now and still have no solution except to cancel my order from Amazon. Norton just wants money, they could care less about people with problems. Stay away from all Norton products, there is no support.	-1
I was first introduced to 360 as a beta tester and enjoyed testing the product. I like the ease of installation. I like Norton products and have used them for years. All the companies I have worked for as a ME secured their PCs and networks. Have never been downed by rogues virus attacks. Will never use the other guys.	1
I've been a Norton user ever since the olden days of Apple: The Mac Performa was the first color computer I ever toyed with.  I had Norton 6 (I believe) and loved it.  It was small, simple, effective.  I used the full Norton software on later PCs and found them to be bloated and memory hogging.  Not worth the money I paid for them at all.  Enter Norton 360.  I do appreciate the more silent footprint of this new Norton, however, all they did was lessen the GUI's presence.  The bloat is still there, you just don't see it.  Take a simple virus scan for example: I have a dualcore Centrino laptop and just a virus scan brought the poor thing to its knees.  Unacceptable.  Also, the cleanup works TOO well, essentially making Firefox "forget" everything even when you tell it not to.  The straw: the heuristic virus protection.  It blocks websites that are in no way dangers to your computer, and deletes software programs that are just updates or patches (not warez).  It assumes something must be dangerous just because it opens a port to function - guess what?  A lot of software might need to do that, including some of Microsoft's own.  It's no big deal.  IT doesn't even prompt you first, it just takes action.  I don't recommend this.  If you need total protection look into McAfee instead.	-1
At first I was enthusiastic about Norton 360, Version 2. I installed it on computers with both Microsoft XP and Vista Home Premium operating systems.  I previously had Norton Internet Security installed on both, so I thought it was just an upgrade.  For this reason I gave the program 4 stars.  Now I'm not sure.  After two months the XP operating system ran without any problems either on Visa or XP.  But then the new computer running on Vista crashed.  I lost all my files and had to access the recovery portion of the hard drive to get the computer to boot.  Then I had to download all the security downloads.  I have only dial-up so this has taken many hours.  And I have to reinstall all the programs I use - and delete the junk programs that came with the HP computer.  What a mess, and what a lot of work. Even the backup disk, created with Norton 360 didn't work as I hoped.  I do have all the files on the disk, but they did not all reload after I fixed the crash.  Update 3/1/09:  Maybe the problem was with the operating system, Vista Home Premium; or maybe it was Norton 360.  And maybe the glitch was repaired with a later update I download.  Anyway, the problem hasn't manifested itself since I reinstalled everything. Furthermore, I must admit, the problem never did occur with the WinXP operating system.  Also, it should be noted that the program I'm using has been updated with a new version.  Update 6/7/09:  I have continued to use Norton 360, Ver. 2.0, for another three months with Vista and WinXP and have had no new problems. Actually, I have grown to like Norton 360 and now rely on it with confidence.  It has reported stopping over a hundred threats and has stopped me cold when I accidentally entered several attack sites.	1
I'm careful about what I let get onto my computer. I try not to visit suspicious websites; I never download attachments in emails unless I know who sent it and what it is.  That said, a lot of "safe" websites are full of adware, and even our best friends can pass along viruses without knowing it.  Years ago, our family lost two computers simultaneously to the same (particularly vicious) virus.  And yet I've never been too serious about virus protection.  If it came with the computer, and I could get a year for free -- great.  I'd try it.  Then I'd start to get irritated by the seemingly-constant "update" popups.  Virus software is serious about keeping you safe, to the point of almost being annoying.  After the year is over, I'm typically not in the mood to pay for continuing virus protection.  The result?  You'd like me to say I got a virus, right?  Nope, I've been without up-to-date virus protection for over a year, and I've been graced with nothing more than adware (which I remove manually using a free program I found online.)  Lately, however, both my desktop and laptop had been running slowly, and I got a bit paranoid.  What if they were both saddled with byte-eating viruses and I didn't even know it?  One thought leads to another, and suddenly I'm convinced I need Anti-Virus software.  So I get Norton, because the last one I had was McAfee and those little red popup messages drove me crazy (at least with Norton, I'd get a different color of popups, right?)  First, I installed Norton 360 on my 6-year-old laptop; the process was slow, and I'm thinking with the amount of hard drive space Norton takes up, it might not be worth it.  My 2-year-old desktop, on the other hand, handled the installation just fine.  The installation process was slower than I expected, but once Norton was up and running, I didn't have any problems.  It asked if I wanted it to scan my computer for badness, I said yes, and it found a handful of semi-malicious cookies.  According to the box, Norton 360 does everything that Norton Internet Security and Norton AntiVirus do... plus more, including a feature for restoring deleted or damaged files on your computer.  They also give you 2 GBs of "secured online storage service," with the "option to purchase more."  2GB doesn't seem like much anymore, does it?  Still, it's something, and if you don't already have your own webspace, you may want to consider backing up certain files online, in case of a house fire or something.  All in all, if you're already careful about what you put on your computer, you take care of your own cookies, you already have free adware protection, and you regularly back up your files your own way, you may be able to do without this.  But it's nice to have this stuff all in one package, and -- dare I say it -- it's even kind of nice to get alerts when there IS something suspicious going on, assuming you really care.  If you need an extra selling point, the box claims you'll receive "free, unlimited 24x7 email and chat support" from Symantec, as well as phone support.  There's also a 60-day money-back guarantee.  I haven't actually needed that support yet, but that's a nice promise.  Edit: After several months of using this product, I have a somewhat minor complaint.  Even when I turn off the protection (a necessity when playing certain PC games with which anti-virus software can interfere) and I instruct the program not to turn itself on without my permission, it turns on anyway.  I'm also annoyed by the pop-ups encouraging me to engage in Norton's online back-up storage feature.  I have my own webspace, I do not need this feature.  I'll turn off the alerts, but a few days later, they're back.  I thought Norton would be less intrusive than McAfee, but that doesn't seem to be the case after all.	1
While I can review a computer game after "beating it" - often a week or two after purchase - with Norton 360 I waited several months after installing it to come to any judgement. There is always a learning curve with any serious software product where you tweak the settings, learn what combination works well for you, and so on. I really feel a serious package like this should be tested out for many weeks - not days - before a decision is made about it.  I run Norton 360 on my main home PC, from which I run several websites. This means I am running database development software, graphic editing software, video editing software, logging software and much more on this machine. Plus I'm a game reviewer, so I'm running some pretty intensive games on it as well. My machine does a great variety of things. You would think if an issue was going to trigger, that I'd probably trigger it.  I definitely agree that you need to spend a little time setting up the software to work well with your surfing and net patterns. Someone who does a lot of networking operations might need ports more open than someone who just reads email and wants their computer locked up tightly. Now, that being said, the interface is rather straightforward to do this. Once you set it up, you're all set.  I haven't run into any issues with Norton 360 once it was set up well. Yes I had to do some tweaking to get my various POP mail accounts working - many of which are customized and using non-standard ports. It was a one time operation, and has been set since then.  In terms of the quality of the anti-virus software, I always give Norton very high marks. Our cable company provided free anti-virus software as part of our cable bill. Virusses got right through their "shield". When I put on Norton, Norton instantly spotted those virusses and eliminated them without any fuss.  I completely agree that some systems out there might have issues with this software package, just like some people are deathly allergic to peanuts. Where an XBox 360 is a perfect clone of every other XBox 360 out there, every PC is unique. Every person has different internet settings, different mail software, and perhaps most importantly, different virusses and spyware that have snuck on your system. Undoubtedly there is always going to be some unique blend of these things that causes a system to crash - with OR without Norton 360. In general, though, I really feel Norton 360 should work extremely well on most systems.  Well recommended - but as always, back up your system before beginning, and have your network documentation handy so you know which specific ports you happen to be personally using, to keep those open.	1
Symantec's 360 has a surprisingly excellent product in version two of this made for home use item. The product integrates very well with Office 2007 ( the Full Enterprise Version , as well as lesser  types).With the full MS Office and Norton 360 to be installed,two reboots is common. Norton 360 covers PC Security, Identity Protection,Backup and PC Tuneup in broad terms. When errors in install occur, a reinstall utility covers and easily fixes problems. The setup shuts down Ghost until install is complete, and also until the backup setup is decided upon since 360 has its own backup technique. After initial setup, the configuration is pretty much automatic. All items are set up on what seems to be a standard basis, with the exception of the backup routine, which is something that can be turned on or off ( unlike the other three major sections) so that you can use the Norton GHOST backup should you want to do so. Its an impressive piece of software, great price, installs and operates extremely well. For a family machine with a non-technical or partially technical background, this is a great piece of software that operates well, and operates automatically. It fits a niche market, and does not , as some say, cross over into some of the regular Norton areas; especially since it is simple and easy to use.	1
I installed this into my computer and the feature all work fine and the program is rather smooth.  The only thign about it is that it does not play nicely with other virus programs such as McAfee.  Which can be a bummer because they each have different focuses.  But for the money I would suggest Norton.	1
With Norton 360, I haven't had to worry about nasty little bugs infiltrating my PC.  It's easy to use, especially since you can schedule scans, and I haven't had a problem which leads me to believe it's doing it's job.  The only downside that I found was having to disable other security software so that Norton 360 would work correctly.  Besides that, I like it.	1
I have used in the past MacAfee and AVG antivirus software, I have always struggled to use them as they have multiple add-ons you have to buy and install depending on what area you want to be safe in (though common sense dictates if I use a computer and buy an anti-virus I expect to be safe everywhere when using my computer)  I had the opportunity to grab a copy of Norton 360 and I am very glad I did. Norton 360 is exactly what an anti-virus software needs to be and offers protection in all areas of your computer. Last year I got a Toshiba Satellite that included Windows Vista (which is a pain already) and a trial version of MacAfee, I never understood how to optimize the use of the MacAfee application, it had too many windows and you had to upgrade different things at different times, I was relieved when the trial expired and I got to install a free application called AVG. AVG was good enough for what I needed but suffered from the same thing, 'if you want anti-spy ware you have to download and install this', 'if you want security using the internet install this other thing'...  I uninstalled AVG and installed Norton 360, first of all the installation was quick, it ran for over an hour (as I decided to have it scan my laptop while installing, if you decide not to it may take less time) Once I completed the setup and the application opened I went through the menus in one single screen which is great! The four areas in which the application is divided are in a single screen with submenus when you click over any of them, from this main menu you can scan, setup and even defragment your hard drive (the PC Tune-up feature helps optimize computer performance).  The time it has been installed in my laptop I have not noticed any slowness in performance and it has worked smoothly in the background while I surf the web or work in it.  One feature I liked is the 'Identity protection', in which you setup a profile with your personal info (including credit card number) and it will keep you safe when doing transactions online, you setup a password that Norton360 will require when doing transactions regardless of any security measures the web pages you use have. In my case I access my bank online to do transactions all the time and purchase from web sites, this feature serves as an additional security option. Norton360 also allows me to monitor my network and it even has functionalities that the software that came with my wireless router doesn't have!  Forget about buying antivirus software which makes you buy add-ons to feel safe, Norton360 has everything you need in one box.	1
Let me preface this review by noting that I'm running Windows XP, so results with Vista may differ.  Norton 360 seems, in general, to get mediocre reviews in the press as well as from a major consumer publication that I read routinely. As a consumer, I don't have access to--for instance--the kind of virus-catching software that professionals use to test the effectiveness of anti-virus packages. As a result, my review can only really address general performance, the user interface, and convenience.  General Performance. Norton 360 seems fine. It doesn't noticeably slow down my system. I haven't gotten any virus warnings, or in fact ANY kind of warnings. So I can only conclude that the software is either seamlessly protecting me, that no threats are being encountered, or that I'm being infected with all kinds of viruses and other on-line threats. Given the lack of symptoms of any problems and my history of good experiences with Symantec products, I assume all is well.  User Interface. The UI is simple and intuitive, perfect for people (like me) who just want peace of mind without a lot of fiddling. There's an icon in the system tray with a green check, which tells me that all is well. When it changes to a red exclamation point, I know I have to do something, and the interface for correcting the problems is simple. There are four areas of protection: PC Security, Identity Protection, Backup, and PC Tuneup. Each area has a simple and intuitive menu that appears when you hover the mouse pointer over the corresponding icon.  Convenience. For me, it's perfect. Virtually all functions are scheduled and/or occur automatically. Unlike a Trend Micro product I used before, the system doesn't constantly present me with issues and ask me what I want to do about them.  After over a month, I've had no problems. However, given what I've read about Norton 360's performance on catching viruses (on a consumer web-site I trust), I can't in good conscience give this product five stars.	1
First, let me just say to those that already don't know:  Before even thinking about buying this, visit Norton's website and download a 15-day trial, to see if it works well with your system.  It seems to me that Norton 360 is a program with a huge ego:  If installed on a new clean, freshly-reformatted PC, it will serve you well.  As advertised, these are the features you get with the pacakge:  Antivirus Antispyware Email scanning Antiphishing Rootkit detection Identity protection Web site authentication Network monitoring Firewall protection Automatic backup and restore 2GB secured online storage PC performance tuneups Automatic updates* Embedded support Optional antispam and parental controls  One aspect that I noticed is its no longer a system hog like it used to be.  It even scans, defragments and mantains your system while your computer is idle.  However, if your machine is no longer in the "new, fresh" state, get ready to face some problems.  It seems like it complicates things with other utility programs that may have already be installed on your machine(thats why I said "Big Ego.")  I had problems with Norton 360 when I installed it on a PC that was reformatted half a year ago and it didn't run too well: freezing, hang-ups and Live Update complete stopped working.  It was also difficult to uninstall.  However, on a newly bought PC it worked pretty smoothly so far with no complications.  But don't take my word for it.  PC Magazine has an extensive review on it.  EDIT:  Amazon took the link off...I guess we're not allowed to post 3rd party links.  However, if you google "Norton 360 review" it will be one of the top links.	1
Used version 12 for a few months. Liked it so upgraded to version 14. Takes a lot off my mind trying to remember birthdays, appointments, yearly tasks, etc.	1
I miss Outlook but this is a good replacement product.	1
Just misses the mark. I suppose the software is good but it is a little difficult to get to do what I want it to do.	-1
When I first started fooling around with we pages back in 1994 when the Internet was fresh and new my HTML editor of choice was a simple text editor.  Over the years the Internet has evolved and technology has changed, but I've stuck with a simple text editor for most of my needs.  I tried Microsoft Frontpage back in the day, but felt it was just so bloated and inefficient that it wasn't worth it.  It was with hesitation and a lot of reservations that I finally decided to give Microsoft Expression Web a shot -- and wow, Microsoft has come a long, long way.  First thing about Expression Web is that it's so flexible depending on your skillset.  Are you still working with Frontpage extensions?  No problem!  Are you moving up to using stylesheets?  It will guide you and help you along!  Maybe you run your own site with custom coding -- Expression understands PHP, Javscript and ASP without a problem!  It will even do syntax checking as you write the code.  Even if you are a web guru Expression Web can help you out.  With extensive support for XML, CSS and data sources you will find everything you need to keep your site chugging.  Gone is the inefficient, slow and incompatible features of Frontpage and in is the support for WWW, XML and CSS standards.  You'll love how it can help you not only keep your site compliant with the latest standards, but also how it helps with promoting your site from "dev" to "prod" with just a few clicks.  I tried Dreamweaver in the past, and found it not only too complicated, but way too expensive.  Expression Web is really going to give Dreamweaver a run for their money -- and their user base.  Once you get the hand of Expression Web you may even find yourelf looking at the other Microsoft Expression products such as&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Microsoft-Expression-Blend-2/dp/B0013ITQ9Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Microsoft Expression Blend 2</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Microsoft-Expression-Encoder-2/dp/B0013IRKCO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Microsoft Expression Encoder 2</a>&nbsp;to further expand your web toolkit.	1
i've owned this program for one week.  i was initially concerned, as it did not come with a manual.  well, after a week, i've found that a paper manual is not necessary to fully operate this program.  i can not claim that i'm an expert after one week, but, i do re-assure you that this program is quite simple to operate, it offers possibilities that i never before imagined in my previous architecture program.  this program is challenging, in that it offers so many options that i can spend hours looking through all of them.  while $99 isn't cheap, especially compared to some of the other programs, i assure you that it is leaps ahead of my 3 year old 3D program.  i haven't purchased other programs to know how it compares to other more recent products.  i can say that it is phenomenal in comparison to three year old programs.  i am very glad that i made this purchase and i would do it again, knowing what i know now, i might even pay more for it.  it is likely to become one of my favorite toys.  [after i've owned this program for a month or two, i'll submit an addendum so that you can read more of my findings.]	1
I have been an avid user/teacher of Chief Architect Inc software since 1995 (I mainly use Chief Architect X1 in my /drafting and design business) but the line of consumer software like Home Designer Suite 8 is a steal for anyone wanting to quickly play with Architectural ideas and scenarios. This program will not produce construction documents (blue prints) but is perfect for communicating ones creative ideas to building professionals.  David J. Potter	1
Vista is a great OS if you have a decent computer.  The visuals are great, lots of quicker work arounds than XP to accomplish goals half as fast.  Except for ME windows has always been a strong OS and VISTA is the best Windows has to offer.  When you upgrade from XP you will see the awesome difference.  A little larger than XP but runs way better than XP and is alot more user friendly.	1
Service Pack 0 was a disaster, now we have SP1. Still a disaster. I almost get the impression that microsoft is being run by FEMA. Vista is still slow, still buggy, and still crashes. Since it would not run properly on a new dual core Athlon, with 4 gigs of RAM, I installed it on my new MAC Pro with 2 quad cores and 4 gigs of RAM. And it actually works well with boot camp. However. OSX works much better. So, thank you ill Gates for pushing me to buy a Mac.	-1
Item as stated and fast shipping	1
Have been running this on my laptop for months.  No complaints and really I notice no real improvement over XP	1
This `upgrade' will not install on a `clean' hard drive, nor will it `upgrade' XP Pro. There is a work around, but it involves duplicate installs and other technical `workarounds' so if you are not technically savvy, don't get this `upgrade'.  If you do want to consider this `upgrade' be aware that Windows Vista Home Premium does not include FAX capability and needs the Office 2007 suite along with Outlook 2007 (which does not support animated gif's, among other things) for most eMail.  I would not consider Windows Vista Home Premium an `upgrade' as it requires more system memory, is a step backward in features, and more cumbersome to use.	-1
The service pack updates to Vista make a world of difference, finally letting this OS shine.	1
Installed about a year ago without any problem on Vista certified hardware.  It was running ok with one annoying problem - it was constantly loosing the video settings every time I reboot.  Then these wave of security patch start to roll in.  I only use the PC for watching blu-ray movies and after installing 100+ security patches, the system is so slow that I cannot finish 90 minutes movies without rebooting the operating system.  Microsoft eventually did fix the video resetting problem (one of those 100+ patch fixed it), but OS is pretty much useless for doing what it is design to do.  Now I have to make a decision to add additional memory to satisfy this memory starving OS (I am currently running with 2 GB) or wipe it clean and install Windows XP.	-1
As has been reported by many other reviewers, there are significant problems with Vista.  Yet despite its flaws, it is a great user friendly product, which explains in large part its continued dominance as the desktop operating system.	1
I tried Windows Vista Home Premium SP1 to see if it was worth upgrading my home XP machine to Vista. I just can't find any compelling reason to upgrade to Vista. I have I gig of memory in my home machine and with XP it runs fine. With Vista I have to turn off the Aero graphics due to limited memory on my machine. Once the Aero graphics are turned off the system runs close to the speed of XP but you loose the major feature upgrade of Vista which is the improved graphics.  I have a MCSE so I'm very familiar with Microsoft OS's but I just don't find Vista to be very intuitive. Seems to me that they put pretty front ends on the same interfaces that are running once you get through the new front ends on system preferences and configuration. I find it harder to move around Vista and find things, and I have given it a good chance to become familiar with but still find it non intuitive.  I've had issues with the wireless on Vista. Easy to connect to my linksys but the connection keeps falling off and and then adds a new connection with a new name to the wireless list. I have had no issues with XP or my Mac 10.5 on my linksys router. Not sure why Vista is struggling but it has become a pain to deal with, especially when someone non technical is using the laptop and I'm not home and the connection drops.  So, if you are an XP user I wouldn't waist the money on the upgrade. Stay with XP unless you are looking to purchase a new PC or laptop and then you will be stuck with Vista whether you like it or not.	-1
What a mess! Vista was an ambitious undertaking by Microsoft, and sure it "looks" better than XP, but when it comes to what matters, Vista fails remarkably in nearly every aspect than it claims to excel at. If you've got XP and it works just fine for you, there is absolutely no way I can recommend that you put yourself through the nightmare of Vista. If you manage to get past the hassle of getting this properly registered and working, you're then forced to put up with the numerous upgrades of other programs which, if you're lucky, will function error-free. Problem is, you shouldn't have to count on luck. Many programs which are less than a year old won't even function on Vista, after you've already spent hours on end trying everything possible to make them work. So it's up to you individually. Some have found it to be a seemless transition with no problems at all. Others, like myself, have had nothing but issues and a pounding headache. I for one reverted back to XP, and I plan on keeping it that way for the forseeable future.	-1
If it were possible to give Vista a negative rating I would do so.  Vista is unlike every other Microsoft Operating System ever produced.  Every new Microsoft Operating System came with its annoying little bugs.  Those of us who liked Microsoft Windows myself among them usually got used to living with the MS bugs or "Features" as they are called by the company.  Vista was inflicted on PC users because somewhere Microsoft got the notion that a more complex difficult to use memory hogging buggy wizard filled operating system was more secure thus much better.  Vista is indeed far more secure than any earlier Microsoft product for one basic reason it never lets you do anything.  You can not be productive on Vista unless you jump through more operating system generated hoops than you will ever see during a lifetime at the circus.  Don't get me wrong.  I am not one of these geeky guys that wants everyone to switch to Linux or Apple.  I love my Microsoft Windows XP PC but, Microsoft Vista is a gigantic LEMMON no amount of Service Pack tweaking will ever fix.  I have XP systems and I will be keeping my XP computer.  If I buy a new computer with Pretty but way lame Vista pre-installed I will reformat my disk and install my trusty capable XP operating system workhorse.  To say Vista is super slow at start up, during regular use and at shut down is an understatement in its most profound incarnation.  If you buy a system with so much memory, new graphics, sound and other high priced, hogh powered hardware producing a system that costs a kings ransom Vista will speed up a little.  Vista is a money hog because many old XP devices do not work on Vista at all and others need lots of tweeking to get them to work.  Now Vista is so improved it will never crash, naw Vista just freezes up so completely you can not do anything productive.  Vista will make you more productive because all its freeze up's will have you doing the same work again and again and again and again hoping it won't freeze before you can save it!  Finally Vista is a big useless paranoid fat nag.  I mean at every turn Vista wants to reformat, check or otherwise make sure something you are doing is allowed.  Vista is the Fort Knox of Operating Systems but think about it who wants to live and work in Fort Knox.  Vista is an operating system as such it is an extention of your home or business.  Adding Vista to your computer is like stationing thousands of nagging police officers whose job it is to challenge your every move every time you become even the least bit productive.  Vista is an operating system with so many paranoid subsystems built in that it is effectively useless for its intended productive purpose.  For all the reasons I list herein I would strongly advise against purchasing Vista.  I feel Vista is the prettiest operating system Microsoft has ever produced but under that pretty surface is a code full of maggots that grow into extremely pretty productivity killing computer bugs.	-1
I build my own computers.  For my newest gaming computer I selected Vista as my O/S.... BIG MISTAKE.  A long list of problems and such.  It is gaming hostile, very slow, very buggy.  And the nvidea video driver for Vista is bad news.  It was soooo bad I just bought XP PRO SP2 and removed Vista from my system.  XP is wonderful in comparison.  Vista was soooo cruddy and slow. PASS on this one.  Not recommended.	-1
Why SP1??? Because SP-zero does not work. Do not let Mad Doctor FrankenGates experiment with you. Microjunk products do not work. Vista will crash, Vista will boot very slow. And you will pull your hair out. On top of that, you will get horrible customer service. If you are running XP, keep it. One star for this product is way too generous.	-1
This is just another, in a long line of horible experiments by Mad Doctor FrankenGates. Your system WILL crash, it WILL run slower, and you will be sorry for buying this boxocrap. If you buy an 8-core Mac Pro and use "boot camp", then and only then will this junk actually work. That's what I had to do. The only good thing about vista is, it got me into something much much better than microsoft. Mac OSX. What a pleasure.	-1
on the life-cycle of this item & the other vista versions aswell & if ur one of the xp users out there who have been afraid to upgrade to windows 7 or 8, then this item is for u.., u'll need service packs 1 & 2 for this item after installing it & some versions alredy include sp1 & if u get a version with sp1 included - then u'll only need to download & install sp2, - but its comparable to windows 7 & it'll give a person the chance to get the feel of a newer operating system before upgrading to 7 or 8.., - just make sure u get a sealed copy before purchasing - if the description on isn't clear about it being a sealed copy or not - then ask the seller to be sure before buying ! ..   NOTE: lately i've seen some copies of this software thats marked " OPEN BOX "  & sometimes that just means that its been opened for display only & it can still be activated after its been installed,  ASK THE SELLER if thats the case before buying cuz if is the case - then u can still get a good price on an open-box item if the software hasn't been activated & the key is still included  - BUT other times the keys to those packages have been lost & they cant be used again - even if someone says u can buy a new vista key,  microsoft no-longer sells new keys for vista to the best of my knoledge - just do the research by asking the seller ! ..	1
I had been running XP for some time, but I ended up getting a virus despite sophisticated internet security.  I figured I'd upgrade to Vista and do a fresh install.  The installation was easy.  After everything was up and running, I noticed it ran pretty well on my system.  I have a 2gig AMD 64 dual core processor.  After about a week, I noticed that my computer would progessively slow down day by day.  Which is funny since it hasn't gotten any more sophisticated.  It just takes more memory.  I have a gig of memory, but even with that, Vista was using around 68% at any given time...just to run the OS.  I could use a little extra memory for my system, but why would I want to spend money to upgrade my hardware just to run the same stupid tasks?  This OS takes 15 extra gigabytes of hard drive space too.  15 gigabytes can hold about 1000 mp3 files, and I'm basically subtracting it from my computer without question so I can have Vista hog it all.  Now I know why Macs have been selling so well.  I don't have $1500 for a new Mac, so I put a copy of Ubuntu Linux on my computer.  It took 10 minutes to install.  It's just as flashy, more intuitive, and it does everything Windows can do-and it's friggin' free.  It reads all my music files, it reads all my pictures and videos.  My printer works and I have Open Office.  From the time it takes to boot up Vista, I can log on, off, and back on again 10 times over.	-1
Vista is indeed a revolutionary OS. The user interface was a MAJOR improvement over XP. The Game Explorer is a very nice addition for gamers. And best of all, it doesn't crash! It's just stable.  I have used Vista Business since its release in January 2007 and it has been absolutely rock solid. It's fast (faster than XP even on systems with more than 4Gbs of RAM), much more secure than XP, compatible with older software, sexy Aero effects, and boasts loads of new features and improvements. And I already mentioned the much improved interface.  Yes, it does have a few bad things. UAC is one of them, but that can be easily turned off. Slow file transfer over the network was indeed a problem early on, but was fixed even before SP1 came out. And DRM is still just as bad as in XP.  Windows 7 is coming out in a few months, but it's not out now, so Vista still holds the crown as the best Windows version out there. Actually, Windows 7 is nothing but Vista SE with a new name. I ran the Windows 7 release candidate full time for a month, and realized that I had been running "Windows 7" since January 2007. Heh. I will still upgrade to Win7 though, if I find it for cheap (the current upgrade prices are NOT worth it if you already own Vista).  Overall, this OS has served me well over these past three years, and just felt compelled to write a positive review. Good job Microsoft! :)	1
I installed this over a copy of Vista Home edition not long after upgrading the motherboard and processor.  Vista Ultimate does not like to be installed if a lot of peripheral USB devices; camera, memory readers, memory sticks, camera bases etc. are plugged in during the installation.  I just pulled them out and it installed very cleanly for me.  Then I reinstalled these devices one at a time and Vista is very graceful about going out on the web and getting the right device driver.  I am still not really sure what Aero does for me (except give me an occasional bunch of diagonal windows to choose from).  The CD/DVD burner support works adequately.  The thing is pretty stable after it screws around with drivers and updates for a couple of days.  It's nice getting the 64 bit disk with the 32 bit version but it requires a clean install, it is not an upgrade.  If it ain't broke...  It's not a priority upgrade over XP but it's got some nice features and it's attractive.  It has been pretty easy to live with - MS has got most of the pain removed.	1
I have not had any application or driver install correctly on Vista, even programs certified for use with Vista.  This is the worst garbage I have ever seen and is occuring on more than one computer.  Don't move away from XP Pro at any cost.	-1
There is absolutely no reason to buy this product.  Stick with XP and wait and see how Windows 7 does when released this year.  Vista adds some eye candy that you can get for your xp system for free or a small fee.  It does add heaches, UAC (goggle that one and check the number of problems), terrific bloat, system slow down, driver issues, software issues,etc...  Also take a look at the people giving 4 and 5 stars and then listing a host of problems.	-1
Since so many of my clients have PC's that come with Vista, I decided it was time to bite the bullet and learn more about it.  I have a fairly powerful PC and decided to go against everything people had recommended and to upgrade over XP rather than do a clean install. I had my XP drive ghosted and figured the worst that would happen is I'd have to go back and try again.  The upgrade was as smooth as silk. When it was complete, I had to download new video drivers from Nvidia, but they installed properly the first time and I've had no problems with them.  So far, none of my applications or games has complained about Vista. I'm mainly running Adobe CS3 and Office 2007. A few games have had minor issues, but I've been able to tweak them and get things working.  For someone like me who does a lot of file copying and manipulation, the new Explorer is 1,000 times better than the old ones. There is much less confusion when copying files as to what will happen when the same files already exist, and it is much easier to view photos, view audio files, etc.  I really like the Aero interface. It looks slick and it's easy to move between Windows.  In short, while Vista may just be "warmed over XP" under the hood, I've been pleasantly surprised.	1
User friendly and easy to use.  You'll be creating your own videos in no time.  You'll also be able to edit them and make them look professional.	1
I bought this to use with Xfer-ing my old VHS "How to" videos to DVD.  1st problem was that the 2nd, bonus CD's serial number was coming up as invalid.  2nd problem: Unable to capture any video.  I have 4 different video capture devices: 1. pinnacle (bought in 2008) 2. Dazzle 100 series (bought in 2008) 3. Dazzle 150b 4. ADS tech X2 (bought in 2007)  Despite trying with all 4 devices, I keep getting the error,"Cannot start Capture graph".  Amazingly the corel website does NOT even list this error in the search results!? Yet when googling for it, you'll find this user problem on probably a 100 + webpages.  (I guess if corel denies the problem exists, then they don't have to address/fix it)  This is the first FULL video editor package I have bought in years. Each of the 4 RCA to USB video capture devices came with either an SE "special edition" or LE "Light edition" of either pinnacle studio or Ulead videostudio. All the stripped down programs actually WORK. The full version of Videostudio 11.5 does NOT!!!  After numerous update attempts, repair attempts, remove & re-install attempts, I gave up. I never had a ulead[corel] program be so messed up.  I had a copy of videostudio plus X2 on order (it came up on amazon on sale for $39.99 last weekend). Today I saw that it had not be shipped, so I cancelled the X2 version.  The lack of knowledge base support for an application with serious issues, is criminal.  For crying out loud, just fix it with a patch and list the fix in the corel knowledgebase. To omit it from the corel website is the sign of a real craptastic company. I always liked ulead products until this one.  A huge disappointment.	-1
This looks like it would be a good product, with a useful suite of features. But the version Amazon sent me didn't include a registration code, so I couldn't install it on my computer. I tore the box apart looking for it, scrutinizing each scrap, but it just wasn't there. Very frustrating.	-1
I've long looked to Ulead VideoStudio as the best amateur video editing software out there, so I'm happy to finally get the chance to compare this package to those I've used in the past, namely the ubiquitous Windows Movie Maker and&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Roxio-Easy-Media-Creator-Suite-10/dp/B000UJUJ7U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Roxio Easy Media Creator Suite 10</a>.  I have to make clear here that I'm wholly an amateur when it comes to video editing (as anyone who has seen one of my YouTube videos could tell you), so all of the technical specs of software such as this are quite over my head.  The beauty of this product, though, is that it meets the needs of the newbie just wanting to edit his home movies as and offers up a huge buffet of options for advanced amateurs who know all of the acronyms, like to argue with other gurus about formats and resolutions, and produce darn-near professional quality videos for any and all occasions.  The software may initially look difficult to learn and use, but it doesn't take long to learn the basics - and then you can learn more advanced features at your own pace.  It goes without saying that you're going to need a pretty powerful computer if you want to use this software without tearing your hair out.  The system requirements are, in my opinion, something of a joke.  There's no way I would try running this with a mere 512 MB of RAM (or, in the case of Vista, even 1 GB); I would recommend at least 1 GB of RAM on Windows XP and 2 GB on Vista - anything less, and you're just asking for problems.  Memory becomes even more of an issue if you're going to be taking advantage of the wealth of HD capabilities this package boasts.  Those HD capabilities really are a big selling point, by the way (as you can tell just by a quick perusal of the box cover or product summary).  You certainly aren't going to be saving any HD videos to Blu-Ray using Windows Movie Maker.  The package comes with an impressive number of templates, filters, effects, etc., and the complete novice can rely on wizards to help him/her put together an impressive project.  Once you've mastered the basics, you have all kinds of enhancement options to choose from.  If you've thought about paying someone to put together a slideshow using old family pictures, forget about it.  It's easy to create a slideshow of images in VideoStudio, and you can basically control every aspect of the production, from inserting music to specifying the transformation settings from any one image to another.  It's almost as easy to create a video and truly customize it to your desires.  One particularly nice feature is the ability to add a voice track as well as a music track rather than limiting the user to one "audio" track.  You can also insert multiple overlays, which is another powerful feature.  And you can export your finished projects all sorts of ways: to your PC, to DVD, to online sites such as YouTube, and to iPods and a number of other portable devices.  VideoStudio isn't perfectly intuitive.  For example, you have a plethora of formats in which you can render a given file, but the rendering option is by no means prominent on the display.  I would also like to have seen some kind of cheat sheet for basic operations included alongside the manual, but I have to say this product manual itself isn't all that bad (although, as with most such software, your best source for information and guidance can probably be found in online forums and the like).  The manual is especially instructive in terms of setting things up and connecting to different digital and even analog video sources.  As far as the installation goes, I had no problems whatsoever (for the record, I'm running Vista with 4 GB of RAM).  Right off the bat, it came up saying I needed Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Redistributable SP1 Package and Microsoft DirectX Feb2006 Runtime, but the setup program installed those for me.  From then on, it was smooth sailing, including the extras that come on the bonus CD: WinDVD 8, MediaOne Plus Photo & Video Manager, and ULead Disc Image Recorder.  The bottom line in this: Ulead VideoStudio 11.5 Plus is, in my opinion, the best and most economical video editing program for amateurs on the market.  Even if you're only interested in making the most basic of videos for any purpose, I would definitely recommend that you take a look at this package.	1
Filmmaking  and video editing are not strengths of mine or applications I  plan to spend a great deal of time with in the future, but I would not consider myself a neophyte either. I have authored DVDs with other software programs, created titles, added subtitle tracks to movies, combined sources from multiple input media. I have tried Roxio Creator 10, Windows Movie Maker and a range of freeware applications. My objective in this case was to capture, contrast and compare a specific group of scenes from three versions of the same film and burn the files to  DVD with menuing and commentary. I tried to duplicate the same procedures in each of the software packages, starting with WMM and concluding with ULead.  My impressions were ULead was not any more difficult to comprehend than the others but it did offer more flexibility and enhanced features that resulted in what I consider to be a superior end product. I cannot discount that `practice' with the other packages may have rendered this software more intuitive however, I found the GUI as easy, or easier to understand and follow than WMM or Roxio, and I elected to use video editing in lieu of the wizard feature.  While I only gave it a cursory overview, I happen to be a stickler in some areas like documentation so the inclusion of what I consider to be a thorough user manual - albeit in miniscule type size- rather than requiring the user to log on to a website and download huge PDF files is a big plus in my opinion.  On the other side of the ledger however, I could not register the product as I received a pop-up error message informing me I had attempted to register a `legacy version' that is no longer supported.  I did have some installation issues, not with the process itself but rather with outcomes. Installation procedure automatically hijacks default status for copying/playing DVDs, all image display, and contributes to performance degradation by installing at least three start-up applications InterVideoDVD (and this is WinDVD8 while 9 is the current standard), CorelPhotoshop monitor and calls Quicktime, if it is already on your hard drive. It is not an uncommon practice among software creators, what is uncommon here is I do not recall seeing an option during the install to maintain my current default programs. This application seems precariously close to bloatware in my view. I have 4GB of memory, or 3Gb or relevant memory with Vista but when this application is open I cannot run any other  background activities that require higher resource allocation like Outlook. One major sidenote, any program that starts off with the advisory you may want to double cache size is by definition a resource hog. While the system requirements indicate this software will work in a 512mb environment, I think anything under 1Gb is just asking for frustration.	1
The fifth time was a charm (!) when I tried to install this software on my Windows XP based system. I have a relatively new system and so I did not anticipate all the problems I had in installing this software. I've used&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Adobe-Premiere-Elements-4/dp/B000UK6OUK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Adobe Premiere Elements 4</a>&nbsp;before and even&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Nero-8-Ultra-Edition/dp/B000V9YXJ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Nero 8 Ultra Edition</a>&nbsp;for some light movie editing and never had a problem with the install or in burning the final DVD. With Ulead VideoStudio I am stumped.  The first 3 times I tried to install it the installation simply froze in the middle and I had to shut down my system to get it to work again. The 4th time I was able to load the software and then it asked me to insert the bonus CD which comes with WinDVD - the CD authoring software - and extra audio, video clips. The moment WinDVD started to install on my system it tried to delete some files which caused a fatal system error and I got blue screened. I began again the next day, I installed the software again and did not put in the bonus CD as suggested.  The software is easy to work with, it can convert your DV tapes to digital media or you can edit your digital media. It's easy to drop in your video clips, drag in audio and use transitions. You may not able to use your computer for much else while editing unless you have a very powerful system. However, once you're done editing, it can be very frustrating to go through the authoring process.  My system keeps freezing repeatedly and it becomes really difficult to create a DVD from this software most times. I am not sure if the hassle is worth my time, even though the software interface is intuitive and easy to use. If I get the system freeze one more time while trying to make a DVD, I am going to uninstall the software.	-1
About the only video I'm interested in working with is the video that I get from my cell phone.  I have Motorola RAZR so it isn't some obscure model no one ever heard of.  I was surprised to see that there was no support for the 3g2 file format in Ulead.  I contacted Corel to make sure that they did, in fact, not support this file format.  They don't--at least not yet.  They may support it in the future as patch update (no time line was given).	-1
This program is still the best program on the market for amateurs and other levels of the everyday user and maybe even a few `pro-sumers' like me. If you're a parent and your goal is to just very simply create some nice looking home movies to burn on DVD and distribute to other family members or even upload directly to Youtube (which is a very nice feature), then Ulead Video Studio is looking like the best program out there for doing so. It's also, by far, the easiest to use and understand while not forfeiting presentation quality and features doing so. The learning curve on this is very fast and dedicating a mere ten minutes to the manual will yield pretty impressive results.  Some folks might think that you'll have to invest thousands of dollars on a new Mac so you can have a new version of iLife and do all this without having an intimate knowledge of video editing or processing, but this really is a much better and a much cheaper alternative. While buying a Mac is always a cool prospect, you may not have to do that just yet.  The only drawback I could find was in using the built-in `Movie Wizard' which is a bit restrictive, even though it's `drag and drop'. Creating movies this way, renders your footage faster and gives you a much grainer, or lower resolution end result. If you can avoid using this feature, I would, as having the ability to fully control the output settings is an absolute must.	1
Video editing is one of those tasks I'd like to get better at but have never gotten around to actually getting better at.  My experiences in this have been enduring constant frustration with Liquid Edition 6 and then some video editing solace with Sony Vegas.  With my recent upgrade to Windows Vista I not only was one of the few absolutely delighted with the switch I also found a nice, extremely user-friendly video editing program in the new Windows Movie Maker.  Of course, Windows Movie Maker is also rather limited.  What it does it does well. But if a person wants to go beyond that they had to take a rather big leap to the next levels of programs.  With Corel Ulead VideoStudio I find an amazing progression from absolutely basic/entry level to highly functional and flexible.  Again and again recently I have found Corel to be the master of designing programs that are both highly capable and highly oriented towards the user experience.  Meaning their programs do a lot and are always surprising how easy they are to pick up and use.  This video software is no exception. It has the user friendliness of Windows Movie Maker with substantially more capability and options.  The learning curve is very slight.  Not because everything can be picked up quick but rather because Corel has approached this program understanding that not everyone can spend the hours and hours learning about software before getting to a real project.  Instead, they have built in different modes of working.  From the really basic Wizard that is a lot like movie maker to a more robust editing context that allows for a whole lot of creativity.  And within that more expansive creativity they have made for a very wonderful ease of use, with the layout and the functions quite easily recognizable and quite easily applied. The arcane qualities of most video software are pushed aside for very clear, very obvious tools.  At each step I found myself easing my way into more and more knowledge.  And that's another quality I've noticed with Corel. The software itself is a teacher in a way.  And not a boring one. Rather, unlike so much headache inducing software (Liquid Edition) this Corel was actually fun. Again the emphasis on the user came out.  No this is not as robust as some other programs.  But it is also significantly less expensive and significantly less resource demanding. I used it on my high quality Dell XPS 710 quad processor, 4GB, up to date video card, Windows Vista desktop (noticing it was faster than other video programs). Of course it worked well on that.  I also used it on my Dell e1405 XP laptop, bought for battery life, that has no video card, sound card, and only 1GB of memory.  It didn't run as fast, of course, but it still worked great. Surprisingly great.  I'm absolutely pleased with VideoStudio and will be heartily recommending it to friends and family. I've not gotten even to the full extent of learning this program--I'm excited about applying Flash to future video projects--and yet I don't feel like I'm missing anything.  This is an ideal mid-level video software meant for people who want to step up in their production but don't want to, or need to, invest in the higher level programs. It's very user friendly, very processor/memory friendly, while offering a wonderful progression of capability for any level user--whether the absolute beginner or the master wanting to do something quick and without bother.  Love this and look forward to a lot more video work in coming months and years.  Corel has made it actually fun.  And that is a huge thing for those of us who don't particularly love sitting in front of the computer all the time.	1
This software has a nice interface and plenty of features for the home/consumer video enthusiast. There's also a great user support forum linked to the publisher's website.  Unfortunately, I found the program to be somewhat buggy and cannot recommend it. The most significant issue was that my PC's DVD drive wasn't recognized by the program when it was time to burn a disk. There were numerous, time consuming workarounds and fixes mentioned on the Video Studio forum. One user even solved his issue with the software by reinstalling his PC's operating system. But who wants to go through all that?  I downloaded the trial versions of Sony's Vegas Pro and DVD Architect Pro, as a previous reviewer suggested, and they worked just fine on the same PC. Those programs are definitely worth the extra money if you value your time.	-1
I ordered this item as I purchased last year a Toshiba Satellite that included a DVD Movie factory by Ulead that works pretty well, very cool templates and other functionalities that have allowed me to create very good-looking DVDs. There were some opportunity areas (for example, if you add a music file to a menu you have no way to edit the audio file or select a portion of it, I have to use Cool Edit to format the audio file to what I need) So I thought the retail version would have more functionalities than the one I already had and decided to get this one.  First of all I had no problems installing it, while I am stuck with the awful Windows Vista, installation ran smoothly and with no incidents. The software comes with a manual that I honestly have not used, the features are very easy to use and so far I have not needed to consult the user guide.  There are three applications and only two of them I have used, the one I haven't tried I really do not have a use for it which is to extract video files from a camera or similar device. I own a Sony DHC and I use the basic windows functionality to extract the files from it.  The first one I'd like to talk about is the video editing software included. While it may not have as many functionalities as the retail box makes you believe, it has some interesting features. First of all, it allows you to select an intro theme to your video which then you can add music to, same as the DVD factory I previously owned, there is no way to edit the audio you use in here, so say the intro is about 10 seconds and you add an mp3 file of over a minute, the song will play over the menu AND your video. There is a neat feature that allows you to trim your video and select the bits and pieces you want to keep or remove. What I liked the most is that this program offers the possibility of extracting video from a DVD and then edit the video on your own. I tried several of my home made DVDs and some of them worked and some others didn't, which is a shame but I believe it might be due to the way in which they were recorded, the ones that didn't work were recorded with a DVD recorder I got to copy my VHS into DVDs. I also tried some music DVD's I own playing with the idea of creating a music video compilation, well, it worked. What the program does is that it extracts the selected video track from the DVD into an mpeg file, from there you can edit it or keep a backup copy of it if you like.  After you are done editing and preparing your videos you can then create your movie. So far I have only created DVDs and VCDs and it has worked great, there are several templates included, some of them look very professional and some others look like they were made in power point, fortunately, the menus can be personalized and you can add/remove things to your taste. In the case of DVD menus there is a feature that allows you to edit the background music, something I really appreciated as I won't have to rely on an external program to do so.  Overall, a great product with some neat functionalities, I have lots of videos I have taken with my Sony camera as well as others I have downloaded and I am happy I got this product. The only time it has failed is when I attempted to open a divx formatted file, it crashed. I have not really had the time to investigate if this is normal or if there is some kind of codec I need to download. I will update the review if I find anything on that.	1
Video editing and authoring is generally an expensive proposition, and while this program is not perfect or professional grade&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Corel-Ulead-VideoStudio-11-5-Plus/dp/B0013OAHTG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Corel Ulead VideoStudio 11.5 Plus</a>&nbsp;packs a wallop of features for a VERY good price, at least compared to what this software has historically cost.  The amount of export options has to be a big plus, and it includes the ability to easily format any video file or project for any of your mobile devices including your iPod, iPhone, Zune, PSP, etc.  That's a huge thing that many people are looking for.  Some of the newer options like HD and BlueRay authoring aren't going to get wide use immediately, but they are must-haves for the growing HD crowd out there.  Within Video Studio there are a few basic options.  The Movie Wizard is a quick and dirty import and export tool.  This is the easiest option to choose to convert, trim and condense video files.  There's also a bunch of templates included for standard transitions to add some openings, endings, fades and credits.  Once again, even with the Wizard alone you can really clean up some video files fast.  You can even import them directly from you digital recorder, but I opt to save my files and import them afterwords.  I always like to have a backup seperate from what I'm working on, so this makes it easier for me to keep track of my import and export areas.  In the full blown Video Studio tool you can open up video and audio files and add them to a project.  The benefit of that is that you can merge and splice your files and add custom transitions and graphics to really make your videos pop.  Once again, there's a lot of features here.  You really have to spend some time playing and exploring.  Media One is kind of an extra, but it makes it easy to do some basic graphics and picture stuff to add to your videos.  Another extra is Intermedia DVD player, which is included on many OEM system software packages but didn't come with my box.  So that's a nice extra too.  One positive thing is that there are a bunch of tutorials and help file documentats included on your extras disks.  There's also plenty of clips to play with and test your skills on.  If you haven't done video editing before that's probably the best place to start.  Still, I think this program is user friendly enough to do basic things like import / export and conversions out of the box.  Since most people will want to start by collecting all their videos, that's a nice plus in terms of the usability.  One con I have to note is that converting videos to certain formats seems to use pre-set frame rates that take some time to customize.  And it seems to convert some of these formats frame by frame, instead of using much faster file conversion techniques.  Behind the scenes it may be doing more, but for this price I don't really mind waiting a few minutes for my files to convert.  I also own the Pinnacle software that comes with their integrated hardware offering,&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Pinnacle-Studio-MovieBox-Ultimate/dp/B000WEJN20/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Pinnacle Studio MovieBox Ultimate</a>,<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Studio-Ultimate-Version-12/dp/B001AMSZSQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Studio Ultimate Version 12</a>.  While there are more basic versions of the software that are closer in price to this guy, I find that the Corel Ulead software is more stable overall.  Don't get me wrong, the Movie-box ultimate package is a great value because it includes the hardware interface.  If you don't have all the connectors you need, that might be a good alternative.  But if you just compare software to software, Corel Ulead stacks up well against Pinnacle Studio Ultimate.  Truth be told, for this price I have to forgive the other minor cons I noted.  That includes mainly that the menu and icon graphics aren't the snazziest.  Still, compared to Apple's Built-in editor and Windows built-in movie editor (from Vista Ultimate) this guy includes more formats and features right out of the box.  And once again, for what you get this is really a great value in software.  Definitely check this out.  The Corel site has some clips and information to get you more used to the kinds of things you can produce.  Enjoy!!!	1
You can do so much with this program.  Video editing, DVD video editing to give you work a professional look, slide showcase. It has wizards that really help you do things you never thought of trying and in every format.  Still learning what this program is capable of so well worth the money.	1
Whilst trivial, the one item I liked the most on this issue of ULEAD is the  capture capability from DVDs through windvd 8. This output file was generally a bmp, and MEDIAONE editor allowed a file to be converted to a smaller file with the same quality. The Central testing area I used is the capture area, since it has the most widespread use in media. There are 7 tools in the Capture Video Tool, and I took a music track and inserted this audio track first. Then I placed a selection of Pictures and movie files from Various sources (such as Windvd 8's capture feature, and the sample media I can gather from other DVDs) and defined the time sequences for each photo or media( The ability to  extend the picture duration out, as well as the video works well in this medium).And after the projext is complete, you can output the project to a pure digital file, or to a DVD using the system. ULEAD can capture from any digital source, and output to any digital source. About the only additional thing I would use is the free application "Quick Media Converter" which makes various media files available to ULEAD, as well as from ULEAD. ULEAD makes the basis for an excellent digital editing system , and in this package the bonus of windvd 8 Silver makes for the best viewer of digital output... the audio quality alone makes the whole thing totally worthwhile, and wether you use it with Bought DVDs or DVDs you mixed down yourself, the audio quality is superb.	1
This is a relatively trim video processing program (ie, it runs on my computer which is several years old while a competing studio from Adobe will not run at all.)  VideoStudio Editor: Corel feels the workflow method (following the normal steps to create a movie) are more user-friendly than learning technical editing. I find this to be true: I never learned technical editing of video before and the system led me through it.  Movie Wizard: A quick-and-dirty way to get a slide show with effects chosen by the system. Great for newbies.  DV-to-DVD Wizard: Choose clips directly from digital video, edit and go.  Auto Color and Tone Filters: Fixes low light conditions--a typical problem for amateur video (no light setups)  DVD Authoring:  You can add chapters, interactive features to make your own DVD's, including tutorial-style DVDs (teachers may be interested in this feature.)  Special FX and Soundtrack editing. There are the usual pan, fade, effects and sound is full-featured (I like this better than the Adobe offering: The soundtrack portion features:  Audio View: Mix between clip, overlay, narration and music tracks. Audio Rubber-banding: Adjust sound levels of your video, overlays, narration and background music directly in Audio view. SmartSound Auto Music Maker: Create unique royalty-free tunes to fit the style and duration of your project. Audio Filters: Audio Normalization, Remove Noise and others help fix audio problems and enhance the sound.  This is a full-featured package, easy to use and a great piece of software to get the most out of your video clips.	1
Most have pointed out the flaws already, I will simply state that every device I used this operating with except my MacBook was dead within a few weeks/months due to bad drivers and terrible instability.  Better than windows 8 or 10 but sucks compared to Xp, 7 or OSX.	-1
A lot of start up problems, a lot of shutdown problems, I ended up having to switch to linux and it starts up and shuts down like a charm. I suggest getting Windows Vista if you need to game in DirectX10, otherwise, stick to XP.	-1
This is possibly the worst operating system I've ever used. Every single time you open an application, download something, or do anything at all, the system asks you for your "permission" to proceed. What a stupid waste of time.  The system is also incredibly unreliable, almost demonically so. I had installed Vista on my MAC in order to take the New York Bar Exam on my computer. However, the day of the exam, when I opened Microsoft Vista, it locked me out of the operating system and asked me for my product registration key - even though I had entered it when I installed Vista earlier. I had no warning that the operating system was just going to lock me out randomly - I had even tested it the night before.  If you use your computer for anything important, I would highly recommend against using this piece of garbage.	-1
It is amazing that software this bad could be released.  If Microsoft had more competition--this would have died a quick death in the market place.  Slows your machine down to crawl.  Freezes and crashes.  Reboot if you must (and you will) and nothing improves.  Unstable and unreliable.  Stick with XP.	-1
I used this to upgrade my desktop from Windows XP.  I could not upgrade my system through the upgrade option.  I had to do a custom install, which deleted all my files and software.  I had to reinstall all my software, which was fine with me and I had already saved all my important files, so it was not too much trouble.  I had to call Microsoft to complete the upgrade and found the tech. support to be very helpful.  I still cannot use my sound card properly, but was told that may happen, so I was not surprised.  I really like the Vista over the XP, which is only a personal preference.  If I had known I would have to do the custom install ahead of time I would have just went ahead and bought the full version instead of the upgrade version, but over all I am pleased with the product and would recommend it.	1
There is absolutely no reason to buy this product.  Stick with XP and wait and see how Windows 7 does when released this year.  Vista adds some eye candy that you can get for your xp system for free or a small fee.  It does add heaches, UAC (goggle that one and check the number of problems), terrific bloat, system slow down, driver issues, software issues,etc...  Also take a look at the people giving 4 and 5 stars and then listing a host of problems.	-1
This `upgrade' will not install on a `clean' hard drive, nor will it `upgrade' XP Pro. There is a work around, but it involves duplicate installs and other technical `workarounds' so if you are not technically savvy, don't get this `upgrade'.  If you do want to consider this `upgrade' be aware that Windows Vista Home Premium does not include FAX capability and needs the Office 2007 suite along with Outlook 2007 (which does not support animated gif's, among other things) for most eMail.  I would not consider Windows Vista Home Premium an `upgrade' as it requires more system memory, is a step backward in features, and more cumbersome to use than XP.	-1
Vista is like parents treating you like a 10 year old who doesn't have permission to do anything on the computer because you're too stupid to know what it is you want to do. I HATE IT. You no longer have access to your computer. If you try to see your temp folders to delete temp files, you can not do that. If you've uninstalled a program via add/remove programs and want to remove the files and folders that always get left behind, you can't. You are only allowed into the areas of your computer that MS deems you will not be able to do any damage. If you go to a web site that has special features you want to view, you can't and you can't change your setting to allow access to things you feel are safe that MS have decided you don't need to have. None of my USB devices work except one printer. There are no USB wireless 802.11 devices that work, unless you want to spend several hundred dollars on gaming devices for networking. After two years of working with MS, trying to get all my computers talking to each other, they were never able to help me get my Vista machine working this my XP machines. I spent more time letting people access my computer remotely than I was able to spend on my computer... I wonder how safe that it. I went back to XP and now EVERYTHING works, my wireless devices, printers and my network is working as it should. Vista my be prettier and have need glow and glass features, but as a working computer, it stinks. If you can't get a computer with XP, save yourself the frustration and agravation and get an APPLE!	-1
Generally speaking, to get the best performance from any operating system a clean install of a full version is recommended. The best choice is to choose a full version of the product and enjoy the benefits of not being left with artifacts and leftover's of your previous operating system which can lead to instability in certain cases. I would only buy this on a limited budget.	-1
Microsoft's latest OS is, indeed, more secure than Windows XP.  But I have installed it twice on two different machines, and subsequently uninstalled it and went back to XP a few weeks later both times.  Why?  - Stability is poor.  The system frequently blue screens (crashes) or, more commonly, hangs.  It's not a hardware problem, because both systems experienced these issues, and neither system has any issues running XP.  Vista Media Center slowly degrades over time (one of the computers is my living room DVR) until it is unusable without a hourly reboot (seriously!) - Speed - I play a lot of games, and Vista is consistently and significantly slower on every single game I've tried.  The difference is significant, even WITH the very latest "Vista Certified" video and sound drivers.  Then, there are games that crash on Vista, but have no issues on XP.  You can say "Well, they were tested to work with XP", and you'd be right, but I'd rather be running an OS that games were tested with.  And the DirectX 10 effects, which only Vista supports, are very ho-hum - they're not worth the performance hit, in my opinion.  For an example, check out the Crysis DirectX 9 vs. DirectX 10 comparisons on the net. - Hardware support - this really is not Microsoft's fault, but it is still an issue.  Many hardware manufacturers quietly refusing to release drivers for their existing hardware, in an effort to force people to buy new hardware for Vista support.  That's totally not Microsoft's fault - but make sure your devices are Vista compatible, BEFORE you buy Vista.  Microsoft has a  good compatibility guide on their website for this.  Scanners, printers, music players, phones, and wireless network gear are the gadgets with the worst Vista driver support, as are notebooks not specifically "designed for Vista".  I'm not saying you should NOT buy Vista, but if you do, be prepared for the problems you will encounter.  It might be better for a business user who is buying all new Vista compatible hardware.	-1
Windows Vista with SP1 is a pretty darned good operating system. Its main problem is that Windows XP is also a superb operating system, and most users will have difficulty understanding why we needed more than an incremental upgrade from XP. To the extent that the Vista interface deviates from the XP menus, I mostly have found this to be simply irritating.  The main flaw with Vista is that it deliberately did not have backwards compatibility with many earlier-version Window drivers.  Some printers and other devices flat out would not work with Vista.  This was an outrageous decision by Microsoft and it ultimately doomed the operating system with many users and businesses as word of this incompatibility got around.  Windows 7 essentially corrected this fatal mistake years later.  That having been said, Vista with SP1 is very solid and reliable. In my experience on my Notebook computer, however, be advised that it runs a LOT faster and better with plenty of DRAM. It seems to need more DRAM to run well. My new Intel dual-core Notebook came with 1GB DRAM, which was usually enough in Windows XP (except for most imaging software, which needed at least 2GB). However, I splurged and upgraded the computer to 4GB DRAM, and the difference was literally night-and-day. Vista could get doggy with 1GB. With 4 GB DRAM it literally screams on my Intel dual-core machine.  One unforgivable lapse on the part of Microsoft with Vista Home Premium is that it does not include Fax support. In this day and age, this is truly astounding. This represents a very obnoxious decision by someone.  The Vista interface is prettier. What more can I say?  One thing I think that Microsoft needs to watch is the security options. Security features are all well and good, but at the end of the day the beauty of a microcomputer is that it frees most of us, most of the time, from dependence on the IT crew in the white labcoats. XP and Vista have so many security protocols that in some instances it is rekindling this dependence.  Overall, I am satisfied with Vista, and I would not hesitate again to buy a computer that came pre-loaded with it. The upgrade learning curve from XP is really not all that great.	-1
Please note that I am just rating the OEM system that came with my new HP laptop I bought a month ago. It is Vista home premium with SP1. I rather like it. I have read numerous reviews that don't like it so much, so I am giving my experience here for those, like me, are considering a new computer with pre-installed Vista. My question was: How is Vista better than XP?  Answer: It looks better!  I am not joking. The only attraction is the aero effect thing where a little bit of each window is slightly transparent, the windows also pop up with a magical effect, like a balloon. It disappears the same way too, with some transparency worked in. It has an option of extra large icon that's really big if you want it, though that takes up screen space fast. The files are also a little bit open you so you can see a file or two in there, but in XP you can see stuff inside too, as many as four things, so the open trick isn't much of an improvement. Also, you can get these things called "Vista Gadgets" for the desktop, like a little calender or a battery charge indicator or even a quick search to amazon that just sits there as part of the desktop. Other program covers it, but otherwise it runs on its own without bothering anything.  (And why do I want a quick search to amazon, you might ask, if I already have it bookmarked as a favorite page? Well you see, you still have to click to open a webpage first before you can click your favorite. With the amazon gadget, you just type directly into it what you want, and a webpage will pop up without you having to click to open it! Really saves on the finger energy, you know?)  Other than this, there is nothing to Vista whatsoever that is different from XP. There is heightened security measures in the form of "OS fearfulness", but I always disable those things as much as possible because they are nothing but a nuisance. Whenever you want to do something it asks, "Are you sure?" It can't tell if something is wrong, mind you. It just keep asking YOU, and you have to keep assuring it like it is a scared child. And I can't disable all of it because then it nags constantly, "Security setting is set too low! Please raise it!"  There are a few minor inconveniences. First, the standard picture viewer will not display GIF images, unlike the one in XP. The help part explicitely states that the viewer will ONLY display bmp and jpg format pictures. Also, the Windows Mail, the equivalent of Outlook Express, no longer has the contact pane where you can just double click any contacts and opening a black email to write. You have to open the contact file each time.  Also, the included Internet Explorer has a ton of problems. It freezes every time I go to my hotmail account. I know, they are both Microsoft, so why can't they get along? Who knows. It freezes on certain other sites too, for no particular reason. I don't have any trouble with the old IE in XP, but Vista does not allow you to downgrade. (My Netscape in Vista manages hotmail and other pages just fine, so that's what I use.)  A friend warned that my old programs might not install in Vista. I've installed a few now. So far, everything works.  So here is the conclusion: except for the pretty translucent aero effect, Vista is identical to XP in every way if you don't think about the few bugs. So if you are into pretty (like me), do get it. It looks cool! It's fun watching the windows pop open and then vanish when you close it! But if you think that sounds stupid, then there is no question XP with SP2 is better in the sense that it is more stable and have fewer bugs.  I have to admit that I am slightly disappointed that the aero thing is all that I am getting out of a brand new operating system. Considering how long it took Microsoft to work on Vista, I thought it'd be a lot more exciting. Maybe they have been concentrating on programming "Are you sure" into every move anybody makes. Back when I upgraded from Windows 95 to XP, there were a so many fun new impressive things to enjoy. So the next time another new Windows come out, I won't bother with it.	1
I wouldn't normally suggest this but do not upgrade!  Vista takes the only good thing about Microsoft products - which is the advantage of an interface that you already know - and breaks it.  Vista really is different than any of the previous versions of windows but in the worst of ways.  Here's a typical example.  Want to do something simple like search for a file?  Too bad!  They have a much faster version of search with just one problem - no place to enter the search criteria.  Overall I think that the only people who have gained from Vista are Apple and Linux users since there should be more defections with the Vista fiasco.	-1
I tried the original version of Vista in March 2007. I thought it was the worst thing to come along since Windows ME. So then I formatted my hard drive and went back to Windows XP. What a difference a year makes! I knew that Microsoft was eventually going to end support for XP, so I figured I would give it another try. The installation was uneventful, after I downloaded all of the updates and defragmented my hard drive everything was as smooth as silk. After Service Pack 1 was released I installed that and saw a major performance increase on my wireless network and when copying files. It turns out that a lot of my issues with Vista the first time around were caused by all of the bloatware that Dell pre-installed on my laptop.  Note: If you are a laptop user and you find that it's a bit sluggish, check your power management settings. By default Vista uses the "Balanced" theme, which means that your Motherboard and CPU don't run at full speed.  My favorite features are the photo viewer and the much improved media center. The new start menu is better organized. I like how you can access your documents, pictures, music, and games with one click. Shutting down and Restarting have been reduced to one click as well.	1
If it were possible to give Vista a negative rating I would do so. Vista is unlike every other Microsoft Operating System ever produced. Every new Microsoft Operating System came with its annoying little bugs. Those of us who liked Microsoft Windows myself among them usually got used to living with the MS bugs or "Features" as they are called by the company.  Vista was inflicted on PC users because somewhere Microsoft got the notion that a more complex difficult to use memory hogging buggy wizard filled operating system was more secure thus much better. Vista is indeed far more secure than any earlier Microsoft product for one basic reason it never lets you do anything. You can not be productive on Vista unless you jump through more operating system generated hoops than you will ever see during a lifetime at the circus.  Don't get me wrong. I am not one of these geeky guys that wants everyone to switch to Linux or Apple. I love my Microsoft Windows XP PC but, Microsoft Vista is a gigantic LEMMON no amount of Service Pack tweaking will ever fix. I have XP systems and I will be keeping my XP computer. If I buy a new computer with Pretty but way lame Vista pre-installed I will reformat my disk and install my trusty capable XP operating system workhorse.  To say Vista is super slow at start up, during regular use and at shut down is an understatement in its most profound incarnation. If you buy a system with so much memory, new graphics, sound and other high priced, hogh powered hardware producing a system that costs a kings ransom Vista will speed up a little. Vista is a money hog because many old XP devices do not work on Vista at all and others need lots of tweeking to get them to work. Now Vista is so improved it will never crash, naw Vista just freezes up so completely you can not do anything productive. Vista will make you more productive because all its freeze up's will have you doing the same work again and again and again and again hoping it won't freeze before you can save it!  Finally Vista is a big useless paranoid fat nag. I mean at every turn Vista wants to reformat, check or otherwise make sure something you are doing is allowed. Vista is the Fort Knox of Operating Systems but think about it who wants to live and work in Fort Knox. Vista is an operating system as such it is an extention of your home or business. Adding Vista to your computer is like stationing thousands of nagging police officers whose job it is to challenge your every move every time you become even the least bit productive. Vista is an operating system with so many paranoid subsystems built in that it is effectively useless for its intended productive purpose.  For all the reasons I list herein I would strongly advise against purchasing Vista. I feel Vista is the prettiest operating system Microsoft has ever produced.  Unfortunately under that pretty VISTA surface is a code filled of maggots that grow into extremely pretty productivity killing computer bugs.	-1
Items are as Decribed, !  " almost 3yrs. left on the life cycle of this item !!! " ..,  - BUT REMEMBER  if u buy one,  u'll still need both service packs 1 & 2 to make it right ..,  Many of these versions come with service pack 1 installed alredy so all u need to do afterwar installing it is update the software ie, etc.  & then download the last sp if u need the 2nd one  or both sps if u got a version didn't include any sps  & then ur set to go..,  i noticed many people on here who have bought the version w/o any service packs at all & they complain cuz it doesnt work right or the copy they got didn't include sp 1 & or 2  & they're right ! & its because they didn't pay attn. to the previous reviews by other buyers & or didn't pay attn. to the products' description before they bought it aswell.., & to the best of my knoledge - theres no guarantee that u'll get a service pack with every or any purchase of one of these items AND but each of those service packs are still downloadable from microsoft aswell as other places online - but if a person doesnt have the $ to pay for'em then they can to the site where the service pace are, download'em & then install from the download & then burn-off the download(s)  to cd after downloading it & have them for future use/support AND if they cant find where to burn'em off from then i'm sure someone would point'em in the right direction to get a service pack(s) that they might need if they ask  VS. complain cuz of no service packs ..	1
What a nightmare. If you've read the other reviews here, you probably already know how annoying Vista's access control messages are, and how it was incompatible with nearly everything, so I won't spend time railing about that. The one issue that I could not solve, or forgive, was one of the most fundamental issues for an operating system: file handling.  Vista didn't like copying files across a network. In fact, Vista took personal umbrage at being asked to transfer files across a network, and passive-agressively reduced the transfer rate down until it could be measured in bits per minute, instead of kB per second. I soon came to personify Vista as one of those toad-like elderly women behind the counter at the DMV who take perverse delight in watching people's impatience boil into homicidal rage. The kind of person/operating system that will let you get to almost the front of a two-hour line/95% complete file transfer and then wordlessly put up a "Next Window" sign/"File I/O error" message with just the hint of a malicious grin. The kind of person/operating system that justifies the "No Firearms in the DMV"/"Don't keep a hammer near your laptop with Vista installed on it" rule.  The problem wasn't just limited to network file copies, either. Copying photos from a USB flash drive to the hard drive took so long that I could have recreated them in MS Paint, pixel by pixel, more quickly and with less frustration. Where else but in Vista will you see a dialog box with the words "0.2 of 4 Mb copied, 240 hours remaining"?  My experience with Vista was so abominable that I swore never to give Microsoft another dime of my business, walked to the Apple store, and plunked down way to much money for a Macbook Pro. OSX has its issues, some of them serious, but OSX makes Vista look like Microsoft literally implemented the "1,000,000 monkeys with 1,000,000 copies of C++ will probably turn out a well-made operating system" rule, but decided to save money by giving about 200 monkeys 3 computers and one copy of Q-BASIC.	-1
Vista is indeed a revolutionary OS. The user interface was a MAJOR improvement over XP. The Game Explorer is a very nice addition for gamers. And best of all, it doesn't crash! It's just stable.  I have used Vista Business since its release in January 2007 and it has been absolutely rock solid. It's fast (faster than XP even on systems with more than 4Gbs of RAM), much more secure than XP, compatible with older software, sexy Aero effects, and boasts loads of new features and improvements. And I already mentioned the much improved interface.  Yes, it does have a few bad things. UAC is one of them, but that can be easily turned off. Slow file transfer over the network was indeed a problem early on, but was fixed even before SP1 came out. And DRM is still just as bad as in XP.  Windows 7 is coming out in a few months, but it's not out now, so Vista still holds the crown as the best Windows version out there. Actually, Windows 7 is nothing but Vista SE with a new name. I ran the Windows 7 release candidate full time for a month, and realized that I had been running "Windows 7" since January 2007. Heh. I will still upgrade to Win7 though, if I find it for cheap (the current upgrade prices are NOT worth it if you already own Vista).  Overall, this OS has served me well over these past three years, and just felt compelled to write a positive review. Good job Microsoft! :)	1
I run Windows now via boot camp on my mac computers and it runs better if that's possible.  PC's are ok too but If you buy a computer with Vista basic make it a mac if you want any kind of stability.  Thus far from using Vista on various pc's it has been a disaster in every sense, it's slow, takes forever to boot up, gets stuck taking hours to shutdown sometimes, doesn't respond to "restart/shut-down" commands, screws up programs, games, apps and accessories that just work on OSX or any other version of windows.  I only use Windows for games anyhow, my boat has long sailed from using windows for common tasks and work, I use OSX for that now with much better results, hell if mac's got as many games released for it as windows or even just my fav one's I would deleted my windows partition today.  Even for games with windows it gets hokey when it tells you you cannot run two games at the one time yet you are only running one and program manager only shows one open, or it randomly crashes or minimizes your game mid game to install the endless useless updates Microsoft throws at you.  The security in in windows compared to OSX or Linux is a joke, when you upgrade to Vista all your licences will be void for anti-virus scanners or word or anything else that came with a cd key which sucks, in some cases you have to use another licence which is bull.  This OS running on a Dell inspirion just equals crash factory, same with the XPS, and hopefully it won't kill my gf's new HP touch smart even though I warned her to get an Imac and dual boot.  Anyhow Vista sucks, get Windows 7 it's a vast improvement and actually works.  The upgrade is flawless.  Vista is pure garbage.	-1
WARNING to anyone thinking about buying this product!  Please understand that you will not be buying this product only RENTING it.  If you do not renew every year the product stops working....COMPLETELY!  I'm not just talking about updates, etc. It actually tells you that it has stopped working and it won't work unless you renew. I have just wasted more than 2 hours with Norton's online tech support.  This is the case with ALL Norton products and I am quoting the tech.	-1
What I wanted to do: make multiple copies of a DVD containing old family Super 8 movies  What happened: the program installed easily, deleting some freebies along the way, all by itself. The instruction book isn't bad, but I felt like there was a distinct gap between part 1: copying the source DVD, and part 2: burning the new DVDs. I was able to reason it out myself, though, and I ended up saving the video file onto the hard drive and burning that as many times as I wanted.  I'm subtracting a star for this perceived gap, especially since this set really doesn't do much else besides copying and changing formats.  An interesting side effect has occurred, though; these ancient pictures need a bit of tagging with names, etc. in the form of subtitles. If anybody can suggest a way to do this that'll work with this program (and not cost pounds of flesh), I'd LOVE to hear it!! I SURE hope the video bug didn't bite me!! :D	1
I have had 6 versions of Toast,  but dealing with this Canadian based company on their now famous rebate scam is not worth the trouble!  Looks like they are using their old ploy again for some unknown reason.  Good product, too bad they play the business game so poorly.  Save the problems by not buying!	-1
Navigon has left the GPS hardware business, and so far it looks like they will not be releasing maps for FreshMaps on the schedule they promised, if at all. You will also have no technical support, and many people who purchased FreshMaps and attempted to register their purchase after Navigon shut down their GPS business have not been able to do so. I highly recommend you do not purchase this product.	-1
I love my 2100 Navigon. (Read my review on the same). I loved it so much when it got destroyed I went and bought a 2nd. Navigon. You may buy a 2nd. navigon due to various reasons - like my case, just for upgrading to newer model, vandalism (more & more happening now), etc. So here I am, with just 2 downloads from possible 12 and I try to register my FreshMaps subscription service -- REPEAT NAVIGON SAYS IT'S A SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE for my new Navigon - 2200T. Nada,zilch, zero, null. Customer service: NO, YOU NEED TO BUY NOW A NEW SUBSCRIPTION, NEW FRESH MAPS, etc. etc. I tell them - where it's written in their terms & conditions - it's not transferable. No Sir - not written, it's ASSUMED. It's our Company policy, etc. That's PURE VANILLA DECEPTIVE MARKETING and also absolutely foolish strategy. Why? I returned back my 2200T, went to Craigslist.org ; bought myself a nice USED 2100 and I continue to happily and merrily use my FreshMaps subscription!! So, ALL YOU GOOD FOLKS - remember - if you buy this you're locking yourself into Navigon's product for the lifetime of the subscription. This includes TRAFFIC, ZAGAT, everthing. I just thought all should be made aware of this limitation.	-1
I was a little surprised to see an average rating so low for a terrific piece of software.  Installation is a breeze, "training" the computer to recognize your voice is quick, and it works.  In fact, the accuracy of Dictate is pretty astonishing. I remember, perhaps a decade ago, tinkering with early iterations of transcription software and coping with woeful performance. No more.  Rather than going into features, I can tell you that it works like a charm in Word and Final Draft, and I've never had a problem with it.  Kudos.	1
A LITTLE HISTORY As a user of Dictate 1.0, I was very interested in the update to the initial offering. Being on sabbatical from my teaching position while I complete my doctoral dissertation, I have been and am in the midst of a sizable research and writing project. I found Dictate 1.0 to be very helpful initially. However, having to stop your train of thought to try and type in an unrecognized word, became cumbersome. Dictate need a "Spelling Mode" desperately.  Enter Dictate 1.2. With a great deal of hope and anticipation, I eagerly awaited my review copy of the update. It seemed like it took years for my friendly neighborhood mail carrier (a rarity in these days of "Postal" mail carriers) to deliver my little box of happiness. It finally arrived and I have been using it now for a few weeks.  In February, MacSpeech released version 1.3 of Dictate. I am using the new version and have been impressed with some of the useful new features. Enough of this small talk, let's jump in and see just what Andy (Andrew Taylor - President & Founder - Very nice man) and company have cooked up for the Dictate Fans-O-Plenty. A BRIEF WORD ABOUT FEATURES Of course you can go to the product page to get a complete list of product features. We won't add undo length here for that. Suffices to say, from my point of view (after all, I am the one pushing the keycaps here) the major features of Dictate are: Natural Speaking Voice Recognition, Unparalleled (on the Mac platform) Accuracy, Spelling Mode, Phrase Training, Document Cacheing, and the Press the Key/Key Combo commands. We will take a closer look at these important, at least to me, features, so read on... If you dare (cue suspenseful music in the background). USING DICTATE 1.3 Once you have installed the software, plugged in the included Plantronics USB Headset (nice headset BTW), completed the brief voice recognition training session, and saved your profile you are ready to, Dictate. When starting the program you are presented with a profile activation screen.  Now that you have activated your profile, the program loads the status window, available commands window, and a text window.  Simply turn on the mic (click on the stop sign icon or use the keyboard shortcut: Command+F11) and start dictating or issuing commands to your Mac through the many system commands which come standard with the program.  As if by magic, your words begin to appear on the screen. It really is a wonderful technology. You can also dictate directly into your favorite word processor. I am using AppleWorks (No cracks please. Call me old school, it sounds much less pathetic.) and have found Dictate to work seamlessly within this venerable Mac staple.  Let's say for arguments sake, that you say a word that Dictate does not recognize, "antediluvian." Here is where Dictate 1.3 has been greatly improved. In version 1.0, you would have to stop, fiddle around with the program so you could type the word with the keyboard, type the word and try and get the dictation mode to resume (not always an easy thing). With 1.3, you simply say, "Spelling Mode" the status windows indicates the mode change and you can then spell the word, adding punctuation as needed. Once you have finished spelling the word, say, "Dictation Mode" and you are ready to continue with your natural dictation. The process could be a little smoother (more on this later), but all in all, a vast improvement over 1.0.  We move on from the ability to spell out words from within the program to the ability to train the program to recognize unique phrases. Let's use, "MyMac.com" as an example. Saying MyMac.com into the program yielded My Mac.com most of the time. Not too bad, but not right. By saying, "train the words MyMac.com"  I put the program into Phrase Training Mode which activated the Recognition window.  If the correct version is not listed, simply click in the closest version, make any needed changes, push return and done. Once I gave Dictate a crash course in the linguistics of MyMac.com, it proved to be a studious learner. I haven't had a problem with it recognizing the term since. This is a great feature and will prove helpful for the power user who dictates large blocks of text into the program.  One of the updated features of version 1.3, is an improved ability to cache a document into Dictate thereby allowing you to navigate and edit any document. Bringing some test documents into the program worked well and as expected. This will be helpful for users who want to edit and repurpose archived documents. Nice improvement to an already strong feature set.  While not quite as evolutionary as the ability to spell words into Dictate, two of the new features of 1.3 have greatly improved the overall usability of the program. You can now command Dictate to, "Press the Key" or "Press the Key Combo." I found these features very useful when one has not taken the time to memorized the proper Dictate commands for a given action. Yeah yeah, I know, but sometimes you just have to, "GET 'ER DONE!" MAKING A GREAT PROGRAM EVEN BETTER There are a couple of areas where Dictate could be refined and improved.  While the new Spelling Mode is a great improvement to the program, the implementation is a little cumbersome to use. The switching of modes greatly reduces the flow of naturally speaking your text into the program. If one could quickly spell a word seamlessly into the dictation process, this would help the writers who would like to use this program a great deal.  MacSpeech has noted that one should not attempt to use the mouse or keyboard while Dictate is running. Indeed, this is a no no. The program becomes unstable and dictation is sporadic at best. Once the mic was turned off, editing within the document was possible. I would great if Dictate could allow keyboard and or mouse interaction while it is running.  Switching between programs while Dictate is running can cause some stability issues. Of course, in this multitask world, one must be able to shift gears from time to time. The program needs a little refinement in this area. MYMAC RATING All refinements and improvements aside, this is a great program that will allow you to dictate large blocks of standard text (sans highly technical terms, and nonstandard words which must be spelled) naturally and accurately. Realizing that with a few refinements this great program could be even better, I am, with proper diction and elocution, giving MacSpeech Dictate 1.3 an enthusiastic MyMac rating of 4.5 out of 5.	1
I am dictating this review using MacSpeech Dictate. If I have to make a correction with my keyboard I will indicate the correction using brackets.  My wife knew I wanted this program so she bought [it] for me for Christmas. I had read many of the reviews and had decided I would wait until some of the bugs have [had] been worked out. So it was with some reticence that I loaded the program onto my computer Christmas day. From some of the reviews I thought it would blow my computer up. However, with some encouragement from my daughter I decided to install it. It was surprisingly easy. I did have two [to] download the patch from the MacSpeech website. But I was prompted to do so and everything went smoothly (I have a wireless Internet connection which made it easy).  It took me about 20 minutes to do the training. It went well. However, the first few times I tried to dictate it didn't go well. At first I feared it was a complete waste of money. After working with it for a while thing[s] started [to] work better until finally it seemed to work perfectly. I did do a few of the training exercises over again, just to be on the safe side. As you can see it's doing a pretty good job. Occasionally I use the recognition menu which allows you to verbally select from a list of options. This is especially good if there is a lot of background noise. I'm actually using it occasionally right now because I find it easier to dictate while I look at the screen. The manual tells you not to do that but for some reason for me it works better. I look at the screen while I type so it seems natural for me to look at the screen while I dictate.  So what initially seemed like a potential disaster turned out to be a lot of fun. I never let on to my wife that her gift initially terrorized me.  I don't really understand those who bash the program. Maybe they type a lot better than I do. In the final analysis I give MacSpeech Dictate high marks. Naturally it makes mistakes, and the mistakes can be hard to find because the program never misspell[s] anything. But all things considered it truly is amazing.  [I]incidentally, there is a great manual in the help menu. It has everything I needed to know about the program, plus some that [I] haven't gotten to yet but hope[d] to learn about soon (like using it to do commands in programs like Photoshop).  I dictated this review with only eight typos. That's a lot better than if I had typed everything.	1
the software was for my sister in a hursing home. she can't type very well, nor speak very well. the software really helps her. MacSpeech Dictate	1
Works on my old PPC Mac	1
Bought for a G4 PB Platinum. This  is the last version of iWork will work with a PPC-based Mac. Get it and you won't be disappointed.	1
Can't beat an Apple computer... Like P-KB4, best by test.	1
works fine	1
Great!!	1
This is about the best screen capture software product available.  Snagit captures from every product I have tried it on saving in a multitude of standard file formats.  The product is easy to install with free upgrades and full technical support.  I only use the capture feature for pictures but there are multiple types of captures possible.  Once saved, I have a standard JPG file that can be attached to an email, embedded in a newsletter or just enjoyed as part of a screensaver. The company has a full set of tutorials and simple documentation is provided.	1
Whether it's paired with iLife '09 back in the days of MobileMe on Leopard and Snow Leopard, or whether it's paired with iLife '11 and Lion for a budget iCloud paradigm, iWork '09 allows Apple machines to have an elegant method to just get down to Office-style work. It may not be a replacement for Microsoft Office 2011, but if you're not seeking the ultimate in Office features, as well as several design touches that Office doesn't have, it's a valuable tool in a Mac software arsenal for someone who likes to transfer files between Mac generations.  A great piece of software that the Mavericks version of iWork failed to adequately replace, in my opinion. Heartily recommended.	1
This is such a useful software. I used a freeware FastStone Capture, it does a lot of of image captures, editing and adding annotation text. It can do windows, scrolling windows, shapes, etc. Snagit is a much more advanced image and VIDEO capture app. No wonder I have been hearing about it for years on techpodcasts that I listen to. It can capture actual videos including the movement of your mouse cursor which is very useful if you are creating a tutorial/instructional videos. If you are a gamer, and would like to show your exceptional skill to others, you can actually record part of the game and send it to whoever you want to.  There are multiple ways you can do in capturing contents. The software also give you an option to save as personal profiles for different combination of capturing configuration, so you don't have to repeat those mouse clicks that you use the most. Sort of a mini macro.  On capturing text. It can capture text to editable form even on Windows Explorer, WIndows error pop-ups, and more.  Capturing images also give you a built in editor. If you want to annotate an image that you have captured and you don't have enough space to place your text to, you can easily drag the edge of the image and add extra real state on your canvass for your arrows and annotation. You can enhance images by adding edges, shadows, bevels, etc. You can email an authored image with a click of a button.	1
Having to write technical documentation and produce training material often requires me to grab dialog boxes and screen shots. Since "Snagit" is my company's (Fortune 500) only approved capture software, this is the tool we were given to use. As it turns out, it is the right software for the job! More than just a screen capture utility, Snagit lives up to its advertising by simplifying image/document retrieval and allowing for a wide range of export options.  Highly recommended!	1
I appreciated the sniping tool in Vista -- but I hated Vista so much I reinstalled XP.  So I missed the sniping tool and Googled for a solution and found Snag It!  Snag It! is far, far superior to the simpleton tool Microsoft had (SURPRISE.  I whole heartly recommend this if you need to send screen shots with comments.	1
In some ways, iWork is better than MS Office and other ways it isn't. The spreadsheet templates are great. I like experimenting with them, making my own formulas.	1
I already have Microsoft Office 2011 for Mac, but wanted some of the features that are in the Mac preferred office software (mainly Keynote).  This was a cheap way of getting all three of the office products that work really well on my machine.  The software installs quickly and if you are using the disk does not require a product key or serial number.  After installing Software Updates updated it to 9.3 (the last version before the switch to the 2013 version - what is currently in the App Store).  The software works fine (I am using Mountain Lion (I have not tried it in Maverick, but I am pretty sure it will not have an issue) - this is because Maverick did not work properly with some of my hardware, so I downgraded back to 10.8.5).  iWork as a software is great since it quickly launches and never freezes up like MS Office does.  However, it is a much different interface and will take some time to get use to.  I also do not like that you cannot default to save as a MS document, you can only export to those formats.  However, you can open and edit them all without any issues.  A feature I use frequently that is not available is equation editor, however, MS Office has it, so I use it in WORD.  Numbers and Pages work really well and offer a full feature of productivity software you expect with a Mac feel to it (so get ready to rely heavily on the File Menu vs the bar and banner like in Office).  Keynote is the main winner here, it offers some really nice features and transitions that make Presentations easy.  However, transitions are not as great as Office 2013, but for Mac options they are the best choice!  In the end this software is great and easy to use, I think if you are a real power user you will probably want both (MS Office and iWork), but for most users iWork will have that Mac feel and work really well.  I got this online since it was much cheaper than buying through the App Store (not the newest version, after the 9.3 update, it is close), but I do not see too many features that would constitute the App Store price).  I want to add that I purchased an NEW copy (from a third party seller), and I received just a disk in a sleeve.  The disk was a legit Apple disk (not a burn or anything), but it was not in a box.  This does not seem to matter since the disk worked perfectly, but I wanted to let you know, since based on the item I expected a In-Box Retail Version Software Product (I bought it NEW).	1
I've used Macs since 2005 and PCs since 1985. I have been a heavy spreadsheet user since '85 and have many spreadsheets from various versions of office. When I bought by MB Pro 3 months ago I was led to believe that iWork is compatible with Excel spreadsheets. The fact is it opens them, edits them, and saves them in such a messed up format they are essentially corrupted.  I have spent hours fixing Excel spreadsheets corrupted by this software. Compatible - NOT  I am used to poorly written Apple software (hello Quicktime and iTunes) running on excellent hardware and have put up with it until now. I am switching to Office for Mac.	-1
I made the foolish mistake of installing the free trial for 30 days, then bought the disk to install before the trial was over.  I tried installing the software (didn't uninstall the trial first) and now the software is asking me for a serial number (note that no serial number is provided on the disk or the box).  I contacted online chat that told me it should just install.  They advised me to call Applecare between 9am and 5pm (I work during the day - duh).  I guess the chat people don't have the authority to fix this sort of problem.  So basically now I own a disk that won't install for over $70.  Not sure if I should just return it or what.	-1
With each successive version increment the very user friendly Apple office suite -- Pages, Numbers and Keynote -- fulfills more and more of the assmptions of MS Office users while increasing eye-pleasing and creative features generally missing from Microsoft products.  Export into or import from common file formats is a breeze.  Those who know why they delight in their Macs will also delight in iWorks, especially the '09 verions of its component programs.	1
I was playing around in the demo version of iWork09, and it seemed ok and according to the glowing reviews I ordered it. Mistake. Once I got into the pages program I stated to notice being told in apple support that "No, Pages won't do that". And I will list just a few things that pages does not do that Word for Mac does. I want the program to display full screen, cant do that, you have to drag and re-size the window each time, I want to set up my own labels, can't do that. I want a document that has both then envelope and letter in the same documents, can't change sections within a document. I wanted to set up my own format to display the date in a document, can't do that, you can in a table but not in a letter. You can edit the date but it gives you the same four 00/00/0000 format, or you can change the date to the time or change the date to the same date format plus add the time, who does that in a letter. Can not mix landscape and portrait pages in the same document. [...]  This is all fine for a letter to grandma, but anything complex, or even a little complex, it is useless.  Numbers is not as bad, so far, but I have not spent much time on it. I don't like the way it displays spreadsheets, I want a full page display. Not little groups of spreadsheets scattered around the desktop.  One telling problem with both these programs is looking in the preferences controls. There are almost none when compared to Word or Excel. As much as I hate Mircosoft and would have liked to migrate to an Apple product, iWork09 is not that product.	-1
This suite is so user friendly, my clients were able to use it without asking me dozens of questions. After 20 years of working in the IT field: good bye Microsoft and hellooooo Apple.  Apple, you have a new and enthusiastic customer and advocate!	1
Numbers is the weakest point of the iWork suite. As far as I can tell, there is no text-to-columns function. I tend to drop down to perl or perl + SQL for heavy math, so other missing functions don't bother me. The lack of text-to-columns makes importing data from a SQL query or the command line harder than it needs to be.  Still, iWork is a great value. I'm glad I bought it, and recommend it to anyone with a mac.	1
All three programs (Pages, Keynote and Numbers) have been improved (from iWork'08), but it is an unspectacular upgrade.   *  Pages: introduced the outlining feature.   *  Keynote: there were added new transitions and effects.   *  Numbers:the biggest changes: about 90 (according Apple). - it is integrates with Pages for page merge  This is a great, easy to use product.	1
This is a great product.  I use Microsoft Office all the time, but now I do a lot of my projects (I administrate a community band and do the website and advertising-[...]) on iWork '09. It is easy to convert to PDF or Word, Excel, or Powerpoint from the iWork '09 interface.	1
This is a nice if unspectacular upgrade. All three programs have been improved. It isn't the have-to-have change that iWork 08 was, but I'm happy with it. All three programs include more of Apple's slick templates, integrate with each other better and sport useful new features.  The biggest changes are in Numbers, which makes sense as it's the newest member of the suite. Apple claims 90 new functions. No longer being a power spreadsheet user I don't need all of them but the much improved charting is appreciated. Numbers also integrates with Pages for page merge, so you can use non-Address Book contact lists. That was an obvious omission in the previous version and is honestly useful. Also Numbers charts and tables inserted in Pages and Keynote will change if the spreadsheet is changed. Again an obvious omission in the last version that's been addressed. Don't move your files, though or you'll lose the links. As before, Numbers is an easy to use and attractive program for normal people. It isn't a replacement for Excel for power spreadsheet users. Thank goodness I don't have to do that kind of work any more.  Keynote has some stunning new transitions and effects that extend the sheer elegance of its presentations even farther beyond Powerpoint. If you do a lot of presentation work, Keynote is worth the price of the suite all by itself. And there are some new templates that reflect Apple's excellence in presentation.  Choosing templates in all three programs is now a bit easier with the improved template chooser.  Pages is the program that I use daily and it has a couple of new features that I appreciate. The full screen mode, that blacks out background distractions is welcome. That's been around in a number of programs before and I've gotten used to using it. The Pages implementation is a bit different, but done with Apple's typical elegance. The outlining feature introduced here is brilliantly implemented. It's the killer feature for me in the suite. I appreciate all the others but use this often.  There are some other new Pages features like the ability to work include formulas and integrate with Endnotes that I haven't used yet. This is a step in the right direction. Hopefully Apple will also include endnote compatibility Bookends, which I do use in an update. Pages still lacks some of the high end features of Word and probably always will. On the other hand it is more pleasant to work with and stable. Compatibility between Windows Office files and iWork seems to be as solid as it is between the Windows and Mac versions.  Since Microsoft dropped macro support on the latest version of Office for Mac, I've switched totally to iWork and haven't looked back. This version of iWork just makes me happier with that decision.	1
As a Vista-fugue, the main reasons for even bothering with a `Bootcamp' Windows installation were Microsoft "Office" and Intuit's "Quicken/Turbotax", both richer-featured in their PC than in their Mac releases.  Disappointingly, iWork '08 'Pages' performed better as an image-based page layout package for the multimedia center crowd, proving woefully underpowered in a professional business office ... crippled by the tediously awkward conversion hassle from  *.doc to  *.pages documents.  No more!  With iWork '09, Apple has virtually erased any remaining barrier to business office `switchers' still on the fence.  I have explored and tested Pages '09 since its online release as a downloadable fully functional 30-day trial demo.  I was so impressed with the new Pages (as against the flashy eye candy of the '08 version) that I ordered the full boxed version.  [The trial software is well worth a test run to see if iWork meets your needs.)  The new Pages now easily exports a document in doc, txt or pdf format, and does a remarkably lifelike transformation of even highly complex Word documents, tables, lists, or legal briefs with a mere double-click or drag-and drop.  Rather than spreading myself too thin, I limit this review to `Pages', leaving commentary on `Numbers' to spreadsheet buffs ... `Numbers' capabilities, in the past, were no match for the depth of MS-Excel.  If  `Numbers`  performs as well as  `Pages'  in this  iWork  overhaul, then the product will be the best eighty bucks gift for your Mac.  `Keynote', an image-with-outline presenter's tool, probably will prove at least the equal of MS-PowerPoint considering the Mac's flair for spectacular graphics.  `Pages' well may be the impressive turnaround software that elevates the Mac from multimedia center toy to serious professional business status.  Highly recommended for Vista-weary PC users and Mac loyalists looking for a solid business suite.  The detailed crystal-clear manuals and crisp `Help' replies are welcome value-added resources.	1
This may well be a five star product for many users.  My problem is that I only use iPhoto and it is likely that I will continue to use only iphoto.  iphoto is a great product.  It is a wonderful way to store your photos and to show them to others.  It is always enhanced in each update and continues to star.  iphoto is worth all 5 stars.  However, you also end up with all of these other programs, which I almost never use.  I think I used imovie once to join some cooking videos into one big cooking video.  That was it.  Mac updates this product almost constantly which means that the consumer is constantly upgrading to the new versions of software he or she may never use. Another problem is that I spent one year belonging to Mac's mobile me, didn't like it, and the web builder attached to this really is meant to work with mobile me.  Consequently, I now use an open source (free) web builder instead.  I love the 3 products associated with iWork and have given that 5 stars.  But the overkill and constant update factor here makes me lower iLife to 4 stars.	1
If you like "painless" then you'll like Apple's software.  Nothing else does a better job.  Just like Apple's computers and operating system.	1
iPhoto has a long ways to go before becoming a great organizer. Events seemed like a great idea when they were released in iPhoto 08 but the trouble with them is that you can't put events inside of other events. The reason this is such a problem is that after you load so many thousands of photographs there becomes to many events and it becomes cumbersome to sludge through them all.  Their solution to this problem in 08 was the add the ability to merge events together. When this happens everything becomes one large event, it doesn't maintain the groups of the events you merge together. I guess I can forgive them not totally thinking this feature though in iPhoto 08 but nearly a year and a half later they should have got this right by now. Adding events inside of events is a lot more important than even features like faces and places.  Doing a search is also limiting from the search box. You can't set multiple search criteria at a time like in the Finder or Adobe Bridge. In other words I can't say show me the files with these keywords that were taken during this time period and have this rating. I can only do one at a time. Yes I can do this with a smart folder but I would like to have option not to since I don't always want to come back to the search later.  Posting to Facebook and Flickr only gives you access to some of the features on those sites. You can't enter in all the information about the pictures from directly with in iPhoto (captions for photos, who can see the pictures, what should be the key photograph for an album etc.) Also iPhoto doesn't pull the previous albums you created back in to iPhoto so you can only view some of your albums not all of them.  If you ever have to move your information to a new hard drive down the road all the work you did to put together slide shows won't come across with the rest of the photos. I found this out the hard way as a spent a lot of time setting up manual Ken Burns effects so that they would pan from one particular area of a photograph to another. Now the only way a can access them is to boot back and forth between my old hard drive. It is a good thing I happen to have two drives in my machine or I would have to recreate them. I imagine this is what you would have to do if you had a laptop.  The recent area on the sidebar only shows the last event you look at. This is ok but I would like to see a history of the last several events I viewed. The last 12 months area doesn't organize those photos by events so you just gets this massive number of photos which isn't very convenient.	-1
I bought this for one reason and one reason only: the hope that iMovie had been fixed from the 2008 version to be more like the 2006 version. Didn't happen. iMovie is now worse than ever. Editing audio files is probably the most frustrating thing I've tried in a while. The interface is not designed well, and I found myself looking for features that used to be there (fade out video effect in conjunction with audio fade out) thinking they've got got to be there somewhere, and then finding out that they simply don't exist.  IMPORTANT: If you install iMovie 09, it will make your existing install of iMovie HD UNUSABLE. You CANNOT keep your old installation of iMovie 06HD when you install iMovie 09! This is amazingly frustrating, especially sine iMovie 09 will not open iMovie 06 video files!  I honestly think they don't want to make iMovie 09 work the way it should to force people to buy the much more expensive Final Cut, even if you don't need all of the features of a full video editing software. Working with HD video in iMovie is a joke; it lags, stutters, and crashes for no apparent reason.  iPhoto is fine, but the new features are not that impressive. The face recognition would be awesome if it worked well, but it doesn't. It wanted to group my grandmother and my sister together (I guess there is a little family resemblance there). The GPS feature is awesome if you have a GPS enabled camera, but if you have a camera that nice you're probably using a proffesional image editing software. Eventually (next 2-3 years) as consumer cameras start to have built in GPS, this feature will be valuable, so I guess you could say iPhoto is ahead of its time.  Garage Band works like it should, but there aren't any improvements that make it worth upgrading. The much flaunted lessons must be bought and downloaded, they don't come with the software. It is useful certainly, but I just don't see anything that makes me believe upgrading is worth it.  Frankly, this is just another ho-hum release. You don't need to upgrade unless you just have to have GPS photo tracking or face recognition software. If you were hoping (like me) that iMovie would be more robust, think again. It would have been very easy for Apple to include two versions of iMovie: advanced and basic. Basic would be the default setting and advanced would include the features lost from the 06 version. It could be turned on or off for the best of both worlds. Instead I have iMovie HD installed on top of iLife 09. Waste of hard drive space.  iLife 09 doesn't offer any compelling reason to update if you have iLife 08. There aren't any improvement that are not relatively minor or obscure (face recognition for example). And there is one MASSIVE disadvatage, at least for those who prefer iMovie 06: installing iMovie 09 will cause iMovie 06 to become inoperable! You have no choice in the matter, and no prompt lets you know that you are losing iMovie HD by installing iLife 09. It just happens.  Why Apple doesn't allow the user to control how many or few features are available is beyond me. I'm not saying everyone should want all the features from iMovie 06, but for those of us that do, why not make them available? This sort of 'one size fits all' approach is really frustrating.	-1
I'm happy with the new iLife. The improvements to iPhoto and iMovie are both very welcome. The lessons feature of Garage Band might be something I might use. The additions to iWeb are good but the program still is only useful for a personal site. It just doesn't offer the search engine optimization capabilities or speed of loading that a business site needs in today's web environment. iDVD has some expanded features and new themes but isn't a have-to-have update.  I'll cover iPhoto first. The new face recognition ability is awesome and amazingly good. I never bothered to make smart albums of individuals before. I went through several thousand photos in a few hours and did that with ease. That one feature makes almost the purchase price worth it all by itself. Geotagging is great. I gave my recent vacation photos location tags and will continue to do so. I'm researching a handheld GPS to sync with my camera so I automate the process. As the number of geotagged photos grows, especially my bird and travel shots. This could turn into a terrific feature. And the tags translate to Flickr maps.  The new built in sharing features in iPhoto are also nice. I can upload to Flickr without exporting and using Flickr's flaky software, or without having to buy a third party plugin. iPhoto also works with Facebook. There are existing free upload plugins for other services like Picasa and Shutterbug that should work.  iMovie has gotten back some of the functionality it lost in the 08 "upgrade", not all of it and you still can't use the old third party plugins I bought prior to that, but it is better. The anti-shake function actually does a pretty good job of smoothing out hand held clips. And being able to edit audio directly in the program is very nice. It's a good but not spectacular move up from the last version.  I use Garage Band, too. The new features are limited here. There are some nice interface tweaks. Those don't add much in the way of functionality, but it looks nice. For guitar players, Garage Band has some added effects.  The ability to buy lessons might prove to be a good feature. That will depend on what lessons become available. Right now Apple seems more interested in getting big names for the lessons than great teachers.  Whether or not the lesson library becomes worthwhile will be something I'll watch. I certainly wouldn't buy iLife for the GB upgrade.	1
iPhoto has a long ways to go before becoming a great organizer. Events seemed like a great idea when they were released in iPhoto 08 but the trouble with them is that you can't put events inside of other events. The reason this is such a problem is that after you load so many thousands of photographs there becomes to many events and it becomes cumbersome to sludge through them all.  Their solution to this problem in 08 was the add the ability to merge events together. When this happens everything becomes one large event, it doesn't maintain the groups of the events you merge together. I guess I can forgive them not totally thinking this feature though in iPhoto 08 but nearly a year and a half later they should have got this right by now. Adding events inside of events is a lot more important than even features like faces and places.  Doing a search is also limiting from the search box. You can't set multiple search criteria at a time like in the Finder or Adobe Bridge. In other words I can't say show me the files with these keywords that were taken during this time period and have this rating. I can only do one at a time. Yes I can do this with a smart folder but I would like to have option not to since I don't always want to come back to the search later.  Posting to Facebook and Flickr only gives you access to some of the features on those sites. You can't enter in all the information about the pictures from directly with in iPhoto (captions for photos, who can see the pictures, what should be the key photograph for an album etc.) Also iPhoto doesn't pull the previous albums you created back in to iPhoto so you can only view some of your albums not all of them.  If you ever have to move your information to a new hard drive down the road all the work you did to put together slide shows won't come across with the rest of the photos. I found this out the hard way as a spent a lot of time setting up manual Ken Burns effects so that they would pan from one particular area of a photograph to another. Now the only way a can access them is to boot back and forth between my old hard drive. It is a good thing I happen to have two drives in my machine or I would have to recreate them. I imagine this is what you would have to do if you had a laptop.  The recent area on the sidebar only shows the last event you look at. This is ok but I would like to see a history of the last several events I viewed. The last 12 months area doesn't organize those photos by events so you just gets this massive number of photos which isn't very convenient.	-1
There is no way that I could give the iLife suite anything but 5 stars.  I switched to the mac 1.5 years ago and have been intensely using iLife '08 for the entire time.  The suite of programs is just incredible.  I would probably pay upwards of $600 for the suite of programs, and it costs only [...].  Crazy.  The following review covers the new features added in iLife '09 that weren't in iLife '08.  There are a lot of new features, and I'll update my review after I spend time with each one.  iPhoto '09 FACE RECOGNITION: My iPhoto library is relatively small at 14,000 photos, most of which feature friends and family.  Because I'm a bit OCD, with iPhoto '08, I took the time to label all the photos with the names of the people contained in each picture.  I did this by writing the person's name in the "Key Words" field of each photo.  For a variety of reasons, my iPhoto library is much more valuable and useful to me when they are properly labeled with people's names.  As such, I was intrigued by the face recognition feature of iPhoto '09.  After allowing iPhoto '09 to scan my library of photos for faces (which took about 3 hours), I spent a handful of hours training iPhoto to know what everyone's faces look like.  This process (if you know how to do it) is indeed easier than the old way (of me typing in people's names in the "key words" field under each photo).  The facial recognition is pretty good, or maybe very good.  The problem I've discovered is that facial recognition is never going to be perfect.  Indeed some of the best photos have friends or family with their backs turned to the camera, or whatever, so facial recognition doesn't notice them.  If I were to rely solely on the facial recognition in iPhoto '09, I would fail to properly label all my pictures ... I'd miss some really really good pictures.  Then, months later, when I'm looking for a photo with my friend Sam, I won't be able to find certain photos, because it was never properly labeled with his name.  Long story short, I won't be using the facial recognition feature.  Instead, I'm going to continue to mark all my photos with names in the "key words" field of each photo.  Note also, the facial recognition feature cannot find the face of my parents' Dalmatian dog.  PRINTED BOOKS (MAPS FEATURE): the printed books that I've created with iPhoto '08 are amazing.  I've had several people say, "I've gotta get a mac" when they see the books I've made.  And, a few months ago, Apple announced that the pictures in the printed books are going to be even higher-res (haven't had a chance to print a book since the announcement), so the books should look even better now. A new feature in iPhoto '09 is the ability to add custom maps to your books.  For instance, I created a book with a map showing a travel line from NYC-Helsinki-Warsaw-Cracow-Budapest-Vienna-Prague.  The map looks awesome (see photo uploaded to amazon).  Printed books make the perfect gift or coffee table book.  (TIP: after you create the map, right-click on the map for additional advanced options (e.g., changing the connecting lines from _curved_ lines to _straight_ lines).  Criticism: while the large-scale maps (i.e., big city to big city to big city) look great, zoomed-in maps (i.e., of an individual city or town) have no detail.  (See the photo uploaded to amazon of my map of Warsaw, Poland).  Hopefully they'll fix this.  GEOTAGGING: this feature is so cool and totally belongs within iPhoto.  Years from now, when all the cameras have GPS built inside, it is going to be so convenient to have this metadata attached to photos.  That being said, I cannot imaging spending the time to label my 14,000 photos that don't currently have that data.  I did buy the "Amod AGL3080 GPS Data Logger," to carry with me on trips so that I can add GPS data to new pictures I take.  I haven't had a chance to use it yet.  Update: I've had a chance to manually geotag some pictures (e.g., this batch of photos is "Warsaw, Poland").  It's pretty easy to tag photos.  That being said, there's really nothing amazing about having geotagged photos.  Hopefully future iterations of iLife will make use of having geotagged photos and movies (e.g., smart slide shows or movies that automatically include maps that zoom into pictures, or something).  GarageBand '09 MUSIC LESSONS: this is the most exciting part of iLife '09 for me.  These lessons look _better than real lessons_.  Seriously, better than live lessons with a real human.  I started the guitar lessons a week ago, and I just love them.  I can do the lesson over and over, at my own pace.  Apple really slammed this one out of the park.  I can't wait until I get good enough to use one of the $5 artist lessons.  Note: there are 9 free introductory piano lessons, and 9 free introductory guitar lessons (the lessons feature an acoustic guitar, but they appear to be useful for learning both acoustic and electric guitar ... same principles).  Note: Garageband includes a tuner, so that you can tune your guitar via your mac's microphone.  Well, it sucks and is nearly useless. (I'm using my iMac's built-in microphone).  I'm glad I bought this tuner: Korg GA-30 Ultra Compact Guitar and Bass Tuner (it works for both my electric and acoustic guitar).  I'll update the review when I've had a chance to use the 1-2 dozen new features that are important to me.	1
Bought for a G4 PowerBook Platinum 867Mhz. This  is the last version of iLife will work with a PPC-based Mac. Get it and you won't be disappointed. iMovie will NOT install on my particular PowerBook, because my PB's CPU is too slow (the install program will decide for you).	1
Finally getting what I was lookin for. Excellent seller. definitely use again********	1
I bought an iMac back in Early 2009 as a closeout of the Early 2008 models because I wanted the compatibility with the Windows 7 Beta and Release Candidate the 2008 2.8GHz Core 2 Duo 2GB RAM 320GB HD ATI Radeon HD 2600 Pro 256MB GDDR3 SDRAM iMac offered, as this was Early 2008 and I had to see if the Windows 7 Beta was receiving good reviews in error. I got iLife '09 with the iMac because of when I bought it, and used it all the way through the end for the to me awesome MobileMe suite. The problem was I needed eventually to upgrade to iLife '11 so that I could use iCloud and eventually iLife '09 had to say goodbye. I still think it was better, and if I could get away with using Snow Leopard as my only OS, I would still be using it. However, Lion is better in a lot of areas now that apps and items like printers accept it. So I'm using iLife '11, but still wishing I had MobileMe, iLife '09, and Snow Leopard. The sad facts of life these are.	1
Best way to get iDVD.  I've tried many alternatives, but nothing comes close to iDVD for power and ease-of-use.  You can set chapters with moving menus. Using iMovie HD and iDVD 09 my DVDs look just like Hollywood.  A tragedy iDVD was discontinued by Apple.	1
After doing a clean installation, I found that was no longer there. I was unable to buy it at Apple. That's being there in a pinch.	1
I have been using apple computers for many years and I like most of the features they offer. However like a tic on a hound you will find like most other computer systems you must update in order to use many features on your computer. Example you buy Ilife 06 only to find that when your computer system updates a couple years later and you purchase a Iphone you must go get Ilife 09 to use some of the features in Iphoto. I am not sold on the changes made on Ilife 09. The vendor I got it from did a great job of selling the product for what it is really worth.	1
This is a wonderful group of software with easy to use features for people who do not have time to go through manuals or extensive classes. iPhoto is why I bought this software.	1
iLife is a collection of fun and useful apps. I would call them toys because they are fun, but they are much more powerful and useful than that.  iPhoto - great for organizing your photos and videos. Face detection is lots of fun. Several basic enhancement tools are included that eliminate much of my need for&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Photoshop/dp/B001EUIVZG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Photoshop</a>. Now I just spin up GIMP when my needs go beyond what iPhoto can offer.  iMovie - I haven't used iMovie 09 much, but older versions of iMovie were great for building simple videos out of DV footage and still images.  iDVD - I haven't used the latest version of iDVD yet, but it has always been a great app for mastering simple DVD content.  GarageBand - Amazing musical toy. Very serious musicians will probably find GarageBand too limited, but it is lots of fun for people who are casually interested in making music. You get plenty of loops and sounds to throw together your own tracks. MIDI support is limited, but it is a very fun environment to play around in.&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Logic-9/dp/B002ISDD1K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Logic 9</a>&nbsp;will give you far more power if you feel constrained by GarageBand.  Update - If you got iLife with your new mac, be sure to drop in the DVD and install the extra GarageBand instruments and loops. A lot of great creative content is included.	1
Well worth the money, as you will need this for the Snow Leopard Up-Date in Sept.	1
I love the updates in iphot0 that do geotagging either by automatic download if your camera is capable or by manuel insertion if not.  You can always definately remember where a picture was taken.  The faces feature is also cool too.  It does take some time for the computer to learn but it does a very good job.  I love being able to look up someone's name and instantly see the pictures that i have of that person on the computer.  iphoto also updated its editing feature.  I have played a little with imovie but not enough to really comment on the differences.  Is it worth the price?  For me, only because i use iphoto for all of my photos.  If it weren't for that, it wouldn't be worth the price.  the other thing i wonder is will there be an ilife '10 and is it better to wait on that?  It is certainly a delimma, but in the end, i chose ilife 09 because of the faces feature, better editing features and geotagging.	1
In the new iPhoto the "faces" section is an easy way to pull all the photos of people you know into one place. In the new iMovie there are many easy ways to make your movies look very professional with almost no effort and they will be easy to submit to YouTube or Facebook.  All in all an improvement over the previous version of iLife.	1
This software incorporates several new features to each of the programs in the iLife suite with the exception of iDVD which is exactly the same as in iLife 08.  I rated the product 4 stars instead of 5 only because iDVD received no update.  The software installed without problems.  iPhoto 09 is much improved and all new features seem to work for me right out of the box.  Be sure and update iPhoto via Apple Software Update to fix some of the problems found in it.	1
very useful	1
I learned to type using one of the earliest versions of this program and now my son is learning using it as well. I have recommended this software many times and will continue to do so in the future.

a little buggy at first until they patched it but now works great and is very fast. Had to learn some new web design but they have great help and video's to help you out.	1
I have been an avid user/teacher of Chief Architect Inc software since 1995 (I mainly use Chief Architect X1 in my /drafting and design business) but the line of consumer software like Home Designer Pro 8 is a great way to introduce yourself to professional level output. Yes it is a cut-down version in terms of choices and productivity tools that are available in its "Big Brother" (Chief X1) but at 1/5 th the price it makes up for the extra steps its economy warrants. The only thing that is more difficult to do in Pro than Chief X1 is curved roof planes, other than that it can easily do what programs costing many thousands more can do.  David J. Potter	1
I have been through the lot! THIS IS THE BEST COMPREHENSIVE SECURITY SUITE I EVER HAD! And I had them all...(well, almost)  For years I sweared by NORTON - until two years ago it got so heavy and demanding it slowed my computer to a crawl. Then I gave McAFEE Internet Security a try which, although lighter, pestered me with pop-up messages. When that license expired I gave KASPERSKY Internet Security a try: real secure feeling and detailed settings control; however, a number of internet applications, although given full internet access, were slowed to a trickle.  About a month ago I downloaded the AVG INTERNET SECURITY as a 30-day trial. Not two weeks had passed and I decided that THIS IS THE ONE!  Light, heuristically effective (it even found a malware that KASPESKY failed to locate - and KASPERSKY has the best reputation on cleaning out everything!), no conflicts, email integration (although not with ThunderBird yet, a minor glitch), excellent AI and quiet.  It may seem a bit pricey, yet keep in mind that it comes with a 2 YEAR license, not the usual 12 months that most other Security applications come with.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!  UPDATE [April 26, 2008]: AVG offered the FREE option to upgrade to v8.0 for the remainder of the license to every customer that had bought v7.5. Now, THIS is a company that knows how to built customer loyalty!	1
In the past Ive used Norton, McAffee & Zone Alarm. Ive used Zone Alarms Firewall in combination with AVG's Virus/Spyware. Ive been using AVG's complete package, Firewall/Anti-virus/Spyware for several years & (for me) this is the best Internet Security product Ive used.  No security product is perfect but AVG has done the best job of protecting my PC from the outside world & I feel more secure using this product than any other.  But like all software, AVG isn't for everyone. If your level of PC knowledge is such that you need their 'tech support' to set it up & run, then I strongly suggest you use Norton, McAffee, Zone Alarm, PC Doctor or possibly Micro Softs Live One Care. Those products are not bad, they are just not as good as AVG. However, they are more simplistic to use. They are also more intrusive & likely to slow down your computer. I just gave my neighbor my copy of MS Live One Care that I got for free when I bought a Laptop & its perfect for them. I installed it for them & it will take care of all their needs & they won't have to do anything at all really. Just follow directions...  But if you're a little more computer savvy, AVG is the way to go. Im not an IT guy or an expert by any means but I can work my way through AVG just fine. Its really pretty simple to use but it does have more options than the products mentioned above & those options can be confusing at first. But those options just give you more control over your PC use & security & its well worth the effort to familiarize yourself with those options.  AVG also searches for root-kit's & now has an Identity Protection function.  For the average PC user, I beleive AVG is the best protection available.	1
No doubt AVG's Internet Security Program is by far the best - exceeds Norton, far exceeds McAfee and the rest -  Amazon's 3 pack 2 - year edition price is the best value around!	1
This application is nothing more than a database of recipes, with little functionality found in other programs.  I purchased this to manage my own recipes from Mastercook, after having to re-image my computer and needing to buy new software anyway (can't find that old cookbook disc!).  I did some research, and the website convinced me to give this product a try.  I tried to use this to manage my OWN recipes, not surf through a collection already existing on the software.  CONS: * Though it can import recipes from "Mastercook," the recipes must be INDIVIDUALLY exported then imported.  If you have a backup of mastercook files, this will not work; you need the mastercook software to. * There is no automatic calculating of nutrition data; it has to be manually re-entered after entering ingredients * The interface looks crude and outdated; something reminiscent of cookbooks sold for $9.99 in the 1990s.  PROS: Um....none.  I thought by spending more I'd get more. Oops, good marketing by the vendor, bad judgement from me.  Don't be fooled by the website lauding this product.	-1
I update a couple of times a year and it pays for itself	1
Garmin needs to realize that most GPS units no longer sell for $500+. I used to update my maps every year on my modest Street Pilot C330, but it no longer makes any sense. I can sell it on eBay and pick up a new unit, with new maps, for less than what Garmin sells their map updates. $50+ for a map update might have been reasonable a few years ago, but GPS prices are a fraction of what they once were. Map update prices have pretty much stayed the same though. Very little changes in these updates each year too. Until Garmin gets realistic with their update pricing, I'll just pick up a new $100 unit every year or two, and sell the old one.	-1
I have used the plain vanilla version of spysweeper for several years on my two XP machines.  I have run several spyware programs including Adware (free version), windows defender (MS)(free software) and Spybot also free software.  I run spysweeper on two different XP machines, one several years old.  The only annoyance I have found was that spysweeper will run during bootup on my slower machine really slowing down the boot up time.  I disabled spysweeper to run only on demand on my slower machine.  I have never found spyware with any of my spyware programs as I regularly update their definitions and run all of them at least once a week.  I keep XP updated with the latest security updates with the exception of SP3 as I have heard people have had problems with SP3.  I found customer support good and overall recommend the product.  Definitions are updated regularly and there can be several free program updates through the year.  There have been no issues (program hangs, etc)running the software.  Remember to disable the email shield checking if you have other software that checks email like norton. i found with my slower system that everytime i would send an email from outlook express spysweeper would run slowing down the system.  I have zone alarm as my firewall and disabled email checking there also to keep my system from bogging down.  I run Spysweeper, Ad-aware, Norton AV 2007, Zone Alarm, and windows defender with no compatibility issues.  The spyware programs are run separately on demand.	1
I will tell you right now what makes this piece of software one of a kind.  Most (other) language learning software is based on templates. They have a single template for your learning needs and they just fill the blanks for each different language. That's just like having a single universal template on how to "drive" and then hoping to fill the blanks for a car, a bike, a truck and a tank, no matter how different they actually are.  Fluenz is different. Even though they probably follow similar scenarios for the different languages, it's downright obvious that each lesson was created from scratch according to the language's specific traits and difficulties.  All the explanations you'll find in Fluenz French are there for a reason, and that reason belongs to the specific language you are learning. What may need 10 minutes of explanation in one language, may take no time in another.  Something else Fluenz gets right is that they teach you how to say ideas in the new language, not only words and grammar, but whole ideas. That's what you need for fluency. I've been learning languages for quite a while, English is not even my native language, and you can trust me when I tell you that having to construct phrases in your head putting grammar rules and words together every time you speak will take you nowhere.  Finally, perhaps irrelevant at first sight but unmistakably important a few hours later: it has the right ambiance. It has nice background music, i.e. it doesn't feel mechanic or boring.  I'm not an easy guy to please with this kind of software but so far I've done about one third of the program and I'm extremely happy with it.	1
I have used WordPerfect in all its permutations since it came on 5 1/4" disks and had a blank blue screen. The lastest version continues the ease of use and power that I expect. The parts that are missing from the "professional" version are not really important for my needs and the price more than makes up for it.  Because I have to match with other people, I also use Word 2007, but WordPerfect continues to be the better product. Whenever I can, I use it instead of Word.	1
It is hard to believe it is two years since Corel released X3.  When I found out that the new X4 version had been released, I downloaded the one month demo from Corel.  I don't have much use for anything in the suite except WordPerfect.  I've been using WordPerfect since before Windows, when it had a blue screen, displayed ASCII characters in Courier font (there were no fonts except Courier), and laser printers cost a small fortune. I work for a number of attorneys -- WordPerfect is the software of choice for word processing in most offices I've worked in because, in my opinion, it is the better product for the job. It may also be because WordPerfect has been around for so long that everyone just migrated without changing. If it ain't broke, don't fix it!  Universal File Support -- Limited PDF support in Home/Student Edition  WordPerfect has very good compatibility with other file formats making it nearly universal.  The more expensive version of WordPerfect handles PDF files and will import text and graphic based PDF files and will perform optical character recognition on the PDF file.  As the comment below shows, Corel indicates this version does not open PDF files, although it will publish to PDF.  Please see [...] for a comparison of the different versions.  Although it is not perfect, WordPerfect converts to and from numerous Word formats including RTF, and all versions through 7.  It also supports other formats including WordStar, AMI, OfficeWriter, Lotus, Multimate and numerous others.  Skins  Corel also added two themes so that the skin looks more like XP/Vista, and for those who need it, the Word Count feature is on the application bar at the bottom of the WordPerfect window.  This new version appears to be very stable.  Exceptional Word Processing Capabilities  When WordPerfect came out, it took over the market. (It was far superior to the software then available, and remains one of the best.) When MicroSoft came out with Word, I had the feeling they did everything they could to make it different from WordPerfect just to use their power in the industry to take over the word processing market, just like MicroSoft did with every other good software idea to come along. (e.g., Mozilla/Netscape, Norton Utilities.)  I have three versions of Word (2000, 2003 and 2007) and WordPerfect 5, 7, 8, 10, 12, X3 and now X4.  I use the MicroSoft product only when absolutely necessary -- usually because someone else sends me a document in that format. The new version of Word is extremely powerful.  It is just that like most M/S software, it does too much and takes the control away from the user.  It is also unfamiliar to me because the traditional pull down menus have been placed sideways on toolbars and rearranged so it is uncomfortable to use.  Accordingly, I prefer to use WordPerfect and save the output as a Word document using the "SAVE AS" feature on the "file" pull down menu.  The reason I like WordPerfect so much is that it types more like a typewriter. You can set up and use styles if you want, but you can also just hit the tab button to indent the first line of a paragraph. If you want to change the margins for the entire document, you simply change the margins. The rest of the document follows the change. You don't have to change each paragraph. If you want to change one paragraph, you can do it with a single keystroke (the WordPerfect 6 keystrokes are F4 for left indent or Shift-F4 for double indent).  In addition, you can get to the formatting codes. Hit Alt-F3 and the screen splits in half and displays all of the format codes -- bold, underline, tabs, indent codes, line spacing, column on and off, etc. Then you know exactly what you have done and fix and format it easily. This ability has proven useful on several occasions when clients, who insist on using Word for legal documents, cannot cajole Word to put their unruly documents into the format they want. (This is particularly true when using OCR with scanned or faxed documents.) By opening the Word document in WordPerfect, I have been able to use "Alt-F3" to identify the errant codes and quickly repair them. WordPerfect can then save the document in Word/RTF format with the problems fixed. This is particularly useful when combined with the global search and replace. For example, you can search and replace all [paragraph style] codes and end up with a manageable document.  Working with columns is also easier. You turn on columns and tell it how many colums you want, set the width of each, and the space between them, and away you go. You have four types of columns to work with -- newspaper, balanced newspaper, parallel and parallel with block protect. I've tried the other software, and if you change text or printers, you can never get the columns to line up the way you want it. With Word, each column change or page change seems to introduce a whole new set of control codes, and a complete set of formatting, and you can never get it back the way you want it. I once tried to scan in a list of names and addresses which were in two or three columns into Word. Each name and address was placed in its own text box. I could never work with it.  Another very important feature is the ability to view a document from the "open document" screen without having to actually open up the document. This way, if you are searching for a specific document or a document containing certain specific information or "language" you need, you don't have to serially open a document, close it, open another document, and so on until you find the one you want. This is particularly powerful when combined with the "find document" feature on the "open document" screen. Using the find button opens a screen which is similar to the windows "search" screen. You can type in a series of words, and WordPerfect will search all files on the hard drive or in the folder/subfolders in which you are working for all documents containing your target search terms. You can then scroll through and look at each document to quickly determine their contents. From the "find" screen, you can access the "quickfinder" program which pre-scans folders on the computer so that searching for documents is nearly instantaneous. For example, once I needed to find a "Declaration re Ex Parte Notice" to use as a template from among thousands of documents. The entire search took perhaps half a minute.  The most prominent change between WP 10 and 12/X3/X4 is the workspace manager which allows you to switch between legal mode, original (classic) WordPerfect 5.1 mode (with the blue screen), legal mode, standard WordPerfect for Windows mode and Word mode. They have also included and upgraded the ability to publish to Adobe PDF, HTML, and RTF/Word formats.  This is full featured software, and does everything I need. It handles tables, tables of content, tables of authorities, column sorts -- everything I need in a law office. Graphics can be dropped in with a click of the mouse. I'm considered to be almost an expert, and there is a lot I don't know!  One of the great advantages of WordPerfect is that the files are much smaller than Word documents. This means you can transport them on floppy drives.  As a final thought, Word is very powerful and works very well for short documents such as business letters. If you do anything over several pages, you are much better off with WordPerfect.  Take time to get to know the software and you'll be glad you purchased it.  Other Programs:  The Corel Office package includes replacement programs for most of the stuff in Microsoft Office.  The suite includes a Microsoft Outlook replacement (Mail), a PowerPoint replacement (Presentation), an exceptional spreadsheet program (Quattro) and Lightning.  I haven't yet figured out what Lightning does except act as a notebook of some sort.	1
I like this word program better than microsoft Word.  It is more versetal and easier to learn.  Overall I would say its a superior program over microsoft.  I would highly recomend it.	1
To my surprise, I have discovered that WordPerfect is NOT dead!  It can only get better from that antiquated software of the early 90s, and Microsoft blew them away.  But, I guess there is reincarnation!  I like the program, and what I like is that one can open this to be strictly WordPerfect style OR, get this...you can have it open this in a Microsoft Word mode.  Excellent option!  And when I become more acquainted, I may choose the WordPerfect mode.  But I can't help but think that these software programs should create simple, easier to use, usable programs.  The average user will never get to some sections.  And why would we need the  And you need to purchase the impressive Corel Visual Intelligence, which is mainly geared for businesses.  The WordPerfect Lighting for creating notes seems redundant to a Word doc, and I see this program as unnecessary, not extremely beneficial.  For a busy Word professional, I'm quite sure it can be helpful, or if you have nothing better to do, go for it.  There are many neat features in WordPerfect, so many that one needs to experiment with and compare to Microsoft Word.  Excel too, has some great benefits and features that you have not seen in Word, and with time, you will learn them.  If you want to incorporate your email setup to the WordPerfect email, you have that option.  You can learn a lot from this WordPerfect program, unfortunately, the average user doesn't have a whole lot of time for learning more software, new software, or complicated software.  But all in all, this is NICE !!.....Rizzo	1
First (and most importantly) I must point out that WordPerfect Office X5 is available for about the same price. Currently, you can find new copies of both X4 or X5 for under $40.  So I obviously recommend getting the newer edition for the same. But I have not tested X5, so here are my comments on X4:  I have always loved WordPerfect, and as expected I love X4. For almost 2 decades now, WordPerfect has earned a well-deserved reputation for excellence, and in my opinion it's much better than Microsoft Word or putting together a quick Word document.  I also strongly recommend Open Office, an open source, completely free office suite. I've used Open Office almost exclusively for the past 5 years, and it's great for "light" word processing, and it's spreadsheet is more than adequate. However, if you are a heavy user, need templates like label templates (Open Office is not great at this), or need somewhat sophisticated word processing functions (like image integration), WordPefect is hands-down the best in my opinion.  Additionally, WordPerfect opens any PDF into Word Perfect. It saves in just about any format (including .docx). Others have touted the optical character recognition (OCR) feature, which can convert a scan to text. This in itself is actually not a big deal - almost every scanner has bundled software that can do this. But having it build into the word processor means you can take a JPG image (such as a scanned receipt) & convert it back into text.  If you already have X4, I doubt that I would actually recommend upgrading to X5 - I don't plan on it. But if you're looking for a new word processor, I would suggest checking out X5. As for X4, I give it an easy 5-stars.	1
At work, we just got the newest version of Microsoft Office with Windows 2007 update; I have to say that it is the worst and most confusing program I have seen. Word perfect is good for anyone who is familiar with the original Microsoft Office. It's compatible, almost exact in the interface and easy to use right out of the box, without having to read a manual. My only complaint is its price. Word Perfect Office offers an alternative to Microsoft Office, but it isn't cheaper. Unfortunately, most major institutions update their Microsoft, which means that you will need to learn the new office to be a viable candidate in our contemporary job market. However, for regular home use, Word perfect is a great and easy to use program with lots of great features.	1
This is a fairly expensive piece of software, but it does a lot. It allows you to do word-processing, including letters, reports and newsletters. You can create complex spreadsheets that can be turned into charts and graphs for visual presentations. You can create slideshows, proposals and other interactive reports. You can create PDF files. You can manage your email, use online services to collaborate with people across the country and around the world, and you can store, collect and use information from almost any source imaginable. In short, this program works much like Microsoft Office and is compatible with it. I highly recommend this suite of programs for people who, like me, have their own home business. It's one-stop shopping for almost anything you could need.	1
I LOVE WordPerfect, have been using it since before Windows so I have had 5.1, 6, 9 and 12.  Just recently, I purchased the standard edition of WordPerfect Office X4, one for my XP workhorse and one for my husband's Windows 7 model.  Since this item has been reviewed for nearly two years, I won't duplicate the other comments, especially those that go into depth with what the suite can do.  Let me say, however, that I have used and enjoy the fact that Quattro Pro is interchangeable with Excel.  As a writer, I always preferred WP's capability to Word's and still find it the superior word processor.  Now with a neat clipboard like Lightning and the wondrous capability to write or modify PDF files without memory hungry Adobe Acrobat, I'm in heaven.  I performed a clean install without a problem on both machines.  Decided not to use the email program because I love my old Eudora and prefer not to change.  WP Office X4 is Vista compliant; I also find it works beautifully with the Windows 7 64 bit machine.  Kudos to Corel!  Again!	1
It's a real tragedy in the world when when the best word processor in history must take second place to MS Word, but that is what has happened here. Office x4 couldn't be a better program but pressure from Microsoft(20% owners), Vector capital (69%) and other groups have caused it to lose most  of its unique features. The *.wpd format is said to not be a  industry standard any more (though I highly disagree). The existence of WP x4 is a testiomony to the strength of the program. Word has never faced this kind of fire before and probably wouldn't survive if it had.   Corel has done its absolute best to keep this fine piece of software together. Wordperfect has been a stable solid program since the seventh edition of the family pack and this edition is no different. People would argue that the lack of change is bad for WordPerfect. I think that Corel has made a very stable product that can do anything and everything better than any Office suite out there. The problem? The increasing similarity to MS Word. These days, the only things that Corel banks on is the "compatibility" with other Microsoft products like Word and Excel. The fact is that WordPerfect x4 doesn't need to imitate others. It is already good. For that matter, so is Quattro Pro which is an excellent spreadsheet that doesn't need to be compatible to excel or 1-2-3 to be good.. Buy Wordperfect Office because it is a good program and not because it is approved by Microsoft.	1
Wow, I am finally out of the dark ages with Wordperfect Office!  Some very neat features, such as the password protected pdf files.  I, for one, did not need that feature, but I am sure there are some out there that do!  Installation was a breeze and it's very easy to use and navigate!	1
I've been a devoted WordPerfect user since the mid-1980s, so I'm always glad to see an update.  This one keeps the general look and feel of my last version (12), which I appreciate.  WP continues to follow the basic Windows-like menu structure instead of the old function-key approach, and I've long since resigned myself to that.  The suite remains better than MS-Word and related products, though they continue to converge.  I appreciate the "reveal codes" feature, which MS seems incapable of duplicating.  Also, I work with lots of foreign languages and with mathematical symbols, and WP supports a bigger menu of those than Word does.  Other reviewers will give you other reasons why WP is better, and I'll say only: believe us.  All of us.  It's better.  For lots of reasons.  If you work with people who use Microsoft Office products -- and who doesn't -- you'll be happy to know that WP imports and exports to Office very well.  Office products don't import from WP very well (gee, wonder why?), so that feature is important in WP.  The bottom line is: you can switch to WP, and you can still collaborate with the poor benighted people who don't switch.  Some of the quirks of 12, such as poor handling of embedded graphics when exported to PDF, are fixed here.  That was a problem in Presentations too, but not in X4.  X4 seems to have added a quirk in that I don't like the way it exports as HTML onto my network when I have documents with large photos in them.  The only problem is that I've had more crashes than I would like.  I installed this onto a new machine with XP 5.1 Service Pack 3, and I think it's the operating system's fault (there are some analogous problems with Adobe and Firefox too).	1
Easy to install and easy to use! I haven't used all its applications yet; however, it is easy to navigate and figure out. No problems so far - recommened!	1
WordPerfect Office 4X Standard  This is a fully functional Office package that rivals and in some cases surpasses MS Office. Each of the programs load more quickly then it's MS Office counterparts do on the same PC.  It installs in less time then MS Office and you are asked less questions during the install.  It can open almost any file including PDF's but with the documents originally created in MS Office it makes slight format changes and in some cases changes the font style.  I have used other editions of Word Perfect nice the time that Novell owned it and I have always liked the functionality of each edition and this is no different in fact in some areas it surpassed my high expectations. I just with it was a little more interoperable with MS Office. It does work fairly well with Open Office that I have installed on my MAC but the formatting changes somewhat here too.  One of the nice features is the ability to preview a document without having to open it, it's a real time saver for me. The edition of a fully functional mail program is nice.  The graphics selection is great and inserting and resizing graphics has become easier.  It's great as a stand alone processor or in a network environment where only Word Perfect is used but unfortunately won't work that well in an environment dominated by MS Office. Still it's my preferred home processor by far. It's easy to use, fairly intuitive and you can turn out some really professional looking documentation with little effort.	1
Please see [...] for a comparison of the features in pre-ribbon versions of Word to WordPerfect.  It is enlightening!  It is hard to believe it is two years since Corel released X3. When I found out that the new X4 version had been released, I downloaded the one month demo from Corel. Based on the $150 difference in price between this version and the student/home version, I would seriously consider the student version.  It is my understanding that it is very similar, if not the same.  The Student/Home version apparently lacks the PDF capabilities of the Standard and Pro versions, so if you need those capabilities, buy this version.  (I would check with with Corel to be certain if all the features are present.)  I don't have much use for anything in the suite except WordPerfect. I've been using WordPerfect since before Windows, when it had a blue screen, displayed ASCII characters in Courier font (there were no fonts except Courier), and laser printers cost a small fortune. I work for a number of attorneys -- WordPerfect is the software of choice for word processing in most offices I've worked in because, in my opinion, it is the better product for the job. It may also be because WordPerfect has been around for so long that everyone just migrated without changing. If it ain't broke, don't fix it!  Universal File Support  WordPerfect has very good compatibility with other file formats making it nearly universal. It includes PDF file support which Corel continues to improve in this version. It saves directly to PDF format Corel has now added optical character recognition so you can import PDF files directly into a text document. Although it is not perfect, it converts to and from numerous Word formats including RTF, and all versions through 7. It also supports other formats including WordStar, AMI, OfficeWriter, Lotus, Multimate and numerous others.  Skins  Corel also added two themes so that the skin looks more like XP/Vista, and for those who need it, the Word Count feature is on the application bar at the bottom of the WordPerfect window. This new version appears to be very stable.  Exceptional Word Processing Capabilities  When WordPerfect came out, it took over the market. (It was far superior to the software then available, and remains one of the best.) When MicroSoft came out with Word, I had the feeling they did everything they could to make it different from WordPerfect just to use their power in the industry to take over the word processing market, just like MicroSoft did with every other good software idea to come along. (e.g., Mozilla/Netscape, Norton Utilities.)  I have three versions of Word (2000, 2003 and 2007) and WordPerfect 5, 7, 8, 10, 12, X3 and now X4. I use the MicroSoft product only when absolutely necessary -- usually because someone else sends me a document in that format. The new version of Word is unfamiliar - the traditional pull down menus have been placed sideways on toolbars and rearranged so it is uncomfortable to use. If possible, I will use WordPerfect and save it as a Word document using the "SAVE AS" feature on the "file" pull down menu.  The reason I like WordPerfect so much is that it types more like a typewriter. You can set up and use styles if you want, but you can also just hit the tab button to indent the first line of a paragraph. If you want to change the margins for the entire document, you simply change the margins. The rest of the document follows the change. You don't have to change each paragraph.  In addition, you can get to the formatting codes. Hit Alt-F3 and the screen splits in half and displays all of the format codes -- bold, underline, tabs, indent codes, line spacing, column on and off, etc. Then you know exactly what you have done and fix and format it easily. This ability has proven useful on several occasions when clients, who insist on using Word for legal documents, cannot cajole Word to put their unruly documents into the format they want. (This is particularly true when using OCR with scanned or faxed documents.) By opening the Word document in WordPerfect, I have been able to use "Alt-F3" to identify the errant codes and quickly repair them. WordPerfect can then save the document in Word/RTF format with the problems fixed. This is particularly useful when combined with the global search and replace. For example, you can search and replace all [paragraph style] and end up with a manageable document.  Working with columns is also easier. You turn on columns and tell it how many colums you want, set the width of each, and the space between them, and away you go. You have four types of columns to work with -- newspaper, balanced newspaper, parallel and parallel with block protect. I've tried the other software, and if you change text or printers, you can never get the columns to line up the way you want it. With Word, each column change or page change seems to introduce a whole new set of control codes, and a complete set of formatting, and you can never get it back the way you want it. I once tried to scan in a list of names and addresses which were in two or three columns into Word. Each name and address was placed in its own text box. I could never work with it.  Another very important feature is the ability to view a document from the "open document" screen without having to actually open up the document. This way, if you are searching for a specific document or a document containing certain specific information or "language" you need, you don't have to serially open a document, close it, open another document, and so on until you find the one you want. This is particularly powerful when combined with the "find document" feature on the "open document" screen. Using the find button opens a screen which is similar to the windows "search" screen. You can type in a series of words, and WordPerfect will search all files on the hard drive or in the folder/subfolders in which you are working for all documents containing your target search terms. You can then scroll through and look at each document to quickly determine their contents. From the "find" screen, you can access the "quickfinder" program which pre-scans folders on the computer so that searching for documents is nearly instantaneous. Just tonight I needed to find a "Declaration re Ex Parte Notice" to use as a template from among thousands of documents. The entire search took perhaps half a minute.  The most prominent change between WP 10 and 12/X3/X4 is the workspace manager which allows you to switch between legal mode, original (classic) WordPerfect 5.1 mode (with the blue screen), legal mode, standard WordPerfect for Windows mode and Word mode. They have also included and upgraded the ability to publish to Adobe PDF, HTML, and RTF/Word formats.  This is full featured software, and does everything I need. It handles tables, tables of content, tables of authorities, column sorts -- everything I need in a law office. Graphics can be dropped in with a click of the mouse. I'm considered to be almost an expert, and there is a lot I don't know! One of the great advantages of WordPerfect is that the files are much smaller than Word documents. This means you can transport them on floppy drives. As a final thought, Word is very powerful and works very well for short documents such as business letters. If you do anything over several pages, you are much better off with WordPerfect.  Take time to get to know the software and you'll be glad you purchased it.  Other Programs:  The Corel Office package includes replacement programs for most of the stuff in Microsoft Office. The suite includes a Microsoft Outlook replacement (Mail), a PowerPoint replacement (Presentation), an exceptional spreadsheet program (Quattro) and Lightning. I haven't yet figured out what Lightning does except act as a notebook of some sort.	1
I found lots to like about Corel's WordPerfect Office X4.  And, speaking as an unhappy employee forced to use WordPerfect back in the Dark Ages, I can attest to the improvements that Corel has made in this suite of Office applications.  Here are a few of the pros and cons of this program as I've experienced them:  PROS:  WordPerfect X4 is easy to use, and it is easier to manage my blog with text from WordPerfect than with text written in Word 2007.  Same with Quattro X4 - easy to use, fast-running.  No complaints here.  WordPerfect Office X4 comes with a tutorial video that shows you how to do all manner of interesting things with your office suite.  I've only completed half of it, and I've already learned some new time-saving tricks.  I've used the PDF maker to great advantage, and I'm very pleased with the results. I also appreciate not having to buy Adobe Acrobat yet again.  CONS:  WordPerfect is designed to work with documents from every conceivable word processor.  Ahem - isn't that a bit of overkill, or could it perhaps be managed during program installation so that my computer doesn't have to host such a big program?  WordPerfect Lightning was a big problem for me.  It did not work and play well with the rest of the programs on my computer.  I finally uninstalled it because it popped up unexpectedly and interfered with my ongoing work.  I have yet to try the month's free trial of Corel's Visual Intelligence, but I can report that it is a subscription-based service.  Every year you get to pay again, and, somehow, that rubs me the wrong way.  I'll buy a program (I know, I know, I'm only leasing it), but I don't want to buy the same program over and over every year.  So I consider this feature, which may in fact be very good, to be a pain.  Overall, I find more pros than cons with WordPerfect Office X4.  It's not perfect, but, as a regular user for two months, I've found that it meets my needs most of the time.  I won't be going back to Microsoft Office.  Three and  stars!	1
I love love LOVE the PDF capabilities that come with Wordperfect X4.  The spreadsheet is incredibly easy to use.  All in all a very nice application.	1
I am not an expert on computer programs and have only a laymen's understanding of them.  This Word Perfect version has everything I would need to do word processing and other functions I would expect from Microsoft Word, Powerpoint, Excel, etc.  The programs work beautifully and I recommend it.  I was glad that Amazon Vine offered it to me for review.  It's a nice program to have and as a teacher will help me do my work even better!	1
So many of the other reviewers have said what I would say about Wordperfect Office x4 that I'll keep it short.  I didn't use the most of the programs much as my main use of office suites is word processing.  I got this suite for my laptop which runs on Vista. My desktop runs XP and I have a copy of MS office that works on XP. Short of buying another copy of MS office, I needed a word processing suite that would convert my word files back and forth with a minimum of formatting destruction.  I do genealogy and among my projects is a detailed transcription of family letters in book format with photographs and images interspersed among the text along with complex uses of headings and footnotes.  When converting between different programs, headings, picture placement, etc will be changed due to the nature of how different programs format documents.  This essentially has limited me to using Word on my desktop. I've tried several editing suites, including Open Office.  All were a bust.  Wordperfect however, did a great job. Not only did documents for word show up correctly in Wordperfect, but they translated back correctly too.  Formatting, complex headings and section breaks, all converted flawlessly. That to me is a great bonus going for Wordperfect X4. It really is compatible with Word. With the vast majority of the office and professional world using Word, this compatibility is a strong selling point for me.  Added to that, WP actually has adjustable menu setup settings, so you may set the menu and tool systems to be configured much like Word is. For someone who works mainly in Word, this is a godsend. It helps avoid relearning where everything is. While some things will still be different, it goes a long way to make that transition easy.  Another feature that is of great interest to me is the ability to publish files to PDF format. Being a genealogist, I do a lot of file sharing with other genealogist. PDFs with their compact size and sharability across platforms are the perfect way to do this. Word perfect makes it easy to do and even allows several types of PDF conversions, from highly compact versions to a commercial printing version.  Word does not offer this option at all.  Would I personally convert from Microsoft Office to Wordperfect?  I've used Word for so long that I think it would be a bit of a stretch. WordPerfect to me has some features that are superior to Word, but for the most part, for my purposes, Word has been sufficient. Still, for a casual user such as myself WP is a good option.	1

item was as described, I was pleased with the purchase	1
I installed Streets and Trips 2009 on a Lenovo S10e netbook for testing. It is running Windows XP with 1.5 GB of ram. Here are a few brief observations:  -Performance is satisfactory. Routing in real time worked well, there were no complaints. -As should be expected, the GPS worked best outdoors or in a car. It takes a while to lock, but that is the case with many handheld gps units. -Screen real estate is at a premium. Microsoft's interface does not lend itself well to the lower resolution of a netbook, but it is still useable enough. To maximize screen space for the maps and other windows, Right-Click on the task bar at the top, and turn off large buttons - and to claim even more space - turn off standard view. The task bar will disappear, but you can still access all features from the drop down menus.  The combination of Microsoft's software, the gps and a netbook makes for an interesting alternative to a dedicated gps unit. There was the moment where I realized that Microsoft's GPS unit would not automatically be configured with Streets and Maps, so I had to do it, which was not difficult, but was also unnecessary. That is the nature of the beast; it is a computer application - not a gps appliance. It benefits from a richer interface due to the presence of a keyboard and mouse, but for some the focused simplicity of a dedicated gps will be enough.	1
I had been debating whether to get a GPS (like a TomTom) and didn't want to spend that much on a navigator. So I was glad to try this product out. Of course, you have to deal with your own laptop issues in a vehicle when you want to use this - so it's a little more burdensome than a TomTom. But I found it quite useful.  The software installation was nice and simple for me - I have XP. But at home, my GPS was not picking up many satellites. It did eventually find some, but it took a while. And every time I start up the software, it seems to take a few minutes to find the satellites from inside my home. That part was not good because I wanted to make sure I knew how to use the product before going out on the road! But eventually, it would track enough satellites to give me good directions, etc. The audio was loud enough on my laptop, but I think it could stand to be louder. You never know when you're going to drive through a very noisy intersection, etc. And then there are plenty of tools in this software. Calculate the cost of a trip (you can input gas price, etc.), find good restaurant deals on a certain route, etc. I haven't used all the tools much, but I'm sure these are great for the frequent travelers. Overall, I think for the price, this is a pretty good product.	1
I am going to use this product along with a mini-notebook for an upcoming bicycle tour.  The plugin USB GPS along with the updated mapping software will make an excellent guide, and an indispensible aid in travelling.  Installation is simple and easily done.  I have had no problems zeroing in our my area.	1
Microsoft's 2009 Streets and Maps comes with a small GPS and all of the software guts needed to stay on track perfectly, so perfectly, in fact, that my daughter took it for herself and is using it in another city. "Could you write a book report on it?" I implored. Still waiting. But between her laptop and the MS 2009 package, she's never had a problem from state-to-state. That's a lot of driving, and sometimes into districts that defy maps. That's a short endorsement, but as a dad, I'm not worried about her getting lost... ever.	1
This has two items in it that deserve separate mention. The first is the GPS receiver.  I have previously used a Garman GPS 60cs for hiking and such, but even as it's great for tracking in the wilderness it doesn't have near the detail that newer, larger, more street driving, oriented GPS's have.  But, it has a good signal and is pretty rugged.  That's the comparison.  The USB GPS provided took a bit bit longer than my Garmin to find the location, but when it did it was pretty surprisingly accurate.  It was very easy to install on my XP laptop, and really worked well in tracking movement and location.  The first time I plugged it in I was in the living room of a 1st floor apartment.  The signal didn't seem to go through the walls very well, and it couldn't pick anything up. That's to be expected.  Outside that location, everything worked perfect.  Easily linked up with the Streets & Trips.  A lot of details have already been given about Streets and Trips itself. I have used Garmin's software--both their North America Streets version and their Western National Parks/Forests version.  I've also become quite a fan of google maps, with occasional use of the other versions.  The major benefit, of course, to Streets and Trips is that unlike Google or the others it doesn't depend on an internet connection.  The major benefit, of course, of another Garmin or other type of GPS is that even this version packaged with the GPS is significantly cheaper--if you have a laptop already.  The software is easy to use and intuitive.  I need to poke around more but I've been pretty satisfied so far. The list of interesting places is very good, as is the overall maps and associated tools. I've not used previous versions of Streets and Trips, so I can't compare this particular version to previous ones.  The one big issue I have with it, that has me using Google a lot in short, one-stop trips is that there doesn't seem to be a way of rerouting the directions.  With Google, a little cursor click and move can shift the route to something that might be preferred for whatever reason. Living in the LA area, as I do, there are a lot of ways to get from here to there, and a lot of reasons why what might seem on paper to be the best isn't at all the best.  The only other downside isn't to do with the software, but instead having to bring my laptop with me places.  Meaning this really is something that I'd use a lot for longer trips, but not as much for the shorter ones.  I'm quite pleased, especially given the price.	1
Been a user of streets since it first came out a long time ago.  I love the program so looked forward to this update.  I never had the GPS unit previously, so I enjoyed the GPS it really caught a signal quickly and accurately tracked.  It's a pity that streets and trips has lost much of its lustre over the years with standalone GPSs now so affordable and online mapping sources having taken over.  But still, I love streets because I can quickly map and get detailed stuff printed without ads in the way or getting confused.  Scrolling is super duper fast since it's all native to your PC, no remote caching is done.	1
Years ago I owed what I think was the first version of this product and it didn't work very well.  This product however works really well.  The menus are a bit confusing but as far as tracking goes this is a good product.  I  used it while on a trip along side my Magellean GPS and it compared well.  The PC version is a little slower than the standalone GPS but it is a nice alternative to buying a more expensive GPS.  Another pro is you have a bigger view of the map and can zoom in and out.	1
I've had four previous versions of this product before online mapping sites made the pre-trip-planning portion of this software mostly obsolete.  It has had a good run.  It still offers something to those who want to plan long road-trips in legs, I guess, but even that use is fading with more compact GPS systems.  The mapping system does what it says it does, so that's fine....  What bothers me is how poorly the GPS hardware works.  Upon first installation, I was right next to a window, and it could not pick up any satellites at all and asked if I had a clear view of the sky -- well, no, and unless you're driving in a convertible....  Finally, as a passenger in a mini-van, I was able to obtain "constant-intermittent" service.  "Huh?" you might well ask.  Well, at least every mile, the hardware would lose satellite tracking, reacquire it, and then squelch out in its chirpy/brittle voice (even my old GPS has 6 smooth voice-choices for English) that it was re-routing and tell me again and again and again what the next turn is.  That became extremely annoying after about 3 minutes, as it was impossible to have a conversation in the vehicle, even when the next turn is in 51 miles.  I tried the male-to-famale USB cord they included to enhance the signal.  It's 28" long (not including the connectors).  This is just long enough to be too long to rest the receiver on your lap(top) and too short to tape it to the windshield or a window, which might actually be useful.  Another loser component.  There's no traffic notification system designed into this system, which is something even my 2-year-old Garmin has.  That feature saves me a LOT of time sitting in traffic, and I can't see going backwards to this MS offering.  Also, you can't just type in a destination while driving.  You have to set up a complete "trip" before-hand.  This is just silly.  What you must do is create and plan a "trip" to your destination from some place you recently passed, while driving (disclaimer....), from whence it will re-route your "trip," just to make the unit function using the same approach it did years ago before the GPS component was introduced.  It's almost as if the MS designers knew this was a dying breed and didn't bother to fix such obvious flaws, such as the passenger (or driver) trying to manage a laptop while driving....	-1
When I am planning a trip, I enjoy planning out the route, calculating the costs, finding nearby sites and restaurants...all of which I was able to do with this software.  For someone who revels in details, Microsoft Streets & Trips allows me to do so much more than I ever could with the free online navigation sites.  I found the interface fairly easy to use and had no issues.  Unfortunately, I found the execution of the GPS while traveling to be cumbersome at best.  We used our 17" laptop, which takes up a lot of space in the front seat of the car (and must be held by someone) and is therefore rather awkward.  When leaving the computer turned on, it gets hot, and the battery wears out...not great for extended travel.  I may have done better on my Asus Eee PC, but lack the external drive to run the installation CD.  Nevertheless, I see the benefit of the trip planning software (even without the GPS) and imagine that the GPS feature would work well as long as you have the space and power for your computer.  If simply for the fabulous functionality of the route-planning software, I recommend this to anyone who is planning a trip and seeking a highly-customizable travel route.	1
Okay, I admit it -- I really am quite navigationally challenged.  When it comes to traveling, I am usually the individual that shows up late simply because I found myself taking the wrong turn, accidentally adventuring into a dangerous neighborhood, and then finding myself eventually on the wrong side of the city...  You get the picture!  Driving and finding new places really isn't my best skill set, to say it nicely.  ;-)  However, for those of us that really do need "step-by-step navigational directions", this program is GREAT!  Here's what I like about Microsoft Streets & Trips 2009 (with GPS):  1) Easy to use with turn-by-turn directions...  Say that I want to go to the Grand Canyon and Bryce Canyon National Parks for a summer vacation.  I can click on "Route Planner" and then type in the name of various places that I wish to visit and it will look up their addresses for me automatically.  It automatically figures out the shortest route for me and provides me with nearly instant step-by-step driving directions!  I no longer need to carry around bulky maps or punch in addresses manually into a portable GPS.  ;-)  It simply finds what I need and guides me right there.  Also, it allows me to put together a vacation planner, stating how many days I want to be at a certain location, when I plan to depart, etc.  This really makes it easy to figure out how long one's trip will take, when you will arrive back home, etc.  2) Up-to-Date Maps  I recently moved into a brand new house and nearly none of the major mapping companies have my place listed on their maps -- well, except for this program!  3) Lost?  Need Directions Now?  Simply press the space bar and the program will instantly speak to you, providing you with the driving directions you need.  4) GPS looks like a USB flash drive and comes with a convenient extension cord.  Best thing is that this GPS also works with Google Earth too (in Windows), which is always nice to know.  I also tried the GPS with Google Earth on a Mac, but it didn't work.  What I don't like about this program:  1) The voice is acceptable, but does seem kind of mechanical.  Sometimes, it also speaks a bit fast, which can make comprehension difficult at times.  2) I find the "find coupons" and "restaurants" features to be a bit unrefined.  For example, if I am traveling in Arizona on my way to the Grand Canyon, looking for fast food, it recommended a variety of places -- including restaurants in the state of "Louisiana."  Sorry, but I'm not traveling that far just to eat.  Overall, the program is good buy for those who are looking for a program with up-to-date maps with GPS, step-by-step navigation.  Love it!	1
The best way to describe Microsoft Streets & Trips is to say it's like having an internet mappimg site (like MapQuest.com) running  on your computer so you don't need to be connected to the internet.  You enter the start and end points, along with any places you wish to stop at along the way.  S&T will then calculate the route. It also gives you estimated drive times. One nice feature is that if you are connected to the internet while you're planing your trip, it will go out and get updated road construction and detour info. It uses this info to determine the best route. You can also find places(hotels, restaurants, etc) near your route. Once you're happy with the route, you can print a map and/or driving instructions.  If you have a laptop, add the GPS (plugs into the USB port on your computer) and it will act like the type of GPS that works in your car. Your laptop talks just like other GPS units, telling you where and when to turn. While it works just as well as my Garmin, I just don't have room for a laptop in the front seat of my car (if I have a passenger). One major advantage over standard auto GPS units is that maps and database in Streets & trips are updated pretty frequently and it's free. You update over the internet just like any other software. My Garmin is updated every year (and at a cost of about $75.00). Score one for Microsoft!  All in all, I will use it at home for a trip planner but still use my Garmin in the car.	1
This is some seriously cool software. Not only can you plan your trip coast to coast or just around the city, but Streets and Trips also provides real time GPS navigation. With updated street-level maps, Streets and Trips helps plan your outing with over one and a half million destinations - even more if you use the online search. The price is right, so give it a try!	1

I have tried over the years to learn Spanish, and have probably six complete Spanish lesson packages. One of them is a VCR tape learning program. I would rather have a DVD video learning program, which is what I thought this was. But actually this is a CD/DVD that you have to use with a computer. It requires interaction with a mouse after every question. There are three vehicle CD's that can be played while driving, but again, I was looking for something that I could just load into my DVD player and watch and learn on my TV in the bedroom. My fault, not theirs for the misunderstanding I guess. See, that's what happens when you are 67 and retired.	-1
First of all, I must say that there is a generous amount of learning Spanish materials included with this software. There are3 40 core lessons that are named after situations that learners of the Spanish language are likely to encounter.  For example:  * Checking In * in the hotel room * making a long distance call * at a restaurant * asking for directions * finding an address * Introductions * at a party * making an appointment * at the pharmacy * at the doctor's office * at the laundry * at the gas station * at the beauty parlor  All 40 of the lessons include the following sections: Vocabulary sections, Vocabulary exercises, Dialogs, Dialogs Exercises, Grammar, Grammar Exercises, and Interactive Conversation.  The software also features "workshops" where the student will have the chance to practice in five areas: Grammar, Pronunciation, Vocabulary, Conversation, and Simulations  The software also has lots of games to help break the monotony of studying Spanish. I have not had a chance to play the games but they seem to consist of crossword puzzles and online games.  This software also includes a "progress" section so that you can measure how well you are learning how to speak Spanish.  But one of my favorite sections of the software was the "tools" section which allowed me to customize my lessons.  It even allowed me to set my "minimum achievement level" which I left at the default (70%). In this section, I was also able to select the lessons based on which was the most important to me to learn. Such as:  1. The Complete Program 2. Everyday Life 3. Business Spanish 4. Travel 5. Going Out 6. Shopping 7. Complete Customization  There was also a very detailed "help" section in the software. But I found the software so intuitive that I never had to use it.  My favorite section of the software was the "media section" that included short cultural videos and MP3  audio. The videos covered topics such as Mexican Traditions, Advise for Tourists, the National Museum and more. I highly recommend the Learn to Speak Spanish Deluxe  for any beginner student of the language or for anyone who needs to learn basic Spanish for an upcoming trip to a Spanish speaking country. However, if you are an intermediate student, you will not find this software enough of a challenge.  The three things that I like most about this software is 1), its economic price 2), the enormous amount of learning Spanish material included for the price, and 3) the interactivity of the software.  Some other products that I recommend for Spanish language learners are Rosetta Stone Spanish.&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Rosetta-Stone-Spanish-Latin-America-Level-1-2-3-4-5-Set-with-Audio-Companion/dp/B00282UXC8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Rosetta Stone  Spanish (Latin America) Level 1,2,3,4 & 5 Set with Audio Companion</a>&nbsp;is pretty good if you are a visual learner like me. My only complaints are that in  Rosetta Stone Spanish the Spanish is rather basic and the course is excessively expensive.  In order to speak Spanish fluently, you must also learn lots of new words. For increasing Spanish vocabulary, I recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Quick-Study-Spanish-Vocabulary-Flash-Cards-1000-cards/dp/1423203615/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Quick Study-Spanish Vocabulary Flash Cards-1000 cards</a>&nbsp;You get 1,000 of these cards at an excellent price.

I installed DragonSpeak (10) for some computer entry.  A few weeks later I purchased this software with the idea that if it did no work I was only out a few dollars.  After installing it, Dragon speak not only stopped functioning, but would not load and now after removing the Learn to Speak software, it still will not load.  I don't care which software is to blame, just a warning that if you buy this software and use another voice recognition software, they may not be compatible.	-1
I just purchased this a couple of weeks ago and have been using it at least 4 times a week.  Love the voice recorder that lets you see how well your spanish is.  Some of the audio is too fast, but overall this is a great program for the cost!	1
PhotoPlus X2 is a very good photo editor. It is operates in a similar manner to Photoshop in many aspects though it is not as powerful as CS3 or CS4.  PhotoPlus X2 is similar in features and power to Paint Shop Pro Photo X2 Ultimate.  Both programs are more powerful than Photoshop Elements versions 6 or 7.  An additional bonus of PhotoPlus X2 not offered with Paint Shop Pro is compatibility with 3rd party Photoshop plugins.  Pros:  Basic editing such as color adjustment, sharpening, lens filters, cloning etc are easy to find and use.  Photo resizing is excellent - the best that I have seen!  (I am referring to taking a small photo and doubling it in size.  Most programs leave the photo in a fuzzy condition.  PhotoPlus X2 somehow doubles the photos with less fuzziness.)  The lens vignette function is really a nice feature to have.  If you use a polarized filter, often times the sky on one side of the photo will be much darker than the other side.  The lens vignette function largely eliminates this problem.  Cons:  The sharpen slider in the Quickfix studio works in chunks rather than in a linear fashion - 0,50 etc.  You must type in a sharpen amount in the box next to the slider and then sharpen in a linear fashion - 28,29,30,31 etc.  Serif verified this bug in Sept 08.  The makeover studio requires several steps similar to Adobe Photoshop - creation of editing masks.  Paintshop Pro Photo X2 Ultimate thankfully does not require the creation of masks to do makeover tasks.  All in all an excellent photo editor that will generally run quite nicely on older hardware - Pentium 4, 3ghz with 3gb of ram.	1
You no longer need to spend hundreds to create a good looking site with the modern features.  I purchased this software about a year ago after using Namo WebEditor for years. In general I like the software. You can create web pages fairly easily, but, just like all software, there is a learning curve.  If you have used other web editing programs, you can't easily jump in and start working. For me, it was unlearning some things, because WP X2 works differently than Web Editor. In Web Editor, you create and save pages in html format. In WebPlus, you create pages (and the site) in their format and it only converts when you publish the site.  Other things work a bit differently, as well. Tables, for example, manipulate a bit differently than in most programs. To create a new page in WE you can just open a new blank page and start working. In WP X2 you have to create a "master page" first, even if it is a blank master.  It comes with quite a few templates, but I can't comment on them because I prefer to start with a "blank slate" when I do a site.  Overall it does a lot and is fairly easy to use once you learn the conventions. It is a great deal for the price.	1
I had very high hopes for this software, as I wanted to take advantage of it for real estate purposes.  Since I am also new to the product, I was also curious about the interface, in that I didn't have any expectations based on previous versions, unlike others that have posted here.  Suffice it to say that any hopes I had were destroyed almost instantly.  This is one of the worst user interfaces I've seen in quite a while, certainly in a major product from a major publisher (and I'm a software development exec).  Virtually everything is non-standard and few things work as expected: clicks and double clicks, right/left button functionality, drag & drop, highlighting & selecting, map navigation, context menus, zooming, export & import, etc.  The iconography is just awful, awful - reminiscent of the software of a decade or more ago.  I also found the functionality outside of routing and route planning (both of which are excellent) to be more restrictive than hoped, with particular disappointment in the territory functionality, territory definitions being too limited for my uses.  Finally, the map graphics themselves just don't make the grade.  While readable, they don't display any real quality until quite closely zoomed, looking quite sketchy to that point.  The high point of the software is the routing functionality, as mentioned above.  It is powerful, flexible, and has many options I have not seen elsewhere, and which are far beyond anything available in Google Maps, Mapquest, or other web-based mapping software.  If this is your primary interest or need, this software is for you, even with the issues mentioned above.  Still, had I to break it down, I'd give MapPoint 2009 5 stars for routing, 4 for Microsoft software integration (Outlook, Excel, Access, etc.), and 1 for everything else.  Couple that with its rather steep price and I really can't give it more than 2 stars overall.  Very disappointing.	-1
If you work with geographic data this is an astounding, helpful product that allows you to use that data in interesting ways.  The map program itself, which is Microsofts Streets and Trips, is not nearly as good.  After using it for a little while I find myself going back to Google or my garmin software.  I have the USB gps to go with this, but even still the tracking is haphazard, and it takes a surprisingly long time for my laptop to recognize the gps.  I've increasingly come to the conclusion that this side of this program needs a major overhaul, and would have been really competitive in 2002, but not so much now.  But, if you're buying Mappoint instead of Streets and Trips, this isn't the biggest issue.  As a mapping program that works with data this is really unique and useful, able to provide a very helpful tool that not only can assist in necessary tasks but, at least for me, has caused me to think more and more about how I can best use the data at hand in new, creative ways to better understand various projects and research.	1
The software loaded and functioned with no problems and bugs. I am not a power user, I occasionally use it to map some geographic distribution data- it does the job for me and I have no complaints. The maps I print out for presentations look a tad basic, like a high school project- I have not looked carefully to see if more attractive maps can be found as templates in the program or downloadable from the internet. The road maps and GPS feature are very similar to Microsoft's Streets and Trips interface- I did not discern any primary differences between the two programs- they work adequately as planning software for business visits. To use them for real time navigation will be quite awkward without looking like you're driving a police cruiser with the lap top. It is also dangerous too to do that.  Overall, a competent program that adequately addresses my needs.	1
I have only used an earlier version of MapPoint and even then for only in a strictly direction-finding capacity. I understood the data mapping functionality of the product but that was never a feature I intended to use. MapPoint 2009 seems to go one better than that earlier version in refining both those features I like and use (ie. direction and route finding) and those which I have less use of.  From a usability standpoint, this interface is intuitive and easy-to-use. For me, there were no problems with moving around the map interface and zooming in to whatever I was interested with either the mouse or keyboard. The various features for route planning is as good as any other on the market today and as this is my primary focus, I'm functionally happy with MapPoint 2009. With the "optimize trip", MapPoint 2009 helps me make the best use of my time, especially when I am geocaching when I have to hit caches in several different areas. In that regard, I find it handles off-road situations rather poorly, but that's understandable. With features like being able to create what they call a "Drivetime Zone", you can find subtle and cool ways to use your maps. Drivetime Zones will select and show you what you can reach within a set amount of time from a particular center point.  Export and import of data is simple and easy with the Import Data Wizard that automatically understands what kind of data  you're importing (of course, if it contains addresses!) and then sorting graphically for data. Having direct, in-program access to demographic information must make Real Estate agents drool in analyzing their information. Using the Data Mapping Wizard (love those wizards, don't you?) makes doing such things easy. I particularly like the ability to insert maps into other Microsoft products, especially the Office suite such as (especially) PowerPoint presentations. I'm going to give this product four stars because I think it should include at least a simple GPS device for the price.	1
MapPoint 2009 is a great tool for any traveling businessman. It allowed me to plan routes, search local places, insert preset stopping times and all of this was discovered in the first five minutes.  As I continued to use the application I learned I could attach a Pharos Gps (gps-360) which allowed me to gather driving data and use my notebook as a turn-by-turn driving assistant.  While the application was written for Windows Vista/XP I was able to install and run it on Windows 7 (RC).  Overall I found this application extremely useful and the integration with Office applications was a pleasant bonus. Highly recommended for anyone that travels for business (by car) and needs a great tool to make the task easier and more productive.	1
I have GPS, Mapquest, google, etc. to get me from point a to b.  Mapquest can do that but the real power of this program is to map data in order to build a visual database that can assist you in marketing to specific demographic and geographic target.  Since I utilize MS office products, I found the interface and data exchange simple to administer.  Very cool product.  Gives the "little guy" access to vital information to grow your business. Find the answer to "Where shall I look for my next big deal?"	1
You can be excused for asking the question "why should I buy this, when I can get a map from Google, Yahoo or Mapquest for free?"  I wondered about that myself for a long time, but using MapPoint 2009 has figuratively shown me the way (yeah... that's an intentional pun).  I'm still learning the nuances of this software, but I have to say that it's one of the more effective programs from Microsoft that I've used in quite a while.  It installed quickly, and with no trouble; integrating itself with Office 2007 without a hitch.  And as a confirmed member of the "I don't need no stinking manual" Club, I've already managed move well up the learning curve into satisfied customer territory.  I'm not going to go into all the technical details, after all you've already got them available to you here on Amazon anyway; so just allow me to describe a few operations that have confirmed my willingness to embrace a "non-free, Microsoft" product over the ad-driven internet sites.  First, I wanted to plot out a new map that showed the residence locations for the 50 members of a volunteer organization I work with.  This might have an effect on locations for our group efforts in the next year (gas prices being what they are).  The old way would have been to cut and paste the addresses into Google Maps or MapQuest then try to approximate their locations onto a screen print graphic.  Time spent: 90 minutes of digital drudgery.  The MapPoint method was insanely simple.  I took the spreadsheet with the address list, and just imported it into MapPoint.  In less than 10 minutes I had a map of the area with push pin graphics for each member's home.  Another 5 minutes invested, and I had concentric circles to show everyone's distance from a specific focal point.  15 minutes of effort versus 90 minutes expended last year!  Second, I wanted to create a more detailed (customized) view of an educational tour.  Piece of cake!  And I didn't have to resort to any additional graphics package, screen prints or anything.  I suspect that as time goes on, I'll discover other uses, but for now I'm already content to recommend this.  If the price were lower, I'd give it another star, but for now it's still worth every penny.	1
In two words.... Google Earth!!! This application is slow as hell and it's not pretty. The GUI sucks and it's a nightmare to import database to be mapped in the map. No one should pay to get this application.  You can do 90% of what it claims on Google Earth and more. I am so tired of Microsoft and it trying to do everything.  Just because you have money doesn't mean you can do thing better than other people with their original ideas.  I DO NOT recommend this application.	-1
This is a robust mapping program that goes beyond&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Microsoft-Streets-Trips-2009/dp/B001EHXOFG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Microsoft Streets & Trips 2009</a>to add features such as the ability to input data from Excel or Access.  It creates clear driving directions that can be emailed as a picture or as an attachment.  The map (either as an attachment or as a picture in the email) is high quality and easy to read.  The email with map and directions was only about 260KB  Another great feature is you can customize fuel cost and MPG city/highway to get fuel cost estimates for the routes that are being planned  Another handy feature is the ability to turn a map into a web page then easily integrates it into your site with either a simple web creator or one such as Front Page or Dreamweaver.  This is probably much more robust than what I needed but it will serve me well being able to email customized directions to my home office for my clients.  In the future I may use it as a tool to map where my clients are located and perhaps develop some marketing tools.  If you are looking for a more robust mapping program to intergrate with data this could very well be the ticket.  If you are just looking for some good mapping program consider Microsoft Streets and Trips.	1
Unlike many other reviewers I have not used any previous editions of this software, but I must say that as a first time user to this software, I highly recommend it.  Unlike web based map solutions, it allows you to drag around the map with no lag or loading times (assuming your computer meets the recommended specs).  The software is ideal for small business owners because you can enter a set of destinations and it will map you the most gas efficient route to get to all these destinations.  For many uses, Google maps is all you need, but if you're a pro and need more in depth mapping data, you won't find a better piece of software than Microsoft MapPoint!	1
Though MapPoint can be used for general mapping and directions, it is not really meant for that.  It is a business application first and foremost. It is best suited for sales type companies and positions.  So for example, you buy a database of all hospitals in the USA and all of their statistics.  You can then visually see all hospitals of a certain size or how much revenue if any you have sold there so far.  You can then better decide sales territories and such.  Of course, once you did, you can provide your sales force with MapPoint and have it provide them routes to each destination to maximize their time on the road and in front of clients.  With the introduction of the Ribbon menu system in most of the Office products, I would have thought they would have incorporated that into MapPoint by now, but they did not. There are still several products they have no done this with.  I like consistency in software from the same vendor. Regardless, the toolbar is useable but still feels and looks rather old school.  It is fairly easy to import or link your demographic information as always.  What is disappointing is that they still have not included the ability to link to data via ODBC or a SQL Client.  For a business application, I would think you should be able to link to a read database and not just Access, Excel, or text files.  The best advice I can give you is this.  Just like most Microsoft products, MapPoint is available for a 60-day trial.  So always do that first to see if you like it before you buy it.	1
I installed MapPoint on a Vista 64 bit computer and an Atom Netbook with Windows XP and it functions perfectly on both.  MapPoint is a must for the serious / business users; it has all the features of Streets and Trips plus powerful data mapping, information analysis, and communication tools.  It is very powerful.  You can basically search by street to any location in the USA and Canada plus it also has street level coverage of Mexico.  It is easy to use.  You can type in a street or just click on the map.  You can put in start and end locations and MapPoint will map it all out for you so you can streamline those travel plans.  If you want to see detailed data information on different areas such as age, population, etc. then this program has it.  This is great for business users so you can target certain products to certain areas.  You can also use the maps etc. in your Microsoft Office applications (such as Word, Excel etc.) to create your own specialized documents.  Once you get rolling then you can plug the GPS receiver in your car into your computer and then run MapPoint in the full screen navigation mode to follow that route you already planned earlier.  It even has voice direction.  I really enjoy using this software, it has all the features of a good navigation program plus it is a powerful mapping and information tool.  The functionality is near perfect which is as you would expect from Microsoft.	1
Want to make your summer road trip smoother and more exciting? Just install the MicroSoft MapPoint 2009 and plug in your stops for turn by turn directions. Easy installation and user friendly to boot, MapPoint 2009 is the perfect copilot for the vacationer or the business person. Plus, you can use your GPS receiver with MapPoint to track your location and even give you audible direction. Highly recommended.	1
Let me start with two observations.  First - this is serious business software and not to be confused with run-of-the-mill GPS software. There's a reason why it is priced at about 10 times its stablemate, "Streets and Trips".  Second - I'm in total awe of this software ;)  With that out of the way, here's the rest of my review.  # Installation  I simply went with all the bells and whistles, and installed it on a budget notebook (Vista 64 bit, AMD Turion TL-60, 4GB RAM, 250GB HDD). The software installed fine, and runs like a dream. In over a month of using it, I haven't experienced any serious issues.  # User Interface  A lot has been said about the "kludgy" interface. And, yes, the toolbar icons are ugly. However, when you're driving at night, and your spouse is trying to click icons in a moving vehicle, I'm sure the wisdom of fat icons will be more readily apparent, and you'll praise the programmers who gave you nice juicy targets to click on.  The user interface is largely pane-based. Each pane is independently closable and resizable, but not dockable. I found this fairly pleasant, and it never cramped my style.  Navigation  around the map is fairly intuitive - click and drag to move the map; the mouse cursor on the edges turns into scroll arrows; and double clicking zooms in. Contextual menus on right clicking also give you the right level of control.  The one non intuitive aspect is that to create a region, you must actually right click and drag. Then to zoom in, you click inside that region. But it works.  # Function  The main purpose of this software is to support "location based applications". In other words, this software works by allowing you to project the non-location portions of your data onto a map. To make this happen you need to begin with data that has location (street, city, county, state) attributes as well as non-location attributes (such as sales figures, inventory numbers, and demographic data such as age and income).  You then tell MapPoint what location attribute to use in generating the map, and what non-location attributes you wish to represent, and sit back and prepare to be amazed.  When you consider that you can have this data sourced from a variety of data sources (natively from delimited text files, Access databases, Excel spreadsheets, and via Microsoft Data Link); and that you can program MapPoint applications using the .NET suite to access the MapPoint ActiveX control and its rich object model; and that you can integrate MapPoint with your PowerPoint presentations and Word documents, you have an amazing amount of power at your disposal.  What is positively astounding is the level of visualization you can achieve with this software.  You can pick the type of "data map" you want to create (push pins, pie charts, shaded areas, bar charts, etc.);  how  you want to represent "data ranges" on your maps (unique values, quantiles, continuous ranges, etc.); as well as customizing the colors, pushpins, etc. that make up your finished visualization.  Yes, it can do routing and GPS - but that's just icing on the cake.  # Why this rating?  What excites me most about this software is that its one of those rare products that take about a couple of hours to figure out, and then take a lifetime to master.  The possibilities are truly endless.  If you have a need for location based visualization - you owe it to yourself to download a trial version of this software, and run the tutorials. For the investment of a couple of hours, I can bet you'll come away as one of the converted.  Good luck!	1
Kaspersky used to be more geared to admins, coders, the uber pc geeks. (circa 2006)  They got a bit better in 07-08, and now, 09, the go over the top.  This is a great suite.  Very user friendly for the PC newbie, and for the pc god alike.  You can let Kaspersky do all the work for you, or you can manage it like you wrote the programming.  I switched to Kaspersky after ZoneAlarm went to crap in 05-06.  Definately the best security option on the net.	1
Kaspersky is a good product but I now use Windows Defender which is also very good.	1
For several years, I used ZoneLabs' Internet Security software.  It worked pretty well, but, over time, I got tired of the way it would seize all system resources to update databases or start a scan.  From time to time, and despite jiggering its various settings for privacy, etc., it interfered with many websites and made shutting down the computer take up to five or ten minutes.  It was time for something new.  I rehabbed an old computer (Pentium 4 running XP on 2gb) to use at work, and I had a copy of Kaspersky sitting around that I'd picked up for "free" when I bought tax software a few years ago.  I loaded it on that machine when I reinstalled the operating system.  I was able to upgrade to Internet Security 2009 with the license key.  The program runs wonderfully.  The machine is much faster than it was with the ZoneAlarm Internet Security software that had been on it.  Kaspersky offers all of the protection and functionality, but it is much more transparent -- it doesn't throw up warnings about everything or seek approval whenever a program tries to access a system function or the Internet.  It runs scans really quickly, too.  I haven't had a problem with any spyware with Kaspersky.  Under the ZoneLabs product, I once had a spyware program change my homepage and hijack my browser, and ZoneAlarm's anti-spyware didn't even detect it.  (I used Super AntiSpyware to get rid of that one.)  When the Zonelabs license on our other computers at home expired recently, I didn't hesitate to switch to Kaspersky.  By buying this 2009 package and getting its license key, I was able to download the 2010 program from Kaspersky's website and install it for less than half the price of the 2010 software, so pay attention to your ability to do that.  This is a good internet security package and is well worth your consideration.	1
I had been a loyal Norton user but when I was not allowed to re-load my newly purchased Norton anti-virus program after my computer crashed I swore off Norton forever.  I compared many different anti-virus programs mainly by reading the articles in PC World Magazine which I subscribe too.  It highly rated Kaspersky and I was lucky to find Kaspersky 2009 at a greatly reduced price at a local discount store.  It loaded easily, and so far has detected many trojans and other potentially harmful viruses and I feel as if my PC (windows XP) is about as well protected as it can possibly be at this time.  My license will expire soon and I discovered that the renewal fee is more than I want to pay so I re-bought this from Amazon's Gold Box deal and will uninstall the previous Kaspersky when it expires and install the new one.  It took some time to for me to adjust to the Kaspersky program from being so used to the Norton program, but I really like how the Kaspersky constantly updates it's malware, phishing sites, and malicious scripts on a minute to minute basis.  As soon as an update is available it automatically downloads it.  I have no complaints so far concerning this program.  My computer has not had any problems nor crashed since I've started using it.	1
It's a great security package, with some minor user's complaints.  The firewall training period is troublesome/bothersome as is the error message for programs that have been updated like IE.  It is all ways asking for permission for programs to either modify the registry or access the network at first.  It would be better if the program came with several defaults for the popular applications, like Google install.  However, you can set the permission in the firewall so it does not ask the next time around or you can set it when the message appears.  You can change the firewall setting to turn off training but one should not do that right a way.  It would also be nice to have virus scan option when applications change, like an update to IE, instead of telling me that it has changed and has not been scanned; please give me the option to scan it with that message.  That is all the complaints that I have for this product.	1
Shortly after installing this program both of my PC's ran slower and did not allow me to go to websites that I wanted to use (using the default settings).  I turned the firewall off completely and that helped access the websites, however, the computers were both painfully slow.  My computers both run XP and one is about 1.5 years old and the other is 4 years old.  I don't know if that has anything to do with it.  They both met the specifications for speed and space.  In the end, I deleted the program on both computers.	-1
I used KIS 2006 successfully for a year after being fed-up with Norton.  At renewal time I was forced into KIS 2007.  It was a disaster (see my KIS 2007 review).  After working with their technicians, I was led to KIS 2009, which was in beta at the time. I installed it with much trepidation (was I embarking on another time-sink?), but I didn't have many alternatives (the devil you know vs the one you don't know).  I was pleasantly surprised that it installed without much problem. Subsequently I've installed it easily on two other computers. It has been working flawlessly for six months.  The overhead seems to be minimal (at least relative to Norton) and it doesn't interfere with installing new programs.  It seems to offer a lot of information and reports for geek types, yet isn't intrusive for those of us who want to minimize administraive issues.  Perhaps not perfect, but it works for me.	1
Solid protection for internet....some problems with identifying and blocking intrusions but otherwise a good product	1
Probably the most expensive of all - but also has the highest of ratings.  This is my second year using Kaspersky Internet Security (KIS) and I am more satisfied than last year.  This version seems to create fewer confusing situations and also appears to be stealth in operation.  I have to admit, however, there is a lot to this program that I know little about - but try and learn as I use it.  There wasn't a User Manual with the shipped product, but there is an easily downloadable version that you can obtain from Kaspersky.com.  I am one that would have prefered a hardcopy at installation - but loading and launching was a breeze!  From my past experiences with this product it can be difficult getting through to Kaspersky's Tech department if you require immediate help.  You may have to wait a few days for any acknowledgement.  But when received, it is usually very specific and to the point.  I have had a few opportunities to discuss a loading procedure with a live Tech and was very pleased with their level of competence and understanding of my situation.	1
I can unequivocally say this product is solely responsible for the slow and painful death of my computer.  I use Windows XP Pro on a self built machine with quality components.  I would consider myself an 'above average' computer user, but ran into problems with Kaspersky that I and their technical support staff are unable to fix.  The day I hit uninstall and removed this slug from my system was the day everything went back to normal and I feel as if a 50lb weight was lifted.  This product:  1) Takes a ridiculously long time to load at system startup 2) Blocks 30-50% of perfectly safe websites regardless of whether you use MSIE or Firefox 3) Has "support" staff that takes days to respond and then gives the standard generic responses you would have already found in the help file 4) Tends to mark any incoming mail as spam if you don't use Outlook for your email client 5) Continues to interfere with your system and web browsing even if you have disabled security 6) Continues to interfere with your system even if you have exited the program completely 7) Is no longer top-rated in virus detection according to av-comparatives 8) Is mind-numbingly slow when scanning your computer for viruses 9) Consumes a tremendous amount of resources while scanning instead of working silently in the background 10) Takes a long time to update due to very slow transfer rates 11) Does not include a comprehensive guide in the retail box.  Just a CD and a lot of wasted cardboard. 12) Slows web surfing to a crawl assuming the sites aren't blocked entirely.  I'm tired of dealing with these people.  I had the exact same problem with their previous version (7.0) and it drove me nuts.  I couldn't even access Kaspersky's website to complain, their software blocked me!  Shutting off and disabling various services like the firewall or online scanner does no good.  The past couple of months v7.0 seemed like it was working correctly.  Against my better judgment I updated to this version and have regretted it.  I just can't rate this program low enough.  For the record, since I uninstalled surfing is a breeze.  Now I need to find an antivirus and firewall solution that works.	-1
The best internet security software I've ever used. It doesn't slow my computer down to a crawl, as some others, and is very effective.	1
I have worked in the computer security/information assurance professional for nearly 30 years and have been asked to review just about every possible personal firewall and/or virus protection product.  This product is a good product for a person that casually surfs the net and checks their own email but it has a difficult time with some websites that are clearly non invasive.  For a person that visits riskier sites, e.g., warez sites this would not be a good choice a  security software.  It is easily configurable but a bit noisy when it comes to warnings.  It is hard for me to say much more about this product that has not been said in other reviews.  You should read some of the other security professionals reviews and make an informed decision.  Bottom line is for normal home use this is an adequate product at a reasonable price.	1
Trend has done a nice job with the 2009 release of its complete internet security suite. The scans and system startup are a bit faster. Also the interface is much improved and very easy to navigate and use. I have been a Trend Micro home user for six years after a bad experience with Norton products. Also Trend technical support is outstanding and very easy to reach. Overall the internet security suite is very effective, easy to use and well supported. I look forward to the next release. I have my whole family using Trend and use the client-server product in twelve different locations of our small business franchise. Trend software just works, does not interfere with updates or system operation and is well supported if the need for support arises.	1
I installed this on my computer about three month ago.  It was very easy to install, and I have had no problems with it.  I recently had a problem connecting to the Internet and called my ISP tech  support.  They told me it sounded like a problem with my Trend Micro, so I called  Trend Micro tech support.  They were very helpful, and after going through a number of checks we were able to determine it was not a software issue.  I called my ISP again, who then found the problem was with their system.  I have used Trend Micro for several years and will continue to do so in the future. The price on this is great for protection from viruses and spyware, and it can be used for up to three computers.  Highly recommended!	1
This product is solid and does what it is is suposed to do. My computer works faster now and I have not tnoticed any problems so far. If I do, I will update these comments.	1
I have not had any of the problems with this program that other reviewers have experienced. I run XP Pro.  It was easy to install and set up.  It seems to run similarly to Norton Internet Security, although I notice it blocks more legit sites than other programs I have used.  I think it is a great value at less than $40 for a 3-user license, much less expensive than Norton.  Right now I highly recommend it but will update if I encounter any significant problems.	1
Personal computers are under constant attack and users nowadays need a product that will keep their pc protected 24/7 without fail. Trend Micro Internet Security is a product designed to act as a watchdog for your computer; keeping unwanted spyware, dangerous viruses, and identity thieves away from your personal computer so that it maintains the integrity of your personal information and runs smoothly without errors.  I haven't had many issues with computer viruses, but I have had problems with Spyware and I am always wary of internet identity theft. These latter two problems are the main reasons I decided to give Trend Micro Internet Security a try. I like that Trend Micro Internet Security is there, protecting my computer and I like that I can schedule it to run updates and a full scan at the time of my choosing. It will run in the background on its own regardless, but scheduling it to run at regular intervals is best because you have control over when it will run and when you will get updates. This provides greater peace of mind, in my opinion, and it lets me control when it runs to better ensure that it won't run when I have important internet work to complete.  The most important quality of any internet security product is its ability to protect from viruses, spyware, cookies, and other potential hazards. From my use so far, I can honestly say that this protect is flawless in this regard. It quarantines spyware, viruses, and other harmful intruders and it displays them on a report that is available for view at any time. Just a few minutes ago, I opened up my Trend Micro Internet Security and looked at my latest stats. It tells me that a full scan was conducted earlier today and no instances of any threats were discovered. It also tells me that, in the past seven days, my computer has been protected against 31 incidents. I can also look at a log that will tell me exactly what problems were prevented. I like this statistical report because it lets me see, at a glance, what viruses, spyware, etc., have tried to attack my computer. I like keeping a step up on these things because, considering the amount of time I spend on my computer, infections are something I cannot afford to have.  One common complaint that consumers have with internet security software is that they slow down computers and/or interfere with the usage of certain web sites or features. I have had some bad luck with other brands with slowness, but Trend Micro Internet Security causes no such problems. Of course, I schedule the scans for those times of day when I won't be using my computer, but even if a scan starts while I'm using the internet, the interference is minimal. There is an ever-so-slight slowdown, but it is too insignificant to matter. And with interference with web sites, I have only experienced one small problem thus far: The tendency of Trend Micro Internet Security to block certain features in web sites. Sometimes, it will prevent me from watching a video and I am forced to lower the protection level temporarily to get past this interference.  Taken as a whole, however, Trend Micro Internet Security is a very useful product and I am happy to report that it has held down all forms of spyware, viruses, and other problems while keeping my peace of mind at a record high level.  It is a nice, all-in-one package that offers multiple levels of protection and multiple features in a single package. I like it better than Norton and some of the other brands and it has plenty of positive qualities to earn it an easy recommendation.	1
I've used TrendMicro in the past and of the three big ones (Norton, McAfee and TrendMicro), it's the last I would probably use.  I usually use McAfee and while it's more complex, it tends to have better coverage.  Still, if you don't have internet security, it's a decent product and one that will keep most cautious people safe.  It's easy to set up and maintain.  Most of it is pretty intuitive.  It blocks most sites ok.  Still doggy on old systems, but if you have a newer system this isn't really a problem.  The price puts it in the realm of affordability, which is something its competitors are not.  If you need a security suite and can't afford the other two, choose this.	1
without boring technical details; speed 3/5 accuracy 4/5 (did not find a rootkit i installed which nod32 did features 5/5 ease of use, first time 4/5 install ease 5/5 support 4/5 (based on ease of finding) cost 5/5 because of length.  wasnt fooled by a fake renamed trojan - didn't give false positive.  I am biased towards comparing everything to NOD32, but thats my preference. Worked well with VISTA and WinXP Pro OEM SP3. I'd spent five hours toying with it, going to known "bad" websites. I got one false positive, and an alert on a keygen which may or may not have been another false positive. I'd rather have false positives than an "ignore".  Overall, I'd recommend this to the average user who does not surf unfamiliar "adult" or other "hacker/keygen/serialz" sites.  The 3-PC license is a great selling point, as most people use one AV license on multiple PCs anyways but they like to feel better about it.  4 stars just because I don't think ANY antivirii software deserves 5 stars. You are NEVER 100% safe. I'm still very happy with this.	1
I've been a Trend Micro user for many many years now and I am a very happy customer indeed.  If you need an easy to use solution for virus protection, firewall, and just the ability to use your computer without worrying about any nasties that you will get on the web or email you HAVE to try out this product!  It's a great bargain at the price point its at, the customer support is fantastic and it's an easy to use product all around.  I love it and continue to upgrade every year.  ***** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED	1
This came right when my subscription to Norton ran out so I was very happy to give it a try. It installed easily with no problems at all, the software also seems to be fairly user friendly. In the past I've used McAfee, Norton, and Avg and in my opinion this program seems to be just a little better.	1
I have Trend Micro's Internet Security on one computer at home and Bit Defender on another.  I have to declare myself thoroughly delighted with both of them.  I knew Trend Micro from 8 or 9 years ago when I got to know it as a free online system scanner.  I used it several times to rid myself of pesky viruses that McAfee could not deal with.  The specific thing I like about the Trend Micro is that it really doesn't slow the system down at all, while providing apparently great protection (I've had no virus problems that I'm aware of).  Some antivirus programs I've used really slow the computer down and make looking at pages on the Internet a drag.  But the Trend Micro has been almost invisible.  I have been very happy with the feature whereby it clears out the malicious cookies that are downloaded onto my computer through surfing the Internet.  Each day it deletes spybots and data miners without my prompting it.  If you are looking for a very fine internet security program I can definitely recommend this one.  My assessment is based on only one month of use, but that has been a completely incident free month.	1
It works and did not slow down my 2 gb ram 2.13 GHZ core 2 duo computer running XP SP3.  The loading times are significantly faster than McAffee, which took 1.5 to 2 minutes to set up the firewall before I could even surf the web.  It still takes 50-60 seconds to load the firewall after startup, and that is why I gave it a 4 stars.  It automatically deletes the tracking cookies on your computer after each scan, which is nice.  Future versions should feature automatic tracking cookie blockers.  It also ID's suspicious websites before you visit and allows you to change your mind.  Update- Trend Micro's monthly newsletter recommended a registry cleaner.  I ran the trial version and start up time is under 30 seconds again.  This suggests that start up slowness from other AV programs can be solved in a similar way.	1
I work for a technology company.  This is the brand my employer uses, and our techs all rave about how good a job it does.	1
I am using a laptop with only 1 GB of RAM, and no matter what Microsoft says, that's really the minimum that you can operate Vista Home Premium with.  Lots of programs struggle for memory to work smoothly, lots of things only "sort of" work with Vista, a common complaint.  This works and doesn't slow me down, and really impressed me.  I was very unhappy with the brand of Internet Security software that came bundled with the laptop, it made the machine sluggish and incredibly slow to boot up.  Trend doesn't, it boots up smoothly, it doesn't cause lagging when using programs, and I'm thrilled.  Its definitely a five star success on a system that has no extras.  I'm shopping for a new desktop, and this is what I'll use there too.	1
I have used this for sometime and I find it to be much better then Mcafee which we used for several years prior, our networks are much more protected and we have had less problems with this service.	1
I've always liked Trend Micro products. I've never had issue with Trend Micro products and this version of Internet Security is no exception. I generally try to stay away from products that try to be all things when it comes to security so I often turn off some of the extra features of the security suite products and just stick to the virus protection. For the average home user though the security suite can help them protect their pc and data when they don't fully understand all of the security threats and how to stop them without a product such as this.  I like the 3 PC license along with the reasonable price point. I also like that they focused in on quicker boot up time and and reduced memory needs. For years virus programs have been resource hogs so glad to see trend micro worked to reduce their footprint. I noticed some improvement on a XP machine so I think it was worth their effort.  For average family PC user I think its a good idea to utilize the Parental control. For those more savy there are  other ways to do this work for free but for non technical families this offers a good way to keep your kids out of possible trouble.  Overall I like this program and its a nice virus program with some additional features for average home users.	1
Please note that I am by no means an authority on software of any variety. That being said, from the perspective of a layperson, this version of Trend Micro's security software appears to be doing a sufficient job protecting me and my computer from our respective selves. The first point to mention is that setup is extremely user friendly, even with regard to some of the specific software settings. At this point I have probably meddled with the configurations as much as I ever will, as I have only utilized this product on my home PC. Nonetheless, I have taken further steps customizing my security settings than I have ever done previously simply because of this software's ease of use and thorough, yet simple, explanation of available functions. One such customization option that I have now utilized for the first time on any security software is the parental control/web browser settings. The ability to restrict specific categories of information, images, and data, as well as descriptions of each category, allows one to feel confident in what they are blocking and what they are allowing on a user specific basis.  Beyond the actual customizable functions, almost everyone probably has the same question: will this security software slow everything on my computer to a screeching halt? After a little use, it seems that this particular software has not had the same ridiculous stopping power of other security platforms that I have utilized in the past. That is, as of this moment, I am pleased with my ability to utilize this software as the issuing company recommends while continuing the use of any other applications simultaneously. All in all, I am not disappointed and, perhaps, pleased (if such a thing is possible when dealing with PC/Internet security software).	1
First, (writing in Nov 2009) I believe the 2009 version I currently have is already outdated. I'm unaware of the history/reason my software, which was released just a few months ago, is already replaced -- too many errors? recall? Not sure.  Anyway ... this is a decent piece of software, not great. I agree with a lot of the complaints on the Amazon reviews - no product support, virus protection lacks (lots of false positives), and reports are not terribly useful. There are also some problems registering the product - they *really* want you to buy a new box every time, for every computer, which always causes problems.  My big problem with Kaspersky is a hint of greed behind the product line -- anybody who puts excessive protections on their software, at the expense of consumer convenience, has profit (not functionality or customer satisfaction) as their #1 goal. This hunch is reinforced by their lack of support - after you buy it, they seem not to care if it works for you.  But my BIGGEST problem with this, is that anti-virus protection should be free. If Kaspersky really believes in investing energy into this product, they should make it free to consumers and charge for upgrades/advances applications (such as network and business accounts). The fact is, this is already the business model for the top rated antivirus softwares.  So here's my recommendation: Get a free antivirus. The best one right now, according to reviews of the experts, is Avast. I've never had problems with Avast (except that it wants to update too often, but it only takes a few seconds). I used to run AVG, and loved it, but the new version is too clunky, lots of crashes.  *Everybody* should be running a hosts file, which Kaspersky completely ignores. The best currently is "hostsman" (and yes, it's free too).  And for firewall, the most recent IT studies say that the Windows XP or Vista firewall works as well as any other. It's free, and chances are you already have it. If you're running Me, 2000, or earlier, try ZoneEdit (also free).  If you're running Vista, you may want to try some of their built-in safeguards. I tried Vista for a while, and went back to XP (too clunky). But if you're on Vista, it's got some pretty decent safeguards already, and may not work well with 3rd party software.  My bottom line is, the computer is a tool which I want to *work* when I turn it on, not spend time or energy cleaning up viruses or other crap, and I should have to spend a fortune protecting it. I haven't had a problem in 4 years (and the last trojan was because my brother-in-law disabled the hosts protection on my laptop to download a game). So I wish you good luck and happy, trouble-free surfing!	-1
I got this version of Kaspersky last year, but just needed it this month, when my McAfee VirusScan Plus expired.  I, of course, uninstalled McAfee first, before trying to install Kaspersky, only to be told there was still something left on the PC by McAfee, that was blocking the installation of Kaspersky.  That sort of thing makes me cringe!  I then went to "techincal assistance" or whatever it was called, on the Kaspersky CD, and immediately saw a question about what to do if a third party security system was blocking installation. Clicking that in, I discovered there were tools for McAfee, Norton's, etc. to remove the problem file. Clicking in McAfee took me to the McAfee file, which I opened, and that started the removal process.  After then going back to installing Kaspersky, I got my old friend Error 1500. That has nothing to do with the Kaspersky software, and everything to do with my PC or Vista.  (For the solution to that error, please read my review of Corel Photo Album 7.) After fixing the Error 1500 problem, Kaspersky installed immediately.  I then had to update, since this version of the software is so old.  That went quickly also, thought I was hooked up to my sister's high speed router, and not my usual dial-up connection...so, I don't know how fast or slow the update would have been with dial-up. Next, I did a full scan, and Kaspersky found 4 infected files with something "very dangerous" in them.  Two weeks later, the daily updates for Kaspersky install very quickly, even on dial-up.  And they don't slow down my PC.  McAfee's updates slowed down my PC, and sometimes they were so long, I had to go hook up my laptop to my sister's high speed router to do them.  McAfee had a maintenance feature, though, and this version of Kaspersky does not; so, I'm going to have to remember to start doing maintenance PC stuff now.  Also, interestingly, Kaspersky does not have a firewall, although it does have spyware protection.  Thus, you must use your Windows firewall, which is fine with me...as long as I don't have to use Windows Defender!  Thus, so far, I'm happy with Kaspersky...and am looking forward to hopefully an uneventful year.	1
I have had Kaspersky AV for four months.  I put it on a Windows XP laptop.  I generally use Mozilla Firefox as my web browser, but I couldn't get my work done because there were so many warnings from Kaspersky AV.  I tried Internet Explorer to browse, and it seemed to get even more warnings; I was at a standstill.  I went back to the laptop many times over several months with the same results.  I finally uninstalled Kapersky and went to my old stand-by, Norton AV. I am no TechGuy; I cannot analyze why this program interfered with my computer use in such an aggravating fashion, but it sure did.  Did it do everything else it claims to do?  Yes, as far as I know.  But the slowdown wasn't worth the protection.	-1
If I think this product is worth less than 1 star, why did I buy it?  Because I had the 2007 version and it worked ok, although weak on spyware detection. I had a 2 year license and would have been happy to simply extend it for a reasonable fee.  Unfortunately Kaspersky is greedy beyond belief and wanted more for a simple license renewal than I could buy a whole new boxed version at a local brick and mortar store.  I checked Amazon and they had AV 2009 for under twelve bucks (unexplicably today they are selling the same "old version" for sixty bucks. What is up with that?).  So it was an easy decision to pay the twelve rather than the outrageous renewal fee.  MISTAKE!  As others have pointed out my computer immediately slowed down to the speed of something from 1963.  Okay, I know didn't have computers in 1963 but you get my point.  This version doesn't do anything different, why is it such a resource hog?  As others have pointed out, KAV2009 does NOT play well with Microsoft Office.  I immediately began having problems saving files because the AV software was trying to protect the file.  How can anyone work with MS Office if they can't save files?  If I turn KAV2009 off, Office works perfectly, turn it back on and the problem happens again. There is no doubt that the AV software is at fault.  How can any software manufacturer try to sell a product that doesn't work with MS Office?  I've had it for about a week and simply can't live with the turtle-slow performance so even though I have almost a full year to go I have ordered another brand to replace it.  I have nothing good to say about KAV2009.	-1
This maximum security spyware assures security against hijacking and identity theft. It also protects against viruses and worms and blocks malware and phishing sites. It doesn't slow down the computer. The reasonable price for this protection should also be considered. I found it easy to install and use. Highly recommended.	1
I'm running Windows XP SP2 on my computer.  I also had the McAfee Virus Scan Plus installed.  Upon uninstalling MVSP, the Kaspersky AV software doesn't install.  You'll be able to unpack it, and it will run start-up scripts.  However, it will find that you still have McAfee products on your computer, and will not install until you remove them--even after you've removed them.  That being said, I tried for 4 hours, trying to re-install Kaspersky to to avail.  There is nothing that is McAfee related on my computer anymore, and Kaspersky still doesn't install itself.  I have to give it 1-star since I can't even get it to install.  I do not know what the characteristics of it if it were to install.  -----  Update: After 10+ reboots, the Kaspersky AV install finally got over the non-existant McAfee programs, but yet again is stopped.  The reason this time?  It is not compatible with either Spybot or Norton AV.  You know what?  This software can take a hike to the trash bin.	-1
This seems like a no frills anti-virus solftware. The installation on Windows XP was simple. Not much hassle with any settings. The only dicosmfort is the updates: Kaspersky's site is unbelievably slow, or it appears this way; hence, the it takes forever to complete the updates. Hence 4 stars.	1
Well phooey. I ordered this 2009 version, expecting it to surely work with my pre-release version of Microsoft Windows 7, but that turned out not to be possible. The installation disk did not recognize Windows 7 as a supported version. I then attempted to load the pre-release version available within Windows 7 itself, only to discover that version didn't fully work either, with the vendor's discussion board stating Windows 7 isn't officially supported yet.  I then tried installing the program on a Windows XP machine, only to discover after installation that it is incompatible with the free version of Zone Labs' firewall I've carefully tuned over a period of years.  It's nice such packages are now covering more security bases for users, but I'm a fan of using best-of-breed products, and only wanted this to be an anti-virus, not also a firewall or anti-spam product. At the very least, I'd like to be able to choose at install time which aspects of the program I wish to use.  Next time I need to build an XP PC from scratch, I'll try this again, but for now, much as I looked forward to trying this product, it's shelfware.	-1
I purchased the Kaspersky Anti-Virus 2009 after my Internet Security program of the same brand expired. I had read better reviews on this software and decided to give it a try. Now after having it installed on my system for a couple months, I can fairly and honestly say I prefer this product over the later. My system runs faster and smoother to the point you can't even tell you have an anti-virus software installed. That is until you venture into troubled waters, then it responds like you'd expect and easily handles the situation without a miss.  I'm sold on this version, so unless they mess it up, I'll certainly renew my product next year.  I rate this 4.0 Stars	1
I enjoyed installing Kaspersky, but I really enjoyed how it worked.  It has an indicator telling me how my PC is running, the overall speed and how  many updates are available. I was cleaning out my PC to find multiple Trojans and  pieces of spy ware that Norton could not find. I recommend it for all techs, home  users alike.  What makes it really interesting is the fix it now capability. Please give it a go  and you will not be dissatisfied.	1
Recently I found myself with a quickly expiring Trend Micro PC-cillin Internet Security license that came with my Dell XPS. Deciding that $79.99 for a 1 year renewal was more than I was willing to spend on what had been an intrusive and unintuitive security suite I decided to look elsewhere.  I ended up getting Kaspersky Anti-Virus 2009 and have been using it on my system for about 2 months and overall I'm satisfied with the product.  After completely removing Trend Micro's program from my PC and installing the Kaspersky program I was prompted for the typical updates. All told the process of installing and updating the software is as easy as it gets for a somewhat computer literate person. Though the initial update can take more than a few minutes to complete download and install.  Once the program is up and running the interface is extremely straightforward. There's a giant stoplight icon at the top of the application that indicates the current status of you PC. Green = protected; Amber = A scan is overdue or an update needs to be installed or otherwise the application needs your attention; Red = some sort intrusion/malicious application has been detected. Simple and effective.  One thing that I immediately noticed after running a complete system scan was Kaspersky detected a number of malware/spyware apps on my PC that Trend Micro missed. Actually I made it a point to run a full scan with Trend Micro before I removed it so I was doubly glad I didn't renew that software license.  After the scan I ran into my first issue with the Kaspersky software. After the program detects malware - including 1 app that it classified as "possible key logger" with a medium threat rating - it's confusing on what it is exactly the user needs to do to eradicate the problem. Is the malware automatically quarantined or deleted? Another issue is that while the Kaspersky program is running it's scan it constantly detects "possible vulnerabilities". A lot of those vulnerabilities are associated with with very common programs - MS Office for example popped up at least half a dozen vulnerability logs. I'm not exactly sure what I'm supposed to do with that information and it's not clearly explained.  I have a moderately powered PC and a major concern is always the system resources that anti-virus software suites use. Kaspersky thus far hasn't impacted my PCs performance in any major way. One thing I did notice is that websites are a tiny bit slower popping up. No major foul there.  Overall, I'm satisfied with Kaspersky anti-virus. I've used everything from resource heavy hitters like Norton & McAfee to Trend Micro and AVG - Kaspersky is right around the top of my list for keeping the resource footprint shallow and for it's easy to use interface. Though I hope that future versions will make the process of cleaning malware more clear.	1
I used this program on a computer that had MacAffee suite on it. It found and took care of some nasties that were lurking in the shadows. It was easy enough to download onto computer and use and hasn't been an issue since I put it on the computer. I've found that MacAffee doesn't always do a good job. So, if you're looking for an adjunct program, or one to take the place of a program, you really should consider this one. Well worth the money.	1
I recently was running Trend Micro on my computer and when the subscription expired I wanted to try a new Anti-Virus software, because Trend Micro was really slowing my computer down. So after reviewing tons of Anti-Virus software , I bought Kaspersky. Now the installation is pretty easy but, if you get stuck, just go to their support center and they will help you with any problems. So after I installed the software it had to do an update and restart, but after that you are ready to go! Now compared to Trend Micro, this program flies! My web pages load instantly, my programs load faster, and pretty much a completely faster system. Now the best feature this software has I think is where it will adjust how much RAM it uses, based on what you are doing. So say that you are trying to load a youtube video and you want all your power to go to that, Kaspersky will automatically adjust how much RAM it is using, to let you watch your movie and then will boost back up when your computer is idle. My son loves it because it is perfect for playing games, especially those high end graphics games that all the kids love. He has noticed a big difference in the speed that the computer manifests now as opposed to running Trend Micro.  It does EVERYTHING that Trend Micro did (& more) , but better! :-) We are pleased!  It is definitely a better value!	1
Kaspersky Anti-Virus 2009 is a premium security solution for home PC users. Select the express (default) or custom installation to take advantage of a suite of applications designed to protect your computer from viruses, spyware, adware, worms, dangerous email messages and other threats. Importantly, you have the option to participate in Kaspersky's Security Network which enables you to share information about new threats and allowing you to download updates automatically whenever they are indicated. With over 250 million systems in the network, Kaspersky provides an essential service that provides a lot of value to end users.  The purchaser should recognize that Kaspersky is sold as a single-user license. If you have multiple PCs at home, you will need to buy additional copies of the software. On this point, Kaspersky compares unfavorably with some of its competitors who offer multi-user or unlimited use home licenses. But for those who want the best possible protection for a single machine (or can spend a little more and are willing to track and manage multiple installs and expiry dates on all their home PCs), it's hard to beat the protection offered by Kaspersky.	1
I've always loved Kaspersky because it's one of the fastest AV software you can get in Windows. Being profession in IT, I've used several other software or hardware based AV solutions.  Kaspersky is one of the best and cost is very reasonable. I would recommend Kaspersky over Norton or even Macafee. The key when you buy any AV software is to look in their website whether they have their own AV database.  I use other enterprise level AV solution such as Fortinet which is the best enterprise grade AV solution but it's not cheap. Buy Kaspersky when it's on sale, you won't regret it.	1
I used pretty much all the big antivirus packages out there. Currently I am using F-Secure antivirus and I have mixed feelings about it. Previously I used Kaspersky Security Suite and I didn't like it mostly because of the annoying firewall. As an antivirus I was always happy with it.  This package includes only the antivirus and is pretty solid. It installs without problems and it works. If you are worried about having on the CD an earlier version (build) that might have installation issues, you can always download the latest from Kaspersky and activate it with the serial number provided.  Kaspersky is a well-known name in the security software community and it always has one of the top places when somebody does a test on multiple security suites or antivirus programs.  The load on the system is not slowing it down, at least not on my machine, but maybe on older computers it could be a problem.  The only issue I have with this software is again the Kaspersky firewall. Since the firewall is not part of this package it is indirectly affecting it. Like most users, I would like to have a security suite rather than individual products made by different software vendors. In this case, I cannot have the anti-virus without having the Kaspersky firewall, therefore, no matter how good the antivirus I will not use that in combination with say Norton Firewall. This makes this product of limited value for me and I will probably not buy it by itself. The only use I can see for this as a standalone antivirus is on a test machine when you want to scan your suspect files with different antivirus programs.	1
Installing Kaspersky was mostly uneventful, however, it did require me to uninstall Spybot first (which seemed strange to me -- but not as strange as Spybot's response to being uninstalled).  During the installation it did an update which took roughly an hour.  After that, it bacame mostly invisible.  I haven't noticed any performance issues, and have been been pleased with this product.  I cannot say how well it is working, because there has been no virus alerts.  I can say that it is mostly invisible and I like that.	1
Malware, viruses, click-jacking, oh my!  Unfortunately, any Internet user has to be aware of how these words can affect how safely they navigate the Internet today. They have become as normal a part of Internet culture as an email address or facebook membership. If you are careful, and I mean *really* careful, you can get away with using the Internet without a "security" product--or more likely these days, a suite of products. I know some who do this without issues, but they're all systems administrators with decades of security administration under their belts. Most however should not venture out into the wild unprotected.  Enter Kasperksy. I have used various other A/V (anti-virus) programs in the past--McAfee is the choice anti-malware at my work--and there are a few things I judge them by, starting with what I call the overhead factor. Because these programs run constantly, just how much CPU time and system memory do they require? Like a good butler, I judge these programs by how little I notice them until (hopefully not) I need them. Of course, there are other judging criteria such as the heavily important one of how effective it is in catching and eradicating malware, and then how easy is it to use and finally, what's the upkeep? Downloading updates, how often the virus signatures are updated, etc.  I'm happy to say that Kasperky AV 2009 scores quite highly in each of the above departments. The installation itself was simple although not quick. On my Vista 32-bit Ultimate PC, it took almost 25 minutes and one restart to get it installed. In addition, it took a few more minutes to install updates; in total, set aside about an hour to get it installed and fully operational. This is a bit long, as you may imagine.  Thereafter, but for one little problem [update below], Kaspersky ran without problems. It was quite straightforward to configure and the reports of its activities are easy to read. The memory and CPU overhead are minimal considering what it does which is categorized in three general areas: anti-malware, system security and online security. For anti-malware, we have files and memory security, email and IM security and web traffic security. System security covers what it calls "proactive defense," which means it protects against the usual suspects (Trojans, worms, keylogger detection, hidden driver installation, OS kernel modifications--this is not a default however--and hidden object detection).  Setting all of these via the intuitive GUI is ... well, intuitive. There are some great real-time graphs of system and software activity which is all logged for later reference. Statistics are kept for a year while reports are kept, by default, for 30 days or 1GB whichever is less. It's all quite simple to manage.  The problem I spoke of before has to do with a pet peeve of mine and the reason I uninstalled McAfee from this very same computer. I fly online with Flight Simulator on a network known as VATSIM. Both McAfee and Kaspersky prevent normal operations of multiplayer function on VATSIM (and some others, I've heard) even though you have paused protection. I would like to be able to completely turn off anti-virus protection when I want and not have it actually continue to work regardless of setting. [Update: Boy, was I wrong! Kaspersky does not interfere with VATSIM traffic. I'm not sure why it happened a time or two when I tried initially, but I've since discovered there are no issues whatever with running Kaspersky and VATSIM concurrently. This could have been because of the numerous updates to the software, but regardless, this bumps it up into the 4.5 star class.]  Apart from this, I judge Kaspersky A/V 2009 to be a top player in the field. I only wish the free update time period would be for more than one year for what it's worth, but that's a measure of how valuable I believe the software to be. A solid effort at 4 stars [4.5 stars!]	1
Kaspersky Antivirus 2009 is the best antivirus software for portable and home computers. * easy to install * user interface * huge virus database * great results	1
My computer did not have any previous issue with it. I saw kaspersky on deal with gold box, so i decided to try it out. Midway through installation, the computer crashed, with an irq overflow, and it rebooted itself. I then tried installing it again, but windows Data Execution Prevention kept kicking in and killing the install, so I decided to disable the DEP. It then asked me to reboot my computer, and when i did, the computer wouldn't even start in safe mode. I had to do a gateway system restore which keeps my data, but reformats windows, so now I have to reinstall all my programs.  There is no warnings, or instructions in the joke of a user manual they include. Do I want to try to install this again? NO! This piece of poo is going back to amazon asap!	-1
Kaspersky offers the very best anti-virus engine. They have a small footprint and an exceptional product. They offer classes for free on their internet site on internet security and program usage. While some may claim that others offer a superior product at a lesser price, no knowledgeable person will dispute their effectiveness. After a scan, they will offer suggestions on other manufacturer program upgrades for maximum security. I have never encountered this feature with other anti-virus programs. But what I really like most about Kaspersky is that you buy a license and not a program. So long as you have a current license, you are entitled to their lastest and greatest program. They provide a very simple means of upgrading their program at no expense on their web site. To those that have had a bad experience, I suggest that you e-mail your concerns to Kaspersky. I have gotten a response within 24 hours and the response answered my question. For me, Kaspersky is a no brainer. I have their products on all of my PC's. I have Comcast and can get McAfee for free, but I have Kaspersky. I have had Norton and will pass. Enough said.	1
The Rosetta Stone program installed easily on my PC, and was up and running without any problems.  The lessons are easy to follow, and start you learning instantly.  I found it easy to follow the lessons and started absorbing the words and phrases with no difficulty.  I am looking forward to the more advanced lessons.  This is a much easier and more effective way to learn a language than other audio and computer programs I have tried.	1
While it should be a standard to wait a long while before reviewing there are aspects that become more quickly apparent both for comparison and understanding.  My previous French language experience came from two years of high school classes about sixteen years ago.  I've had a few other language classes since then, establishing me if not as a thorough polyglot at least as a someone well versed in language training from a variety of different teaching styles, approaches, and contexts.  I've tried to keep up with a number of these languages I've studied, with various success, and with various software help. Mostly the inexpensive kind.  I've picked up the Instant Immersion disks (a great, inexpensive, entirely un-thorough approach), the Learn to Speak series (about the same, though with a lot more content).  Recently, to learn German for my studies I looked at more thorough programs and two stood out.  The Rosetta Stone series and the Tell Me More.  I noticed Tell Me More was getting great reviews and was less than half the price.  Being a little financially strapped I skipped the trend and bought Tell Me More. And I'm very glad I did. It's an effective program that has pushed me quite along in learning the language.  Still, there was a tickle in my brain.  Is Rosetta Stone really better?  So, when it came time for me to start with French, also for my studies, I decided to make a contrast.  And yes, Rosetta Stone is the better program.  In some ways.  Really, I'd have to say these are quite different programs, rather than one being substantially better.  Tell Me More is a like a class in a box.  There is a mix of exercises that help to build vocabulary, sentence structure, writing, pronunciation, and other aspects.  Each section has a large mix of short lessons that reinforce the learning without becoming dull or tedious.  Save yourself taking language classes by using Tell Me More.  Rosetta Stone is a lot less like taking a class.  It's more like finding yourself on an island with a group of people who all only speak another shared language.  And if you want to learn how to thrive on this island, then you follow their patient, but focused, teaching.  This approach sticks, and it is effective.  My only quibble is I'm not sure it's quite worth the amount of money they are asking.  Indeed, if money isn't an issue then by all means go with Rosetta Stone.  There are qualities that do set it apart, and it helps a person feel much more involved in the language and less like taking a class.  But, if money is an issue Tell Me More is comparable in quality, without being nearly as expensive.  That's not a slam against the product quality of Rosetta Stone at all. It really is an extraordinary software, and revolutionizes language learning.	1
I have taken a number of classes to learn a variety of languages (French formal classes, Korean, Modern Standard Arabic to name a few), and have forgotten most of them all. Learning on the computer has been a new and fairly positive experience for me. The package comes with a number of elements: the base software, the particular language elements to plug into the base software, audio companion CDs for review offline and a USB headset/microphone.  Installation is a two part process, 1) install the base software, 2) install any language element tiers. (The headset will need some installation time, but that should be managed by the system). The installation progressed pretty smooth, took a reasonable amount of time, no errors.  While the process has been much quicker, more of a review, than with the Spanish version, I have followed the lesson plans to get a true feel for the software. Learning is geared toward an immersive process where you start speaking pretty much right at the start (kind of like being tossed into the pool and told to swim). You start by selecting your goals (read, write, speak, etc.) and then follow the lesson plan, reviewing as often as necessary. My personal experience has been that I enjoy the immersive process, I am still working through the lessons, but I fell that I have gained considerably more than I have in past language learning opportunities. The process has been a fairly painless process, and I devote time when available.  My bottom line is that the product is pretty pricey, but gives you one of the best learning experiences I can imagine short of being dropped off in Paris. P-)	1
This review is written by my 16-year old daughter who installed the software (with a little help from me) and started using it.  "The RosettaStone Version 4: French Level 1,2 & 3" is a fun, engaging introduction to learning a new language.  The program comes with three corresponding Audio Companion CDs PER LEVEL, for a total of 12 disks of instructional software in one product. (The Audio Companion software can be downloaded to an MP3 player). Each Level has four different units, for each of which you practice Pronunciation, Vocabulary, Phrases, Speaking, and more. RosettaStones' unique feature is its use of "language immersion" as a teaching tool. The program shows you images and the corresponding French words for what is in the pictures. There is no direct English-to-French vocabulary translation (that I've seen thus far), and this makes learning the language more enjoyable and more natural. The graphics are very aesthetically pleasing as well.  The audio software is one of the best parts about this program. The product comes with a USB Headset Microphone, and the program uses voice recognition software for you to practice pronunciation. Better yet, you can record yourself saying the same phrase several times and then play it back to listen to your progress and compare your pronunciation to that of a native speaker.  One drawback to the program is that you cannot pause a lesson easily if you need to see something again. You have to wait until the end of the lesson and then go back to particular part of it, but this is a minor inconvenience that does not take away too much from the program's quality.  I've only begun to use RosettaStone, but I am very pleased with the product thus far and will continue to use it."	1
I love this language tool - the best self-study on the market! Easy to use, easy to stay motivated. Great for the home and the car (and the gym!) I have not used it for too long, but I am committed to stay with it. Tres bien :)	1
For those of you who are seriously determined to learn more than just the basics of French in a short amount of time, well this is your chance. This product is not cheap at first glance, but when you add up all the costs for books, language lessons and time you'll spend in a community college or with a private tutor, you'll quickly realize the value of owning The Rosetta Stone.  The product itself contains several useful tools to help you get started. There are the three levels of CD-ROM software that can be installed both Mac and PC, a microphone (that can be used with many other applications), the guide and then the multiple CDs that you can play at home, in your car or anyplace you carry your MP3 player (I particularly enjoyed these).  Functionally, this product is exceptional as it allowed me to learn how to spell and write, speak without following a script, strategies to learn and retain what I learned for a long time. With simple practice, I learned how to ask what is your age, simple greetings, finding directions, telling the time of day and using correctly past, present and future tense. If you are as diligent as I am, you'll learn in no time how to order food in restaurants, express ideas and comprehend terms from the daily life, such as the news from the media.  I highly recommend this product and personally guarantee that you can walk away with a lot more knowledge of the language than you presently possess.	1
I tried this software out in several languages, and found the learning process to be very easy and intuitive.  I'd recommend it for learning a language, although it will never compare to living in a foreign country and speaking only that language.  Pros: Rosetta stone's process is a lot better than traditional "current language word = foreign language word" learning processes, which rely on memorization and lead to internal translation from the foreign language to one's native language while speaking.  Rosetta stone converts foreign words straight to pictures and ideas, eliminating internal translation to one's native language.  There is plenty of repetition of previous words, but at no point does the process seem like rote recitation.  The software is divided into "lessons" which introduce new words, and have several exercises including matching, pronouncing each part of the word, verbally filling in blanks with your new words, etc.  There is plenty to keep you interested and ensure that you learn new words and phrases.  The voice recognition was decent, a simple training has the program hearing you correctly ~90% of the time, and an adjustable slider can reduce the pickiness the software has if you're having issues, although that also controls how strictly you want to be held to pronunciation.  Cons of Rosetta Stone: -It's expensive -The approach in rosetta stone does not use conjugations or grammar rules, you just learn words and phrases.  Some maybe bothered by this. -Many other reviews note technical problems, I had no issues on my PC running windows XP.	1
Rosetta Stone is a ripoff.  1.  They limit downloads, so if your computer crashes, or you get a new computer, you are out of luck. 2.  They are not people friendly, if you call.  Hopefully, you can get a native English speaker you understand. 3.  The method is ok for some people; it is a matter of personal preference.  One should develop one's own method which works best for them.  For example, repetition is best for some, memorization is best for others.  Rosetta Stone has you figure out words based on the pictures and context, and this can be much improved.  This much like how a child learns her/her own language, which is ok.  However, I think someone can make a similar method more suitable for adults.  My suggestions  1. Start with Pimseur.  This method teaches you good pronunciation from the beginning, and develops a basic speaking ability.  It repeats a lot, which many don't like, but I'm not one of them.  Repetition hammers it into your skull, so that you can automatically spit outa word without trying to remember the word.  A shortcoming to many is the limited vocabulary.  Well, this method is NOT supposed to include a large vocabulary; you can best get that from beginner readers and other materials such as French at the Wheel and Living Language courses.  They expand your knowlege, and supplement Pimsleur beautifully.  2. Read French materials on the internet, and even tune in on sitcoms via the internet.  See what the library has, and talk to others for their own ideas.  3. Carefully read reviews on Amazon and elsewhere.  Many reviews for various items seem fake, to me.  Or reviews are by people who are naive and easily impressed. So read reviews for substance, and if you have time, read what other items a reviewer has reviewed. Personally, I have no problem in harshly rating something.  I tend to give better than average ratings because I've already studied other reviewers carefully, and end up with products deserving good reviews. This review was based on looking at what someone else bought; I knew beforehand from reviews of others what it was.	-1
Having used this for several months now i found the immersion approach to be well suited For french. It is familiar enough to really progess rapidly essentially through pattern recognition. Other more diverse Languages are difficult to learn and some user may find the Rosetta stone approach to be overwhelming in those instances.	1
I hate this software for two reasons.  Nonetheless, I'm positive it will work wonders for certain individuals.  At this price range you simply must know if you're one of those types or not.  Otherwise you'll be wasting a lot of hard earned money.  Rosetta's licensing makes it so that you cannot resell the software and their "money back guarantee" does NOT cover Amazon purchases.  I know because I asked and researched.  You only get the six month guarantee if you buy directly from Rosetta - at an even higher price I might add.  There are basically two schools of thought when it comes to language instruction.  Total immersion or non-total immersion.  The former is like dropping you in the middle of a foreign country without a guidebook or translator.  The latter is like having someone with you who can speak both languages and can answer questions in your native tongue.  Rosetta is total immersion.  I didn't know that when I received the product.  In the past I've used Pimsleur (Brazilian Portuguese) and found it to be effective both in teaching the language and in motivating me to continue.  The motivation part is why I prefer Pimsleur.  There's also a new company on the market with a similar approach called Fluenz that offers a bit more hand holding than Pimsleur which many users, according to reviews here, seem to like.  For many people there's a very basic psychological principle in play when learning a new language.  It's similar to those folks who resolve to exercise and lose weight after New Years.  They start with the best intentions, but many if not most fail to keep their resolutions.  One of the reasons is a lack of positive reinforcement.  If you start out too fast, for example, and get hurt you've just created a negative influence on your motivation.  Some people, however, are quite successful right out the gate and keep going on their own.  No need for a trainer, no need for hand holding or compliments.  They just do it.  Are you the type of person who will feel stressed (demotivation) by not having the rules of grammar explained to you while you learn a new language?  If yes you won't like Rosetta.  Try Pimsleur or Fluenz.  Or are you the type of person who welcomes the challenge (motivation) of figuring out the rules of grammar on your own by using your own observations?  Then you'll like Rosetta.  I am not one of those people who can stay motivated to do an extremely difficult task if I feel stressed out right at the beginning.  I have visited multiple countries and what I experienced only affirms my dislike of the Rosetta approach.  While in South Korea, Thailand, China or Iraq, I found that people assumed I did not know the local language so they either spoke slower or tried to mix English in with their native tongue.  Much less stressful albeit slower way to learn.  In Brazil there is no single ethnic group.  People assumed I spoke Portuguese.  It was the most difficult time I ever had in another country.  I'm not saying I shouldn't learn the local language - no way.  Just that when you're learning, at least for some people, they need things to go a little slower and with a bit more assistance in order to be motivated to keep learning the language.  Rosetta's license is most restrictive that I have ever encountered.  And they enforce their license.  Some users claim that other companies have the same license rules.  That might be true, but they don't enforce those rules like Rosetta.  If you buy Rosetta on Amazon you are subject to Amazon's refund policies, not Rosetta's.  Amazon doesn't give full refunds on opened software.  And after 30 days you're probably out of luck for any kind of refund.  You cannot get Rosetta's 6 month money back guarantee here.  You only get it if you buy it direct from them at a higher price.  The software can be used on only one computer.  No, you cannot use it on a laptop while you're away from your desktop.  The software license requires that you register online in order to access all the exercises.  Once you do this the software is then tied specifically to that computer.  It cannot be registered on another computer.  This means you cannot resell it _anywhere_.  Rosetta customer service told me that they would consider the needs of customers on a case-by-case basis should someone upgrade their system and get rid of their old machine.  In other words, there's a tiny sliver of flexibility here.  But it ain't much.  You simply must know what style of language learning you prefer before purchasing this very expensive piece of software.  Some people, like me, are going to hate it.  Others who like total immersion love it.  Know what kind of user you are.	-1
I am the kind of person who was never good at learning a foreign language.  In high school I took 2 years of German; in college I had two semesters of German.  Yet I was barely able to ask where the bathroom was after all that.  It just never clicked.  Fast forward 15 years and Rosetta Stone has transformed the language learning process!  For years I've seen ads for Rosetta Stone in magazines and at the airport.  Looking at the price tag I was always thinking to myself "Yeah, right.  There's money that will go right down the drain!"  Little did I know how wrong I was.  I started out skeptical -- and have to admit I was making it hard from the start -- but after two lessons with Rosetta Stone I was actually starting to enjoy learning French!  I found myself really getting into the lessons and -- amazingly -- was starting to retain some of the words and their meaning!  Rosetta isn't like tradition language classes.  You don't try to memorize words and phrases.  No, they do away with all that nonsense.  Instead you are immersed in the language through a multi-media experience.  Images and sounds encapsulate you.  You are actually learning French as though you were dropped right in the middle of France!  You are learning it how every school child learns it!  Now here we are 3 months later and I can honestly hold a basic conversation in French.  I feel confident I could get on the plane and land in France and be able to get around and take care of myself with relying on English or a translator.  Now THAT is amazing -- at least for me!  This old dog has been taught some new tricks -- and I highly recommend this software not only for business folks, but also for kids and others who want to learn a foreign language without being forced to memorize useless phrases that make the proces so difficult.	1
Rosetta Stone programs are very good for a quick and fast intro to a language, especially for the casual visitor.  I used a previous version to help me learn enough French to get by on my frequent visits to Paris (on business), and my son has been using this version to support his school French classes.  I found it very helpful in getting me quickly to a point of learning basic (broken) French, and improving my pronunciation and accent.  My son has had similar experience.  But be wary of the company's hype, that this is equivalent to an "immersion" program for learning a language, etc.  That's nonsense; in fact, I found it very lacking in helping understand French grammar, and completely inadequate sometimes in just helping understand French words.  So use it by all means.  But a good French-English dictionary is essential.  And so are friends/teachers who know the language and culture: I found it very necessary to ask questions of my French colleagues about proper idiomatic (and cultural) uses of various words and phrases.	1
This program is a great way to learn a language. The method of using pictures with the text helps you make associations and learn much faster and easier than just memorizing words. You do need to be self motivated but I found myself looking forward to the lessons. The program will automatically recommend to repeat a lesson if you make too many errors. I love that you can have up to 5 users so others can learn along with you and that makes it a good value for households that have several members who would like to learn the language. I think it would also be a great family activity and learning with others would be great for motivation and practice. The audio companion CDs are a big help to reinforce and practice what you have learned. I had no problems with the software installation and set up except for some reason the software could not detect my wireless connection and I had to register by phone.	1
This is by far the best self-guided foreign language product on the market that I have used.  I highly recommend it, it makes learning a foreign language much easier, and it is very intuitive to use.	1
Rosetta Stone's language software is fantastic. Their total immersion approach makes it feel like a play along game instead of learning a language. I had a bit of French in college, but despite the fact that it was a beginning class, students were already expected to know some French. The software outclasses the traditional class. Setup is easy and you can select the options for your level to go at your own pace. Seeing the images with text and hearing the native speaker really does allow for faster learning and you do use your own native ability to learn to better effect. The new Audio Companion CDs are an excellent reinforcement. They make it so easy to load them into a CD player or an iPod. You never feel as pressured to learn the language. I have always wanted to learn French and am loving doing so. The software is nicely packaged with a Quick Start guide, User's Guide, application software and three levels of language for beginning, intermediate and advanced. There are also four CDs for each level for the Audio Companion and an included headset with microphone. It is pricey, but worth it. With regular practice you will become proficient and the software interface is very user friendly. I highly recommend Rosetta Stone and will stick with them for my language learning needs.	1
I was terribly excited to receive this box of software; French was my first language now long-forgotten, and I've been aching to try my hand at picking the language up again. On TV, Rosetta Stone promises users of its products that they will be comfortable with any of their language courses in short order, citing their use by the US State Department, the US Army and others.  Well, time to give it a try. The yellow box's contents were a User's Guide, the usual assortment of user agreements, registration cards, a Quick Start guide, a small pamphlet on setting up the included USB headset on one's computer and of course, the software DVDs (one application disk and three language disks, one each for French levels 1, 2, and 3) along with Audio Companion CDs that serve as a complement to the software course--supposedly, these will help you practice what you've learned in the software and is meant to be played on a CD player or downloaded (as they put it) to an MP3 player.  In itself, impressive set if a little overwhelming, but I found the instructions rather straightforward and easy-to-use. Just following the instructions in the Quick Start guide was enough to have me operational on my within the hour. The headset installation instructions were equally as easy to follow on my Vista PC and there's even a French QWERTY keyboard overlay. The folks at Rosetta Stone have outdone themselves in this regard. There are far too many instances of software installation and use that get in the way of the software itself.  So, how did I find the software and did I learn some French? I admit freely that I was a bit skeptical about the company's claims. No grammar workbooks or textbooks, just what they call a "natural" way of learning through something called Dynamic Immersion, which sounds like being kicked off the side of the pool into the deep end, only less pleasant! Their admonition is to simply trust the method as it works without requiring translation. They promise that I will be speaking French immediately from the first lesson and that was no joke.  The levels are broken into units which are further subdivided into core lessons, focused activities and finally, a milestone. The program starts with a few questions about the user's goals which can revolve around both speaking and writing the language, just writing or just speaking. The recommended default is to focus on both speaking and writing, which is what I chose.  From the "home" screen, the user can see their progress along the lesson, the unit and the entire course. It's truly easy to use. The content is also incredible: you will either type responses, listening to and repeating after a speaker (which is scored as well) or choosing the correct answers from multiple-choices or typing out the proper sentence. In so doing, you find yourself picking up on vocabulary, proper pronunciation, writing and grammatical structure.  I have finished the first level and I'm looking forward to the second level as it is easy, but hard work if that makes sense. I haven't yet listened to the audio CDs, but if the software is anything to go by, my god. I am so impressed with the quality of the software and instruction that I am giving Rosetta Stone French the highest recommendations. Five, extremely deserved stars.	1
My company is planning on expanding to Canada, soon, and I thought that it would be a great "investment" to try the French version of Rosetta Stone.  I must say that it is making learning French as easy as possible, and I'm learning so much every day.  I have learned so many different phrases, and learning everyday.  I'm sure it is going to come in very handy when we go live.  Thanks RS for such a wonderful product!	1
I'm still working through the basics. So far, this is an awesome package. Chinese is tough because of the strange alphabet and the language is totally different from English. Even though I have a busy schedule, I'm still able to learn Chinese bit by bit in the time that I do have. This is an expensive package, but worth it. It's nice to be able to go at your own pace. I would not call myself intellectual, but Rosetta Stone makes learning languages a fun hobby.  Included in this package are: * printed manuals (very nice - a lot of software packages neglect these) * software CDs for all 3 levels * audio companion CDs for all 3 levels * USB headphone and microphone set  The software allows you to focus on the aspects of the language you want to learn first and provides you a total immersion environment. Rather than dull repetition, the software guides you through the learning process with related graphics so you see & hear the words at the same time.  Even with all the goodies, the work isn't done for you, as with anything if you want to learn it, you do have to put some effort into it.	1
The Rosetta Stone (RS) learning interface is well designed and very clean. It is the most user friendly language learning program I've experienced.  What's more, the user interface applies to all of their language modules so learners of multiple RS language modules will be comfortable and at home with the "dynamic immersion" approach.  At best, the RS Mandarin will train you to be conversational in Mandarin. It will not allow you to recognize and write Chinese characters easily- that is an entirely different discipline better served by other instructional approaches. It is possible to speak and not be able to read the characters at this stage.  Mandarin is hard language to speak for most westerners. The 4 primary pronunciation tones (see Wiki's Pinyin article for an excellent overview) sound subtle to western tongues and are very hard to pronounce for the typical English speaker. This is because the way the mouth (lips, tongue, breathing) moves in pronouncing Mandarin is completely different to speaking English. My wife, an American from the South who speaks English with a somewhat relaxed and dragged out accent, has incredible difficulty in discerning the tonal differences, let alone pronouncing them accurately. Discerning and learning these tonal differences is crucial to successful conversational Mandarin. If you remember the 70's-80's Kung-Fu movies, they sometimes have a Westerner as a sparring combatant and they will sometimes speak some Mandarin in between the flying punches. To the Mandarin speaker, it always sounds really funny because they have typically messed up the tonal inflections. For example, "ma" can mean mother, horse, to scold, to wipe, a question, measles, etc., when used with the correct tone and context. So, to avoid speaking "Kung-Fu Mandarin" (comical and embarrassing in a business meeting, but at least it gets them smiling), it is essential to listen to the Mandarin speakers on the RS software very very carefully and practice repeatedly. That said, the speakers on the RS software have clear excellent accents but the microphone pronunciation feedback tool is not tight enough and will tolerate tonal mis-pronunciations.  If you are learning Mandarin alone, it would be very helpful to still seek a native Mandarin speaker. It helps to observe the mouth when pronouncing the words (I wish RS would have avi's of the speaker's mouth up close as a pronouncing aid). It also helps to be corrected immediately to avoid entrenching bad habits. And if you are finding an instructor, get an educated person that speaks with a proper accent. You want the Beijing news reader quality. China is a large country and speakers from different parts of China have very different accents. For example, speakers from HK or Canton will often speak (if they even can!) Mandarin that is heavily tinged with a Cantonese accent.  No point learning that. Should you be discouraged? No!!! If you are in China or get Chinese cable programs, you will notice some westerners on the language and outreach programs. Folks, these guys speak a brand of Mandarin with such accuracy and poise that would put most native speakers to shame!	1
This is not like French class in high school! No grammar, syntax, or conjugation!  I really want to say, I'm very excited by this product. I've always been intrigued by the possibility of learning Chinese, but each time I looked into the options, I quickly gave up. The other books and tapes I've looked at are difficult and "flat", as in uni-dimensional. You either repeat what's on the tape ad nauseum, or read what's in the book ad nauseum, you get the idea.  The Rosetta Stone Chinese program is very different. It's multi-dimensional in the sense that it gives you several ways to learn. You can use the computer-based tools to speak and get instantaneous feedback. You can use the Audio Companion CDs in your car (actually, on my iPod!) to practice while driving or whatever. Within the computer based tools are several ways to learn, including a cool Milestones test that inserts you into a real life situation where you have to speak the right answer. I was actually intimidated to try this for a few hours, because I didn't want to screw up, but eventually I tried it, screwed up, and learned more by doing so.  I really like the Rosetta method of presenting you with visual images and spoken language for you to repeat, then visual "puzzles" for you to deduce the correct response. This is very natural once you get into it. It took me a while to get the "rhythm" and patterns of the language, but this method in particular helped me over that hump. That's the main reason for my 5 star rating. I couldn't get that from a "flat" book or tape series.  This set includes everything, including the computer headset and  microphone, so you just drop it all in and go. It worked flawlessly on my vintage 2006 Windows XP laptop.  Important: You are going to have to set aside time to learn Chinese with this or any other system. Five minutes here and there won't work. The program is broken up into lots of modules, so it is easy to focus on a small amount of related material at once, but FOCUS is the issue: I recommend 30-90 minutes at a time with no distractions (audio or visual!).  The downside: I don't think I'm  going to become fluent reading or writing Chinese from this system. I didn't expect to be able to read written Chinese, so I did not reduce my review for this limitation. Perhaps others will have more luck, because the features are there to help you read two kinds of Chinese writing, but I don't think that part is going to make me literate. I can recognize some Chinese characters at this point, but there are thousands you have to know to be literate.  By the way, if you want to get a taste of the Rosetta Stone method, go to their web site where they have an online sample of the watch-listen-try system (for Turkish!). The online sample does not include the instant feedback on your spoken words included in this package, or the Milestones or other features. It just grades your point-click responses, which will give you a taste. Plus, there's a Michael Phelps testimonial video about the Chinese program (recorded before he won all the medals in Beijing!)	1
I had high hopes for this software, as Rosetta Stone has a very high profile and is quite expensive.  I evaluated it simply to see what the quality of the product was; I am already an intermediate level Mandarin speaker (native English speaker).  Rosetta Stone has one core thing right: the principle that you learn a foreign language best by avoiding "translation" in your head.  It is much better to learn Chinese by seeing a picture of an apple and saying/hearing "pingguo" than it is to look at it and think "apple" in English and trying to translate to Chinese.  In this regard, their method is effective.  Where this program is lacking, however, is in not teaching the Chinese characters.  It sounds strange to English speakers, but it really is true that learning the characters is absolutely essential to learning to speak the language well.  (I resisted this at first too, but luckily a college professor saved me from my wrong thinking).  I would love to Rosetta add an option in the software that allows you to learn the characters as an intrinsic part of learning the language.  If you're just trying to learn to be conversant, and don't want to learn the characters, and prefer not to be tied to your computer, I find the Pimsleur CDs to be a better option.  Overall- good program - but don't fall for the hype that learning Chinese is going to be easy.  It's a lot of hard work; this is a decent aide for starting that long journey.	1
My kids are taking mandarin at the Charter Scholl they attend.  I thought this would be a good addendum to help them with the Class.  I have done the Danish and German Rosetta Stones in the past.  I did get a lot out of the German one but I had taken a German class in college.  The Danish one not so well as my pronounciation of Scandanavian vowels is lacking.  Fortunately the Danes speak American English.  The Mandarin course is a bit different in that it teaches Chinese Letters too though you can decide to do the entire course using only the Roman alphabet.  I found the software can be as easy or as Challenging as you wish.  The Course is presented in three sections.  A basic, intermediate, and more advanced sections.  You create a profile for yourself and based on your age and gender the software will compensate for you on its voice recognition software.  The best thing about the course is the voice recognition.  You say the words and the system tell you if you are correct.  I can't pronounce English very well so I'm not quite sure how accurate it is.  The Basic course is pretty simple.  It teaches you touristy things like eating, walking, running, cooking, and the differences in gender.  I like rosetta stone because it emmerses you in the language.  It doesn't try to translate.  You infer from the pictures what you are saying.  The courses get harder and harder as you go along.  I found I tend to forget what I learned in the class if I try to remember but pick it up again immediately when confronted with it in real life.  I would reccomend it highly for someone just looking for a simple tool to introduce them to the Chinese alphabet and Mandarin.  I thought it and the other courses I got to be well worth it.	1
Learning a language takes time. The Rosetta Stone software is abosultely the fastest way to learn compared to courses. That said, it is difficult to learn the language without real opportunities for conversation and learning the subtleties by engaging in the language first person. I've used the software and it has been very helpful, but completing it is a very time consuming task.  If you have never used Rosetta Stone you will be surprised at how much fun it can be because their system uses engaging photographs that help you remember and learn the meaning of both vocabulary as well as the verbal structure of the language assembling increasingly complex variations (the English equivalents of adjectives, adverbs, etc.).	1
The Rosetta Stone version 3 software with audio companion is really an excellent value, especially for the beginning learner. No software can do the hard work for you of training your brain to recognize sounds, training your tongue to make them, and learning an entirely new set of vocabulary. But Rosetta Stone tries to make this process fun, intuitive, and simple. When you are trying to do something as difficult as learning another language, you don't need other difficulties thrown in your path. Attending a traditional class--driving, reading books, studying flash cards, interacting with other people who know the language just as poorly as you do--in my opinion introduces many more difficulties into the language learning process and is the cause of many people's failure to advance. If this is you, I recommend Rosetta Stone, which will allow you to advance beyond beginner level in a language in the comfort of your own home, using your own computer and the provided headset and microphone. When compared with the cost of taking a traditional course along with drive time and cost of books, Rosetta Stone's value becomes apparent.  Rosetta Stone is fun. At times, it can feel like a video game. The program does a good job of continuously challenging both your vocabulary and your tongue (as you have to pronounce the words more or less accurately) without being so difficult as to be dishearteningly discouraging.  Rosetta Stone immediately immerses the learner in the world of the language trying to make you forget your mother tongue (in my case English) as much as possible as you learn. This is, as far as I can tell, the best way to make oneself truly fluent. It is the way that I learned Spanish (total immersion), and in my opinion Rosetta Stone does as good of a job of that in a computer setting as I could imagine using today's technology.  I recommend purchasing levels 1, 2, & 3 together in a set so that you can advance far enough to actually begin intelligent conversations with native speakers. Rosetta Stone will only be able to advance you to a point, getting you out of beginner status. But to move on from there to fluent, will most definitely require surrounding yourself with people who speak the target language. But I am aware of no better value than Rosetta Stone to make that transition into another culture and language possible. I am looking forward to taking the next step.  I do have  word of caution from my experience regarding Windows Vista 64-bit software and Rosetta Stone's technical support. I was able to "successfully" install the software but unable to load any of the language modules into the software. After multiple calls (3+ hours) to technical support with a wide range of suggestions, I was finally told that Rosetta Stone is not supported on Vista 64 bit. This is somewhat frustrating and will likely be an issue more many purchasers of newer computers. I have read in reviews and blogs that some have been able to make it work, but I was unable to. I ended up having to install it on a secondary (and older) computer system. This was an inconvenience and something that I personally feel is an inexcusable oversight for high-end software. For lack of 64-bit support and the slowness of technical support to identify this issue, I have dropped my rating of the software from 5 stars to 4 stars.	1
I ordered Rosetta Stone Chinese in an attempt to learn a difficult language in the easiest and most comprehensive manner possible. I failed, but not because of Rosetta Stone. I really thought I could master Mandarin as I previously learned German in college and became fluent in Spanish and lived in Latin America for eight years. I assumed learning Chinese would be a similar process.  Rosetta Stone does a great job on their language learning product. The software installed flawlessly on my iMac, registered quickly and I was up and running in short order. The program method is interesting in that it provides graphic scenarios with spoken conversation that the student is tested on for comprehension and repeating with feedback on both. This was nothing like I had experienced with German or Spanish which were largely based on vocabulary, dialogues, sentence structure, verb tenses and the like. Rosetta Stone is more like "total immersion" where the student is exposed to the language from the git go with repetitive phrases and progress feedback.  My operational experience with the program was flawless but I became frustrated very early on with my inability to distinguish the subtle differences among the Chinese words. After many sessions of null progress I elected to put it aside until I could find a Community College program where I could get face to face interaction with (hopefully) a native speaker(s) and use Rosetta Stone to augment the instruction.  If you have the ability to determine subtle differences in tonal changes you may find success with Rosetta Stone Chinese. If you are like me, who can't tune an instrument other than a radio, you may want to consider this program as a valuable adjunct to classroom instruction.  In summation, I really liked the Rosetta Stone approach and the functionality of the software but I was unsuccessful getting very far due to my inability to understand a very difficult language.	1
This is probably the best there is in language teaching progam. Only a real life teacher can do better.  But again, you will need to invest time to learn the language. While this program is very effective, it is not a miracle.	1
The Rosetta Stone programs are wonderful for anyone who wants to self-study a language. The lessons move along well, but they also repeat words and phrases enough that you can absorb them.  I have installed Rosetta Stone software on both a PC (WinXP) and a Mac (OS-X), and have not had a problem on either system. Installation went smoothly and everything worked the first time. Installation does take a while, though, so expect to spend at least 20 or 30 minutes to get up and running.  Chinese is a difficult language for me, so I have struggled more with these lessons than with other Rosetta Stone courses I have used. I like the fact that I can review the lessons until I feel comfortable with them.  You will get out of this course what you put into it. If you are willing to spend the time, you should be able to learn enough of the language to be able to converse. (Reading and writing lessons are also included, if you wish to use them.)	1
I have this software in three different languages and I find that I am picking up the vocabulary pretty quickly through the Rosetta method. I also do not have a lot of time to dedicate and like it that they include audio lessons that I can load on my ipod, I find that this helps me to not forget too much between computer lessons.  I don't have anything else besides class room lessons to compare this too, and that wouldn't be a fair comparison.  So I can't say that the Rosetta Stone software is better than anyone else's, but I like it very much and would highly recommend it.	1
Having been a user of Rosetta Stone products for some time I was off and running very quickly with the Chinese language course. The software is easy to install and interesting to set up and get immersed into.  A word to the wise though. Some people may approach this process very casually and try to either blast through it or not take it very serious. I can only say that any user, regardless of their background, needs to take it slow and pace themselves.  1. Approaching learning Chinese with this program should be like taking any college course. 2. You should take notes and keep a journal of your progress. 3. After the first three days you should start to chart your progress. 4. You should practice with the system at least an hour a day for the first five days. 5. You should speak aloud as many of the phrases as you can after every period once you've stepped away from your computer.  You don't have to be a native speaker to stay on course and progress, but please don't think that you'll be disappearing into the crowd or ordering deftly from the menus of out-of-the-way dim sum restaurants any time soon.  I recommend this program for people who have a serious yen, no pun intended, to get a jump start on taking Chinese. Some folks like to think that taking a foreign language is about memorization and  repetition. But that just isn't the case, if it was, we'd probably all be home schooled via VCR.  Listen to me, nothing can compare to learning Chinese in a classroom, under pressure and under the gun of requirements and deadlines. The benefit and the beauty is participating with other classmates and going over the material in a setting that can also build your confidence. Learning at home alone, with a set of headphones doesn't really give you this, even though you may walk away with some sound basics. If you're going to study this over the summer and then concentrate on a double semester course in Chinese, you'll probably excel and be the star student. In this scenario, I cannot recommend it enough. If you're going to lock yourself in a dark room and try to learn Chinese with this, don't get your hopes up. You'll discover that the moment you open your mouth.  Best of luck, kind regards and don't forget your local Community College or State University.	1
This is easily the most comprehensive language instruction package I've ever seen. With four separate units, each split into several different sections -- including listening, speaking, vocabulary and grammar -- Rosetta Stone provides hours and hours of easy-to-use instruction in learning to speak the Chinese language like an expert.  A language package like this requires the user to be a self-starter. There's nobody pushing you to use it or assessing your performance. The lack of feedback might prove challenging for some users. But if you're willing to push yourself, this system really works.  Rosetta Stone comes with a high price tag. But if you're serious about learning Chinese, and have the discipline to follow a program on your own, your purchase will be money well spent.	1
This is not an in depth review. I've just started with the Rosetta Stone Chinese. I know it will be year or maybe even never, that I will be fluent in this lanuage. But Rosetta Stone's learning processes are well known for all their language study programs. I've personally used French, German, Japanese, Hebrew, and now Chinese. I'm comfortable with their methodology and know that if I'm willing to put the effort in, on a regular basis, I can get to a decent level of proficiency in a new language in a year's time. Now a decent level of proficiency is not the same as fluent but it's worthwhile if your interest is in learning.  If you want to learn to read, write, speak, and understand a foreign language, and you're willing to dedicate regular daily time to do so, I don't think you'll find a better self study program available than Rosetta Stone.	1
Admittedly, being a westerner, getting a good grasp of a vowel mad language like Chinese, is very difficult.  I have only met one westerner who claimed he was able to learn Chinese MUCH easier than Latin based languages such as Italian or Spanish, et al.  Suffice it to say, he's the exception.  But in the spirit of the recent Olympic games I decided to put my faith in Rosetta Stone, in helping me learn Chinese.  It is very slow going.  The program does a good job of easing you into the basics of the language.  Starting with easy words and relating them to pictures.  Note, that unlike a conventional course, you're not going to be getting any true grammar lessons; you won't have to sit and memorize how to convert a word from past to present, or male to female, or singular to plural.  The beauty of RS, is that you'll be eased into intrinsically learning it as you go, almost without thinking about it, as you continuously relate words and phrases to pictures.  One other thing I must add, that like French, Chinese is heavy on proper pronunciation.  The only way you can learn this language even a little bit is to several (I should say many) times listening to the word/phrases being spoken and repeating them back to the computer, trying to match up your pronunciation with that of your computer teacher/expert.  This is not easy for me, but the program lets you go at your own pace, unlike a conventional class, and won't bug you if you're too lazy to one day sit down at the computer.  But I must underscore that with an Asian language, to a western mind, you must practice everyday because it is extremely simple to forget a word.  That is what the audio companion of this package is all about, and for Chinese, is worth spending the extra money for, as opposed to the RS package that doesn't have the audio companion.  Take it along with you, maybe not to pronounce the words back as you hear them (people on the train may think you're mad :-), but to at least remind yourself of what you learned the day before, and mentally repeat it back to yourself before you continue studying after work/school.  That way, you won't have to bother reviewing and wasting your time, and instead will be ready to move on to the next section.	1
If you remember your foreign language classes in high school, it is likely not with a smile. The endless conjugation of verbs and repeating vocabulary over and over and over... tedious and not very productive. But Rosetta Stone has solved that.  How does a child learn a new language? Through immersion. Expose a child to a new language, and they will pick it up without ever having to go through the endless practice of German 101. This is Rosetta Stone's secret: it skips the repetitive exercises of the verbs and the simple phrases of the Dick and Jane saw a dog type of learning in favor of an immersive experience into German as if you were dropped in to Berlin without a phrasebook and left to your own devises.  It sounds hard and horrible, but it is not. It is the easiest and fastest way to pickup a new language. If you lived in France and spent a lot of time in Germany, then you would learn the language the same way.  Rosetta Stone allows you to learn at your own pace with this user-friendly software that comes complete with a microphone headset and companion audio CDs that allow you practice when you are without your computer such as driving or working out.	1
I've tried a couple of the Rosetta Stone products and the Italian level 1,2,3 doesn't disappoint. The product installed fine on Mac OS 10.5 or you can install on Windows XP/Vista. Although the product wasn't developed for MAC platform it does perform well but doesn't offer any of the MAC like interface setup.  As far as the language learning, the product performs well. It starts off easy with matching of words to pictures and quickly builds to speaking and matching more complex language sentences. I like how the product feels up to date with the images and the over all look and feel. I really like the ability to speak back to the system so that it can verify how I'm pronouncing the words and sentences. I also like the audio companion feature that allows you to take your learning on the road with an MP3 player.  As far as learning a language by using the software, well....that takes time and commitment to going through the software and practicing. Its easy to think that you can just go through the software and speak another language but learning a language is hard work but the software makes it more manageable.	1
I am working with Rosetta Spanish (Latin American) at the moment and have this one waiting in the wings.  From my experience with the Spanish, I can say hands down Rosetta is the best language-learning system I've ever seen, heard about, or used -- period.  Pricey, yes, but definitely worth it.  I am continually amazed at how quickly I am learning, how much I am learning, and for that matter, how enjoyable the process is.  Why didn't I start this years ago????	1
Italian isn't that difficult to learn for me, as it's the cousin language of Spanish, and so many (words, grammar, etc) things overlap.  Rosetta Stone, for me, is mainly about helping to understand what words/phrases go with what picture/scenario, and most importantly of all, pronunciation.  If you can't pronounce a word, what the heck is it worth then?  This is why RS is such a good study-at-home program.  The main reason, being the voice recognition technology which is worth its weight in gold.  You will speak into your mic.  And the program will analyze the sound waves, letting you see and hear how well you did compared to the native speaker.  Please note however, that no mic. Is perfect, and don't waste your time sitting there for hours, trying to match every sound wave.  Use your judgment and decide when you've learned the proper pronunciation well enough, but without having to be perfect.  In addition to the voice recognition technology, the audio companion is really well worth the money.  Just having the ability to take the program on the go, and listen to what you have already learned is really neat.  First, it keep the material fresh in your mind, and second you get to once again, listen to the proper pronunciation, and try to repeat it back (hopefully not in a public place like a bus, as you might get a few odd stares).	1
This is a great product that has some installation and minor sound system issues that go along with it.  I am running Vista on the computer I installed the program on.  Although I followed installation directions faithfully, I was unable to update the product when following the suggested steps.  I could not update it until after I had completed registration, so I would advise registering the product before trying to do much else.  After registering the product, updates were installed seamlessly.  Updating was time-intensive, taking over  an hour over a DSL connection.  Luckily, this appears to be an infrequent occurrence.  After installing the updates, I set up the headset (a minor repair had to made--an ear piece had come apart and was easily fixed), and proceeded to try the program.  At first I was unable to try the program because of sound issues.  Although my system volume was not set high, the sound coming through the headset was entirely too loud to be listened to.  I had to go into my volume mixer and reset a variety of sound levels--and located the separate Rosetta Stone volume control--before volume was at a workable level.  All of the tries at updating and then sound issues made for a very slow start to beginning to enjoy the software.  But once all of the "dust" settled and I was able to begin the program, I was very favorably impressed.  The language-learning portion of the program is easy to use and customizable to what you wish to learn.  Are you more interested in spoken language?  Well, you can emphasize that and spend less time with written language.  The program's approach is indeed an immersion approach and doesn't require that you spend time overtly memorizing by rote, as many approaches to learning a language seem to take.  This makes the program a pleasure to use, particularly for visual/auditory learners.  The more you use the program, the more you will find yourself remembering and the more success you will have in your chosen language.  And, the more success you have in learning Italian, the more you will find yourself wanting to use the program.  You will be learning language in the same way a native speaker of the language learns.  The program creates such a positive learning experience, I find myself not wanting to miss a day of practice!  Currently, three of us are using the program, as the program does let you add users on the same computer.  Everyone proceeds at his or her own pace, and you may revisit lessons and set your user interface to learn whatever aspect of language interests you most.  The ability to go back and review is invaluable.  You may also set up your voice recognition software to be more or less "strict" about what it finds acceptable in terms of pronunciation.  One of the three program users in the household is taking an accelerated course in Italian at the local university and finds that this program is a wonderful adjunct to the live class, giving them extra practice and a pronunciation leg-up.  Other than the initial set-up hurdles, the three of us give the program a very big "thumbs up."  The program is well worth the price.  I've taken many language classes over the years and find this to be one of the easiest and most fun approaches I've been presented with.	1
Where to even begin - First my major frustration.  I have drooled over this software for years and when it finally arrived I tore open the box to install right away.  The box is nice, the included booklet and materials are also nice, well made and useful.  The installation went well, no trouble at all, until after completing the install from the disc and moving on to the update from their website.  The update downloaded and started to install - then froze.  Confused I discovered that Windows had ignored my telling it not to automatically download Windows updates and had instead downloaded one and was attempting to reboot my computer in the middle of my Rosetta Stone install. I sat for over an hour telling Windows not to reboot the computer while waiting for the Rosetta Stone update to complete.  Finally I had to go make dinner and left the computer to its own devices.  When I returned my laptop was dead - completely... so I called Dell and they did some magic to tell me that my hard drive was kaput.  I now had to wait 3 days for my new hard drive to arrive (thank goodness for Dell's Warranties).  Once I had the new hard drive and had put my computer back together, I tried the Rosetta Stone install again.  This time it went much faster, and the update went off without a hitch.  Then I read in the agreement that the software can only be installed a total of 2 times.  So I called Rosetta Stone - The told me that it was indeed true, that heaven forbid I buy a new computer, I cannot move it to the new one without contacting them ahead of time to deactivate the registration on the old computer.  I was upset because I had wanted to also install it on my children's computer so that they could try it as well - but I was informed that unless I mailed them proof of purchase and leapt through a few other hoops, that they could do nothing for me.  If my current hard drive dies - I am out $500 software.  That fact alone would make me as a consumer very hesitant to shell out the kind of money they are asking for.  Now on to the product -  I like it.  I set up 3 students on it; me, my son, and my husband and only myself and my son have tried it.  He loved it but could not do the speaking recognition since not only has he picked up a strong southern (read "redneck") accent - but he's also 8 years old and it had a hard time recognizing anything he said.  What I like: 1) There really isn't any English in the program, you start it up and boom - there's a picture of a little girl with the word in German above it and a lady saying the word out loud.  There is a lot of clicking to identify what is being said to you, picking out the picture that matches the words or repeating what has been said to you. 2) The pictures are very pretty; the flow of the material is presented in a very attractive manner. 3) This is incredibly easy to use; my 8 year old went along for a while using it and having a blast with no trouble or instruction at all until he hit the speaking part. 4) Others have complained of the headset - this is the only one I have ever had for the computer and it hasn't given me any trouble at all.  It even survived a road trip with quite a bit of abuse. 5) This method of teaching me the masculinity/femininity of the articles and different words actually seems to be sticking.  Which is funny because I've taken (and failed) German classes and had a hard time remembering them before.  What I didn't like: 1) The biggest one is the issue with only installing it twice - ever. 2) The speech recognition was going great for a while, but then would suddenly not understand me in a simple syllable.  I spent 3 minutes trying to pronounce "com" the way it wanted, ending with a string of curses and lots of beeping in my ear - perhaps I have a southern accent as well. 3) I would really have liked for the pictures to have gone with the culture of the country whose language I am trying to learn.  Why am I learning the German word for Woman while looking at a picture of a Chinese Kabuki Dancer?  I understand the multicultural aspect and that they probably just have stock pictures used for all of the languages - but for the money they want for this product, put pictures from German speaking cultures in it.  When I buy the Mandarin version THEN give me the Kabuki pictures. 4) I personally don't believe that I will be fluent in the language through this method without finding a German in real life to converse with.  I am currently almost done with phase 1 and although I now recognize the words, I don't know that I will be able to formulate conversation through this method.  I will update when I complete the entire program.  It is my belief that this software will allow you to probably pass German 1 and 2 at a college level with at least a "B."  I also think that you could go over to Germany, be able to order a meal, ask for directions and get around with little to no problem.  I DON'T think that you will be able to discuss politics or pass as a native.  Is it worth the money?  If you take out the install limitation - the software itself is great.  I do recommend it, but you have to know ahead of time how badly do you want to learn the language and how much are you willing to pay to learn it.  The cost is about the same as a college class and would cover both German 1 and 2 at the college level so in theory it's cheaper then taking the two classes in it.  If you have a hard time in classes then this may be the way to go.	1
Alright so you probably will not wirting in Italian like a pro; however, you will be able speak and understand Italian.  No you will no the grammar rules but many people do not even know the grammr rules of their native language.  If you do not have at least 4 to 5 hours a week to commit to the Rosseta learning process, then I do not recommend you purchasing it because the cost is high to justify the lack of commitment. In addition, you need to isolate yourself from distractions.  Besides your kids will laugh at you as you try to repeat the words at the computer.  You are presented with images and audio. The software also has you try to say the word and does not move on until you same it somewhat close. You start out with words, then move on phrases and finally to sentences. You can move on to the next lesson at your pace and each builds upon the previous lesson.  Yes I would recommend the software. Ideally I believe you would be better off taking a class at a local college so you can work with others also trying to learn the language.	1
I tried this software out in several languages, and found the learning process to be very easy and intuitive.  I'd recommend it for learning a language, although it will never compare to living in a foreign country and speaking only that language.  Pros: Rosetta stone's process is a lot better than traditional "current language word = foreign language word" learning processes, which rely on memorization and lead to internal translation from the foreign language to one's native language while speaking.  Rosetta stone converts foreign words straight to pictures and ideas, eliminating internal translation to one's native language.  There is plenty of repetition of previous words, but at no point does the process seem like rote recitation.  The software is divided into "lessons" which introduce new words, and have several exercises including matching, pronouncing each part of the word, verbally filling in blanks with your new words, etc.  There is plenty to keep you interested and ensure that you learn new words and phrases.  The voice recognition was decent, a simple training has the program hearing you correctly ~90% of the time, and an adjustable slider can reduce the pickiness the software has if you're having issues, although that also controls how strictly you want to be held to pronunciation.  Cons of Rosetta Stone: -It's expensive -The approach in rosetta stone does not use conjugations or grammar rules, you just learn words and phrases.  Some maybe bothered by this. -Many other reviews note technical problems, I had no issues on my PC running windows XP.	1
Like other RS products this one uses full immersion for the language-learning portion of the program.  It is easy to use and allows you to "jump around" if you feel like you need to go back and review an earlier section. RS's approach is to "immerse" you in the language so you are learning it the way a native speaker would.  There is no tedious memorization and, before long, you find that you begin to understand the language first and then you begin to be able to speak it--it almost sneaks up on you.  This all makes the program fun to use, particularly for people who learn best by seeing or hearing but make no mistake--it is also a lot of effort.  The program does create a very nice positive feedback loop where success begets success and failure circles you back until it becomes success.  In short, if you stick with the program it is hard to fail.	1
The various Rosetta Stone software packages have garnered a rather impressive reputation over the years as some of the best options for learning a new language without taking classes or hiring an instructor.  Based on the high quality offering of the "German Level 1, 2, 3" set, that reputation appears to be well deserved.  The package is far more than just a book on German in digital form, and includes many extra features to make the whole thing worth the hefty price tag.  The three level German language software comes with a USB headset so that the user can listen to the lessons without disturbing anyone around them.  The headset has a built-in microphone that works with the software's speech recognition feature, which lets the user know how they are doing with the language.  A quick-start fold out card is also included, complete with pictures and step-by-step instructions, to get the user started quickly.  The software isn't hard to install, but it is a very long process.  The entire installation could take more than a half hour, especially if the massive web updates are downloaded.  Any decent computer system should be able to handle the software, as the program only requires 512 MB of RAM and 1.8 GB of hard drive space.  Both Windows XP and Windows Vista are currently supported.  There is an interesting option that can be set during the installation to change the software to start with a different language.  The program doesn't have to go from English to German, but can instead begin with several different starting languages.  That alone already makes it more versatile than any German language book could ever be.  Another neat add-on that is included is a set of stickers that can be attached to a keyboard.  The stickers mimic a German language keyboard, which will make typing in German easier once the basics of the language have been mastered.  The user's guide is also exceedingly comprehensive, so any questions about how to use the software shouldn't require a call to tech support.  Once the program is installed and started there are several different course options to choose from.  Each option tackles a different aspect of learning the language, such as reading, writing, and speaking.  The default option is to learn all three at once, but for those who don't have enough time for the full course or are only interested in one of the courses there is the option to remove one or two of the features. As the name suggests there are three levels to the software, each building on the concepts in the last.  As the user progresses through the program they switch out the CDs to the next level.  The program also comes with multiple audio companion CDs so that the user can practice their German when they aren't in front of their computer.  While the price may be a big deterrent for some, there is enough high quality material in the Rosetta Stone German language software that anyone who is really committed to learning the language should seriously consider it as an option.	1
Let's start out by being very clear here -- Rosetta Stone is not cheap.  If you want cheap, then you need to find another product.  However, let me be very clear that you get what you pay for -- and if you NEED to learn a foreign language then this is the best investment you will ever make.  Rosetta Stone doesn't use the "school" way of teaching you a foreign language.  You know, the memorizing words and such that dooms you to failure from the start.  Instead they immerse you in the culture and activities of the country you are learning the language for and help you build your vocabulary naturally.  I've always wanted to visit Germany, but did not want to go without learning how to speak some German first.  After spending 3 months with Rosetta Stone I am confident I could have a decent conversation with someone in Germany about everyday affairs and surroundings without having to stumble through it.  It was a mind shift at first using their learning methods, but in the end it really paid off for me.  So yes, you can find something cheaper -- but you aren't going to find something better.	1
The Rosetta Stone version 3 software with audio companion is really an excellent value, especially for the beginning learner. No software can do the hard work for you of training your brain to recognize sounds, training your tongue to make them, and learning an entirely new set of vocabulary. But Rosetta Stone tries to make this process fun, intuitive, and simple. When you are trying to do something as difficult as learning another language, you don't need other difficulties thrown in your path. Attending a traditional class--driving, reading books, studying flash cards, interacting with other people who know the language just as poorly as you do--in my opinion introduces many more difficulties into the language learning process and is the cause of many people's failure to advance. If this is you, I recommend Rosetta Stone, which will allow you to advance beyond beginner level in a language in the comfort of your own home, using your own computer and the provided headset and microphone. When compared with the cost of taking a traditional course along with drive time and cost of books, Rosetta Stone's value becomes apparent.  Rosetta Stone is fun. At times, it can feel like a video game. The program does a good job of continuously challenging both your vocabulary and your tongue (as you have to pronounce the words more or less accurately) without being so difficult as to be dishearteningly discouraging.  Rosetta Stone immediately immerses the learner in the world of the language trying to make you forget your mother tongue (in my case English) as much as possible as you learn. This is, as far as I can tell, the best way to make oneself truly fluent. It is the way that I learned Spanish (total immersion), and in my opinion Rosetta Stone does as good of a job of that in a computer setting as I could imagine using today's technology.  I recommend purchasing levels 1, 2, & 3 together in a set so that you can advance far enough to actually begin intelligent conversations with native speakers. Rosetta Stone will only be able to advance you to a point, getting you out of beginner status. But to move on from there to fluent, will most definitely require surrounding yourself with people who speak the target language. But I am aware of no better value than Rosetta Stone to make that transition into another culture and language possible. I am looking forward to taking the next step.  I do have  word of caution from my experience regarding Windows Vista 64-bit software and Rosetta Stone's technical support. I was able to "successfully" install the software but unable to load any of the language modules into the software. After multiple calls (3+ hours) to technical support with a wide range of suggestions, I was finally told that Rosetta Stone is not supported on Vista 64 bit. This is somewhat frustrating and will likely be an issue more many purchasers of newer computers. I have read in reviews and blogs that some have been able to make it work, but I was unable to. I ended up having to install it on a secondary (and older) computer system. This was an inconvenience and something that I personally feel is an inexcusable oversight for high-end software. For lack of 64-bit support and the slowness of technical support to identify this issue, I have dropped my rating of the software from 5 stars to 4 stars.	1
I've been using this Rosetta Stone program for about three months now. Overall, I am very pleased with it. The program's interface is well-designed, I've experienced no bugs or glitches, and I am making progress faster than I thought I would (or at least I think I am).  Rosetta Stone's method is based on a technique called "Dynamic Immersion." You're immediately thrown into the language you want to learn -- there's no English allowed. This sounds daunting, but the software starts you off at such a rudimentary level it isn't intimidating.  Thankfully, the app employs a good variety of interactive methods (matching pictures to sentences, writing caption for photos, hearing words and phrases pronounced correctly by native speakers, etc.) so the "by rote" factor stays low. Rosetta Stone says its techniques are modeled on how native speakers actually learn their own languages, usually while still kids, and I think that's a good description for what the software delivers. You start with words and then move on to phrases, and then with level two you get to conversations. Level three kicks the conversational up a couple of notches. It's a natural progression.  I think there are people who prefer a more standard "grammar-first" approach because they've found in the past that this is what works for them. I imagine there are also people who don't like looking at computer screens for lengthy periods. These are valid concerns. There are different pedagogical approaches for a reason -- not everyone learns in the same way. My guess is that Rosetta Stone would serve the majority of people very well, especially students who are comfortable with computer-based learning. Ideally, I think this program will work best for people who are studying a language using many "inputs" (text books, audio programs, computer apps, foreign-language media, foreign flicks, native speakers, etc.) All of these things will ultimately reinforce one another. The more immersion, the better.  I really like how the program keeps track of what areas I'm botching and pulls me back into those areas for more work. I also like the pronunciation practice via the included headset, although I can't verify it's always catching me when I'm mispronouncing things. To my ear I'm doing OK, but my ear isn't the best, hence my use of this program. If I'm pronouncing things badly and the program isn't always catching my errors, I'm not sure how I'd know, if you see what I mean. My hope is that I can nail the rudiments of German and get a good grip on simple conversations using Rosetta Stone before trying to find people to practice with/on, thus keeping my embarrassment factor low.  I'd give the app five stars but I cringe just a little bit at the price. I don't think it is overpriced for what you get, mind you, but the cost -- well, it is what it is. There is a demo on the Rosetta Stone Web site that I encourage you to try before buying. It'll give you a good idea how well this program will work for you. If you like the approach, the price for all three levels is well worth it.  Keep in mind that learning any foreign tongue will realistically take a while. Rosetta Stone shortens the learning period a good deal and makes sticking with the program easier, but it's only a foundation. Still, it's a pretty darn good one, and I can see why it's so popular with people traveling overseas for the first time as well as the international business community.	1
UPDATED REVIEW (My original review remains intact below) -------------------- While I am still behind the general approach to this software, unfortunately, after making it quite a ways into the software, I have decided that the technical implementation--particularly around voice recognition--is so unbelievably poor as to make the software unusable.  Here are the big problems.  1. The voice recognition component is worthless.  At times even the most simple word (I can certainly pronounce "drei" in German) fails to recognize the word.  For fun--and to prove the point--go into the mode where you can repeat the word as often as you want and get an analysis of what you did right or wrong.  You can repeat a single, simple syllable over and over and watch the analysis be completely different every time.  The important part to notice is that it does not register a "fail" (as in, "you said it wrong"); it simply does not take input from the microphone.  It registers an "I did not hear you" sound, and no amount of begging will convince it you are speaking.  At other times, I have discovered that the only way to get something "right" is to intentionally pronounce something wrongly--for example, anything like "Ich", "Spreche", etc. with a "ch" has a far better chance of success if pronounced as an English "sh" (as in "she", "shy") rather than the correct sound.  2. The Support is HORRIBLE.  When I contacted them to discuss the problemsabove, they told me (rather sarcastically) that I was simply not saying the phrase correctly.  This was ironic from "Bob", who clearly someone in need of "Rosetta Stone for Residents of Bangalore".  To illustrate that I am not completely incapable of repeating a very basic sound, I recorded the voice of the Rosetta Stone native speaker and played it back to the program.  It was wrong over 80% of the time.  When I pointed this out, the support organization then suggested that it was perhaps a problem with the microphone, and transferred me to a different department to give me the privilege of buying another microphone from them (gee, thanks... $600 for this software and you want me to buy another microphone because by your own admission the microphone you included is broken?  that seems ummm... really...  reasonable).  3. Rather than purchase the oh-so-cheap microphone, I elected to purchase a very nice microphone from SoundBlaster.  This product works great--for every piece of software except Rosetta Stone, which continues to be unable to understand even the most basic phrases.  I then tried a rather nice Logitech--same results--great precision everywhere else and nothing in Rosetta Stone.  4. The most frustrating part of this is that some days, Rosetta Stone will work just fine.  I can go through lesson after lesson with perfect scores; then suddenly it simply decides to fail.  Occasionally a reboot will help, but generally just for a few minutes, then it is back to being horrible.  Overall, it is a shame that a piece of software that is otherwise quite a good way to introduce you to a new language is (a) so insanely bad in a critical product area, and (b) the company refuses to recognize the deficiency.  This software is never going to make anyone a fluent speaker--even with these problems fixed--but if I knew I were being dropped into German in three months, it would certainly be something I believe would prepare me to get by and build the base I needed for eventual fluency after living there for a few years.  I think that the bottom line is that if you are willing to skip all the speaking lessons, you might really enjoy and get value from this software, but I strongly suggest that you save yourself the frustration of dealing with the random God of Speech (Dis-)Recognition  ------------END UPDATED REVIEW--------------  Rosetta Stone Version 3 is an excellent way to introduce someone to a new language.  SETUP Reasonably easy, but I would strongly recommend an Internet connection during installation to get all the features unlocked.  I did the installation on an airplane, and found out that I was missing a few things.  This is easily remedied later.  COURSE CONTENT Overall, the course content is very good, using only the German language--there is no use of English at all, except for menu options and such.  This is not, therefore, a course that relies at all on "translation".  Rather, the course uses images and audio to acquaint the user with key words and phrases, then re-enforces them by using them in different orders, combining them in different ways, etc. until the use becomes natural.  This is generally quite effective, but in some areas falls short.  For example, the intricacies of German articles (is it "Der", "Das", "Die"?) can be a little tricky to pick up in this way--it would be nice to have at least some explanation of how these are used in a general sense, explaing how they are used with respect to gender and plurality.  An unfortunate feature is that the images appear to be very generic, as opposed to specifically related to the German culture.  I assume that this allows Rosetta to recycle these images for other languages, but it diminishes the quality of the immersion program, and is my reason for giving this product only four stars.  To truly learn a language, one must understand its culture as well, and having images that match that culture would greatly enhance the experience.  CONCLUSION Other than the specific issues mentioned previously, this is an excellent product and I would recommend it over any other language training products I have encountered.	-1
Let's face it: a lot of computer-assisted instruction is just plain lame or worse.  They can suffer from either being rote memorization schemes or over-glorified games or simply textbooks in electronic form.  Rare is a system that truly utilizes what computers can do best to solidly teach concepts.  Rosetta Stone delivers.  It teaches language using multiple sensory inputs (picture & voice) and multiple feedback mechanisms (your voice and hand-eye choices).  It is able to adjust and compensate for your learning speed and strengths on the fly.  It is engaging without being just a game.  And it is able to effectively teach without English--- which is the closest you can get to a dedicated immersion course.  I had previously installed and used the Spanish & Italian Rosetta Stone, and found that it was easy to install the German Rosetta Stone as a 3rd language onto my base installation on my computer.  It's easy to switch between languages and users & keep track of your progress with each.  Bottom line:  I am very impressed.  My ten year old loves it, actually WANTS to do the lessons.  I'm having fun with it too, even though languages are definitely not my strong suit.  If you want to learn a language on your own, this is the best way I know to do it.	1
Let's get one thing straight right off the bat: The Rosetta Stone method is much, much better than the Pimsleur method. I've done Pimsleur in Spanish and Italian and a little bit of German, but this is the first time I've tried Rosetta Stone. It beats the Pimsleur aural method hands down. Pimsleur comes at you on a one-way street. They repeat phrases over and over again and you try to repeat them back. You can't even see the words you're trying to say. You just listen and repeat. If you don't have a fantastic ear for language, you're going to have no idea whether you're even coming close to repeating the original.  That being said, this is much more expensive than one Pimsleur set. If you can afford it, then go with Rosetta Stone; if not, then try the Pimsleur. In fact, before you buy Pimsleur, see if it's available in your local library. Take it out and try it before you plunk down the money for it. Personally, the visual cues, variable targets and pacing, and voice recognition for speech perfection in Rosetta Stone make it worth the extra money for me.  I took one semester of German in college, 34 years ago. That gave me a little familiarity with the language structure. That was then reinforced by 15 years of working for or being associated with German-owned companies, and the 30 or more trips to Germany I've made over the years. I picked up some of the language, but it was a pidgin version of German, interspersed with a lot of English words and helped a lot by the very courteous way in which my German colleagues helped me get a little closer to saying things the right way.  So I had some background. But when I sat down with the Rosetta Stone/German package, it was the first time I felt immersed in or surrounded by verbal cues, visual cues, and instantaneous translation. This really worked for me. I don't learn that well by just listening.  I have to admit I also had a lot of fun with this. There was an interactivity and pacing that was much more engaging than either Pimsleur recordings or even classroom language learning. I also liked that it recorded my progress within my goal set. I highly recommend this product.	1
My previous German language experience came from an eight week German reading course I took about 5 years ago.  The emphasis was not on speaking, but rather to give us the basic tools in order to begin the process of deciphering German texts.  I've had a few other language classes since then, establishing me if not as a thorough polyglot at least as a someone well versed in language training from a variety of different teaching styles, approaches, and contexts.  I've tried to keep up with a number of these languages I've studied, with various success, and with various software help. Mostly the inexpensive kind.  I've picked up the Instant Immersion disks (a great, inexpensive, entirely un-thorough approach), the Learn to Speak series (about the same, though with a lot more content).  Recently, to learn German for my studies I looked at more thorough programs and two stood out.  The Rosetta Stone series and the Tell Me More.  I noticed Tell Me More was getting great reviews and was less than half the price.  Being a little financially strapped I skipped the trend and bought Tell Me More. And I'm very glad I did. It's an effective program that has pushed me quite along in learning the language.  Still, there was a tickle in my brain.  Is Rosetta Stone really better?  Now, with Rosetta Stone German and Tell Me More German in hand I have an answer.  And yes, Rosetta Stone is the better program.  In some ways.  Really, I'd have to say these are quite different programs, rather than one being substantially better.  Tell Me More is a like a class in a box.  There is a mix of exercises that help to build vocabulary, sentence structure, writing, pronunciation, and other aspects.  Each section has a large mix of short lessons that reinforce the learning without becoming dull or tedious.  Save yourself taking language classes by using Tell Me More.  Rosetta Stone is a lot less like taking a class.  It's more like finding yourself on an island with a group of people who all only speak another shared language.  And if you want to learn how to thrive on this island, then you follow their patient, but focused, teaching.  The lessons advance by building on previous lessons, adding grammar and vocabulary in small increments without being separate focus.  Rosetta Stone goes for whole learning, approaching the language as a whole rather than in separate topics.  Also, there is a tracking system so that after a certain amount of days a review lesson pops up that makes sure what was learned a couple of weeks ago is still there.  Good confidence boost too.  This approach sticks, and it is effective.  My only quibble is I'm not sure it's quite worth the amount of money they are asking.  Indeed, if money isn't an issue then by all means go with Rosetta Stone.  There are qualities that do set it apart, and it helps a person feel much more involved in the language and less like taking a class. I see it also as a continued resource way beyond the initial run through, providing a consistent platform to keep the language sharp.  The island analogy is also appropriate because Rosetta Stone doesn't have nearly the same amount of cultural exposure that Tell Me More does.  The Tell Me More program offers more German (as in the country) exposure, along with Austria and Switzerland.  Tell Me More also has a more potent vocabulary push, especially early on.  Rosetta Stone takes a long while to build a foundation and with this can become pretty repetitive.  But, if money is an issue Tell Me More is comparable in quality, without being nearly as expensive.  That's not a slam against the product quality of Rosetta Stone at all. It really is an extraordinary software, and revolutionizes language learning.	1
The Rosetta Stone language system, for me at least, is far better than Pimsleur.  Pimplseur only teaches oral skills; I need to be able to "see" words and have the visual re-enforce the spoken.	1
Rosetta Stone's method is based on a technique called "Dynamic Immersion." You're immediately thrown into the language you want to learn -- there's no English allowed. This sounds daunting, but the software starts you off at such a rudimentary level it isn't intimidating.  I really like how the program keeps track of what areas I'm botching and pulls me back into those areas for more work. I also like the pronunciation practice via the included headset, although I can't verify it's always catching me when I'm mispronouncing things. To my ear I'm doing OK, but my ear isn't the best, hence my use of this program. If I'm pronouncing things badly and the program isn't always catching my errors, I'm not sure how I'd know, if you see what I mean. My hope is that I can nail the rudiments of Italian and get a good grip on simple conversations using Rosetta Stone before trying to find people to practice with/on, thus keeping my embarrassment factor low.  Thankfully, the app employs a good variety of interactive methods (matching pictures to sentences, writing caption for photos, hearing words and phrases pronounced correctly by native speakers, etc.) so the "by rote" factor stays low. Rosetta Stone says its techniques are modeled on how native speakers actually learn their own languages, usually while still kids, and I think that's a good description for what the software delivers. You start with words and then move on to phrases, and then with level two you get to conversations. Level three kicks the conversational up a couple of notches. It's a natural progression.  I think there are people who prefer a more standard "grammar-first" approach because they've found in the past that this is what works for them. I imagine there are also people who don't like looking at computer screens for lengthy periods. These are valid concerns. There are different pedagogical approaches for a reason -- not everyone learns in the same way. My guess is that Rosetta Stone would serve the majority of people very well, especially students who are comfortable with computer-based learning. Ideally, I think this program will work best for people who are studying a language using many "inputs" (text books, audio programs, computer apps, foreign-language media, foreign flicks, native speakers, etc.) All of these things will ultimately reinforce one another. The more immersion, the better.  Overall, I am very pleased with this product. The program's interface is well-designed, I've experienced no bugs or glitches, and I am making progress faster than I thought I would (or at least I think I am). I'd give the app five stars but I cringe just a little bit at the price. I don't think it is overpriced for what you get, mind you, but the cost -- well, it is what it is. There is a demo on the Rosetta Stone Web site that I encourage you to try before buying. It'll give you a good idea how well this program will work for you. If you like the approach, the price for all three levels is well worth it.  Keep in mind that learning any foreign tongue will realistically take a while. Rosetta Stone shortens the learning period a good deal and makes sticking with the program easier, but it's only a foundation. Still, it's a pretty darn good one, and I can see why it's so popular with the international business community.	1

I had previously installed and used the Spanish Rosetta Stone, and found that it was easy to install the Italian Rosetta Stone as a 2nd language onto my base installation on my computer.  My ten year old now is going around saying Italian phrases and saying, "I can speak Italian!"  Bottom line:  I am very impressed.  My ten year old loves it, actually WANTS to do the lessons.  I'm having fun with it too, even though languages are definitely not my strong suit.  If you want to learn a language on your own, this is the best way I know to do it.	1
I have used other Rosetta Stone programs and really like the teaching method they use. Each lesson introduces new words and phrases, which are repeated in different ways. The repetition makes it easy to retain the language lessons. The lessons progress in a logical way, so each builds on what has come before.  There were no technical problems for me in installing this program on my laptop running Windows XP. Installation takes a long time (it's a big program), but it worked perfectly. The headset is somewhat flimsy, but it works. Do turn the volume down VERY low before you start the program, or the sound will blast you out of your chair.  Rosetta Stone allows a lot of customization. For example, you can choose to learn reading and writing, speaking and listening, or reading, writing, speaking and listening. You can also choose how precise you want the voice recognition to be, so you can make it easier or more difficult.  The Audio Companion CDs do not seem very useful to me. They do not contain English translations, so their only purpose would be to listen to the pronunciation as a review.  The Rosetta Stone program is one of the best ways I have found to learn a new language. I had considered the intensive language program offered by a local college, but spending an entire week in a classroom would be hard to work in to my schedule. The Rosetta Stone lessons can be done on my schedule, at my convenience. Of course, you do need to work the lessons regularly so that you retain what you learned in the previous lessons and just because of the volume of information presented.  If you have tried other language programs without success, Rosetta Stone could work for you. Although the course includes listening and repeating, it is more interactive and interesting that those old language courses on cassettes or vinyl albums.	1
This program is a great way to learn a language. The method of using pictures with the text helps you make associations and learn much faster,easier and more fun than just memorizing words. You do need to be self motivated but I found myself looking forward to the lessons. The program will automatically recommend to repeat a lesson if you make too many errors. I love that you can have up to 5 users so others can learn along with you and that makes it a good value for households that have several members who would like to learn the language. I think it would also be a good family activity/project and learning with others would be great for motivation and practice. The audio companion CDs are a big help to reinforce and practice what you have learned. I had no problems with the software installation and set up except for some reason the software could not detect my wireless connection and I had to register by phone.	1
I already have the Spanish version of Rosetta Stone, but we are planning a trip to Italy (hopefully) this fall, so I jumped on a recent offer to try out the Italian version, too. (Please see my review of the Spanish version, as well.)  I find the software incredibly intuitive to learn and use, and while there's a LOT of review, it definitely drums things into your head. I also like the diversity used in the photos -- OK, sometimes it's a little surprising to have a picture of a man who's clearly Central Asian when you're in the middle of your Italian lesson, but people from all ethnicities speak all different languages in this jet-setting world, so I guess it really shouldn't seem all that unusual!  One relatively minor complaint: Both my husband and I have had some issues with the headset. Sometimes we've found ourselves shouting into it in Italian, trying to get it to pick up our words. Other times, we're positive that we're pronouncing the words correctly, but it doesn't think we are. The one that came with my Spanish set seems to work better than the one that came with the Italian set, for some reason. Considering the cost of the program, a more reliable headset would be nice.  A word about the audio companions -- they're very handy, but they will NOT work on their own. We find them useful mostly for when we're driving and want to practice a bit. I particularly like to use them to keep me from forgetting what I've learned when I haven't had a chance to use the software for a little while.	1
The Rosetta Stone program is truly ingenious.  I have spent the last two months using the program and the amount you can learn in that time is by far superior to memorization or learning from a book.  Rosetta Stone works the same way you learn your first language - without translation memorization.  It seems a little repetitive as you go along, but when you realize how much you remember without any prompting or memorization, it's truly amazing.  I just returned from a trip to Italy and the program helped me communicate, and perhaps more importantly, really taught me the fundamentals of the language and pronunciation.  Therefore, I could look up a word in a small phrasebook if needed, and feel confident when speaking to locals.  I highly recommend the Rosetta Stone program for those who want to learn a new language.  The fact that the headphones will listen to you and confirm if you are using correct inflection and pronunciation is very helpful in giving you the confidence to begin using your newly learned language in the real world.	1
I really enjoyed using this method and even bought one for my mom to learn another language and she was amazed how easy it was to use. Looking forward to purchase another one to learn Arabic.	1
This is easily the most comprehensive language instruction package I've ever seen. With four separate units, each split into several different sections -- including listening, speaking, vocabulary and grammar -- Rosetta Stone provides hours and hours of easy-to-use instruction in learning to speak the Italian language like an expert.  A language package like this requires the user to be a self-starter. There's nobody pushing you to use it or assessing your performance. The lack of feedback might prove challenging for some users. But if you're willing to push yourself, this system really works.  Rosetta Stone comes with a high price tag. But if you're serious about learning Italian, and have the discipline to follow a program on your own, your purchase will be money well spent.	1
I am an Army Reservist and had to learn Arabic really quickly.  I used Rosetta Stone and couldn't believe how fast I learned Arabic basics.  Well, I'm back from the Middle East and can tell you that what they teach you is applicable and correct. So, I am planning a trip to Italy in a few months and immediately thought of Rosetta Stone because I only know as much Italian as what I have heard from watching the Saprano's.  I have been using the system for the last couple of month's now and I feel very confident in being able to carry on a basic conversation in Italian and I am only though 1/2 of the course.  I'm astonished. For those not familiar with Rosetta Stone's programs, they are hand's down the easiest way to learn a language.  Just brief over the basic instructions, put the disc in your drive, and start--it's that simple!  You don't have to pour over manuals, dictionaries, audio discs/tapes or history books. I've tried Berlitz and many other programs in the past that required all of those other 'tools' and their systems depended on memorization.  Other programs don't work for me.  Rosetta stone uses another approach by allowing you to learn a language in a way that allows you to UNDERSTAND the language instead of MEMORIZING a language. If I can't remember a shopping list, how can I memorize an entire language?  By the way, the US Army offers only 1 language program free to soldiers and it's Rosetta Stone...because it is the only one that works.	1
I have always had a inferiority complex when learning foreign languages.  I nearly failed my high school Latin class and hated studying grammer.  Why then can I enthusiastically recommend Rosetta Stone Italian?  In a word, it is fun!  If you are not familiar with their approach, Rosetta Stone immerses you in the language through photos, repetition and contextural clues.  The photographs are beautiful,  the voiceovers are rich, the challenges interesting.  You learn by doing, repeating and adding variety.  It is like being dropped in the middle of Italy with nothing but your time and your willingness to learn.  In the beginning, it is easy to build your vocabulary, as you respond to prompts.  Later as you build, you learn more grammer, the same way you learned English, through example. If you are patient and work hard, more and more puzzle pieces will fall into place. Though I am in the early stages of the process, I have no doubt that I can get a good working understanding of the language over a period of months if I am diligent.  Is Rosetta Stone worth it?  I haven't tried all the programs but have purchased Instant Immersion and Pimseluer but I have found they do not hold my interest like the Rosetta Stone version.  Though the other programs are a fraction of the cost, they don't seem to make me want to learn like the Rosetta Stone program.  My conclusion is that Rosetta Stone works.  That means value to me.	1
Bravissimo!  I love the way they get you started right away with phrases instead of bogging you down with the alphabet or sentence structure.  It seems like a more natural way to learn the language, more like the way people actually learn to speak.  The mic is great so you can check that your prononciation is correct.  The CD is wonderful to take along in the car, it reinforces what you've been learning.	1
I originally became interested in Italian when I visited there a couple years ago.  At the time, I just wanted to learn enough to get by in the event that I was in a situation where there wasn't an English speaker.  So, I purchased the drive time italian audio CD's and tried to learn from them. I was very unimpressed with them and felt like ten hours of CDs got me little more than the ability to say hello and goodbye.  Being in Italy spurred me into wanting to actually learn more of the lesson, so when Rossetta Stone 3 was made available I jumped at the chance to go further. So far, I can say that this is leap years ahead of the drive time italian course.  This product allows you to customize it to your goals (read, write, listen, speak) through a very simple startup screen (which can be setup for different users) and then it automatically builds the lessons for you.  I find the lessons to be enjoyable and very useful.  The speech recognition aspect is awesome.  It lets you even customize how precise you want the software to grade your pronunciation.  Aside from the computer aspect, this product provides a whole set of CDs that complement the main software.  This is great for reinforcing your learnings when you aren't in front of the computer.  The downsides of the product do NOT outweigh the upsides in my opinion. However, I should list a few for you. 1) It is pricey. 2) It doesn't allow you to run it on more than one computer (you can move it to a new computer, but you have to uninstall it from the first computer). 3) The included headset is a bit flimsy.  Bottom Line: If you are wanting to learn the language, excel when presented with multiple ways to learn it (visual, auditory, and written), and want to do it at your own pace, I really think this is a great option and can recommend it.  If you are only wanting to pick up the bare minimums for surviving travel in Italy and are on a budget, find another product that focuses on getting you into the basic phrases you'll need.  Overall, a great product.	1
I have this software in three different languages and I find that I am picking up the vocabulary pretty quickly through the Rosetta method. I also do not have a lot of time to dedicate and like it that they include audio lessons that I can load on my ipod, I find that this helps me to not forget too much between computer lessons.  I don't have anything else besides class room lessons to compare this too, and that wouldn't be a fair comparison.  So I can't say that the Rosetta Stone software is better than anyone else's, but I like it very much and would highly recommend it.	1
I've become interested in going to Germany and although I know that English is spoken there, I'd like to be able to go off the beaten path and immerse myself in the culture.  I'd also like to be able to understand the conversations of people around me.  This is why I really was interested in Rosetta Stone versus a quick and dirty travel language CD.  This product allows you to customize it to your goals (read, write, listen, speak) through a very simple startup screen (which can be setup for different users) and then it automatically builds the lessons for you.  I find the lessons to be enjoyable and very useful. The speech recognition aspect is awesome. It lets you even customize how precise you want the software to grade your pronunciation.

If you are only wanting to pick up the bare minimums for surviving travel in Germnay and are on a budget, find another product that focuses on getting you into the basic phrases you'll need. Overall, a great product.	1
I didn't have immediate expectations of being fluent or even conversant in German from using this program (that will be a much longer journey) - so I am rather pleased so far.  I can understand many of the criticisms.  This product immerses you virtually into the language learning process - via conversation.  The program installs easily, and activiation is simple for all 3 levels.  There is a USB headset & micrphone included - not going to replace you highend gaming headset, but it does the job.  I have a long journey ahead of me to make progress, but I think this is a very good first step as a learning tool.	1
I never had a problem learning the english language or acquiring new vocabulary. Why then did I have a mental block learning a new language? Could it be the boring, repetition and grammer ? (yup!)  I am very pleased to report that I now can converse in elemantary German thanks to the Rosetta Stone learning system.  Imagine learning can be fun!  The total immersion approach teaches you a new language the same way you learned your first one through visual and contextural clues, repetition and a very cool speech analyzer that helps with pronunciation.  The Rosetta stone approach is the best thing next to a personal tutor since it is so comprehensive long time to download , probably because of server traffic.  I must admit, it took a while to build my confidence.  It has been a long time since the rigors of a college classroom.  At middle age, wasn't it supposed to be a bit harder for me to learn?  What I found, is that the mind is like any muscle.  With work, your can grow more nimble and strong.  The self pacing aspect of the program, makes it easier to remain positive and focused on progress and not worry about "falling behind".  I am really enjoying the challenge of learning a new language.  I look forward to adding other languages.  The software is of excellent quality. I find the photography outstanding and the voices attractive. It might sound silly to remark about this, but the user experience is intoxicatingly fun.  The big question, "Is it worth it?"  For me, it is a definite "Yes". Although the software is a high price, it is by far the best "learning experience".  Since you want to learn a language, why not put the cost into perspective? If a cheaper product, turns you on, then go for it.  For me, the Rosetta stone experience makes me want to learn. That is worth the price of admission.	1
I've tried a couple of the Rosetta Stone products and the German level 1,2,3 doesn't disappoint. The product installed fine on Mac OS 10.5 or you can install on Windows XP/Vista. Although the product wasn't developed for MAC platform it does perform well but doesn't offer any of the MAC like interface setup.  As far as the language learning, the product performs well. It starts off easy with matching of words to pictures and quickly builds to speaking and matching more complex language sentences. I like how the product feels up to date with the images and the over all look and feel. I really like the ability to speak back to the system so that it can verify how I'm pronouncing the words and sentences. I also like the audio companion feature that allows you to take your learning on the road with an MP3 player.  As far as learning a language by using the software, well....that takes time and commitment to going through the software and practicing. Its easy to think that you can just go through the software and speak another language but learning a language is hard work but the software makes it more manageable.	1
I tried this software out in several languages, and found the learning process to be very easy and intuitive.  I'd recommend it for learning a language, although it will never compare to living in a foreign country and speaking only that language.  Pros: Rosetta stone's process is a lot better than traditional "current language word = foreign language word" learning processes, which rely on memorization and lead to internal translation from the foreign language to one's native language while speaking.  Rosetta stone converts foreign words straight to pictures and ideas, eliminating internal translation to one's native language.  There is plenty of repetition of previous words, but at no point does the process seem like rote recitation.  The software is divided into "lessons" which introduce new words, and have several exercises including matching, pronouncing each part of the word, verbally filling in blanks with your new words, etc.  There is plenty to keep you interested and ensure that you learn new words and phrases.  The voice recognition was decent, a simple training has the program hearing you correctly ~90% of the time, and an adjustable slider can reduce the pickiness the software has if you're having issues, although that also controls how strictly you want to be held to pronunciation.  Cons of Rosetta Stone: -It's expensive -The approach in rosetta stone does not use conjugations or grammar rules, you just learn words and phrases.  Some maybe bothered by this. -Many other reviews note technical problems, I had no issues on my PC running windows XP.	1
I hate this software for two reasons.  Nonetheless, I'm positive it will work wonders for certain individuals.  At this price range you simply must know if you're one of those types or not.  Otherwise you'll be wasting a lot of hard earned money.  Rosetta's licensing makes it so that you cannot resell the software and their "money back guarantee" does NOT cover Amazon purchases.  I know because I asked and researched.  You only get the six month guarantee if you buy directly from Rosetta - at an even higher price I might add.  There are basically two schools of thought when it comes to language instruction.  Total immersion or non-total immersion.  The former is like dropping you in the middle of a foreign country without a guidebook or translator.  The latter is like having someone with you who can speak both languages and can answer questions in your native tongue.  Rosetta is total immersion.  I didn't know that when I received the product.  In the past I've used Pimsleur (Brazilian Portuguese) and found it to be effective both in teaching the language and in motivating me to continue.  The motivation part is why I prefer Pimsleur.  There's also a new company on the market with a similar approach called Fluenz that offers a bit more hand holding than Pimsleur which many users, according to reviews here, seem to like.  For many people there's a very basic psychological principle in play when learning a new language.  It's similar to those folks who resolve to exercise and lose weight after New Years.  They start with the best intentions, but many if not most fail to keep their resolutions.  One of the reasons is a lack of positive reinforcement.  If you start out too fast, for example, and get hurt you've just created a negative influence on your motivation.  Some people, however, are quite successful right out the gate and keep going on their own.  No need for a trainer, no need for hand holding or compliments.  They just do it.  Are you the type of person who will feel stressed (demotivation) by not having the rules of grammar explained to you while you learn a new language?  If yes you won't like Rosetta.  Try Pimsleur or Fluenz.  Or are you the type of person who welcomes the challenge (motivation) of figuring out the rules of grammar on your own by using your own observations?  Then you'll like Rosetta.  I am not one of those people who can stay motivated to do an extremely difficult task if I feel stressed out right at the beginning.  I have visited multiple countries and what I experienced only affirms my dislike of the Rosetta approach.  While in South Korea, Thailand, China or Iraq, I found that people assumed I did not know the local language so they either spoke slower or tried to mix English in with their native tongue.  Much less stressful albeit slower way to learn.  In Brazil there is no single ethnic group.  People assumed I spoke Portuguese.  It was the most difficult time I ever had in another country.  I'm not saying I shouldn't learn the local language - no way.  Just that when you're learning, at least for some people, they need things to go a little slower and with a bit more assistance in order to be motivated to keep learning the language.  Rosetta's license is most restrictive that I have ever encountered.  And they enforce their license.  Some users claim that other companies have the same license rules.  That might be true, but they don't enforce those rules like Rosetta.  If you buy Rosetta on Amazon you are subject to Amazon's refund policies, not Rosetta's.  Amazon doesn't give full refunds on opened software.  And after 30 days you're probably out of luck for any kind of refund.  You cannot get Rosetta's 6 month money back guarantee here.  You only get it if you buy it direct from them at a higher price.  The software can be used on only one computer.  No, you cannot use it on a laptop while you're away from your desktop.  The software license requires that you register online in order to access all the exercises.  Once you do this the software is then tied specifically to that computer.  It cannot be registered on another computer.  This means you cannot resell it _anywhere_.  Rosetta customer service told me that they would consider the needs of customers on a case-by-case basis should someone upgrade their system and get rid of their old machine.  In other words, there's a tiny sliver of flexibility here.  But it ain't much.  You simply must know what style of language learning you prefer before purchasing this very expensive piece of software.  Some people, like me, are going to hate it.  Others who like total immersion love it.  Know what kind of user you are.	-1
With all the commercials on tv for this thing you would figure it was all hoplah. Well, with the perfect interface, the included headphones and the voice and video support, I would consider this the perfect way to learn any language. Optional cds are included so you don't have to be planted in front of your computer the whole time. However, you'll get the most out of this with the picture and video software. Good luck!	1
Apprehension finally put aside, I'm learning!  Runs perfectly on my Apple and takes a small commitment of about an hour a day to get up to speed. NO problems on updates, etc. and only wished that I'd have loaded it onto a laptop for daily "downtime" practicing, because I'd be miles ahead just working in public. ROSETTA STONE SPANISH is the best of the best!  An all-inclusive BOX of gear and lessons that teach very simply and clearly. Choose your level of learning options and wire yourself in: my nephew thinks it rocks and navigates through it with ease, so this is perfect for a wide range of ages and aptitude.  I practice on one of my friends at work, which always is a good thing and welcomed. The sign of respect anywhere on the planet is to try to speak the language, and here it is, an amazing multi-level program that IF YOU KEEP PRACTICING will make you great at Spanish. It can work for more than one user, so do so! Voice ID makes it REALLY work! This is a very complete suite of courses; commit and you'll rock. Even after just a level, I can order food (with a smile for the effort) and converse pretty well. And, best, a kid can do this (although I'm catching up to my kid who absorbed Spanish).  I'm still using it, and this review has no negatives yet! If this old guy can learn it, make the $$$ commitment and go for it. Your confidence will soar!	1
I had a slight advantage, as I started using this product, because I had a basic working knowledge of the Spanish language. I'm in my 40's now, but I studied Spanish in my junior high and high-school years. Although it may be true that you never forget how to ride a bike, a language that languishes is soon forgotten. My Spanish has grown mighty rusty.  I had no idea at all what to expect from Rosetta Stone. Studying Spanish in school was, needless to say, an academic exercise, and I still remember my early days, learning the pronunciation of Spanish vowels and some of the other letters (like &ntilde;) that are not used in the English language. I imagined the process of learning those same things on a computer being exceedingly boring.  To my surprise, Rosetta Stone skips those basic language lessons, and skips right to, well, total immersion. The entire program is in Spanish, without English text or translations beyond those on the menu page. Rosetta Stone teaches with pictures; you learn to associate Spanish words with familiar pictures. And you do so over and over again.  The program "mixes up" the lessons enough to keep them interesting. It can use a microphone (included) to check your pronunciation; it shows plenty of pictures for you to choose from for each Spanish word, and includes lessons on spelling and sentence structure as well.  I have not completed levels 1-3 yet, but I can give Rosetta Stone my unqualified "thumbs up."	1
We've used Rosetta Stone's products for several different language studies. Their methodology works. It's odd because as you complete your first lesson or two you find yourself thinking this can't teach me this language but before you know it you're gaining proficiency. Make no mistake, there is no substitute for time and effort and learning any foreign language requires committment. But, if you're willing to put in the consistent time and effort you will/can/should learn with this product.	1
I have now had the Spanish program for a few months now and I must say that my Spanish has improved.  The lessons are put together well and they seemed to walk me through nicely. I did not feel the pressure of trying to learn Spanish as if I was in a classroom.  Being able to set my own pace was nice.  To be fair, I had taken 4 years of Spanish 20+ years ago in high school.  So much of that knowledge came back to me as I was going through these lesson.  I would definitely reccomend this program to anyone who wants to put the time in to learn Spanish well.  This is not a quick solution, but if you are patient and stick with the program it will pay off immensely.	1
I'm using the Rosetta Stone Spanish version to help my poor Spanish speaking skills. I'm an American-born Hispanic, grew up in a bilingual household and bilingual schools early in my life, but speaking Spanish for me has always been a stumbling block I struggled with. As a young kid, when I tried to speak Spanish, I got laughed at by other kids...so I stopped doing it.  Rosetta Stone Spanish is helping me get past my fears by practicing and speaking Spanish in the privacy of my home. I can speak, review, re-review, and have fun without the pressures of "perfect performance" or getting laughed at. (But I'll laugh at myself.) While a lot of it is very familiar with me, especially in the early stages of the lessons which flew by quickly, it's nice to ease in and work my way upwards.  A part of me is disappointed that I didn't pick a different language like French or Japanese, even though I really need to practice my Spanish. Seeing how Rosetta Stone up their simple yet creative lesson plans, I really wished I was learning a new language from scratch. Really!  The Rosetta Stone kit includes the lesson plan software, audio CD for practice, and a set of USB headphones with a built-in boom mic. The headphone are nicely built and wear comfortably. (But, like most headphones, your ears do get tired and sweaty after prolonged use.) There's also a set of decals to use on your keyboard, if you wish. The decals are helpful but not required to use on your keyboard. Most often, the program will show a virtual keyboard on the screen to help you find the keys you need.  It supports multiple users, so my whole family can take of this program and tailor the lessons to our specific needs. The lessons plans slowly increase in difficulty making it easier to keep pace, especially in a total immersion environment.  This is great for me because since I started doing Rosetta's program, my kindergartner now wants to learn Spanish too. I was able to setup a lesson plan for my young son and set his levels to "Easy" to accommodate his young speaking voice and learning skills. So far, so good. And he has fun doing it.  The program appears to be quite lengthy, so if you're thinking you can learn a whole new language in a week, think again. Each lesson session can take anywhere between 10 to 30 minutes to complete. There are plenty lessons for each level you accomplish, then you keep going up from there.  Rosetta Stone is not a crash course in language learning; it more like a computerized school course with several grade levels you do at home.  Rosetta Stone has been far more practical to use on a laptop where I can move it to a quiet private place in my home to practice. Having a quiet place is crucial. The voice recognition program easily picks up background voices (TV, radio, family, etc.) easily and frustrates your efforts. It's happened to me on several occasions. And since lessons include speaking out loud back to the computer from time to time, you may not want to be close to anyone preoccupied with TV/phone/etc. or do this in a public place where they will look at you funny. (Anyone who plays with Brain Age or similar on Nintendo's DS Lite can relate.)  I have not finished the complete program yet, but have valued what Rosetta's program has offered so far for me and my family. I'm getting more confident with my Spanish speaking abilities which is priceless for me. My son is learning a new language at his pace. My husband is gleaning off of my abilities to help him in bilingual situations. It's been a win-win situation so far.  If it weren't so pricey, I'd gladly buy more languages to have fun with. But if a situation ever arises that requires that I learn a new language, I will seriously look Rosetta's programs to fill that need.	1
This is, without question, my longest term review.  I have been using this software on and off for about two months.  I really wanted to hold my review until I had finished the software.  I wanted to be able to tell potential buyers how far this package, alone, had gotten me toward becoming an actual speaker of Spanish.  However, it has become clear to me i will never finish reviewing this software.  i don't have a truly compelling reason to learn spanish and without that i find that my motivation has simply failed 2/3rds of the way into set 1 of 3.  I suppose one could wonder if my boredom with the software is a sign of a weakness in its design.  it is a question I've asked myself many times. Yes, the lessons are repetitive but they probably NEED to be.  So far the key strength of the program has been to teach me new spanish words.  The program itself never translates anything into English so you wind up "thinking" in Spanish.  This is what they mean by immersion.  However, as i have gone through chapter after chapter i have found my ability to form sentences not improving at all.  This has caused me to become discouraged.  I really think that the people at Rosetta Stone should include some early confidence builders that drill making the user get whole sentences correct as much as they drill individual words and parts of words.  I know that is jumping ahead but it would have helped to hold my interest.  If I do get back to it I will, of course, revise my review.  I subtracted a star because the voice recognition portion of the program is not very good.  Even when I bumped up the level on the voice recognition it still accepted as correct words I had intentionally pronounced incorrectly.  It is, however, clear to me that this is a rigorous and serious software package that truly attempts to TEACH you to read AND write Spanish.	1
Be warned.....buying the Rosetta Stone is not enough to learn spanish. No, in addition to buying the Rosetta Stone you must also be willing to dedicate at least 45-60 minutes a day to learning Spanish. If you are willing to dedicate the time you can be confident that you will see positive results.    The Rosetta Stone is amazing effective in drilling in lessons with the use of games and patterns while forgoing the old-fashioned method of memorizing lists of words. At first you don't realize that you are learning spanish...and then as the days roll by you gradually realize that you are beginning to understand a variety of words and phrases. It reminds me of putting together a puzzle - it takes a little time before you see the picture coming together.    The voice recognition software is great for helping you to learn to talk (almost) like a native. While your pronunciation does not need to be perfect to advance it does need to be close. This is a very effective way to help transfer the lessons that you are learning into usable communication skills. In fact, to me this is the primary benefit that the Rosetta Stone has over any other language learning device - it offers immediate feedback!  Things that I enjoy-    - Intuitive approach to learning - both through word identification and by speaking. The voice identification software will help you take your language learning to the next lesson.   - More than one user is allowed. The Rosetta Stone is currently tracking of both me and my wife.   - Comprehensive language suite - once you are finished (and I am not close to being finished) you can be assured that you have gone through a intensive language training course. Simply put - you are getting more than the basics.   - Money back guarantee - if you don't like the Rosetta Stone you have 6 months to get a FULL refund!   - To me, this seems like the perfect tool for someone home schooling their children. Many of the lessons would be very age appropriate for someone in school  Negatives to the Rosetta Stone -   - Well it is not cheap   - You must "Want" to learn the language - not partial efforts will be effective   - one license means one computer - if you have the need to run the software on an additional computer you will need to buy ANOTHER copy of the software.    Final verdict - if you are serious about learning spanish The Rosetta Stone will be the perfect investment for you. 5 stars	1
This was our first experience with Rosetta Stone for any language, and we were excited to get right into it and see if it lived up to expectations. Installation and setup of the program took a little while but completed without a hitch, and everything functioned properly right off the bat. The immersive learning process is truly wonderful, and even our seven year old is able to participate and learn without having to worry about it being too complicated to use. Personally, I've almost completed the entire course and I've found that I've learned quicker and easier with Rosetta Stone than I did in my entire two years taking Spanish in high school (after which I still had only mastered the basics). The native speakers method of compare/contrast to your own speech is really what makes this program so special, and probably why it's more effective than just learning from a high school teacher saying the words and having you write them down. Overall, I cannot speak highly enough of this product. I recommend it to anybody who's interested in learning Spanish, whether for your career, travel, or just to broaden your language horizons.	1
OK, first off I need to admit that I am a native New Mexican and have been around Spanish speaking folks most of my life. That probably gives me a bit of an advantage in attempting to learn the language. Another advantage is Rosetta Stone's Version 3 language system. The installation was simple and the program works great. You learn Spanish the same way you learned English: you learn to say what you see. It's fun and kind of addicting. And best of all, you can start speaking the language right away and little by little gain a confident and comprehensive grasp of Spanish. Highly recommended! Enjoy!!	1
I opted to study French when I was in grade school, but I have always been interested in learning the Spanish language.  This set is very well thought out and comes with everything you need, except for the computer of course. '-)  It also gets an extra star because it it Mac OS X compatible!  I've been using this for a few weeks and although I am not yet a fluent Spanish speaker yet, I think that the Rosetta Stone's techniques, along with a good deal of practice, can have a committed person learning the language in a very short time.  So slap on the included headset (it allows the program to evaluate your pronunciation), and Aprenderemos hablar espaol!	1
First things first - I was able to easily install the software following the directions provided.  This is somewhat significant in that my DH is a technical person and I've done very little of this on my own.  Of note is that 600 mb is needed for each of the Language Levels.  I did struggle and had to ask for help installing the headset/microphone, but the techie had little difficulty and I'll admit I surrendered to offered help too quickly and believe I may have been able to do that on my own as well.  I write this only for those of you who may be intimidated by programs and are hesitant to buy something for fear you won't be able to figure out how to install and use it.  I'll confess I haven't gotten very far at all with the program and can't tell you that I feel confident I'll be understanding written and spoken Spanish and speaking it fluently any time soon - but I do have hope that this program is what help me improve beyond my current very minimal level.  Incidentally, you have the option of modifying your lessons so that you can choose to learn speaking only, speaking and listening, speaking, reading and listening, etc., although they recommend selecting it all.  I was tempted to select speaking only, but decided if I was going to do this, I may as well do it thoroughly.  Finding the time is going to be the biggest challenge, but I have been heartened by the relatively short - 30 minutes - time for each lesson I've encountered so far in Level 1.  I find the immersion concept of teaching to be an interesting one and am hopeful their methods will be effective.  I especially like the use of images as I think that serves as visual reinforcement and greatly assists in remembering.  I'll update my review as I make progress with the program and see how well I'm absorbing and retaining what I'm taught.  So far, I've been impressed with everything I've encountered.  I was very concerned that I may not follow through with the program, but I have found it to be an appealing way to try to learn something new in a new way at an age when my learning skills are rusty.	1
This is the perfect learning software for me.  I learn best by doing, and you certainly are doing a lot here.  This is far better than any books or cds you could ever buy.  And in some ways, it could very well be better than a classroom.  You are in full control of your learning and you do it without worrying about remembering a lesson.  You do each lesson feeling like you just forgot everything, and then realize days later, you know phrases for situations in your life, or simple items that you come across. It is highly impressive.  The difference here is all visual.  You see a boy eating an ice cream cone, and you know how to communicate anything that could relate to the sex and age of a person, the act of eating,  food and the amounts or sizes etc.  The program refreshes a variation later on, which could be a woman drinking soda, and you know the difference with the appropriate and specific communication.  You interact in many ways with the program, including speech recognition.  It will even pause until you say the phrase correctly.  All of a sudden, you are presented photos, no words, and if it's a girl walking a dog... you are speaking spanish telling the program what you are looking at.  This is great for any age, and I highly recommend it for children.  It should be in all schools as well.  I have no attention span to speak of, but this kept me going, wanting to learn more.  I still have more to go, but I hope to afford the Italian version as soon as I can... which leads to the only negative aspect... the price.  For the most part, it's worth the price, but, not fair for most.  If this is way out of your reach, please try your local library.  Otherwise, it is worth the investment.  Product cosmetics need to be revamped.  The box could be library ready without stickers and tape ripping the outer carton.  And the inside is poorly constructed to hold the disc due to the slot for the headphones that will never go in the box again.  For the amount of money, the storage box should be more functional.  I have tried several recorded language programs before.  This is by far the best.	1
I live in an area where Rosetta Stone heavily markets their products to the aging and retiring baby-boomers that have all been told by their General Physicians to start studying a new language to help stave of the onset of Alzheimer's. Being 36 years old myself, I have yet to worry about that just yet.  At nearly four hundred dollars though, the entry price on this is a bit of a downer. When you look at things in terms of price points, that kind of money, in this economy -- doesn't bode well. I'm reminded of a quote by Matt Damon in the film Good Will Hunting:  "You dropped a hundred and fifty grand on an education you coulda' picked up for a dollar fifty in late charges at the Public Library."  Yes, your local public library probably has a multitude of learning materials for learning Spanish. A language that is still difficult, but definitely not as difficult as Chinese. If you live in the United States, you would also be hard pressed not to be able to find, or even know, and be friends with some folks who either speak Spanish fluently or do so as native speakers. The Spanish language is so ubiquitous in the US now, a person could almost learn the language just from riding the city bus.  So, the point I'm making here is a simple one. Do you need to drop $400 to learn Spanish? The answer is simple. No. I think of Rosetta Stone like a gym membership. They're expensive and often tedious to pay, but worth it only if you use it.  The product itself is quite good though, if you already have moved past any concerns of money. The system Rosetta Stone employs is state of the art, as they say, and they do their best to immerse you into the language immediately. It really is unlike any other Spanish Language program that's out there for the purchase. So there really is no comparison.  Having been a previous customer with the Rosetta Stone Japanese 1,2,3 ... I was pleased to sharpen my skills in Spanish. Both of them are a fantastic product to say the least.  I give it four stars. One minus for the price.	1
Rosetta Stone represents an easy and fun process of relating words and speech to images....without any English translation at all.  Learning Spanish is fast, effective and as fun as playing a game but, you are also learning the language at the same time!  It is the same way you learned your language as a child.  Calling it "Dynamic Immersion" with four dynamic strategies, which are: intuition, interactivity, instruction and images.  All aspects of learning the language is by simple activities. Beginning with the nouns, verbs and other basics.  Pronunciation, through speech analysis and recognition. Using repetition and correction until the pronunciation of words and phrases are perfected.  There is even an advanced speech analysis graph that you can compare your speech to the "native speaker".  The speech recognition software is an outstanding accomplishment.  I started with level 1 course "speaking and listening" and I was off learning Spanish.  Under each level there are many "units" to practice and learn.  There are 3 levels altogether to work through.  After completing the course work there are 3 levels of audio companion (4 cd's each level) to help you practice what you have learned in Rosetta Stone version 3 software.  Through The Rosetta Stone, learning a new language is not a heavy task.  Anyone can and will learn just by following the program.  I highly recommend this for one who needs to learn Spanish in a short amount of time.	1
First, because a lot of reviewers here seem to have some background in Spanish, I want to mention my own experience with this language. Basically, I have next to none!  I mean, as an American, I've of course encountered words like "grande" and "hombre," but I've had almost no Spanish instruction in my life. (I did have a semester of Spanish in sixth grade, but I am 99.9 percent sure the instructor didn't actually speak Spanish, and I certainly didn't learn anything. Plus, that was two decades ago.)  I'm still working on Level 1 of this program, because I'm the mom of a very busy toddler and I also don't want to go so fast that none of what I'm learning "sticks." But so far, I am absolutely in love with the Rosetta Stone program.  The software (which I run on a Macbook, with absolutely no problems) is very intuitive and easy to use. There's almost no English -- just pictures and Spanish words, phrases and sentences that you quickly come to associate with one another. For example, the software says, "Es rojo" and you select the picture of the red object, as opposed to the blue or green or yellow one. It's almost like being in Latin America and having a very patient Spanish-speaking friend point out everything you see, again and again and again, until you learn to associate the word and the concept or object.  This method works surprisingly well for verbs and other grammatical constructions, I've found. I was really amazed at how quickly I picked up things like subject/verb agreement just from the photos and from repetition.  There is definitely a lot of repetition. Some people may find this frustrating, especially if they pick up on something very quickly and then remember it well, but it's worked well for me. I tend to grasp a concept very fast and then forget it almost immediately. But working through this program slowly seems to really be pounding Spanish into my head.  The audio companions, while probably not strictly necessary, are nice. I listen to them while I'm driving. They're mostly of the "listen and repeat" variety -- at least the ones I've encountered so far are -- and it helps me to try to visualize what the speaker is talking about, as a way of refreshing what I've learned.	1
Have Spanish version 3 level 1,2&3 installed on a Vista laptop and it works well. The program uses repetition of words matched to pictures to reinforce learning. I like the feature of being able to speak into the system to test your accent. The software will let you know if your accent matches what it believes is correct. The program starts off easy but quickly becomes harder as you move through the different lessons. The key thing to remember is that learning any language takes time and a lot of work. To think that you are just going to go through the program without a lot of effort and learn a language would be incorrect.  The program is very expensive but seems to work well and if you are interested in learning another language it is a valid option.	1
I have been very curious about Rosetta Stone language teaching program. You saw their commercials everywhere, from airline magazines to TV ads, and wonder if it really works. After several lessons, I can say that it works! Like everything else, you need to invest time and patience, but if you can't learn from Rosetta Stone, you need a human teacher or you just don't have aptitude for learning a second language. IMHO, Rosetta Stone is among the top language learning software out there. If you can't take a live class, then Rosetta Stone is for you.  The software comes with both Windows and Mac, which is a pleasant surprise. It installed and run on my Mac without any issues. The package included language learning software and 3 levels of Spanish language. It even includes a high quality headset and microphone so you can learn without bothering other people. There are 3 audio companion disks to aid with learning. The whole thing took about 15 minutes to install. I installed all 3 levels. You can select different goals: read, write, speak and listen or just to read and write. I selected the whole thing: read, write, speak and listen.  Now for the lesson part. Rosetta Stone uses a natural learning method, which associates spoken and written words with images so it is very different from other software. No English was spoken, you have to work at guessing the words at first, but then it becomes easier as you build up vocabulary. First, you match text to an images (reading), then you have to pronounce the words for each image (speaking). The last part for hearing, you select the correct image as the software pronounces it. The sentences get more complex as you progress through lessons. The images used in the software are very nice and high quality.  At the end of each lesson, there is sort of a quiz to review what you learned. Each lesson is also short enough, about 30 minutes, so you don't have to worry about forgetting what you learned. After each lesson, there is a pronunciation part to help you speak correctly,  *You* are still the key to learning a new language. Without commitment, no software or teacher in the world can help you with it. But if you really want to learn and can't get to a live class, Rosetta Stone is the best option.	1
I have taken a number of classes to learn a variety of languages, and have forgotten most of them all. Learning on the computer has been a new and fairly positive experience for me. The package comes with a number of elements: the base software, the particular language elements to plug into the base software, audio companion CDs for review offline and a USB headset/microphone.  Installation is a two part process, 1) install the base software, 2) install any language element tiers. (The headset will need some installation time, but that should be managed by the system). The installation progressed pretty smooth, took a reasonable amount of time, no errors.  The process of learning is geared toward an immersive process where you start speaking pretty much right at the start (kind of like being tossed into the pool and told to swim). You start by selecting your goals (read, write, speak, etc.) and then follow the lesson plan, reviewing as often as necessary. My personal experience has been that I enjoy the immersive process, I am still working through the lessons, but I fell that I have gained considerably more than I have in past language learning opportunities. The process has been a fairly painless process, and I devote time when available.  My bottom line is that the product is pretty pricey, but gives you one of the best learning experiences I can imagine short of being dropped off in Mexico. P-)	1
Three of the members of my family have been using this program for the past two - three weeks.  The first is myself, a 40 something who took Spanish in high school for 3 years, spent a summer in South America (and emerged fluent from that experience) but now am quite rusty.  I still understand a great deal of Spanish, but have lost my ability to speak it.  The second is my 12 year old son, who has had one year of fairly intensive Spanish over the previous school year.  The third is my 9 year old daughter, her previous Spanish only a few words gleaned from Dora the Explorer.  Both of my kids have to earn TV or video game time over the summer.  They  earn it by reading or playing educational computer games.  I offered this program as a choice when it arrived and both have chosen to do Rosetta Stone for about 80% of the overall required time.  Obviously they enjoy it, but would not chose it over playing on the video game console.   Both kids have been using the microphone.  I feel this is a strong point of the program since my kids really do not hear native speakers with the other Spanish Language Program we have (Eazyspeak Spanish ) .  The microphone option has several choices for how closely you have to match the correct pronunciation in order to "pass".  I have it adjusted higher for my son and lower for my daughter.  I also had to adjust the speaker volume from the control panel of the computer (use Start- Control Panel - Sounds and Audio Devices).  For the 12 year old with one year of Spanish, starting about halfway though level one was appropriate.  For myself Level 1 was too easy.  At level 2 I found that I was "relearning" some things (especially matching noun and verb type) that I had forgotten.  The program is visually pleasant,  good quality photos, and a good mix of types of teaching such as listening to a phrase and picking the correct photo,  repeating phrases,  having to come up with your own phrases to describe the photos,  typing answers.  I find the audio companion very useful, it is helping me drag the forgotten Spanish out of my brain.  The kids do not like it at all,  I think the lack of visual feedback is frustrating for them but it could also be that they prefer the "books on cd" we usually listen to when traveling in the car.  My son had been using "Eazyspeak Spanish" before Rosetta stone.  This is also a good program for learning basic vocabulary (if you just want to go to Mexico and be able to ask for the bathroom, or chose menu items) but it does not give you any feedback about your pronunciation.  Be aware, the Eazyspeak  program does teach all sorts of names for alcoholic drinks and has some innuendos.  Rosetta Stone is a great way to learn basic Spanish, much closer to how you "naturally" learn. However, I do not thing you will be "fluent" after finishing the program, but you will be able to get your basic messages across and navigate more easily when on vacation.  It is fantastic as a supplement to a beginning Spanish classes and a great way for kids to start learning another language.  I plan on having my daughter finish all the lessons before she starts taking Spanish in school, it should give her a good solid foundation.  ***UPDATE  My son went back to school 3 weeks ago.  I got an email from his teacher this week saying that my son had really improved his pronunciation over the summer and had remembered more of his vocabulary than the rest of the class.  He asked me if what we did with him over the summer and I told him that my son had done Eazy Speak Spanish for a month and then Rosetta Stone.  **One year update   We are still using this software on a weekly basis.  During the summer I have my teenage son (who is taking Spanish in school) use Rosetta Stone.  It is very helpful in retaining vocabulary.  My 10 year old daughter has been working her way through the program as well,  she should start out her first Spanish class with a good grasp of some of the basics.  They enjoy the program, so it does not take much pushing to get them to use it.	1
Let's face it: a lot of computer-assisted instruction is just plain lame or worse.  They can suffer from either being rote memorization schemes or over-glorified games or simply textbooks in electronic form.  Rare is a system that truly utilizes what computers can do best to solidly teach concepts.  Rosetta Stone delivers.  It teaches language using multiple sensory inputs (picture & voice) and multiple feedback mechanisms (your voice and hand-eye choices).  It is able to adjust and compensate for your learning speed and strengths on the fly.  It is engaging without being just a game.  And it is able to effectively teach without English--- which is the closest you can get to a dedicated immersion course.  Bottom line:  I am very impressed.  My ten year old loves it, actually WANTS to do the lessons.  I'm having fun with it too, even though languages are definitely not my strong suit.  If you want to learn a language on your own, this is the best way I know to do it.	1
While in middle school and high school we were required to take a foreign language course, so I ended up taking French, Spanish, and Japanese. Eventually French was the only one I continued through high school and eventually college.  Since then, I have never had a need to use French so I have pretty much forgotten all I've learned.  I later realized Spanish was a language I could have use for today, but my past Spanish computer courses I've purchases not helpful at all and downright boring.  RosettaStone was going to be my next purchase until I saw the price; much more expensive than I expected it to be.  I eventually planned on getting it, but not anytime in the foreseeable future.  I had an opportunity to try and keep the Spanish version of RosettaStone so you can image I jumped on the opportunity quickly.  As I am going through Level 1 of the three level course, I am finding out already that I am enjoying RosettaStone's approach to learning as opposed to the other courses I have had.  RosettaStone uses a "Dynamic Immersion" approach which basically teaches you the language very similar to the way you learned your first language.  After the very first lesson I found myself being able to associate everyday objects with the things I learned in the language.  More importantly it seems to stick.  My high school French teacher taught us that repetition is the key to learning a new language and if you don't use it then you will lose it.  RosettaStone follows this same principle; at the beginning of every lesson the software always goes over what you've learned in the previous lessons to reinforce what you've learned.  It also comes with audio companion CD's you can listen to in your car or at work that will also go over with what has been learned.  The RosettaStone software focuses on four major areas; reading, speaking, writing, and vocabulary.  Most of the reading and vocabulary exercises require you matching up pictures up with what the speaker says and what displays on the screen.  Pronunciation exercises require you to repeat what the speaker says with the provided USB Headphones/microphone.  Writing exercises require you to write/spell in Spanish using the on screen keyboard.  The software even comes with stickers you can place over your existing keyboard to make typing easier.  RosettaStone is very visual which is important to learning a new language.  From what I have observed, RosettaStone does not use translations at all. Instead, with the aid of visual references it actually teaches Spanish independent of your native language.  So instead of trying to remember "una manzana" = apple or "un huevo" = egg, you are taught to associate the word, phrase, or sentence with a mental picture which I think makes things stick.  Keep in mind this is just one example of how RosettaStone teaches you your new language.  Honestly, after going through to first few lessons, while I agreed I was learning, I didn't think I was learning THAT much, however that view changed when the software required me to identify objects and phrases on the screen by spelling them without any help from the speaker.  I thought I would fail the lesson, but I surprised myself; ending up getting all but one correct.  It was as if I was doing the activity subconsciously.  My only real complaint was the poor customer service experience I had when calling RosettaStone Customer Support to inform them that the Spanish Keyboard stickers were printed incorrectly.  On Spanish keyboards pressing Shift + a number 4 - 0 will produce a different character than an English keyboard:  On a Spanish Keyboard, pressing shift in conjunction with numbers 4 - 0 should produce the following characters:  Shift + 4 = "$" Shift + 5 = "%" Shift + 6 = "&" Shift + 7 = "/" Shift + 8 = "(" Shift + 9 = ")" Shift + 0 = "="  However the Spanish stickers included with RosettaStone are printed as:  Shift + 4 = "%" Shift + 5 = "&" Shift + 6 = "/" Shift + 7 = "(" Shift + 8 = ")" Shift + 9 = "=" Shift + 0 =  After being on hold for nearly 20 minutes, I finally get to a live person, I tried to explain the issue to the customer service rep, but this guy was completely clueless on what I was talking about and the only solution was for me to press the shift button...ok.  Before getting too involved with a long drawn out frustrating conversation, I asked to speak to someone else.  He transfers me and again I am on hold for a long period of time before speaking to a "senior technical rep" I tell her the issue and she tells me that she can just have RosettaStone send me more keyboard stickers.  I am transferred again, and yet again am on hold for a while.  When speaking to the new person, she informs me that RosettaStone does NOT send out the stickers separately, but suggested I buy some from another company for $12.  When I tell her that the keyboard stickers are printed incorrectly she says she would bring it to someone's attention...yeah right.  After wasting nearly an hour with RosettaStone Customer Support I hung up more dissatisfied then I was when I first called.  In fact the original issue wasn't really a big of a deal, but I felt the need to let someone know so they could fix it for future customers; but instead, I get bad customer service.  I eventually fixed the stickers myself with the help of a razor, simply putting the symbols above the numbers in their correct places.  Other than the bad customer service experience, my only concern right now is that the course may be rather short even though it's three levels.  I am still very early in the course so perhaps that may not be a concern at all.  Also since I am very early in the course, there is no way I can honestly say if it's worth the hefty price tag, but I will say I am very impressed so far, and am very eager to continue my learning.  However be aware if you need to call customer support that you will be on hold for a while and there is no guarantee that they will even be able to help you plus they are not the most polite people I have had to deal with but hopefully you won't even have to deal with them.  Independent of the customer service I'll give it a rounded up value of 5, but the bad customer service experience is something I can't ignore, so for that it gets a 4.	1
There is no false adverstising with Rosetta Stone. This system works, but one caveat. It takes a lot of time. You need to listen to the lessons and do nothing else.  If you are trying to become fairly fluent for a vacation or business trip, this is the way to go. But, if you really want to learn the language, with conjugations and such then you still need a class or workbook. Also be careful, this is Latin American Spanish, not Spanish from Spain. There is a difference.	1
We've been thinking about it for a long time but the cost kept stopping us. It's expensive, but seems very good, albeit we haven't had it long. Maybe I will add to the review once we've had it longer, but other reviewers here have done a good job of describing it. Why does it take weeks to ship though?	1
I must be honest - I'm still working my way through level 1. However, the product is the next best thing to having native language speaker tutoring me and is in some ways better. I can use it whenever I feel like picking up a few new phrases and it never gets impatient with me.  Rosetta Stone products are primarily geared towards visual learners, using lots of flash card like memory games. One included extra that I appreciate is the CD pack for audio listening on long drives. Overall the package is an excellent way to learn Japanese and that comes at a price premium.	1
We've all seen the commercials for Rosetta Stone on television. Given the mass of "instant satisfaction" commercials on tv, it's easy to write this product off as another one of those scams to relieve people of their hard earned money.  It was sort of with this attitude that I approached Rosetta Stone.  I've had a mild interest in Japanese for some time and so, decided to take the plunge with the Japanese version of Rosetta Stone.  Rosetta Stone comes with the software for installation on a computer, audio cds for use to practice while on the go as well as a headset for use with the software itself. Installing the program is easy enough, and then one gets into the nitty gritty of using it. The program is fairly well laid out and intuitive and it's easy to get started.  As others have described, Rosetta Stone's main goal is to encourage users to speak the language actively.  Immersion is undoubtedly the most effective way to learn a language as it forces the speaker to use the language and converse in it under practical circumstances. As one who's taken a few language courses in my time, I can say that while book study has its uses, to actually learn a language for practical use, speaking and hearing it is absolutely vital.  Rosetta Stone attempts to get as close to that experiance as possible with its teaching style. Do do this, it uses images, spoke words and a return responce method. The user speaks into a microphone to respond and the program has the facility to "listen" to one's pronunciation and correct it when off.  For a tonal language such as Japanese, pronunciation is absolutely vital to avoid translation errors.  The Rosetta Stone method is quite effective in helping to train a person's mouth to make the correct sounds and get used to saying the words. Japanese is a language quite unlike English, so this is a real benefit of the program. I found that it really did work in helping me retain vocabulary, though I did struggle at times.  The progam is fairly well designed from a flow standpoint, with various lessons occasionally repeating themselves as you progress to help reinforce retention of the material.  In the end it's not a perfect method, but for the self studier, it isn't terrible.  The down side is that Rosetta stone uses a call responce method and so a person does not get the conversational experiance that builds confidence and teaches in its own right. Practical conversation is unexpected and fluid, something that a computer program cannot emulate. I could see that this program would be a godsend if used in conjunction with actual classes where one could practically apply what they've learned. Repeating rote phrases is a lot different than actually speaking.  Another thing I noticed is that Rosetta Stone's focus on speaking actually has a downside in that it seems a bit weak on teaching proper grammer. It uses the language method of teaching by showing differences in gender and verb conjugations and the like as you go through lessons, but it's not very deep and a lot of it is inferred. For someone like myself who has taken numerous language classes over the years, I was left wondering if learning vocabulary and grammer in this way was really enough. Given that all I know about Japanese is what I was taught by Rosetta Stone, it's hard for me to say.  The use of Japanese characters is another aspect of this program that threw me. I took the advice of one of the other reviewers here and studied some of the Hiragana on my own to avoid using Romaji (latinized written japanese). It was good advice.  A word to the wise, this is a pretty in depth program. While commercials and the like seem to imply that this is the "easy" way to learn a language, it's like any other method of learning a language. It's work and a real investment of time. Daily study will make this program its most effective and probably push a student deeper into the language than basic classes would.  But it's likely to take months rather than weeks to progress to the point where one has a deeper grasp of the language.  I didn't use the language CD's (which cover the lessons in the program), but I could see that if someone was in a hurry to learn even more quickly, these might be quite useful for usewhile in the car on the go.  From personal experiance, I learned more Japanese more quickly from this program in a couple months than a comparative spanish when taking a couple years of that language.  That's saying something.	1
Rosetta Stone presents a different approach to spoken-language learning. You are provided with computer program discs, audio discs and a headset. The lessons consist of a visual/audio response setting. You are shown some beautiful pictures/photos and are provided examples of speech by either native or expert language speakers. You are expected to repeat what you are told. You are also expected to remember what you previously learned. Rosetta Stone is not intended to teach you to be able to read nor write the language, especially with non-Roman character sets. There is some support  for the more graphic character sets (Kanji, Hiragana), but with only an English keyboard, your typing will be with Roman characters in a phonetic Japanese. What is lacking? Specific language syntax. When sentence structure varies from your native language you can get very confused constructing your own prose. (This would be necessary to learn to write in a foreign tongue, which is not an objective here.) Overall this is a simple approach to allow you to learn to speak a foreign language as a native child might be taught to speak (recognition, repetition and intuition.) Including the "audio companion" discs was a good idea. When you are away from your computer you can listen to the discs (or upload them to your iPod, or other media player) and practice some more.	1
With all the commercials on tv for this thing you would figure it was all hoplah. Well, with the perfect interface, the included headphones and the voice and video support, I would consider this the perfect way to learn any language. Optional cds are included so you don't have to be planted in front of your computer the whole time. However, you'll get the most out of this with the picture and video software. Good luck!	1
I had tried to learn Japanese several years ago by listening to audio tapes and then by taking a class, and found it very difficult. Rosetta Stone looked like they might have a better answer, so I gave them a try.  First of all, installation was a snap. I installed RS on a Mac running OS X Leopard, and had no problem at all. It takes a long time, though, so be prepared to wait or even walk away from the computer for a while during installation. I decided to try using the Mac's built-in mic instead of the headset provided with the software, and found that it worked well. Of course, this would not be a good idea if there is a lot of noise near your computer. You may have trouble hearing the lessons, and RS would probably not do well judging your pronunciation.  You have a choice of how the Japanese words will display on your screen. If you are primarily interested in learning spoken Japanese, you might choose to have the text display using characters from the English alphabet, as that could help you to more easily recognize and pronounce the phrases.  Japanese is, obviously, very different from English, and I was unsure how well I could follow even the basic lessons. Turns out, it was simple due to the repetition built in to the Rosetta Stone system. The first time I heard a word or phrase it didn't necessarily stick with me, but by the end of the lesson it had sunk in. That has turned out to be key in helping me to learn this unfamiliar language.  Although each phrase is repeated several times, it wasn't boring. The phrases are mixed up a bit each time, and by paying attention and working through the lesson you start to understand a little more each time you use the software.  One thing that makes a difference in how much I retain is working the lessons consistently. Do not expect that you will spend a few minutes once or twice a week and really learn the language. Plan on spending time nearly every day, and the more time you can spare, the better. Half an hour or more a day would be ideal.  Although everyone has a different learning style, I believe that Rosetta Stone can work for many people who are comfortable with independent learning. It is certainly much better than audio-only, and allows you to learn and practice on your own schedule, unlike a class.	1
Approximately 3 months of usage now and going strong.  I am able to recognize simple characters and basic conversation phrases in Japanese.  Each level takes 1 year to fully complete, so this complete set is in effect a 3 year language course.	1
Rosetta Stone Japanese Course Levels 1, 2, and 3 Pros: The Rosetta Stone approach to language learning is a new (and quite frankly, effective) one. Instead of learning vocabulary and grammar through repetitious rote memorization, Rosetta Stone utilizes the user's own deductive logic and inherent learning abilities to make the language fun and much easier to master. Each unit begins with the introduction of new sounds and words. You aren't expected to know what the words mean at this point, but you are encouraged to repeat them and listen to how you sound compared to native speakers. This is accomplished by using the included headset and microphone in conjunction with visual feedback of your voice. Next comes the vocabulary section. As I mentioned before, you are not given direct translations of the words; instead, you are shown a series of pictures that help you deduce the meanings of words and how they fit into the structure of the sentence. It becomes a sort of detective game, as you are given a sentence written entirely in the language, and using your brain, you come to instinctively pull it apart to find the meaning. After you find meaning to your words, the Phrases and Speaking sections help you put it into practice and solidify everything you learned in the unit. Add to that the included CDs full of audio lessons and samples of native speech, and you have a full package that turns an incredible task into an enjoyable experience. Cons: The only real con I could find with the software itself was the price. It may seem like a large price to pay for some CD-ROMS and a USB headset, but after using the product for awhile, I have come to see its true value. I have taken nearly a year and a half of college-grade Japanese, and I still have learned a great deal from the software. Also, the presentation of the material makes it fun enough for leisurely learners and youths.  So even though the price tag is a bit exorbitant, it beats the heck out of paying for 2 years of college language courses! Intended Users: This is where Rosetta Stone courses really shine. Not only did I have a go at the program, but I set up user profiles for my mother, father, sister and nephew in order to get a good cross-sectional view of how different ages and educations would react. All were positive. Perhaps the greatest surprise to me was my father, who is a very stern "you can't teach an old dog new tricks" kind of guy found himself getting caught up learning a language that he didn't even have a need for! All in all, I'd certainly suggest this program to anyone looking to learn another language, brush up on one that may be slipping away due to lack of practice, or just looking to stretch their mind a bit.	1
The "Rosetta Stone" language programs use an immersion technique to teach language, where all the lessons are done in the language you're looking to learn.  The idea is that it is how we all learn language in the first place, so it's the most logical way to learn a second language.  There are several styles of exercise in the Rosetta Stone program. The simplest version presents a word in the new language, along with several pictures, one of which matches.  Sometimes the word is spoken, sometimes written, and usually both.  More complex variations will present a number of phrases, which form a pattern, and ask the student to complete the pattern on a fourth phrase.  For example, one exercise might give the student "The man is wearing pants," "The man is wearing a hat," "The woman is wearing a hat," and a picture of a woman wearing pants.  The student then has to give back the sentence, "The woman is wearing pants."  Again, there are different ways to do this.  Sometimes, it's a multiple-choice question, where the program will offer, "The woman/man is wearing pants/a hat," and ask the user to select the appropriate words to fill in the blank.  Other times, the student must speak the entire sentence into a microphone.  (A USB headset/microphone is provided.)  This voice recognition is the most disappointing part of the program to me.  Simply put, it's not nearly as good as a person.  There have been many times where I've said an incorrect answer - knowing I'd messed it up as the words left my mouth - and had the program mark it as correct, and vice versa.  As the program always repeats the correct answer back, once it thinks you've given it, you shouldn't get led too far astray.  All in all, the Rosetta Stone software looks like an effective way to learn the rudiments of a language.  It excels at teaching and drilling vocabulary, and in offering many excellent examples of correct pronunciation.  It falls short of its goals in being able to validate the student's pronunciation, and in teaching subtle points of grammar.  For those, supplementing the program with conversation with a  native speaker, and a decent textbook will be invaluable.	1
<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Rosetta-Stone-Version-3-Japanese-Level-1-2-3-Set-with-Audio-Companion/dp/B001AFFYSW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Rosetta Stone Version 3: Japanese Level 1, 2 & 3 Set with Audio Companion</a>&nbsp;is a great program and is definitely speeding up my language learning.  I have studied and used several languages for work, and Japanese has been on my list for a while.  Like most tools this software should probably be used in combination with other tools.  Learning the Kanji character alphabet will probably be the hardest with the included method.  While it does help you with building a vocabulary, learning the intricacies of the various formal tenses is also something that may need to be augmented.  Still, this is an excellent resource for the serious language learner who wants to learn a little bit at a time. The high cost may stop some people but overall it's probably worth it for those serious about learning Japanese.  The Product  The product that includes the 3 levels is definitely a better value than the single level products, which won't provide enough content to allow even basic speaking ability.  Included you will find: 1) Nice quality printed manuals 2) Software CDs for all 3 levels, beginner, intermediate and advanced 3) Audio companion CDs for all 3 levels, also a huge extra and well worth the extra $50 4) A basic computer headset with headphones and a microphone  Overall, the box seems somewhat small.  But once you see all that's included within it, you will understand where your money went.  There's a lot of content packed on those disks, which is what you pay for.  The Method  The full immersion method forces you to avoid the traditional translation of other learning methods.  The good thing is that it helps you to quickly gain the basics in terms of vocabulary and comprehension. The challenge is of course that you must work much harder to learn grammar and written syntax.  This version does allow you to see and learn some characters along with the lessons, but most serious learners will still want to augment this immersion method with some traditional study too.  The software allows you to focus on language areas.  There is less emphasis on repetition within modules, but you can repeat them as desired if you prefer drills.  The USB headset allows you to repeat phrases and improve your accuracy, which also facilitates learning.  The structure is very good and the integrated visuals along with the audio will allow you to gain confidence quicker than other methods. Since many people learn visually and others learn by hearing, this method allows both groups to learn effectively.  You can also begin to learn to read basic Japanese characters by selecting that option.  The program allows you to select traditional roman characters or Japanese.  There are also exercises that test your comprehension by making selections onscreen.  The method may be overwhelming at first for some people, but is actually easier than traditional learning.  The only qualms I have with it is that I personally do learn a little better with traditional grammar and repetition methods.  The Software  The software is very good, but not error free.  I was somewhat surprised by how demanding it was.  I did experience a few errors that required me to restart the program, as well as some general slowness moving between sections.  I recently upgraded the RAM on my computer, and have had more responsiveness since then.  However, you are limited to installing this on one machine as far as I could tell.  So from that perspective, make sure you install it on a good one that you feel comfortable with.  The audio companions are perhaps more akin to traditional programs I am familiar with.  These have been a great addition for me.  I started out only using the software and have begun to augment with the CDs too.  The Alternatives  The&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Rosetta-Stone-Version-3-Japanese-Level-1-2-3/dp/B0015ETQ78/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Rosetta Stone Version 3: Japanese Level 1, 2 & 3</a>&nbsp;version doesn't include the audio companion, but as far as I'm concerned this version is well worth the small premium relative to that one.  Similarly, you can buy each level individually but getting them together is a much better value. <a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Rosetta-Stone-Version-3-Japanese-Level-1/dp/B00153T0KM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Rosetta Stone Version 3: Japanese Level 1</a>, <a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Rosetta-Stone-Version-3-Japanese-Level-2/dp/B00153YALG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Rosetta Stone Version 3: Japanese Level 2</a>, <a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Rosetta-Stone-Version-3-Japanese-Level-3/dp/B0015EV4H8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Rosetta Stone Version 3: Japanese Level 3</a>  Coming from somebody who is used to learning a language from a combination of Barron's programs and books, this program is a very welcome addition to my toolbox.  I would still recommend using those other programs to augment your study though.  Particularly, books on characters like&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Essential-Kanji-2-000-Basic-Japanese-Characters-Systematically-Arranged-For-Learning-And-Reference/dp/0834802228/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Essential Kanji: 2,000 Basic Japanese Characters Systematically Arranged For Learning And Reference</a>,<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Schaum-s-Outline-of-Japanese-Grammar/dp/0071342206/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Schaum's Outline of Japanese Grammar</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Japanese-Kanji-Flashcards-Vol-1-Third-Edition/dp/0974869449/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Japanese Kanji Flashcards, Vol. 1 (Third Edition)</a>&nbsp;are going to be very useful if you need to learn for more than just conversation.  Relatively speaking, I suppose the Pimsleur programs like&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Japanese-III-2nd-Ed-Learn-to-Speak-and-Understand-Japanese-with-Pimsleur-Language-Programs-Pimsleur-Language-Program/dp/0743528859/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Japanese III - 2nd Ed.: Learn to Speak and Understand Japanese with Pimsleur Language Programs (Pimsleur Language Program)</a>would be considered comparable in price to these, though they are also more expensive if you buy each level individually.  Relative to those, there is no comparison.  This software approach wins hands down and is actually a better value.  Conclusion  This is a great language program and should do the trick if, like many people, you are not a fan of the traditional memorization method that is common in language learning.  While the investment is significant, it's well worth if you're serious about learning Japanese.  Enjoy!	1
I was very happy to get this product. I am Japanese American myself but am ashamed to say pretty much the only Japanese I know is being able to order from a menu, or else the more impolite words like "bakatare" (stupid) or "yakamashi" (loudmouth) or "monku" (complaining.. hence the "monkuboy" moniker, haha). While my friends went to Japanese school on Saturday mornings I resisted and my parents never forced me so I learned nothing. However, I bet everyone who went forgot how to speak or understand it anyway so we all wound up at the same place.  Regarding this program: The box is impressively heavy. It installed without a hitch using the accurate instructions, though it did take a fairly long time. The headset installed without a hitch also - I use Windows XP and it recognized the device right away and the first test with the software was successful.  It is a rather flimsy headset so you have to treat it gently.  Also, make sure you turn down the volume on your PC before using it because the voices are LOUD.  The lessons are pleasant to take and the sessions last about half an hour which seems about right to digest things. Even though most of it is intuitive as far as what to do (repeat the phrase, match something to a picture, etc.), there is a help screen present and the guidebook that comes with the set is also helpful.  I find Japanese is harder to learn than say Spanish or French because there's hardly any similarity to English (except when they borrow English words, like "juice" becomes "juisah")in the words or structure. I think the full immersion method is good because it forces you to use the language. I expect to have a basic knowledge after I finish with everything and to be able to converse on a very elementary level.  However, no matter what method you use, it has to be practiced frequently, with a native speaker.  Just like my friends who went to J-School back then, if you don't use it you lose it. At least my parents speak some Japanese and I know a few other people who do so I can bludgeon them with my efforts but for those who don't have someone to practice with, it makes it difficult.  I know someone who has the Korean version of this and he likes it very much (and he has a Korean wife so he gets a lot of free help!).  Overall, I rate this as a very good package for those who want to learn the language. The lessons are clear and understandable, and flow from one to the other in a sensible and logical way. I would certainly recommend it.	1
I didn't have immediate expectations of being fluent or even conversant in Japanese from using this program (that will be a much longer journey) - so I am rather pleased so far.  I can understand many of the criticisms.  In the near future I will be doing a business trip to Japan - and I wanted to not be totally clueless as to the language.  My limited expectations have been met!  The program installs easily, and activiation is simple for all 3 levels.  I have a long journey ahead of me to make progress, but I think this is a very good first step as a learning tool.	1
First off, I suppose I'll have to start by stating that I initially knew very little about the Japanese language, other than little snippets spoken to me from old Godzilla movies and various anime titles. To an outside viewer any foreign language can seem like a perplexing challenge to take on. It usually requires regiments of classes and years of complex study. When Rosetta Stone advertized itself as being able to teach foreign languages in an easy, concise manner, I was very skeptical. Now that I've spent a few months using this software in the small gaps that open up during my busy schedule, my skepticism has completely dissolved.  While I can't claim to have gained mastery of the Japanese language, I can say that I've learned quite a lot by utilizing this outstanding software. The program allows the user to work with a headset, in which you speak various words and sayings into a microphone. Feedback is given on how well you pronouce these words and compared alongside the audio samples of native speakers. The visual techniques employed by the software is also very effective; the mind is immersed in a catalog of recognizable images that methodically builds up a network of associations and helps to gently increase your powers of memory.  While most study involved in Foreign Languages can be ardous and painful, Rosetta Stone somehow manages to turn the ordeal into a pleasent experience. The program is very user-friendly without being overly patronizing, and it ran very smoothly on my system without any sort of technical problems. I was honestly expecting some sort of technical hiccup due to the complex nature of the programming, but one never presented itself.  But perhaps the greatest aspect of Rosetta Stone is it's casual-though-effective structure to teaching. I found that simply using the program for just an hour a day proved to show progress, with most lessons taking 30 minutes or less to complete. It doesn't force its users to dedicate large portions of their life time in order to make progress. The way the lessons are timed and structured, one could come closer to understanding a foreign language while still maintaining a full and busy life with career, friends, and family.  Overall, I found Rosetta Stone to an effective tool in learning Japanese. I've only had the time to get through level 1 of the course, but I'm already inching my way closer to speaking and writing the alphabets of Japanese, without sacrificing any time from my normal schedule. It is highly recommended to everyone.	1
Rosetta Stone's method is based on a technique called "Dynamic Immersion." You're immediately thrown into the language you want to learn -- there's no English allowed. This sounds daunting, but the software starts you off at such a rudimentary level it isn't intimidating.  Thankfully, the app employs a good variety of interactive methods (matching pictures to sentences, writing caption for photos, hearing words and phrases pronounced correctly by native speakers, etc.) so the "by rote" factor stays low. Rosetta Stone says its techniques are modeled on how native speakers actually learn their own languages, usually while still kids, and I think that's a good description for what the software delivers. You start with words and then move on to phrases, and then with level two you get to conversations. Level three kicks the conversational up a couple of notches. It's a natural progression.  I really like how the program keeps track of what areas I'm botching and pulls me back into those areas for more work. I also like the pronunciation practice via the included headset, although I can't verify it's always catching me when I'm mispronouncing things. To my ear I'm doing OK, but my ear isn't the best, hence my use of this program. If I'm pronouncing things badly and the program isn't always catching my errors, I'm not sure how I'd know, if you see what I mean. (I'm sure I'll find out once I begin practicing on real people.) My hope is that I can nail the rudiments of Japanese and get a good grip on simple conversations using Rosetta Stone before trying to find people to practice with/on, thus keeping my embarrassment factor low.  I think there are people who prefer a more standard "grammar-first" approach because they've found in the past that this is what works for them. I imagine there are also people who don't like looking at computer screens for lengthy periods. These are valid concerns. There are different pedagogical approaches for a reason -- not everyone learns in the same way. My guess is that Rosetta Stone would serve the majority of people very well, especially students who are comfortable with computer-based learning. Ideally, I think this program will work best for people who are studying a language using many "inputs" (text books, audio programs, computer apps, foreign-language media, Akira Kurosawa flicks, native speakers, etc.) All of these things will ultimately reinforce one another. The more immersion, the better.  Overall, I am very pleased with this product. The program's interface is well-designed, I've experienced no bugs or glitches, and I am making progress faster than I thought I would (or at least I think I am). I'd give the app five stars but I cringe just a little bit at the price. I don't think it is overpriced for what you get, mind you, but the cost -- well, it is what it is. There is a demo on the Rosetta Stone Web site that I encourage you to try before buying. It'll give you a good idea how well this program will work for you. If you like the approach, the price for all three levels is well worth it.  Keep in mind that learning any foreign tongue will realistically take a while, especially Japanese. Rosetta Stone shortens the learning period a good deal and makes sticking with the program easier, but it's only a foundation. Still, it's a pretty darn good one.	1
I am working with Rosetta Spanish (Latin American) at the moment and have this one waiting in the wings. From my experience with the Spanish, I can say hands down Rosetta is the best language-learning system I've ever seen, heard about, or used -- period. Pricey, yes, but definitely worth it. I am continually amazed at how quickly I am learning, how much I am learning, and for that matter, how enjoyable the process is. Why didn't I start this years ago????	1
I don't know what I was thinking when I said I'd try this.  Just looking at the user's guide gave me a headache.  I'm sure it's fabulous - this company is known for this type of software - but I chickened out.	1
The product consists of several PC CD-ROMS, audio CD's, headset w/microphone, and instruction manuals.  Installation was fairly straightforward although product activation is required. After installation and activation, we were prompted to configure the speech recognition.  This was easy and it works surprisingly well.  The beginning lessons were concise and easy to understand.  It basically teaches you the words, you repeat them, and the speech recognition guages how well you did. This is a great way to learn because it also teaches pronunciation.  As you progress, it gets more complex and the rules more strict, just like in a class.  The immersion technique is a great approach and the accompanying visuals are great.  My son is currently studying Japanese in high school.  He's had some difficulties along the way, however he finds the lessons in this product pretty easy to follow. This is an excellent study aid for him and is already boosting his confidence for the upcoming school year. Ultimately, the learning potential depends upon the individual.  This won't teach you Japanese overnight, however if you are persistent and serious about learning the language, it would definitly be a beneficial learning aid or supplemental resource for those already studying the language.  I'll update this review at a later time to report long-term results.	1
This is easily the most comprehensive language instruction package I've ever seen. With four separate units, each split into several different sections -- including listening, speaking, vocabulary and grammar -- Rosetta Stone provides hours and hours of easy-to-use instruction in learning to speak and understand Japanese like an expert.  A language package like this requires the user to be a self-starter. There's nobody pushing you to use it or assessing your performance. The lack of feedback might prove challenging for some users. But if you're willing to push yourself, this system really works. (Of course, one advantage to this method is that you're able to move at your own pace.)  Rosetta Stone comes with a high price tag. But if you're serious about learning Japanese, and have the discipline to follow a program on your own, your purchase will be money well spent.	1
Having spent the better part of today with Apple's latest operating system upgrade I can say that the transition to 10.6 was a much smoother process than the jump from Tiger to Leopard.  Today's upgrade installation took a little less than an hour on my 2009 Macbook Pro.  The result?  Subtle changes that definitely don't demand you do this upgrade immediately.  Still, many little annoyances are fixed, and performance has been tuned to the point that this upgrade results in a noticeably 'snappier' operating system.  So far I've encountered none of the catastrophic upgrade gotchyas I experienced when upgrading from Tiger to Leopard two years ago.  It's important to note that there really aren't any major user-facing upgrades with this release.  When your system returns to your control after the upgrade process it will largely look the same -- just polished.  You will notice as you begin navigating through your newly refreshed system that things happen faster.  Less beachballs, fewer pauses, and overall a much more pleasant user experience even with software written for earlier versions of the operating system (just make sure those apps are on the Snow Leopard compatibility list).  The performance improvements are noticeable.  Very noticeable at times.  The real power of this release is going to come later on this year and next as developers begin working with the very important under-the-hood changes that Mac OS X Snow Leopard brings to the Mac platform.  As we saw with Leopard it will take time for the 'snow leopard only' apps to start appearing.  Those who use their Macs to bill by the hour may want to wait until their most important app becomes a 10.6 only version before upgrading.  The snappier feel is great, but the real power of this OS upgrade is yet to come -- and waiting a bit will undoubtedly fix bugs that will be found by us early adopters in the coming weeks.  There are simply no 'must-have' user facing features that have been the hallmark of previous OS X releases.  You can nitpick me on the details but let's face it - your system will be pretty much the same after this installs itself over 10.5.  One other note before I turn this post over to the commenters:  What makes the Mac so great are the users' acceptance of upgrading hardware to meet new software demands.  What ultimately makes Windows such a problem for us enlightened Mac owners is that Windows still needs to run code written 20-30 years ago!  Macs are different.  We're used to buying new hardware to run the latest and greatest.  To that end, those who have not yet jumped over to Intel-based processors are going to be left out in the cold on this release.  It will only install on machines produced after the Intel transition in 2006.	1
The most remarkable thing about Snow Leopard is simply that it can be installed on a Mac running Tiger. You do not need to pay the money to buy the boxed set to upgrade if you never upgraded to Leopard. This means that you can upgrade a Tiger computer to Leopard using this disk. It is up to the user to determine if they have an ethical problem with that; Apple certainly knew that this was possible when they released the software: they understand and use DRM effectively and always have. The fact it is missing here tells me that they are primarily concerned with getting Snow Leopard unto as many computers as possible as fast as possible. I am sure part of that is the desire to have Snow Leopard outperform Windows 7 which debuts in October.  So what do you get with Snow Leopard? The answer is largely performance boosts, although many of those are not really applicable (yet) since few (virtually none) third party applications use the performance gains offered by Snow Leopard. Similar to Windows 7s ability to load share between CPU and GPU, many of the changes in Snow Leopard will take several years for developers to really start to use and write programs for.  Relying on 64-bit architecture through the entire OS, Snow Leopard is essentially an upgrade for the future: as developers write programs that take advantage of the new, higher ceiling, end users like you and I will benefit. For now, most of the performance increases are only applicable to Apple's own software. However, that's not to say these aren't nice or useful, and in some cases very impressive:  1) Opening large photos is faster in preview mode  2) Quicktime uses significantly less CPU on all Macs regardless of generation. Older Macs benefit the most with as much as 40% performance gains.  3) Time Machine backups take about 20% less time  4) Snow Leopard itself installs faster than Leopard  5) Boot times are faster with Snow Leopard by 5-10%; Shut down times are slightly faster as well.  6) File compression is also faster by 10-15%  (These are somewhat simplified. If you want the exact numbers you can find them online: Google "Snow Leopard Performance")  Of all of these, the performance increases afforded to older first generation Macbooks are the most significant. Breathing new life into older hardware isn't easy, especially not significant improvements. Snow Leopard manages to do just that and make even slower 1.6ghz MacBooks that much more useful.  Installation itself is a SNAP (did I mention it takes less time than Leopard?). I've already upgraded a MacBook and MacBook Pro, and installation was simple, fast, and easy. I plan to install Snow Leopard on another older Macbook later in the week and will upgrade this review once I have.  The few new visual tweaks are nice, but not the reason to upgrade. Better stacks is useful, as is the quickness of Finder, but overall I don't find myself blown away by the upgrade. This isn't an entirely new OS with a fantastic array of improvements, aside from the welcome and useful performance increases. That said, if you are a power user or just observant, you WILL NOTICE the speed increase, especially in Finder. I used to prefer Google Desktop search on PCs to Finder, but this upgrade has swayed me to prefer Finder.  *****UPDATE September 2nd 2009*****  A few other changes of minor importance but sometimes great usefulness:  1) Air Port now shows all available wireless networks and their relative signal strength, something Windows has done going back to XP, but that for some strange reason has been absent from OSX 10. X until now. Now when you turn on the Air Port you get a drop down to select which wireless signal you want as well as signal strength.  2) The date has been added to the desktop. This isn't that amazing but it is useful.  3) I am LOVING the way stacks work now. They're so much more intuitive to use and navigate, especially the ability to brows through directories directly from the stack itself.  4) Trash has the ability to restore a file to it's original location right from the trash. This is a feature common to Windows that has been very strangely absent from Mac OS. It's nice to see them catch this omission and correct it, but very odd it took this long to do it.  A MAJOR complaint:  1) Seriously, no support for CS3? Why Apple, why? I don't have the grand to drop on the newest version of CS. This is very, very frustrating, and makes me wish I could take back a star and downgrade this to a 4-star review. CS3 is still so widely used that I'm amazed Apple decided not to offer support for it. If you want to continue to receive support for CS3 or don't have the money to upgrade to CS4, this could be a big deal and even a reason not to upgrade.  A Minor complaint:  1) One of my time machine back-ups for a co-workers Mac was seemingly corrupted by the upgrade. Fortunately they didn't have any old data they needed from that backup so I just made a new one with Snow Leopard that mounts just fine, but this is something to be aware of. If you have a critical time machine backup that you cannot afford to lose, I'd suggest making a backup of the entire drive (clone it) using SuperDuper! or something like it.  *****End of update*****  Snow Leopard will grow in usefulness as time passes. As I said earlier, once third party applications start to be written to take advantage of advancements in the OS, the performance overhead will become more and more useful. Expect to wait 6-12 months for that to happen, but in the mean time at least you're enjoying speedier OS performance for an very inexpensive price!	1
not for me	1
I have been using Snow Leopard on an early 2008 Mac Pro Tower computer for several years now.  It is the BEST, fastest, most dependable, most reliable computing thing I have EVER laid hands on.  MY HISTORY I bought my first Mac in 1993.  Have owned many different models, including an LCIII, G3 Desktop, an eMac, the very first iMac, an iMac G5, a PowerBook G4, this Mac Pro Tower, and I have used Windows computers in offices I have worked in.  I have also helped friends with their Macs and other friends with their Windows computers.  I have also tried later versions of Macintosh Operating Systems including Mountain Lion and Mavericks.  So given my history, I should know something of what I am talking about, and I can guarantee that Snow Leopard is the BEST.  I really liked Tiger a lot, but it doesn't run on Intels.  Leopard was apparently a bloated mess that ran very slow. Versions after Snow Leopard are missing very useful features... But Snow Leopard is a Lean, Clean, Stream Lined, Fast, Powerful, Reliable Beauty with all the features I have ever wanted or needed.  The first two things I noticed MISSING with versions of the Macintosh Operating System after Snow Leopard:  1.  You can no longer simply double click on a folder to see the contents in a new window.  You have to Option Double Click or something.  This is ridiculous.  The ability to EASILY: Create folders, name and rename folders, and organize my stuff into folders by dragging files and folders into other folders... is the NUMBER ONE REASON THAT I HAVE LOVED USING MACS SINCE 1993.  2.  The Show All Bookmarks page is gone from Safari in later Mac OS Versions.  I do NOT use TABs.  I WILL NOT use Tabs.  I REFUSE to use Tabs.  Every time I open Safari in Snow Leopard, my Bookmarks page is right there waiting for me to choose something I refer to all the time.  Most of my Bookmarks are organized into folders all named appropriately, and though I am behind in putting Bookmarks from the New Bookmarks list into the appropriate folders, I can still find what I am looking for very quickly.  But with NO Bookmarks Page in subsequent versions of the Mac OS, it would be IMPOSSIBLE for me to use BOOKMARKS ANY MORE.  3.  I have just read that in the latest version of the Mac OS, there are even MORE things missing that people used all the time, like: a.  No Geotracking in iPhoto, because iPhoto is GONE, and some CHEAP replacement called simply Photo has taken its place. b.  You cannot stop your computer from answering calls to your iPhone, and you cannot stop your phone from getting messages sent to your computer.  Resizing albums in iTunes was also removed last year.  And as a side note, the new Music App for iPhones is completely useless in every way.  I know this is a short list.  There's a lot more things that others are complaining about, but THESE THINGS ARE IMPORTANT TO ME AND OTHERS.  Like I said, I HAVE BEEN A LOYAL MACINTOSH USER SINCE 1993 BECAUSE OF THESE FEATURES.  So APPLE PLEASE RESTORE THESE FEATURES TO THE LATEST OPERATING SYSTEM, OR RESTORE SUPPORT FOR SNOW LEOPARD!  Thank You!!  A very disappointed Apple Fan.	1
Had an old iMac that it was time to pass on.  Needed to keep my Snow Leopard disk for an original MacBook Air that is still hanging in there, but can't use the newer OSx versions.  So I was happy to get this online and to pass along with the iMac.  It's the real deal.  Can't ask for more than that.	1
I was very pleased with this product. It a very accurate representation of the color displayed on the site. Also, it is very difficult to find similar item in a retail store Finally, cam when it was estimated	1
Worked great on my macbook pro, looks good, runs well and stable. Quick and easy to use and worked well when connecting to external displays and projectors. It works well when used with keynote to deliver inspiring presentations and lectures. Found a good book on getting started using mac os&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Mountain-Lion-Macs-Computer-Training/dp/B00C3FLCCK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Mountain Lion Macs (Computer Training)</a>	1
I love the features this offers.  I can sync my itouch with my mac without even docking it.  my calendar, addressbook and email are all automatically updated.  it also updates pictures. it does this all through push technology.  with itouch you have to be in a wifi spot to sync without docking.  with iphone you just have to be where you get service.  also, all information is on web so you can look it up from any computer if you forget your itouch.  had i known about this, i probably would have saved the money on my blackberry and just kept a regular cell phone and then purchased this for my itouch.  blackberry's have lots of problems syncing with macs so i am very excited about this program because i can keep my information with me on my itouch.  i forgot to add that this keeps my multiple mac laptops synced with each other without me having to do anything.  I have used this product for almost a year now.  I purchased it again to renew it as it is cheaper usually to do that through amazon.  One thing to remember is that if you catch it at a good price, you can renew anytime during your membership and it will add another year to your membership--even if you are only 1 day in.  I know some people that bought 5 and have 5 years worth--there doesn't seem to be a limit to how long apple will let you pay in advance.  I think it is worth every penny.  there is usually a 60 day free trial through apple if you want to check it out.	1
Can't beat this.  A fraction of the price but still a full year of membership.  Code worked perfectly fine!  Sealed package.	1
The MobileMe service is useful for several services and features in conjunction with OS X. Buying it from Amazon is a great way to get buy the yearly service and save a few dollars.	1
Not much to review here.  I renew my e-mail and "cloud" subscription every year at Amazon's discounted rate.  Inputting the registration code is a breeze.	1
I love that I can save money on products from Amazon.com Very helpful in this day and age!	1
In my opinion, the main reason for this upgrade was to make money for Apple and its partners that were hurting with the bad economy.  I don't believe the hype about having to sync it with iPads and iPhones. To me, the operating system is now officially junk. For extremely little gain you put up with endless hours of grief typical of older Apple OS problems in the OS 9 days.  I upgraded because Apple was getting rid of "me.com" and replacing it with iCloud, which I could care less about.  Os Lion was required to do that.  Pretty sneaky if you ask me. Of course Lion broke numerous software titles, not the least of which was Passwords Plus which held all my life's passwords.  At this time, that one can't be fixed even with DataViz's import program, which transfers the data to an insecure Excel document (if it had worked). This alone shows the incredible fallibility of putting passwords and bank accounts into computer programs. It's just not safe.  The woman next to me at the Apple store tried to rely on Apples TimeMachine backup to restore her computer, but it failed under Lion.  So nothing is safe around a Lion! I should have known..  Lion also broke Business Card Composer, Photoshop and other critical programs. This of course helps Apple, which charged me to go to iPhoto 11 so it could work with iCloud as well as its partners as I spend hundreds of dollars and numerous hours to upgrade applications that Lion broke. All for what, "gestures?" and other hardly worth it gimmicks?  Apple is definitely a pirate of Silicon Valley.  It pushes around its trapped customers today, just as much as it always has.  Pretty soon we'll have Mountain Lion.  I was perfectly happy with Me.com and my old OS leopard and all my applications. Apple is just another monopoly taking advantage of its trapped audience.  I don't like 'em and now that Jobs is gone, I wouldn't trust Apple, Inc. further than I can throw a stick.  Never trust any  99 cent company.  i.e. $499 vs $500 for an iPad.  Tricky on the outside always means tricky on the inside. Just another dirt-bag corporation.  By the way, the "download only" idea stank to high heaven.  It took forever, crashed and I had to go to the Apple Store to fix it.  I feel for folks that don't have an Apple store nearby that got stuck with that horrendous problem.  This was almost as bad as using AT&T as the iPhone's sole service provider.  What a mess Apple.  Thank you for nothing.  Get a moral bearing and those of us that are not blind lemmings might also learn to like you.	-1
Snow Leopard is a very stable and user friendly system software. I am still using it on my 27" iMac. Many of my clients also still use this system because of its speed and stability.	1
I've been working with Snow Leopard since about November, when I got my first Intel Mac (a white MacBook, rev 5,2), and so far I haven't had a single real complaint with it. I tend to live on the trailing edge, so jumping into Snow Leopard from a world of Jaguar and Panther was a huge change. So far I've not had a major problem.  Snow Leopard looks superficially similar to Leopard, but Apple made enough changes under the hood that it could theoretically be considered v11.0 rather than 10.6. The system uses 64-bit code heavily, although Apple deemed many low-end models unable to run a 64-bit kernel (it seems to have something to do with drivers) and therefore those models use a 32-bit kernel. Frankly, you won't notice the difference unless you're trying to install more that 4GB of memory in those models. The new Cocoa-based Finder is more flexible but still maintains the same basic appearance and functionality that Apple introduced in 10.3.  A lot has changed though, particularly utility programs getting shuffled around, combined, or outright deleted -- pretty much all the AppleScript access has been rolled into Script Editor and Xcode for example. Quicktime Player has been updated with a borderless playback window, though Quicktime 7 is still available as an optional install. Annoyingly, Rosetta is an optional install as well, an obvious cause for frustration for people still running significant amounts of PowerPC code. The developer tools remain as strong a component as ever, which is good because you will want them if you ever want to install anything that isn't available on a CD or as a binary download (a lot of Unix software for example); however, Xcode can seem a cluttered, convoluted mess and you may wish to familiarize yourself with the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/command-line-basics/dp/013937681X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">command line basics</a>&nbsp;for small things like Fink. (In addition, 64-bit app support is a *major* change in the system, and trying to convert older code bases may give you a massive headache.) X11 support hasn't changed significantly since Panther, although your main concern there would be dock clutter from the window server.  An important gotcha: printer drivers. A lot of older printers are not supported by their manufacturers under Snow Leopard, but this is less of a problem than you'd expect -- Apple added the Gutenprint driver package to support a tremendous quantity of printers that have been essentially abandoned by their manufacturers, and I find it to be vastly more stable and effective than the older drivers.  All that said, the worrying trend in operating system distros is that upgrading an in-place system can be an enormous hair-yanker, so back up your data and do a clean install. And I have no experience as of yet running Snow Leopard on non-Apple hardware, though I would imagine you'd be best-served to upgrade a non-Apple box as much as you can afford before trying to install. (Not that I would recommend doing such a thing...) Overall, though, it's a solid system and it's definitely a necessary upgrade for Intel Mac users.	1
Okay - I've read a lot of reviews here and on various tech blogs and mac product sites, and I hear a few common things that I'll confirm or deny in this review.  There's also a must-have bit of performance information at the end, which you might already know about, but it is important - if you read that far and it's helpful, please vote for this review.  My perspective: I use Windows and Macs, both personally and for work.  This is NOT a windows-vs-mac review, it is a "I use a Mac, should I use Snow Leopard" review.  1. "It's not that big of a difference" FALSE. It's not packed with new features, but it is different - those differences will be very noticeable if you're a power user.  Everything is a bit faster.  Just a bit, so non-power users might not notice as much.  However, while it will not speed up your old MacBook by 6000%, it will increase the stability of it, and if you really need a performance boost, you can get that by adding more RAM in addition to upgrading to Snow Leopard.  Why?  64-bit OS means much better memory handling, allowing you to make better use of RAM >4GB.  If you're a power user, going 64-bit and adding a massive heap (8GB or more) of memory is well ... imagine trading up your wardrobe from rough canvas to cashmere. Same feeling.  2. "It's not 64-bit really". FALSE. It's 80% 64 bit even when running in '32 bit mode", which means your kernel extensions are 32 bit and everything else is 64 bit.  If you want it to be all 64-bit, hold '6' and '4' while booting and from then on your in 100% 64-bit land. (holding '3' and '2' gets you back).  The only application that I had that wouldn't run in 64 bit mode was VMWare Fusion, so I ran in 32 bit mode for a while (I need VMWare for work).  However, they've upgraded, and now I'm in 64 bit mode all the time.  3. "I got tens of gigabytes of HD space back!" TRUE. 10.6 handles files differently (mostly by stripping out legacy PPC code) and as a result you'll get a boat-load of free space back. This is important - see the very end of this review for WHY it's important.  4. "It doesn't work with my old copy of XYZ Software from 2006" FALSE Okay, this is probably really true for some apps, but for most, you can get them to work by a) running in 32-bit mode (which is default, by the way), or b) installing Rosetta - which is an optional install but gives you some bonus backwards compatibility.  However, this violates one of the golden rules of computing, which is: DONT UPGRADE YOUR OS IF YOU'RE UNWILLING TO UPGRADE OTHER APPS ALSO.  People who gripe about how Mac OSX no longer supports their antiquated Hypercard application from 1989 make me sad.  Basically, don't believe rumors about compatibility - go to the source and verify it yourself.  For example, based on reviews here, you'd think that CS3 doesn't work. Adobe hasn't tested CS3, but in one adobe blog there's confirmation that Photoshop CS3 works ... [...]  5. "The new dock/expose feature is awesome" TRUE. Need to see it/use it to believe it, but the new dock/expose features really are awesome.  It's not just eye-candy: you click and hold on a dock icon and you get a quick zoom-out to show open windows for that app.  Why is this so great? You're working on a Word document, and need to send it to someone for review.  You (like most modern computer users) have a zillion things open. You draft an email, and then need to attach the document. Where the heck is it?  Go to Word, click-hold on the little document icon in the title bar to select the document without having to go to the finder (which is a great tip in itself), and then drag it down to Mail int he doc.  When expose kicks in, move over to the email you were working on, and in an instant you have the doc attached to your email.  One word: BRILLIANT.  6. "This Feature or Function seems faster" TRUE.  Everything feels snappy in Snow Leopard.  In many cases (many video codecs, anything with high-CPU requirements) it actually is faster. This is due in part to using the your GPU for normal computing tasks.  It's also due to the zillion other refinements made to the core OS .. which is the whole point to Snow Leopard.  7. "I need to run Windows (or VMWare, etc) because of work, so This is irrelevant" FALSE. No, I'm not going to chime in on the mac-vs-pc debate ... but 10.6 does include built-in exchange support. If you own a Mac version of MS Office, chances are that Snow Leopard will let you get your job done without every having to click on a Start bar.  Yes, in some specialized fields there will be applications that you'll need to run that don't have Mac equivalents.  But for most of us, exchange is the only thing holding us back from running a Mac as their primary OS in the workplace.  So why do I need VMWare (as mentioned above)?  Because my office uses an old RICOH all-in-one printer/copier/scanner/fax thingy, and there are no OSX drivers for it (and none of the generic or open source drivers work with it).  So, and this is not a joke, I only use VMWare to print.  I've considered buying myself a cheap printer for my office, but VMWare works well enough that it doesn't bother me.  8. "Snow Leopard is Apple's Vista" FALSE. Again, not to start that debate, but please acknowledge a) that the mac-vs-pc debate exists, b) people feel strongly about it, and c) they will post 1-star reviews claiming things like this in order to... well, I'm not sure why they do it, but they do.  Mac users do it too. Please keep in mind that Snow Leopard is primarily a "refinement" release - aimed at fixing long-standing bugs and inefficiencies in OS X.  If you read a review that mentions Vista, chances are it's from a PC fanboy who has never used a Mac.  Don't take my word for it -- simply judge reviews based on their merit. If there's a real example of why SL is bad, consider it.  If the review says "this was a big mistake, I had to re-install Leopard" with no supporting evidence, I wouldn't give it much credibility.  If someone claims that "SL made my system slow down to a crawl," weigh that against this and a zillion other reviews that confirm apple's claims of a speed improvement.  ... 'nuff said.  9. "It's not worth $[...]" FALSE. If you bought an extra 20+ GB of physical hard drive storage, you'd pay more than thirty bucks for it.  If you're busy, the extra time you'll get back because of stability is worth thirty bucks.  And, now a caveat and the afore mentioned tip:  QuickTime X is awesome, but it lacks 90% of the features of QUickTime 7 "Pro".  If you've never used QUickTime Pro (i.e, if you haven't paid $[...] to Apple for a QT Pro license), this won't concern you.  If you did, you need to be aware that you'll still need QUickTime 7 if you want to cut-and-paste within movies, extract tracks, convert file formats, etc.  Luckily, QT 7 is available as an optional install (and will take your pro license), so it's not a real issue, but it is something the be aware of.  The tip: OS X loves -- nay, it *needs* -- free disk space to operate optimally.  If you're running less that 20% free space, performance will start to degrade.  Now, SL will give you back some of that free space if you're upgrading from previous OS X's, but HDs tend to fill up quickly.  I have SL running on a MacPro and a MacBookPro, and my 'book started to slow down.  Turns out that a combination of downloading the first season of "the Prisoner" and playing Tochlight in a Windows VM caused my drive to fill up rather quickly.  I can't stop playing Torchlight (I can't wait until the Mac version is available, I'll buy it twice its that good), but I got around my iTunes TV addiction by buying an Apple TV ... which offloaded about 80GB of movies and TV shows.  Now things are running fast and clean again. So, if you're seeing a performance slow-down in OS X, whatever version it is, check your free disc space.  HDs (even laptop HDs) are cheap, and could end up being the upgrade of your dreams.  Okay ... maybe the tip wasn't that great, but what do you expect from an amazon review?  :-)	1
No issues installing this on my Intel based iMAC previously running OS X Tiger 10.4.x. Everything I had seemed to still work. My Photoshop still works and my MS Office tools still work. I like the new snappier design and bells that were added. I can't really tell a difference on the speed but I take their word for it. I'm not one to do upgrades just for the heck of it. I could have done without this. There's nothing in Snow Leopard that I really needed so for that reason I give it 4 stars. I'm just glad it didn't break something. So kudo's to the Apple release team. You earn my respect.	1
Once again Apple hits a homerun.  The install took a little while, but when it finished I had an extra 70Gigs of free space on my hard-drive.	1
Happy with this transition.  I did not encounter any installation problem at all.  It took about 30 to 45 minutes.  All my data are intact.  Need to remember that it requires you to have at least 2 gigs of RAM - one thing that I forgot so I have to redo it until my additional memory came in from the mail.  It makes working on apps more snappy.  Additional space is a much appreciated bonus.  It freed up some gigs in my meager 80 gigs of hard drive memory.  One of the most useful features of the latest versions of the Mac OS is Time Machine.  This makes backing up which used to be a painful process a much better experience.  It is also significantly faster than the previous version that came with the OS.  Stacks is fun, but not very useful to me.  The new Quicktime will now allow you to record as well as edit videos which previously available only on the paid version.  You can now make your own tutorial videos as it can record the screen and use an external or built-in microphone.  Moving up from Leopard seems not as big of a difference; but moving up from Tiger...	1
Snow Leopard may look the same as Leopard on the surface, but the more you use it, the more you realize just how comprehensive and powerful an update it is!  From the initial installation, you will notice that your Mac is snappier - and if you look at the space on your hard drive, you'll see that installing Snow Leopard has freed up more than a few gigabytes of space.  As you go about your normal workflow, you'll start to stumble onto things that are just - well - better.  I'll give you one example.  I decided that I wanted to relocate my iTunes Library, but that I didn't want it to take an entire drive.  I have several 1TB externals, and one looked tempting.  But it was formatted with a single partition.  I did a brief search in the Mac help section and was delighted to find that I am no longer stuck with static partitioning on formatted drives. In the past, if I wanted to resize a partition, it was a complicated process, first backing up all data on the drive, then using disk utility to reformat and then partition the drive, and finally copying my data to the new partitions.  With Leopard, all that is consolidated into one step.  In disk utility, I can select the "partition" option, drag the size of my existing partition to release space on the drive (or type in a number to specify exactly how big I want the partition to be!)  Then create a new partition or partitions in the empty space - No loss of data, no reformatting, dead simple.  This is a powerful feature, which used to require third party software to accomplish.  And Snow Leopard is full of such "Aha!" moments.  A great update to an already great OS.	1
Update to below review: I did promise to come back if I found any problems with this product. Some users have experienced reduced battery power (drains faster) after installing it.  I have experienced that but my husband did not.  We are both on macbooks.  My macbook is a year old and his is three years old. I ended up taking my machine into the genius bar.  Apple said iM was not snow leopard.  It said my battery was shot so it gave me a new battery, no charge. my machine has worked like a champ ever since and I still have snow leopard.  This is my original review before the above came to light.  The product remains five stars for me personally.  I am just discovering all the refinements which have gone into Snow Leopard.  However, what I want to comment on is the most important aspect to me.  I came to my Macbook from years of working on PCs.  One good thing PCs did for me was that I became quite a proficient little techie but that was because I was forced to do so.  I lost count of the amount of times I had to reinstall my operating system due to an overall system crash, an Internet Explorer flaw which crashed the whole OS, viruses or trojans or other problems which got past my virus protection software, etc., etc., When I went over to Mac, I was able to retire from being a self taught techie.  I have to do just about zilch on my macbook in order to keep it running well.  I have now used Tiger, Leopard and Snow Leopard.  Each one is an improvement over the last.  There is no bloating factor.  I don't have a bunch of extra software on here which I don't need.  In fact, I picked up about 18 GB of space by switching to Snow Leopard from Leopard.  Snow Leopard is working perfectly for me 24/7 and I have not really had to think about adapting to it.  It is so intuitive that I just find myself doing so automatically.  I always liked the finder and I like it even better now in Snow Leopard.  I've been doing great searches within my folders, getting wonderfully sized images as my thumbnails plus Quick Look is better than ever.  As I set all of my preferences for the whole OS, I discovered that certain things, which were more complicated to do in Leopard, are now simpler to do.  Some specs were removed entirely and macbook just does them quietly on its own in the background, which is fine by me.  I do not miss the hours I spent reading computer manuals as I tried to cope with being a PC user.  After the installation, everything still worked just fine.  I was able to just pick off where I had left off without missing a beat.  I have a David Pogue missing manual book sitting next to me but have yet to open it as I've run into no problems.  Best of all, it was really cheap to buy.  I've never had such a cheap OS yet it is so slick!!!!  It is hard for me to imagine why you would not want Snow Leopard on your Mac.  If I run into such a reason, I will come back and edit this review to include it!	1
Many will comment on the aspect of new features, usefulness, etc.  Being an IT person, I see this as the value of staying on the most current operating system for $24.  You just can't say that you can do that anywhere else. It's cheap and it keeps you current.  If your hardware will support it, I always support staying current as long as there are no large bug or hindrance issues. In this case there are few to no issues, I say, upgrade for cheap!!!  I had no issues with the upgrade, it went fast, and all of my software & settings were just fine after the upgrade.  I rated 4 stars instead of 5 for the reason people argue about-- how many compelling reasons to upgrade exist other than staying current? Still, I recommend the upgrade.	1
Upgraded easily, no technical problems; need to patch upgrade soon after installation to fix bugs.  Overall worth the upgrade price but no great features.	1
"Still the most beautiful and elegant OS out there bar none. Just looking at beautiful box Snow Leopard comes in you already know you won't be disappointed since the attention to all the little details is there. The check out clerk took his time admiring it and commenting on it's beauty before leaving BestBuy too LOL. I'm serious I've never had a checkout clerk actually take time to admire a products packaging before! I also got it for $5 cheaper at BestBuy than buying it direct from Apple. Anyways, when I got it home I installed it on my 2009 macmini and the upgrade when as smooth as butter. It freed up all kinds of diskspace as everyone has been mentioning and everything was noticeably snappier right away. Even the startup and boot times were faster if you can believe that! Also, I was happy to see that my Bootcamp install of Windows still worked and ran fine after the upgrade. I have yet to run into any compatibilty problems with any of my apps or hardware so that is another plus. Only thing I could really complain about is lack of powerpc hardware support but then again if you have a powerpc like my old mac it's probably like 10 years old and no OS upgrade is going to help much LOL. You can still run older powerpc programs though and the first time you try to run them you'll get a popup saying you need Rosetta and it'll automatically be installed. I don't know why it's not just installed by default but then again that's probably how Apple got a clean install of Snow Leopard to be so lean and take up so little space by getting rid of the old stuff. Also, if you boot from the dvd and do try to do a clean install Apple has dumbed down the installer so much that everything is automatic and there is no erase, archive,etc options like in Leopard so you have to manually open up the disc utility from the menu and format if you want a clean install. Finally, Apple changed the way disc space is calculated. Snow Leopard calculates disk space using base 10 measurement now instead of the old base 2 way. So you'll actually see a 500GB hard drive report it's size as 500GB in finder instead of 465GB.  This is definitely and OS for the future so, unless you have a program that you know does work with 10.6, this upgrade is a no-brainer especially at the low price compared to other products like Win7."	1
This is what a desktop operating system should be.  This was a part of of getting to the awesome OSX 10.10 we have now.  Great clean desktop, great user interface, solid speed and security and flawless apps and programs.	1
There's no driver for my multifunction laser printer/scanner: Samsung CLX-3160FN. That makes it a $1400 brick wasting space on my desk.  NOT cool.	-1
Decent upgrade to OSX, but nothing earth-shattering here. Apple has simply cleaned up and streamlined the OS. Due to the cheap price, and the fact that it's good to keep your machine running on the newest OS, it's probably an essential buy.  This is the first time I've loaded a version of OSX since it came out several years ago that I found no single feature that made a difference to me.  Overall, it simply refines the system; it speeds everything up a bit.  It feels like Apple has retooled everything to make it run more smoothly and quickly - freeing up disk space and CPU cycles, all at a cheap price - I have to applaud them for that.	1
Snow Leopard isn't a dramatic improvement over Leopard, but for the price it certainly isn't a bad idea. In addition to what you'll probably read in the other reviews, here are some things I've noticed:  1) It reduces the amount of memory needed for the OS by about 7 GB. Thus, I have an additional 7-8 GB on my hard drive that I can use for pictures and music. This is important for me since I have thousands of photos from my trips, and while I back them up I also like to keep them on my actual hard drive so I can browse through them quickly. This is important too if you're like me and are still using and older laptop with less than 100GB of memory total.  2) Stacks and expose are a lot more useful and easier to use. You can use expose by holding the mouse on any application in the dock. Stacks allows you to go through multiple folders through the stacks window, not just opening the first folder you click. I hadn't used these features much in Leopard, but probably will now in Snow Leopard.  3) QuickTime X is a major upgrade from the free version of QuickTime installed in Leopard. The new version gives you a pretty decent editing capability for film and audio clips. This came at a perfect time for me as I have some movies from a recent trip but did not yet have a good editing program. Now I do.  4) Faster and smoother. I noticed the OS took faster to load up and applications are much faster. I no longer have to wait 5 minutes for Microsoft Word to open. For details on Snow Leopard's performance, check out some of the other reviews.  Overall, Snow Leopard isn't going to revolutionize your computer, but will make it faster, cleaner, and give you more memory - not bad for $30.	1
I hesitated before purchasing Snow Leopard since I know new operating systems can wreck your computing environment, but the Apple OS upgrades have always served me well, so I went for it. The installation took about an hour on my Mac Mini. Perhaps tellingly, at first I could barely distinguish between the old Leopard and the new Snow Leopard. All my settings, dock, programs looked exactly the same; the only difference was the gray-to-lavender top menu bar. Only after using it was I able to begin to see what had changed. NOTE: I currently have this installed on my Mac Mini only. I want to wait several months before converting all my Macs to Snow Leopard.  If you have more than one Mac, get&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Mac-OS-X-Snow-Leopard-Family-Pack-5-User/dp/B001AMPP0W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Mac OS X Snow Leopard Family Pack (5-User)</a>&nbsp;since it's much more cost-effective than buying single versions.  The Good:  -- Start up and shut down is, as promised, faster. Likewise, Safari is much faster than even the newest update installed on Leopard. Most other programs run faster as well. These speed differences are noticeable, so, if you are at all impatient, you might want to upgrade for this alone. -- Microsoft Office 2004 AND 2008 both work as they did before the upgrade. I use these programs frequently, and the fear that they wouldn't be compatible almost steered me away from Snow Leopard -- Time Machine seems to be much more stable in Snow Leopard, and this is perhaps the biggest plus of upgrading. -- Snow Leopard includes X-Code tools for developers. I don't use these, so I can't comment except that they exist. -- Expos&eacute; is a wonderful tool once put in the Dock, although not all users will need or want this access. -- Computers that currently run Tiger can upgrade, thus skipping an entire OS (Leopard). If you haven't used Leopard, you'll notice a huge difference. -- So far, I have not had any compatibility issues with the applications I use. Adobe Photoshop Elements requires the installation of Rosetta, one of the optional elements, but, if you don't download it initially, the computer will prompt you to install.  The Bad:  -- At first, I couldn't install because I didn't have enough space on the hard drive for Snow Leopard because of the presence of Leopard. I had to get rid of some old videos and unwanted photos to make room. Once installed, I had the space available to me again. People who have lots of media on their computers will have a tougher time than those that have less content. -- The difference between Leopard and Snow Leopard are small enough to make this a desirable but not necessary upgrade. The difference is not dramatic -- not at all like the leap between Tiger and Leopard. You'll have to weigh the cost against the benefits. -- The claims of "greater stability" are difficult to test since the original Leopard is pretty darn stable on its own. -- Some early users have reported internet connectivity issues, although I did not have this problem myself.  Because Snow Leopard is not a step backward, I recommend getting it if you plan to keep your current Mac for a while since future tweaks are often dependent on running the latest operating system. Likewise, if you have a Mac purchased just before the release of Snow Leopard, you should take advantage of the ten dollar upgrade before it disappears. Except for those who still run Tiger,other Mac owners will not miss much in this latest OS X.  -- Debbie Lee Wesselmann	1
Visually, for folks who mainly use the Mac for entertainment, this is a minor upgrade--frankly not worth the bother. But for folks who use OSX for its power, speed and reliability this is a very significant step forward. Most importantly, perhaps, is spreading the workload among cores in multi-core hardware and rewriting old workhorses like Finder for 64-bit code (although it still looks much like the Finder of yore). Snopard, at last, is meeting the computing potential of current hardware, and seems CPU-ready for the oft-promised but slow-in-coming powerful software  that could take advantage of multicore hardware. For demanding users, this upgrade is well-placed and well-timed at an amazingly low price point.  Curiously, although BootCamp (for Windows cohabitation) has been upgraded as well - it mentions Vista compatibility - not a word on the forthcoming Windows-7 release - I'd wait till the dust settles on that issue with future updates. The upgrade went smooth as can be (except for a Canon printer needing new driver) and most applications like Apple iWork and the Adobe imaging line just kept on going; applications like Bento are explicitly Snopard-aware  A fabulous upgrade for serious Mac users, scientists, photographers and business people ... but a non-event for media-craving entertainment use.	1
Snow Leopard is the latest OS X version and is an excellent upgrade, given its bargain price.  This is a revamped Leopard and not a totally new operating system, but succeeds at improving on already great features. There are software compatibility problems, so it may pay to wait a month or so before upgrading to avoid the annoyance of non-working software.  The installation couldn't have been more smooth--you basically put in the DVD, hit install, and the OS installs itself.  Unlike every other version of Microsoft Windows, the machine doesn't have to reboot multiple times and Snow Leopard doesn't require any user input until after it reboots into itself.  The OS offers a nice tweak on OS X's usual features.  There are also a lot of 'under the hood' improvements that take full advantage of 64 bit processing and others that make life easier for software developers.  Apple's description above tells you about most of the improvements, so I won't reiterate that here.  The ones that really shine for me in everyday use are the improved 'stacks' features in the dock, incredible improvements in Expose, expanded 'Quick look' capabilities,faster start up, faster backups with time machine, and Microsoft exchange capabilities in Mail.  Overall, the computer seems to work faster.  In particular, video processing in iMovie and iDVD seem to have gained some more speed.  I have a lot of pictures on iPhoto and before Snow Leopard there was a lot of lag when starting iPhoto up.  Now starting iPhoto is much snappier.  As many reviewers have pointed out, there's no 'killer' application here and this is less of a new operating system and more of an upgrade on the existing system.  But the price is right and the features really do make the most pleasant to use OS out there even better.  Alas, all is not wine and roses.  There are now internet lists of compatibility problems with software.  If you want to run older software, you have to install Rosetta (now a separate installation).  My biggest annoyance was Microsoft Office 2008: once I upgraded, none of the components would load.  Uncharacteristically for an Apple, the program just hung in the air and would not respond, necessitating a force quit.  After a couple of days and no Microsoft patches in sight, I canvassed the net.  This was a 'font loading' problem.  What I had to do was verify all the fonts in fontbook and remove the offending ones.  I then had to restore them so that Microsoft Office would print in something other than symbol fonts.  This was not an insurmountable problem, but was the first time in three years of owning a Mac that I had any problems whatsoever. Obviously, Microsoft Office is a third party program and you can't fault Apple completely for compatibility issues.  Even so, lack of Office if you rely on it can make your life miserable. (Kudos to NeoOffice/OpenOffice, their program worked without a hitch.  So did iWork, for the record, but this is an Apple product.) My guess would be that this kind of problem will occur less and less as developers realize that such problems are occurring.  Most problems can be preemptively solved by upgrading all your software before installing Leopard.  The folks at Mac most likely released this OS as a preemptive strike against the onslaught of Microsoft's latest system, Windows 7.  Having played with the Windows 7 release candidate, I don't think that Apple has much to fear.  Windows 7 is a vast improvement over Vista, in my opinion, but it won't win over the OS X faithful.  And given the economy, the vast majority of users and companies will stick to the more ubiquitous Windows systems rather than buying new hardware.  (My guess is that Windows 7 will be competing more with other versions of itself rather than OS X or Linux for market share.)  Even so, Apple probably wanted to keep its cutting-edge image alive.  Snow Leopard is well worth the price of admission.  As above, I would recommend waiting a week or two before installing it so that the 3rd party vendors have time to eliminate the compatibility problems.	1
I can't believe this upgrade isn't getting a solid five star rating!!!  Sure, it took over an hour to install. When I restarted I opened mail and I was prompted for my mail settings (WHATT??).  However, when I hit the "next" prompt the mail started up with all my message intact (whew!).  Okay, so what's so good about Snow Leopard?  First of all, your system will run much faster.  Safari opens faster and text loads quicker when your browsing web pages (although the photos load a little slower it seems).  Mail seems to open faster.  The new "aqua" desktop looks a little nicer (okay, that's worth about $5 to me).  The system shuts down faster.  All in all, for $25, this is a very worthwhile upgrade that will feel like you just upgraded your system to a faster processor.  So, it's worth it. Now everybody, let's get with the program and rate this upgrade five stars!	1
First of all, the real advantages of OSX 10.6 are not additional features (held to a minimum this time) but performance--especially speed and extra gigs of freed-up space.  Read the accompanying description and, without the references to Version 6, you might think you're reading deja vu all over again--all the same prattle you heard about OSX Version 5 --talk about Cover Flow, Expose, colorful panoramic views and three-dimensional perspectives.  And of course the striking photo of the cat with chillblains goes along with the emphasis on the scenic and the exotic, almost reminiscent of Apple's recent promotion of an iTouch as "the funniest [?] iPod ever"--anything to get your attention and lead you to believe that their computers are all fun and games.  But anyone who's used these machines for an extended period knows that for all the conveniences there are exasperating delays and confounding snarls, frozen machines, uncooperative programs and internet sites, and hours of down time, often sufficient to make you wonder if all the consumer technology of the past twenty-five years has saved us any time whatsoever.  But sentiments like the foregoing may be sufficient to justify purchase of this latest edition, or "upgrade."  I couldn't care less about the colorful toys (I never use Cover Flow or mess with a widget)--but it's impossible to ignore the times that you sit for minutes watching the wheel turn without a file opening or a letter being sent.  Those seconds add up, often eating up a day's worth of valuable "living time," time best spent not at a computer screen but out in nature, perhaps trying to catch sight of the real deal (better, I say, catching sight of a feral neighborhood cat in your front yard or, as happened to me the other day, a red fox nonchalantly walking past my house than staring at computer images).  What I've noticed about Version 6 is improved speed.  Internet sites that were formerly loggy, slow and snowbound seem to snap into place with zest and efficiency.  It feels like my iMac has been rejuvenated, been given some Geritol, maybe a testosterone implant.  Now the challenge will be not to load it up with all sorts of buggy software programs (many of which simply haven't caught up with the potentials of the hard-wired gear). I'm beginning to see even Microsoft Word as a cooperative companion for this cat  instead of experiencing the momentary twinge of hesitation preceding use of the slow behemoth.  In fact, thanks to the improved metabolism, it now seems as good a bet as TextEdit for some of those smaller tasks.  I realize that these are highly subjective impressions early in the game, but for twenty-five bucks I don't see how you can NOT make the switch.  It's all about putting that spinning wheel out of its misery and getting your machine to do the work you paid it to do in the first place.	1
A short history of upgrading the OS for MAC. When I upgraded from TIGER to Leopard X, the upgrade that was recommended essentially wiped my hard drive clean so after installation was complete, I had to reinstall my OFFICE for MAC and other programs.  Sometimes history does not repeat itself. Snow Leopard installed fully in approximately one hour. With little effort on my part the installation went flawlessly and no programs (or even icons) were lost in the process.  Once installed, users are not going to notice significant changes. Everything was the same as it was before (my Dock was still on the bottom, even my custom desktop screen was the same).  But when I checked the HD, I got a wonderful shock to discover that Snow Leopard gave me back almost a whopping 7 GB of space! I don't know how APPLE managed to get rid of the bloat without changing anything but Thanks!  Now my three year old Mac Book runs a little bit faster and has a lot more disk space.	1
I have an older macbook so I can't take full advatange of this upgrade, but I still bought it. Why you might ask?  I am always impressed with Apple and when I heard that they had cisco vpn built in along with Microsoft exchange support it was a no brainer for me. I am a Systems Admin and lug my windows laptop to and from work daily because I needed the ability to vpn into the office to support servers after hours. With Snow leopards built in support I can now leave the windows beast at work and use my mac while at home. I did find out that Remote Desktop really isn't supported in the non server level Snow Leopard, at least not that I could find and to get the Mac version would cost a lot. Microsoft however does have a free download for Mac called Remote Desktop for Mac version 2.1 and it works beautifully with the Cisco VPN and Exchange to really bring my ability to provide support to where I always wanted it to be on my mac!  Like I said I don't get full access to all the bells and whistles, but for the reasons I mentioned above it was an easy choice to upgrade. Plus the savings in disk space, speed to start up and shut down and all the other visual enhancements really makes this a winner.  If anyone is aware of an Apple version of RDP that is FREE let me know, I hate to use Microsoft products on my mac but for now that was the only free solution I could find without running a VM and I wasn't about to fork out the big bucks for the Apple version that includes that.  Way to go apple, another solid product and another terrific enhancement. It's nice to see a computer company put out software to make their older hardware run FASTER and not put something out like microsoft does where you need to upgrade to make it work. Redmond better get with it, and the price for Snow Leopard is so affordable.  I will say I did purchase my copy through the Apple store directly and had it shipped to my house on the day it was released. I was sad to see that Amazon was going to take a few days to get it to me but I understand that essentially it was Apple that caused that delay.

I installed the family edition tonight on two laptops, a MacBook and MacBook Pro.  It is immediately obvious the new Finder is worth the price of admission alone.  Finder windows open and close quickly, there's no annoying pauses and hangs.  File copies are dramatically faster; no more need for power users to use a third party tool or drop into Terminal to copy files quickly.  Time Machine backups are indeed faster, my old applications still work fine.  When I opened a PowerPC app that needed Rosetta, Snow Leopard went to the Internet to download Rosetta--no need to dig out a DVD.  My primary applications--Photoshop CS3, Dreamweaver CS3, OmniGraffle Pro, PowerPoint 2008, Word 2008, Flex Builder, Eclipse, FireFox, VMware Fusion--all seem to work just fine.  So I see no reason not to upgrade:  The speed improvements, the painless installation, and most significantly, the much-improved Finder make this a bargain of an upgrade.  And that's ignoring all the cool technologies under the hood (discussed in other reviews) and the small details that have been added (signal strength icons of wireless networks in the AirPort menu, for example).	1
The price of the family pack makes this a no brainer.  You get license to install on 5 computers in the same household for a price less than two individual copies of Snow Leopard.  And the OS itself is fantastic, below is my review of the OS itself:  I installed the family edition tonight on two laptops, a MacBook and MacBook Pro. It is immediately obvious the new Finder is worth the price of admission alone. Finder windows open and close quickly, there's no annoying pauses and hangs.

The most remarkable thing about Snow Leopard is simply that it can be installed on a Mac running Tiger. You do not need to pay the money to buy the boxed set to upgrade if you never upgraded to Leopard. This means that you can upgrade a Tiger computer to Leopard using this disk. It is up to the user to determine if they have an ethical problem with that; Apple certainly knew that this was possible when they released the software: they understand and use DRM effectively and always have. The fact it is missing here tells me that they are primarily concerned with getting Snow Leopard unto as many computers as possible as fast as possible. I am sure part of that is the desire to have Snow Leopard outperform Windows 7 which debuts in October. If you are updating from Leopard, Apple has continued to make it inexpensive for a family using more than one machine by pricing the upgrade at about $10.00 a machine (assuming you use all five). Not bad.  So what do you get with Snow Leopard? The answer is largely performance boosts, although many of those are not really applicable (yet) since few (virtually none) third party applications use the performance gains offered by Snow Leopard. Similar to Windows 7s ability to load share between CPU and GPU, many of the changes in Snow Leopard will take several years for developers to really start to use and write programs for.  Relying on 64-bit architecture through the entire OS, Snow Leopard is essentially an upgrade for the future: as developers write programs that take advantage of the new, higher ceiling, end users like you and I will benefit. For now, most of the performance increases are only applicable to Apple's own software. However, that's not to say these aren't nice or useful, and in some cases very impressive:  1) Opening large photos is faster in preview mode  2) Quicktime uses significantly less CPU on all Macs regardless of generation. Older Macs benefit the most with as much as 40% performance gains.  3) Time Machine backups take about 20% less time  4) Snow Leopard itself installs faster than Leopard  5) Boot times are faster with Snow Leopard by 5-10%; Shut down times are slightly faster as well.  6) File compression is also faster by 10-15%  (These are somewhat simplified. If you want the exact numbers you can find them online: Google "Snow Leopard Performance")  Of all of these, the performance increases afforded to older first generation Macbooks are the most significant. Breathing new life into older hardware isn't easy, especially not significant improvements. Snow Leopard manages to do just that and make even slower 1.6ghz MacBooks that much more useful.  Installation itself is a SNAP (did I mention it takes less time than Leopard?). I've already upgraded a MacBook and MacBook Pro, and installation was simple, fast, and easy. I plan to install Snow Leopard on another older Macbook later in the week and will upgrade this review once I have.  The few new visual tweaks are nice, but not the reason to upgrade. Better stacks is useful, as is the quickness of Finder, but overall I don't find myself blown away by the upgrade. This isn't an entirely new OS with a fantastic array of improvements, aside from the welcome and useful performance increases. That said, if you are a power user or just observant, you WILL NOTICE the speed increase, especially in Finder.  *****UPDATE September 2nd 2009*****  A few other changes of minor importance but sometimes great usefulness:  1) Air Port now shows all available wireless networks and their relative signal strength, something Windows has done going back to XP, but that for some strange reason has been absent from OSX 10. X until now. Now when you turn on the Air Port you get a drop down to select which wireless signal you want as well as signal strength.  2) The date has been added to the desktop. This isn't that amazing but it is useful.  3) I am LOVING the way stacks work now. They're so much more intuitive to use and navigate, especially the ability to brows through directories directly from the stack itself.  4) Trash has the ability to restore a file to it's original location right from the trash. This is a feature common to Windows that has been very strangely absent from Mac OS. It's nice to see them catch this omission and correct it, but very odd it took this long to do it.  A MAJOR complaint:  1) Seriously, no support for CS3? Why Apple, why? I don't have the grand to drop on the newest version of CS. This is very, very frustrating, and makes me wish I could take back a star and downgrade this to a 4-star review. CS3 is still so widely used that I'm amazed Apple decided not to offer support for it. If you want to continue to receive support for CS3 or don't have the money to upgrade to CS4, this could be a big deal and even a reason not to upgrade.  A Minor complaint:  1) One of my time machine back-ups for a co-workers Mac was seemingly corrupted by the upgrade. Fortunately they didn't have any old data they needed from that backup so I just made a new one with Snow Leopard that mounts just fine, but this is something to be aware of. If you have a critical time machine backup that you cannot afford to lose, I'd suggest making a backup of the entire drive (clone it) using SuperDuper! or something like it.  *****End of update*****  Snow Leopard will grow in usefulness as time passes. As I said earlier, once third party applications start to be written to take advantage of advancements in the OS, the performance overhead will become more and more useful. Expect to wait 6-12 months for that to happen, but in the mean time at least you're enjoying speedier OS performance for an very inexpensive price!	1
Amazon has just recently made Snow Leopard even more irresistible by lowering the price of the Family Pack to within range of the already discounted Single-User copy, which I"m now regretting purchasing only because there are more users in the family than me alone.  Don't be misled by much of the the hype accompanying this version--most of it concerns features that were already available on Leopard.  Yes, Expose, Spaces, and Stacks have been tweaked, but some of us never found much use for them in the first place.  The primary reason to upgrade is improved efficiency and speed. Apple has figured out how to reconfigure the OS system to optimize memory, eliminating unnecessary programs (for printers and peripheral items you'd never use), and the result is a snappier, rejuvenated computer experience.  It's not like Apple to make colorful come-ons and computer cosmetics secondary to sheer practicality, but in this case they've attended to the matters that matter most.  If you're an experienced computer-user, you've no doubt become all too sensitive to the time wasted in opening programs and large files, sending mail, multi-tasking (I wish I had a penny for every second I've sat idly in front of the screen while that darn wheel kept spinning around).  If I can save five minutes of non-productive computer time a day, the upgrade is worth several times the current price.  While I'm at it, I'll put in a plug for a nifty new storage drive that is the "iPod" of personal external drives--it's the Seagate Free Agent for Macs, configured to work with Time Machine and complement your desk-top instantly and, if you use the Firewire 800 connection, at twice the speed of all of the USB drives--moreover, it comes with a matching dock and leather carrying case.  After going through Iomega, Western Digital, Cavalry, and Toshiba drives, I can testify that the Free Agent 500 GB for Mac (in white to match the Snow Leopard's habitat) is as cool as they come.	1
"Still the most beautiful and elegant OS out there bar none. Just looking at beautiful box Snow Leopard comes in you already know you won't be disappointed since the attention to all the little details is there. The check out clerk took his time admiring it and commenting on it's beauty before leaving BestBuy too LOL. I'm serious I've never had a checkout clerk actually take time to admire a products packaging before! I also got it for $5 cheaper at BestBuy than buying it direct from Apple. Anyways, when I got it home I installed it on my 2009 macmini and the upgrade when as smooth as butter. It freed up all kinds of diskspace as everyone has been mentioning and everything was noticeably snappier right away. Even the startup and boot times were faster if you can believe that! Also, I was happy to see that my Bootcamp install of Windows still worked and ran fine after the upgrade. I have yet to run into any compatibilty problems with any of my apps or hardware so that is another plus. Only thing I could really complain about is lack of powerpc hardware support but then again if you have a powerpc like my old mac it's probably like 10 years old and no OS upgrade is going to help much LOL. You can still run older powerpc programs though and the first time you try to run them you'll get a popup saying you need Rosetta and it'll automatically be installed. I don't know why it's not just installed by default but then again that's probably how Apple got a clean install of Snow Leopard to be so lean and take up so little space by getting rid of the old stuff. This is definitely and OS for the future so, unless you have a program that you know does work with 10.6, this upgrade is a no-brainer especially at the low price compared to other products like Win7."	1
There is not much of an upgrade to be found here from Tiger...new wallpaper and few more apps that I don't use, other than that everthing is the same.  If you upgraded you mac to this version stay with it as OSX Lion/mountain lion sucks hard.  It leaves all your PPC/Rosetta apps as unuseable question marks with any warning prior to the upgrade due to Apple deciding for it's users that we didn't need it.  Switched back to Windows 7 now 8 due to the backward capability and better functionality, I don't have to be at Apple's mercy any longer to use programs and games I want to use.	-1
Snow Leopard isn't a dramatic improvement over Leopard, but for the price it certainly isn't a bad idea. In addition to what you'll probably read in the other reviews, here are some things I've noticed:  1) It reduces the amount of memory needed for the OS by about 7 GB. Thus, I have an additional 7-8 GB on my hard drive that I can use for pictures and music. This is important for me since I have thousands of photos from my trips, and while I back them up I also like to keep them on my actual hard drive so I can browse through them quickly. This is important too if you're like me and are still using and older laptop with less than 100GB of memory total.  2) Stacks and expose are a lot more useful and easier to use. You can use expose by holding the mouse on any application in the dock. Stacks allows you to go through multiple folders through the stacks window, not just opening the first folder you click. I hadn't used these features much in Leopard, but probably will now in Snow Leopard.  3) QuickTime X is a major upgrade from the free version of QuickTime installed in Leopard. The new version gives you a pretty decent editing capability for film and audio clips. This came at a perfect time for me as I have some movies from a recent trip but did not yet have a good editing program. Now I do.  4) Faster and smoother. I noticed the OS took faster to load up and applications are much faster. I no longer have to wait 5 minutes for Microsoft Word to open. For details on Snow Leopard's performance, check out some of the other reviews.  Overall, Snow Leopard isn't going to revolutionize your computer, but will make it faster, cleaner, and give you more memory - not bad for $30.	1
I hesitated before purchasing Snow Leopard since I know new operating systems can wreck your computing environment, but the Apple OS upgrades have always served me well, so I went for it.  The installation took about an hour on my Mac Mini.  Perhaps tellingly, I couldn't tell right away that my computer was running a different operating system.  All my settings, dock, programs looked exactly the same.  Only after using it was I able to begin to see what had changed.  NOTE:  I currently have this installed on my Mac Mini only.  I want to wait several months before converting all my Macs to Snow Leopard.  The Good:  -- Start up and shut down is, as promised, faster.  Likewise, Safari is much faster than even the newest update installed on Leopard.  Most other programs run faster as well.  These speed differences are noticeable, so, if you are at all impatient, you might want to upgrade for this alone. -- Microsoft Office 2004 AND 2008 both work as they did before the upgrade.  I use these programs frequently, and the fear that they wouldn't be compatible almost steered me away from Snow Leopard -- Time Machine seems to be much more stable in Snow Leopard, and this is perhaps the biggest plus of upgrading. -- Snow Leopard includes X-Code tools for developers.  I don't use these, so I can't comment except that they exist. -- Expos is a wonderful tool once put in the Dock, although not all users will need or want this access. -- Computers that currently run Tiger can upgrade, thus skipping an entire OS (Leopard).  If you haven't used Leopard, you'll notice a huge difference. -- So far, I have not had any compatibility issues with the applications I use.  Adobe Photoshop Elements requires the installation of Rosetta, one of the optional elements, but, if you don't download it initially, the computer will prompt you to install. -- The family pack can be installed on five computers, without having to enter long codes.  If you have two or more Macs, the price per machine is quite reasonable.  The Bad:  -- At first, I couldn't install because I didn't have enough space on the hard drive for Snow Leopard because of the presence of Leopard.  I had to get rid of some old videos and unwanted photos to make room.  Once installed, I had the space available to me again.  People who have lots of media on their computers will have a tougher time than those that have less content. -- The difference between Leopard and Snow Leopard are small enough to make this a desirable but not necessary upgrade.  The difference is not dramatic -- not at all like the leap between Tiger and Leopard.  You'll have to weigh the cost against the benefits. -- The claims of "greater stability" are difficult to test since the original Leopard is pretty darn stable on its own.  Because Snow Leopard is not a step backward, I recommend getting it if you plan to keep your current Mac for a while since future tweaks are often dependent on running the latest operating system.  Likewise, if you have a Mac purchased just before the release of Snow Leopard, you should take advantage of the ten dollar upgrade before it disappears.  Except for those who still run Tiger,other Mac owners will not miss much in this latest OS X.  -- Debbie Lee Wesselmann	1
I tried installing this on three Macs (two iMacs and one MacBook), two regular installations and one clean install. Everything was smooth and perfect for each computer, and the installation process wasn't too long (30 minutes to 1 hr).  There aren't many major new features in this upgrade (which would explain the low price) but this upgrade is still worthwhile in my opinion due to the numerous minor improvements. Granted, there are a few major features (Exchange support if you use Exchange, OpenCL, 64 bit and Grand Central Dispatch for major speed improvements that will get more noticeable in the future, QuickTime X...) and the OS's footprint seems to have shrunk by about 10 GB, but that's besides the point. (If you're thinking about upgrading, by the way, I want to point out that this is just the first release, and you would be fine to wait a few months while certain apps are updated to support Snow Leopard and the OS itself is updated to alleviate the problems a few early upgraders have experienced. I didn't have any problems, but if you're cautious you can wait.)  I am, however, disappointed that the video cards on our Macs (which were bought before Apple started making the really good ones standard) aren't able to take advantage of OpenCL and some of the new high-def video improvements. This is the only thing I really wasn't happy about, but I'm getting enough other speed boosts and little features to still consider this a 5 star OS.  So what did I really like? Spotlight is faster, and I like how it brings up emails and definitions in searches, too. Time Machine is faster, shut down is faster, various things are faster. If you've ever written a document that includes some right-to-left text (like Hebrew) in Leopard you may have noticed some major formatting problems. This has been fixed (as well as right-to-left text searches in Preview) in Snow Leopard. When playing Chess, the computer understands my vocal commands much better. I'm not sure if there's an improvement in speech recognition for other programs though. It still isn't perfect. When I copied in some old fonts into Font Book for the computer I did a clean install on, Font Book was able to automatically note and disable duplicate fonts. Navigating folders in Stacks is now present, so it makes it much easier for me to find everything I want in the dock. I can now play media content in their icons. I can make movie and screencast recordings and trimmings with QuickTime. Printer drivers work great out of the box without the need for me to install them manually. File/drive size is now read in base-10 (rather than base-2 like it used to be and like Windows is) so now when you buy a hard drive that says "500 GB" the OS will say "500 GB" and not "453.4 GB" or whatever it would have otherwise said. Safari is supposedly more crash-proof. It hasn't crashed for me in my light testing, but I'm happy because now I know to open Safari (rather than Firefox) if I want to do something like watch a flash-based movie without my browser crashing on me. I also read that Apple has put some kind of anti-malware thing that checks if you downloaded an infected file. (Not like it needs it, there's almost no malware for OS X.) It currently isn't loaded up with many definitions, but I'm happy that in case someone DOES manage to make a raging Mac virus (which is getting more risky as more and more people use Macs), all Apple would have to do is do a minor update to that file and bring protection as peace of mind and an extra layer of security. And the anti-malware doesn't slow down the Macs at all (unlike certain 3rd party apps).  So all this shows me that Snow Leopard has been really well thought out, so it really makes it a joy to use. For the price, I really think it's worth it to upgrade even if you have Leopard, especially since it will mean that software developers will be making compatible programs/updates for your OS for a couple extra years.	1
I've installed on four computers so far; everything went well on three of them. The fourth had a third-party Firewire 400 card, which made installation impossible. The system would reboot halfway into the upgrade, spitting out the DVD. Nothing would break, but the installation failed without producing any kind of error message. The only solution, ultimately, was to remove the card, run the upgrade, and then re-insert the card.  That done, the software seems to work. My printer (an old Xerox Phaser) is supported, as are my scanners. The driver for one of the scanners crashes when trying to save to a particular format, but the manufacturer has promised a fix and it's anyway easy to work around for now.  I'd call this 4.5 stars if that were an option.	1
Because of nerve damage I have a difficult time typing and thought that this software would be useful.  I purchased a good digital microphone and installed the software.  Setup seemed easy enough and the learning software was reasonable.  I didn't use it much because it seemed to have problems with Microsoft products (though I could buy an upgrade that - in theory - worked better).  A couple weeks later I purchased another piece of software for learning a foreign language and soon neither worked.  I uninstalled the language software and reinstalled the Dragon software and was plagued by a window that was always trying to re initiate the program (never successfully).  Not an uncommon problems I researched it!  If I completely wiped out the program (including deleting the sub-directory and clearing out the registry) the program would work once.  I have Windows 7 64bit, 12 gigs of ram, an i7 chip and 2 terabytes of HD space so hardware should not be a problem.  I gave up on Nuance.  Then the cards and email came from Nuance to buy version 11.  They were worse than the most persistent telemarketer.  I ignored all the cards and mail and then the phone calls came.  Even after I listened to one sales person's entire pitch and told them no repeatedly they STILL called and emails every day.  I rue the day i gave them a valid phone number, email address and home address.  If you do buy this software give them a PO box and not your real phone number!!  How well does the software work?  Not great, but acceptable for someone who has the time and patience to go back over and correct 30%.  The new software claims a MUCH better rate of recognition.  Instead of giving purchasers an update, they chose to soak people by getting them to buy a new package.  I gave them two stars instead of one because for some applications they do work better that typing it all in by hand, but do not be foolish enough to believe that this software will transform how you enter words into your computer.	-1
I wanted to try the Dragon Standard  because when I type my mind wanders and I start loosing my train of thought or get off subject. It works good for me, I don't use all the punctuations and the other aids that you can set up in this program, I just use the basic dictation then punctuate as I proof read and make minor adjustments. This program fits the bill.  When I read through the installation and set up I got worried that it would be complicated. It was not. I used the quick install, I read through the short voice recognition exercises ( which is critical for successful results) and that was it, simple and clean. I am not a computer wiz but it installed easily and worked great.  The important part is making sure your mic is set up in front of your mouth properly. To use the program just open the program, turn on the mic, open up a microsoft page, put the headset that came with the program on, I set up the mic into position then begin a few short test sentences. I move the mic up and down after each sentence until I find the right position whereby it catches all my words accurately, then I am good to go.  To start a new paragraph I just hit enter, I keep it simple and it works just fine.  For the price , simplicity and convenience it worth buying.	1
This program is awful on so many levels...so where to begin? First, I can't get it to work properly on Vista. The program shut down my sound Audio Service quite nicely and then turned it on and off and repeated this until I uninstalled it. The included microphone also didn't work well, and yes, there's a training session. If you have Vista, go with its dictation system; but if you have XP, it may work. It just didn't do substantially better than the version I tried several years ago. Please note: This program is meant to run on XP, and Vista is problematic. After spending close to an hour on the phone with one of the Nuance techies, she recommended that I get a USB sound card adapter, then began reading me the recommended models: Sigma Tel, Sound Max, and Creative Sound Blaster. (All expensive USB cards.) "You have this problem a lot with Vista, don't you," I asked. There was perhaps a 5-second pause and she said, "Yes." Bottom line is this: if your sound card is integrated into the motherboard, and you're using Vista, expect trouble. You can install this program on two machines, and it's activated, which means your system needs to be connected to the Internet to be okayed. Waiting times for tech help are long, so be patient. If you have XP, you have a better chance of this program working if the hardware is fairly new. If your system is more than about a year old, good luck.  I wish I'd never heard of this product.	-1
I have mixed feelings on any voice recognition software.  If I knew how to type properly instead of the hunt and peck method I use I wouldn't have any need for this product.  I don't use it all that often but when I do it comes in incredibly handy. For example I am using this now to dictate this review. I've had to stop twice now to correct a mistake. Some of that could be caused by the fact I have the Moody blues running in the background on my stereo.  I purchased Dragon NaturallySpeaking 10 to replace version 9.  That goes to show how much I like the software.  One of the reasons I wanted to replace version 9 was it was quite buggy.  Sometimes it would crash for no apparent reason, other times the accuracy didn't seem that great.  It also was quite a resource hog, but then again so is version 10.  However I have a pretty good computer with a quad four processor, and three gigs of RAM so it doesn't really pose a problem.  Generally when I'm not using it I shut it off anyway.  I have noticed however that the accuracy and stability is a lot better than version 9. A lot of the quirkiness maybe due to the complexity of the program.  It is a full-featured program albeit with a user-friendly interface. As time goes by I will try tweaking the program a little more.  I cannot comment on the included headset that comes with the software. I am still using my trusty Telex USB headset. I've had this thing for years and it works great so why change.  In conclusion all I can say is I'm happy with the software.  It is very functional, a step up from version 9, and a lifesaver for those that are typing challenged. It does require some effort on the users part, but then again so do most things that are worthwhile.  I would definitely have given it a five star rating if not due to the quirkiness.  In all fairness however a lot of that can be blamed on the operator.  Compared to previous versions it is definitely a five.	1
I needed a security program and wanted something simple and easy to understand and this was both.  I am not a computer geek and I've had limited experience and exposure to other programs.  The only one I've tried before was Norton and I didn't like it, it really dragged my computer down. Make sure you remove any exisiting antivirus/security programs you have on your computer before installing this one.  I really like the vault and the registry cleaner features. One lets you store files in a protected folder and encrypt them and password protect.  The other cleans things up so your computer isn't bogged down.  I thought overall it was pretty basic and easy for the routine user to use. And they had good customer service, which is very important to me, especially when it comes to technical things that often go above my head.	1
I hadn't been aware of BitDefender before being offered the opportunity to review BitDefender Total Security 2009.    I've used Norton and McAfee and fund plenty to criticize in them. Over the past few years, in fact, my impression is that both brands have become bloated and slow.    BitDefender is a pleasant surprise. Installation is fast and the installer is well done.    Funtionally, BitDefender is very smooth. Setup is extremely efficient and the number of intrusive pop-ups is low. Firewall installation is very simple compared to some other packages. BitDefender does an excellent job of recognizing legitimate applications and letting their traffic pass through.    The range of services is impressive, though some of them such as IM Encryption would appear to be of dubious value in the real world.    The BitDefender CD is bootable (it runs under Knoppix Linux, a very dependable distribution) and can be used to "analyze/repair/disinfect" a compromised system.    The feature list of BitDefender Total Security 2009 is long - 22 by BitDefender's count. The important functions seem to be well regarded. BitDefender came out on top in an allegedly independent test of antivirus detection.    It will take me a while to assess the value of AES encrypted storage capabilities (great if it works); a gamer mode that limits security during online gameplay (unlikely something I'll ever use, but very valuable to families with online gamers), local network management (appears to be somewhat limited compared to other products); online backup, privacy protection and so on.    One quality that is high on my list is antivirus scanning speed and overhead. On this one factor, BitDefender is a clear winner. It scans at an impressively high speed and doesn't bog down the system as Norton and McAfee do. On one Norton equipped computer where I have the antivirus scan set for late evening, it often starts while I am still working. Nine times out of ten, I'll shut Norton down because it is such a resource hog.    Not so with BitDefender.    Overall, BitDefender Total Security 2009 is a very impressive package in terms of capabilities and price. If it holds up under continuous use and scrutiny, I can see it (happily) as a replacement for Norton and McAffee, Well worth checking out in your own environment.  Jerry	1
Installation was easy and trouble-free.  However, if you currently have some antivirus software or other similar programs, BitDefender suggests that you delete that program before installing BitDefender or else risk system instability.  I just wish that BitDefender can detect other programs but give you the option to turn the other program off temporarily rather than asking you to delete it before you know whether your installation has been successful with BitDefender.  I haven't played with all of the features but it does look pretty comprehensive.	1
Thank you for the prompt delivery of this product.  It has out performed all the competitive products that I have used over the years and it has a backup routine built in to the product.	1
Bitdefender has a nice assortment of features, but from my experience, this package just wasn't ready for the market. I hardly even had the opportunity to test out the software because it crashed my computer almost immediately after install.  Back to McAfee for me...  I don't love McAfee, but it's better than this.	-1
Just as the name implies, this is a totoal package. I have used it on my desk top and so fat it is doing what it is supposed to do. Protect my computer and keep it fast. The downloading of the software and running it was a breeze. If I run into any problems then I will update this review. recommended.	1
I need to rewrite my review based on what has been said.  BitDefender Total Security 2009 so far has been great for me.  It got rid of viruses that infected one of our computers while it ran McAfee, which I decided to try since it is free from my internet provider.  I tried to clean my computer with McAfee and TrendMicro before I purchased a copy BitDefender 2009 (the virus blocked access to all security web sites so I could not try free copies).  I purchased the copy based on my previous year's experience, where I used a free copy of BitDefender 2008 to clean up my child's computer so that I could install TrendMicro 2008.  I had already paid for TrendMicro 2008, but it could not clean up the computer enough for successful installation.  Secondly, any security software can cause problems.  My employer only buys certain computers and does extensive testing before allowing any software on a computer.  An individual can do that, but its lots of work.  Or an individual can try free evaluations of security software and find one that works.  All security software companies offer free evaluation copies for 15 to 30 days.  Try what you want before purchasing  Thirdly, the problem with update KB954430 is not caused by BitDefender per se (as stated by one reviewer), or is a problem with all security software.  I developed that problem while using McAfee.  Microsoft says the cause is "Different versions of MSXML are included with various Microsoft products, such as Windows, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Office, and Microsoft SQL Server, and some third-party products."  [...] which also has an abbreviated solution and a link to a detailed solution)  Granted, this may be "third party products." I found one reference directly blaming BitDefender while I found many sites blaming Norton.  Last, people need to have reasonable expectations.  I have only seen high quality customer support once on software that costs less than [...] . I contacted BitDefender (which is under $100) once and got a very technical "solution" for a problem that was not even their fault.  For something this inexpensive  that is all I can ask.  I do not expect them to hold my hand.  I feel BitDefender 2009 is the best software to try first since it offers great protection for a great price and relative to other software, except Kapersky, has the best chance of working on your computer.	1
I like this, yet I prefer Spybot S&D which does the same thing yet is free.	1
I'll start off by stating the installation of Bitdefender:  the process went semi-smoothly for installation on my high-performance home server that is on 24 hours and runs largely headless (without a monitor).  The system is an AMD X2-6000 dual-core with 2GB of RAM running under XP Media Center.  The major problem during installation was that the program's firewall was rammed down my throat with no toggle to deactivate it during the install period.  The result was that I was locked out of my own server's network when the install was complete.  I had to manually click on the options by going to my server's mouse and monitor.  Major blunder on part of the software company's installation for this program.  A bunch of typical malware options were made available to me; most were kept on by default.  I choose deactivate quite a few since many of them (i.e. email protection) was not needed as I do not do these activities over the system.  I simply wanted some antivirus protection against trojans that can attach themselves to the system unknowingly.  The menus were relatively straightforward to figure out how to select things without having to refer to another source.  This is as a brief summary appears below the screen when you point your mouse to a selection box.  Nice.  I particularly enjoyed the option of disabling the splashscreens and any update/news notices.  This is important because when my system reboots automatically those kinds of splash screens can screw up my boot process which has a complex set of scripts that are timing-dependent.  CPU usage is a major consideration with any antivirus program so that was a concern to me.  Although my server doesn't max out its cpu use, I have done a lot to minimize electricity consumption of the system.  Wasted cpu cycles increase power requirements so I do not want wasteful software running all the time.  This is particularly an issue as my system processes several dozen files in batches every minute of the day for its tasks.  With active virus scanning enabled, these files are analyzed for viral activity.  When no file activity is conducted, it seems that the antivirus system consumes an average of only 1-2% cpu power.  With active scanning going on during the batch processes that occur, cpu usage climbs up to 6-13% for a few seconds.  This isn't too bad really, and acceptable (so far) to me.  As for updating the definition files, they were pretty quick to download, no complaints there.  The registry key is good for 3 computers for 2 years.  Although some may be dismayed at the 2-year figure, I am quite impressed that the company is honest about this.  Some other company's don't mention it at all and you may think it's an infinite lifetime license, but in reality it doesn't work that way as they will obsolete your license when a major version changes in the software.  Bitdefender deserves credit for their honesty.  Overall, it looks like I'll be keeping this antivirus program on.  I will knock off one point due to the install issues highlighted earlier.  They really need to let the user select the ability to disable the firewall during the install as many will install the software remotely.	1
The Good:  * A wide array of tools and scanners, as well as firewall and virus protection * Gamer Mode/Laptop Mode customizes your experience * Optional online back-up tool * 2-YEARS/3 PCs subscription makes this a great value  The Bad:  * With the in-your-face alerts, it feels clunky at times * File Vault feature is cumbersome  The Bottom Line:  A great protection from BitDefender that is also a great value as you get not one, but 2 YEARS of protection for up to 3 PCs.  While the protection is very powerful, it could feel clunky at times when it warns you something minor needs to be adjusted.  The File Vault feature is a great addition to this suite.  However, it makes you scratch your head at times.  Instead of simple folder drag and drop feature, it insists on making a vault with an assigned letter and size, following by asking which file(s) you want to put in, which makes the whole process feel cumbersome.  However, that does not take away from the fact that the overall protection you get is very powerful.	1
This review can become quite long if I elaborate too much so I'll stick to bullet points to explain my experience with the program.  I was optimistic because this program received high marks from Consumer Reports but they're not known for being as thorough with software as they are with other products.  I gave this program the college try but I found numerous problems and cannot recommend it.  For instance:  1) My DVD/CD player was unable to detect the presence of this program on the provided CD so I needed to download it from their website. 2) During installation, the program asked if I wanted to update everything but the update failed with an error message (future updates worked ok) 3) At random times it would steal focus from whatever I was doing (like typing this review).  I'm not sure but I believe this happens every time it updates. 4) When it scans my system for viruses (2 1/2 hours for a full scan) it doesn't prompt you for action, it simply deletes the file without your input.  The settings can be changed to quarantine the file, but given the number of false positives that come from antivirus scanners, deleting is a horrible default choice and they need to give us the option to skip the file if we know it's safe. 5) Speaking of defaults, it doesn't scan http traffic by default and real-time antivirus and antispyware are not enabled by default.  Not sure why. 6) On the other hand, it doesn't seem to detect what programs are installed in your system as I had Yahoo Messenger scanning enabled by default even though it's not installed.  So far these are just minor annoyances, however, the following leads me to believe there are more systemic problems:  1) In spite of Bitdefender clearly stating it supports my email client (Thunderbird), it rendered it unusable.  When I open Thunderbird, a message pops up saying, "In order to manage spam, it is necessary to select one or more emails."  This box steals focus and prevents you from doing anything else on your computer.  There's a box to check to it wouldn't show this message again, however even when checked the box keeps popping up over and over until you terminate Thunderbird. 2) When running the antispam "wizard" it does not detect either my Thunderbird email folder or my address book and it provided no avenue for me to point out the correct folders.  Since the filter could not be trained, the constant popup boxes rendered Thunderbird unusable and I was prevented from checking my emails. 3) Bitdefender allows no option to pause or disable protection.  In fact, even when these are disabled manually in settings they continue to load in the background.  In other words, even when I tell it not to load antispam (since it didn't work) it would continue to load, generate popup boxes, and render Thunderbird unusable. 4) Bitdefender adds toolbars to your email and web clients and, while they may be useful, they take up an entire row of space for just one icon and they don't allow you to move the icon to a different toolbar. 5) Like others, I was only given 250MB of online backup space as opposed to the 2GB promised on the box. 6) Worst of all, it is impossible to disable Bitdefender from running.  There is a box to check in settings to tell it whether or not to load at startup.  This is ignored and Bitdefender will load regardless of what you want.  Similar problems exist when you try to get web based support.  If you go to chat support, they will not accept any messages longer than 128 characters.  Unfortunately, they don't tell you this beforehand.  Even when you correct this, the support client stops working.  You have to close your web browser and start over from scratch.  I finally jumped through all the hoops and connected to support.  The first time I connected I waited for five minutes with no response.  Eventually I was prompted to leave them an email message.  The second time I connected someone named "Bob" connected.  I explained the problems I was having and he simply left the chat session with no response whatsoever.  Later I receive an email response to my first session saying I need to set up an account before they would respond (I already did this).  In short, I believe this program wasn't tested properly before release and support was not helpful.  There are too many bugs that need to be fixed before I could recommend it to anyone.	-1
I am a recent convert to McAfee's internet security solution and I have recently upgraded from the 2008 version to the 2009 version. I was impressed with the VAST inprovements McAfee has made to their product line to the point that I have found myself recommending their products to people looking for a reasonable solution. With the move to 2009 I was anxious to see what other improvements McAfee has made. There are some updates and improvements, but these seem to be minor.  I have two computers, one of which runs Vista Home Premium and the other runs XP Home. Both were running the 2008 version. On the XP box, the installation was smooth and seamless, and after a reboot all was well. The Vista machine had some issues, though, during the installation of each component, where it would complain about a file that either had an invalid path or that could not be overwritten. I was offered a Retry/Cancel dialog box, and in every case the Retry button worked, but having to click over and over again during installation was annoying. I am assuming it was because it was an upgrade, not a fresh install, though both machines were upgrades. After the Vista install was complete, there were no more headaches.  I was pleased to see that my settings for the 2008 version were retained for the 2009 version.  I noticed something unpleasant between the systems that grabbed my attention, but only because I was looking for differences. The memory usage on the Vista computer is MUCH lower than that on the XP system, for reasons unknown. That said, the performance does not seem to be appreciably different.  On the same note, I have noticed that with the 2009 version installed the XP system ran faster than it did with the 2008 version loaded. The Vista machine's performance seems to be unchanged.  Next I will discuss the firewall, as that seems to be where the majority of noticeable changes have occurred. With the 2008 version, there were several settings for the firewall that could be made with the adjustment of a slider control. These level settings ranged between Off, Trusting, Standard, Tight, Stealth, and Lockdown (or some minor variation there of - I did not write these down before I upgraded). With the 2009 version, these have been replaced with just three slider settings - Automatic, Standard and Stealth. Lockdown is in a different area. The reduced number of options is not necessarily a bad thing, and I suspect it now matches the actual usage patterns that are prevalent in the software's usage. I always set mine to Stealth and saw no reason to change. When I tested the firewall for security, I was unable to locate a test that caused the firewall to fail, and I was pleased that the firewall prevented my computer from responding to any kind of probe or echo requests.  I discovered a curiosity in the firewall's application filters. The filters allow you to set up access rules for any and all applications on your system which is very handy when you have a useful application that you want to keep from accessing the network (such as Acrobat Reader, in my case). After the upgrade several applications in the rule sets that were still loaded on my system were listed as no longer installed. I am not sure what happened there, and I deleted these errant rules. I believe these were probably cosmetic issues, but regardless it was something that drew my attention.  The antivirus seems to be virtually unchanged between the 2008 and 2009 versions. The antivirus is very thorough and stable, doing an excellent job of scanning the system. I discovered a check box in the AV settings, that allows you to specify minimal resource usage during a scan. The information help that comes with it states very clearly that AV scanning is a low-priority background task when this option is taken, and it seems to work very much as advertised. With this option checked, McAfee's AV is absolutely the slowest AV I have ever used (600,000 files in 3.5 hours), but it also is so gentle on system resources that it does not impact anything and you might not know it's running except for the animated scanning icon in the system tray.  The parental controls in McAfee's suite are, in my opinion, nearly useless. If you want to block anything, you have to specify that you want it blocked, so there is no pregenerated list of URLs. Keyword filtering is a more useful aspect of the filter system, yet it still requires some manual entry.  I like the site advisor, which provides some clues as to the safety of the web sites you visit. It does not prevent you from going there, but it does tell you when you have found a potentially harmful site. That says that McAfee is tracking some kind of URL set, yet it does not make the set available to the parental control component which is unfortunate.  The antispam component does a fair job of catagorizing email, though I elected to turn it off because I use a different antispam product. With the standard settings, I find that determination of spam is a little trigger-happy but not unreasonable.  I played with the "Manage Network" component and like the mapping of the network topology. Though it is not something I personally need, it is undoubtedly useful to system administrators who need to see the lay of the land at a quick glance.  With McAfee Internet Security installed on both machines, I have seen no appreciable issues and my systems are well protected. I like the firewall configuration and I really like the fact that the antivirus is so gentle on the system when scanning. The other components in the system - with the exception of the parental controls - are sufficient protection for home and SOHO users, though not all are features I use. I am comfortable recommending this package based on my positive experience with it - it is a fine solution for anyone wishing to protect their system without bringing it to its knees.	1
The install process was easy on Vista Ultimate.  In fact this version of the software uses a really convenient system where you register on their site to activate your software.  This way you don't need to worry about losing your software key.  Some may find that intrusive but I find it useful.  I think most people are familiar with the most basic function a virus/spyware scanner performs.  It looks for pre-defined viruses/spyware and makes sure that you don't download, email or install them.  McAfee has never been at the top of the list of virus detection but it isn't the worst either.  I think perhaps the feature of this version that I like most is the Site Advisor feature (something not found in free scanners).  What this does is pre-scan all the webpages you are going to against a central database and lets you know if virus or spyware problems have been found on those pages.  This is particularly useful for people who are not familiar with more advanced methods for avoiding suspect websites.  However, this feature is somewhat problematic because on two of my older systems it significantly slowed Internet Explorer 7 (though it did not slow down Firefox 3 at all).  Also useful is the Easy Networking tool that is included.  This allows you to see a map of your network and to see the status of the McAfee software on each.  It does not use anything more sophisticated than a Windows Workgroup but it makes it easier to set up and use a home network to share printers and files.  However, I recommend caution setting up a network using this tool if you also have a wireless router.  It may or may not warn you about setting up strong encryption on your router to prevent people from logging on to your home network and viewing your network shares.  Finally I do like the intelligent firewall.  Vista comes with a firewall but it is pretty weak.  This version of McAfee does a decent job of letting you know when bad programs are trying to connect to the internet.  It is also adjustable so you can get a lot of warnings (if you like that) or very few warnings.  Overall I feel pretty good about this software.	1
For years I was a Norton user. Then about 4 years ago I went full bore into the Mac World. As much as I like Mac I find I need a good Windows PC too. So, in spite of all the bad press I bought a Windows Vista machine. I think Vista's great. Anyway, It came with 30 days of McAfee. I did a little research and decided to buy Windows Live OneCare. I am very happy with it. It's made by Microsoft and is very user friendly, more so than McAfee or Norton and it seems to be protecting my two Windows PCs quite well. So, I did use this McAfee for 30 days but consider the MS product superior.	-1
When you find a quality name brand that lives up to the lofty expectations you have as a consumer, you should be loyal to that brand.  For my computer security needs, that name will ALWAYS be McAfee.  This security for my online activities is just what I needed since my computer has been acting strange lately.  I'm afraid some spyware has crept onto my computer and this McAfee Internet Security 2009 software is precisely the answer I've needed.  GET THIS PRODUCT and keep yourself protected from the evildoers!	1
McAfee is a very easy Internet Security package to use.  I have not had any noticeable infiltrations on any of the machines, 1 XP pro laptops 1 XP pro tablet and 1 media PC tower, that it has been installed on.  In the past, I have predominantly used Norton products, but realized that it had a tendency to significantly reduce the performance of all machines I have installed them on.  AV suites are about as much protection as possible, but when my performance is cut almost in half, I had to look for an alternative.  Though I have used many different anti-virus and internet security suites over the years (Kaspersky, Trend Micro, AVG, etc.), for the purposes of this review, I am comparing only McAfee and Norton as I installed McAfee over the Norton installations.  Comparing the two, they have both worked well for me.  The main difference between McAfee and Norton is that McAfee is much more hands off.  Use the installer and the most current package is downloaded and then installed.  Once installed, it does its thing with very little setup or configuration.  Conversely, Norton came with a full version on the cd and after the install it asks to download the latest definitions and updates.  This route of install definitely took longer; and with the prevalence of high speed internet access that isn't that big of a deal --- of course it would be a big deal if you are still on dial up.  Norton also has a lengthy configuration process and while it "learns" your habits, pop ups and config questions constantly come on asking you to proceed, block, allow, accept, etc.  Not a big deal if you are fairly comfortable with computers, but people like my dad that only has basic skills were always afraid of doing the wrong thing so the first month I would always get a call asking me what to do.  In short, I like McAfee.  It works well and is easier to install and live with.  I would like a little more control over specific functions and task, that Norton does, but the ease of use and performance increase is well worth the sacrifice.	1
This is a good easy to use software for your security needs.  McAfee has been a good company over the years and I would recommend this product.	1
I've been running McAfee's anti-virus and anti-spyware software for quite a while now and am satisfied with the product. It does the job it's billed to do without causing any of the slowdown problems that can be a problem when using software of this type.  I elected not to use the other features of this software package -- which include a firewall and anti-spam protection, among other things -- so I can't comment on them.  The software operates efficiently and effectively. It does consume resources, but if you have the latest generation of PC, that shouldn't prove to be a problem.  McAfee's security suite does not seem to me to be substantially different from the similar products offered by Norton and other companies. But this remains a good choice.	1
When computer users were searching for a term to apply to computer programs that came loaded with viruses, harmful DRM (Digital Rights Management) or other insidious ways of slowing down the user's computer, they eventually settled on "Malware."  Its time to coin a new term for programs like McAfee Total Protection. My complaints against the program are only partially related to its ability to filter out viruses and keep a computer free of junk.  The real issue with this program, and many, many others is that it will constantly steal the users focus by popping up text boxes from the Taskbar in Windows. These can come at ANY time the computer is on. They alert the user to the fact that "McAfee has installed updates," or "It is time to restart the computer" to the neverendingly frustrating "Your subscription is about to expire." These boxes can and will pop up while immersed in a full screen computer game, at times causing it to crash. They will pop up when you are working on editing digital photos, or watching a movie, or anything else that requires your full attention.  The term "nagware," came to mind, and maybe it will stick. Feel free to put your suggestions in the comments section of this review.  I understand why they do this. It is intended for novice computer owners who need to be reminded of all of these things, and who don't consider having their 'focus' (the primary task the computer user is working on. For example, as I write this review, it is my primary focus) stolen as EXTREMELY frustrating. That wouldn't even be a big deal, except that McAfee in their infinite wisdom has provided no remedy for the power user. We cannot turn off these irritating messages. They come regardless of my desire to see them or not.  They are amazingly irritating, especially if they disrupt something immersive, like a computer game or movie. Imagine: you are watching your new blue-ray of "The Dark Knight," and just as Batman is about to dispense with the Joker, a text box pops up with the message "McAfee has finished installing updates" in a gray box in the corner of the screen. Unacceptable in the first place, and even more so because you CANNOT TURN THIS FEATURE OFF! This gets unbearable when your subscription is a few months from expiring, and alerts informing you of that pop up literally every time you use the computer. Also, they don't just leave after they pop up, the user is required to click 'ok.' You cannot permanently disable these messages.  As a virus scanner, McAfee works relatively well. It will scan your system for viruses, and if your definitions are up-to-date, find them some of the time. However, it is pretty strange that after making virus software for so many years, they still cannot provide a reasonably well working Spyware hunter that is anywhere near as good as the free version of "Ad-Aware" offered by Lavasoft, or the retail version of "Spybot Search and Destroy."  Another major complaint is the sheer size of the system resource footprint that McAfee total protection takes up. If you have an older computer, less than 2gb of ram (4gb with Vista), this program will create a very noticeable slowdown in your computer's performance. Comparing to how it runs on my wife's laptop with 4gb of ram vs. some of the computers at my work with only 1.5gb, the older work computers are drastically slowed down by McAfee, while my wife's laptop with its 4gb of ram is not really affected. (I do not use this program on my computer for the reasons that I've laid out above).  In concussion, if you don't care about 1. Annoying pop ups that steal your focus and cannot be disabled, 2. Very limited spyware removal and 3. Slow and poorly written code that uses a large portion of system resources, you MIGHT consider buying this software.	-1
WHen it comes to virus protection, users differ in what they want so I'll note that we wanted basic family protection as well as a few bonus features that came in handy.  This exceeded OUR expectations but be sure about what YOU expect. We got:  1. Quick installation and the ability to be used by more than one family member. Simple, easy to use, solid protection.  Bonus features that may or may not be of interest to you:  the ability to rate web sites and rank them. Instant feedback about sites that may be trouble with a capital T, regular updates and parental control modes. You can block ads and other annoyances.  THe bells and whistles? Sure, you can do better but do you really need more?	1
While I did not expect much with McAfee Internet Security 2009 it did, at least, meet my expectations.  As someone that works in the computing industry I know how the consumer level anti-virus packages can be below par and really cause headaches for the end user.  Corporate level packages are much better, but I will get off topic here...  McAfee Internet Security 2009 was decently quick during the installation and updating phases.  It followed the usual steps of uninstalling older software packages and did it with ease, but I'm sure it was just luck in my case.  After the install and updating, I found the menus to be fairly easy to navigate.  However, I personally feel that most anti-virus/internet security packages (McAfee included) offer too many options.  At the end of the day most people just want to know that their PC is protected.  McAfee does a decent job of offering a compromise between simple, straight-forward menus and more complicated options should the user want them.  After a couple weeks of use, Internet Security 2009 has been running smoothly.  I have not noticed too much of a slow down on my system and the software has not been too nagging with pop-ups and warnings.  As for firewalls, it does a good job out of the box without too much hassle and blocking.  Overall, its speed has been above par and resource usage has been relatively low.  Comparing Internet Security 2009 to previous versions, I would certainly recommend it as an upgrade.  Compared to its competition, it's really on par.  It does not offer anything substantial above its competitors, nor does it offer any negatives.  Your previous experience with this brand and the price of the product should be among your deciding factors.  I have used just about all of the consumer level security packages and I tend to stick with a single brand and McAfee is certainly a brand that you can trust.	1
Back when we owned only one computer, McAfee was the internet utility software we used. After my husband became a certified system engineer and our home network grew to rival that of some small companies, McAfee remained the brand we counted on. We still do. This is an excellent suite and a great value for money. In a word -- well, two words -- buy it.	1
You can't go wrong with McAfee! Easy to install, this security system will do the job without slowing your computer down to a crawl like some of the others I've tried. Not comprehensive, but focused instead on those who do a lot of internet surfing.	1
If you're like me, you've spent much time with these consumer-level security software over the past few years.  Chances are that your experiences were not entirely positive. While offering some clear value to us, they normally come preloaded on computers and bombard you with notifications and updates, while draining valuable system resources (I HATE THAT don't you?). As such, these programs have gotten a reputation for being bloated and inefficient, while free antivirus offerings, like AVG and Avast, have proven themselves to be worthy alternatives, at least for core features.  Strengths: Good at scanning for viruses and malware. Tons of features, easy to use.  Report and monitor internet attempts/ Hits on your PC. Pretty bells sounds and graphs.  Weaknesses: Terrible load times and slow to respond. Kept crashing after roughly 9 months of use - customer service was terrible. Can bog down system though not as bad as Norton Internet security suite. Nightmare to update, renew, and if something goes wrong, another nightmare to uninstall. Poor Tech support.  Overall Evaluation: If you can get it to load, and get it to respond (even on a fairly quick computer it took forever), then it's a decent protection package. However, if you really don't know a lot about protection programs or have a very short temper when it comes to computers, I suggest staying away - this package causes headaches and so does customer support.  As owner of my equipment I agree to abide by software protocols. McAfee is different. Once their software GRABS your PC. You cannot escape. Sooner you will delete essential files than remove McAfee from registry.  The software written not to be deleted. Scare?? yup.. I've experienced this FIRST hand.  McAfee has "parasite" my unit so I had to rebuild. Mcafee has unveiled an improved UI, which makes the software easier to use. It seems effective in protecting my machines from harm, but couldn't it do it without bogging down my computers so much?	-1
It couldn't have come at a better time. My old PC-cillin A/V was an older version and I didn't know for sure if it was even downloading the A/V updates or if it could handle the anti-spyware functions of the newer anti-X suites (by X, I mean the generic, anti-virus, anti-malware, anti-whatever).  When McAfee finally arrived, installing from the single disk was simple and easy. Setup was also simple and easy with clearly defined steps along the way. After an installation process that included the necessary step of updating the anti-virus and general anti-malware signatures, I had to sign up for a McAfee account that will ensure I continue getting updates to the software for one year on three (3) different computers.  That's a really nice feature, by the way: you can install this software on three different computers using the same software and the same account.  There are several components to this suite, some of which are really good and some which are quite non-essential and perhaps even useless. The VirusScan is of course necessary as is the Personal Firewall. I'm not so sure about McAfee's SiteAdvisor which gives the web browsing user a validation of particular sites visited--green if it's a safe site, red if it isn't, or at least has been reported as unsafe. SiteAdvisor gets installed on all the browsers installed; for me, it was installed as an add-on to both Firefox and Internet Explorer. I promptly uninstalled these two after a few days as I felt it didn't benefit me one way or the other in exchange for its system resources.  I don't use the Parental Controls nor do I the Easy Network which is supposed to help you connect up computers within a local network to automate secure file and printer sharing. I already have a pretty good network set up using the native Windows tools. Perhaps one day, I'll play around with it, but I don't see the need for learning to use Easy Network right now.  I guess a Backup and Restore tool is or should be a required part of a *security* suite, but again, I have better pieces of software to do that for me so this is yet another part of McAfee's suite that I don't use. From a cursory examination of the tool, it looks easy enough to use.  Now, the anti-logic of anti-virus software is that if it's working well, you don't know if it's working well. Unless you subject your system to a test by actually injecting a virus into it, of course! The first manual scan of my system (thankfully) produced no issues and since then, as it frequently updates itself and runs the automatically scheduled scans, it hasn't found anything untoward. Mostly, I believe that as long as you stay away from the obviously-bad sites and don't download suspicious software, you will continue to stay relatively free of malware.  What I'm really afraid of are the rootkits that seem to be everywhere these days. McAfee's boast is that it will find and kill these. I guess I have no choice other than to take them at their word. The Personal Firewall seems to be doing its job really well--from time to time, it pops up with a notification that a particular program is requesting access to the Internet and gives me the option to allow or disallow that access. Excellent. This is exactly what a firewall should do, and for a personal or home use firewall, a good feature is not to overwhelm the non-technical user with useless information. McAfee does this well.  What's the bad? Well, for some weird reason, from time to time, it turns itself off! Then a balloon pops up to inform me that my system is no longer protected. Just like that.  I've done some initial research, but haven't been able to find out why this happens but it worries me as you can imagine. I'll continue trying to find out what the problem is, and perhaps use their technical support resources which I hope is good. For now, simply clicking to "re-protect" the system turns everything back on to normal.  I like McAfee's product in general, how easy it was to setup and use (weird turning off notwithstanding!); it seems to do the exact job for which I got it and I'm satisfied with that. It has also received high praise from the usual sources that know much more than I do about security issues so I'll give it a three-and-a-half star review. Since there are no half-stars, I'll go up to four.	1
With all the competing products out there, including the free version of AVG, it's tough to justify shelling out this kind of money for anti-virus software. Realizing that, McAfee has loaded this with extra features. My guess is most people will only use a small number of features beyond those that run automatically, but if you have use for the parental controls, data backup, shredder, or other extras, it might be worth getting this all in one package rather than installing several apps from different companies. All in all it's good software, even if the price seems a bit high.	1
If you want to control every 1 and 0 that your computer has to deal with, this program is not it.  It's not the most powerful nor the most comprehensive or trustworhty applicaiton, for that you would want Kasperksy AV/Anti-Hacker, which will let you control every little detail, with power, precision, and reliability (the only catch is it will use up a lot of memory).  However, I must say, that for the average, every day Joe and Jane, this isn't a bad program.  If you want to have a simple, easy to use interface, and as long as you don't prowel around "iffy" web sites, don't download too many untrusted files/sources, and don't open emails from Nigeria, this will do enough to protect you from standard web threats.  Also, Mcafee's AV is probably (comapred to Kasperksy, Norton, Trend-micro) one that uses the least system resources, and hence your computer works well while it is active.	1
The best thing about his program that anyone should want to know is that it works - and more importantly it works efficiently.  Unlike any Norton Product, McAfee Security center doesn't install all over your computer and bog down your system resources like it's ever dwindling competitor. It's humorous that Norton still likes to do a full court press on your operating system just to keep an eye on your computer, the real problem though is that it needs to keep an eye on itself. Too bad it doesn't know where all of it is most of the time. When you go to uninstall it, it likes to orphan large blocks of fully functional bots all over your system to dial home at its own convenience. Thank god I haven't seen or experienced any of this type of bad business from McAfee.  I installed this on two computers which took a total of fifteen minutes. The software adheres to the Bush Doctrine and preemptively does everything from scanning, updating and destroying attackers and known problems. I also set it to automatically tune up and delete old files once a week so I never have to think of the outside world as I get my work done.  A worthy program worth the price and plays nice with Vista sp1.	1
This version of McAfee offers a whole bundle of features, including some cool stuff that isn't on previous versions.  Installation is fast and easy, even though you have to remove your existing anti-virus software, and it doesn't cause application errors or slow down system performance.  The single CD in the package can provide protection for up to three computers for one year, after which you need to shell out for the annual fee at the going rate. Installation also offers the option of installing from the CD provided and then updating from the web after installation is completed or downloading the application from the web and then installing.  It has a simple, user friendly appearance and a choice of two interfaces -basic and advanced.  It should be noted that some of the options are only available to persons logged in as "administrators" and not to the other users on your computer with limited permissions.  If you're the only user you can consider yourself promoted to Administrative level.  "So what does it DO?" enquiring minds want to know. Well, here goes.  1.  It provides a firewall as your computer's first line of defense against identity theft, viruses, spyware, spam, hackers and other bad things that go "bump" in cyberspace.  There's a "lockdown" feature that stops all internet access with one click.  2.  It makes web-surfing safer by rating your search results, as well as the sites you visit, using a color code.  Green = safe; Yellow = caution; Red = get the heck out of there NOW.  (Works with Google, Yahoo! And MSN searches.)  3.  Automatic updates and upgrades  4.  Stops viruses in their tracks, as well as worms, Trojans and other slimy things, and then automatically cleans or quarantines the little boogers.  The QuickScan feature patrols the vulnerable areas of your computer to check for threats.  5.  Offers you a "stealth mode" that blocks incoming network connections so you can lurk on the internet without being detected by hackers.  6.  Blocks spyware, adware, and other bad "wares" from stealing your log-ins and passwords, tracking your cookies, or filling your screen with pop-ups.  7.  Keeps your computer uncluttered with a QuickClean system that takes out the trash, such as temporary files, cached files, lost file fragments, deleted e-mail messages and other undesirable junk.  8.  It includes a "Shredder" for permanently deleting top secret documents such as love letters or romantic poems penned under the influence.  To make it even cooler, there are three different shredding levels.  9.  Automatically recognizes spam, phish and scams, fake virus messages and all that weird foreign language stuff, and stops it from filling your in-box  10.  Provides different levels of blocking depending on the age or maturity level of your child.  It has easy to understand settings like "young child", "child", "younger teen", "older teen" or "adult".  Age appropriate searching makes sure that the safety filters of some popular search engines are enabled. It uses keyword filtering and even blocks offensive images.  11.  Provides an automatic back-up feature which requires the installation of Microsoft.net Framework 1.1  12.  Tactfully defers certain updates and alerts while you're watching movies or playing games in full-screen mode to prevent interruptions.  Recommended for PCs and small networks, families with internet-savvy kids and people who like to go into sites marked with 3 X's.  Amanda Richards, October 15, 2008	1
If there is one reason why I like this product, it is the simplistic rating that they provide to each and every website even before you visit that website.  Let us say for example that you visit [...] and search for 'LCD HDTV' - google comes back with thousand of results - we all know that some of these sites are genuine and some of them are just spam sites which are there just to introduce virus into our computer and hack information from us.  McAfee does a good job of highlighting each of the google results links with a easy to see marking if that site is safe to visit - this will result in avoiding a lot of bad websites and harm to our computeers.  There are a couple of other good things about McAfee:   * Comprehensive protection - McAfee protects not just against viruses, but also against Spamware   * On access scan - This is something which you will hate as well as equally like :  The Antivirus will always keep running in the background and scan each and every website you visit, each and every program you run.  This will slow down things a little bit, but the protection is comprehensive.    I have noticed that McShield much faster than Symantic in On-Access scanning   * Easy to share : A 3-user license is very easy to share, you get to create an online account with McAfee with which you can download the latest version of antivirus on any computer and install it	1
In the beginning there were not many choices in computer virus protection, but that changed throughout the years and the market is now flooded to the point where the general consumer does not know what to purchase.  Enter McAfee -- one of the first virus protections on the market and arguably still the best.  To test out McAfee Internet Security 2009. I knowingly infected a test machine with a minor trojan virus. I then went ahead and and installed a free virus cleaner that did not detect it. I then went ahead and installed McAfee which picked it up right away and cleaned it up.  McAfee has been a name synonymous with quality for quite some time now, and in 2009 it does it again. CPU and processor speed does not spike as with some virus software and you will know your computer is safe ans sound.	1
Right now, there are a pleethora of options for internet security on the market. Of course there are the big hitters, Microsoft, McAfee and Norton's to name a few. With so many options out there, the normal end user can be left feeling a little shell-shocked and usure of just what to get.  If you are anything like me the first thing you do is turn the box over and look for 'the grid'. The grid tells you what is covered by that particular set-up and what is not. Usually this is just a sly way of trying to get you to buy the more expensive version that covers everything. The problem with that is, end users like myself don't always need the 'everything' option. Sometimes the simple version is better. The less options I have the less likely I am to screw something up, right?  I will spare you all the tech talk, because a) others have done it a lot better than I ever could, and b) I would probably screw it up anyway.  I have been a Norton's user for years. I had fallen into a rut of purchasingt he latest addition and just accepting the drawbacks because I didn't want to deal with the hassle switching things over. Well, this issue of Norton's has made that a lot harder. It's simplistic, intuitive, and makes sense, but more importantly it doesn't require a lot from me. So, that really means less for me to screw up.  Two things I am disapointed about.  1 - no instruction manual. Give me something, anything to read and reference when I get these pop-up messages. I want to make informed decisions. I am not always able to do that.  2 - I loathe when a company makes you pay to talk to tech suppor. The minimum call is $9.99. So, at a minimum if you call you are dropping ten bucks. Not cool. If I am a customer, they should be looking to help me get the most out of the product, not the most out of my wallet.  If you are looking for a new internet security program, or are looking to upgrade take a look at this one. Don't settle for the first thing you see. Do some research and find the product that meets what you want. There are too many options out there right now to settle for what the product offers. Make it work for you.	1
I  have used mcafee on and off over the years seems that free avg stuff might seem good free always is. However Mcafee is alot better choice it isn't all that expensive to renew or nothing either. My computer seems to run alot smoother now that I have this one it doesn't seem to be as laggy as it was. I happen to appreciate the anti spam thing specially using outlook express. I was getting so tired of those nigerian emails saying I won this and that haha I wish it could of helped pay for my wii , ps3 and my future xbox 360 and hdtv lol.  Anyhow  This is great if offers so many products in one package be it the anti virus, the anti spam ,firewall etc. I appreciate having this on my computer keeping me and my family safe and my computer free of trouble makers and pests. It really does seem to run alot smoother, faster, not as laggy and I do have a older computer with xp still. I will probably always be a Mcafee user no doubt bout that. They put out very good products and I intend to buy them every year or renew them. I will be recommending their products to friends and family from now on.	1
I've used Norton and AVG before trying this program, and I prefer this one. Testing security software reminds me of the old joke about snapping your fingers to keep away tigers ("Does it work?" "You don't see any tigers, do you?"). An engineer friend suggested that I install it on one of my extra computers and intentionally infect it. Lacking numerous extra computers or easy access to computer viruses, I had to content myself with installing it on the older of my home computers. It was simple to install. It immediately identified problems with some of my kids' downloaded music, which previous security software had failed to catch, and it healed the problems. I've had two complaints about previous security software I've tried. First, they give scary announcements of problems and then sigh that they can't fix it. Second, when they run their scans and updates, they slow down the machine enormously. Since I work online, this matters to me. Neither of these problems has arisen with with McAfee.	1
Installation time ( downloading from internet with DSL ) took about 30 minutes (including a couple reboots, as required.)  Takes up more memory in the background than previous version did. (Previous version used 46K, new version uses about 54K.) Didn't have to "uninstall" previous version- it did that for me, automatically.  Haven't seen anything new or unusual about this version that is much different from previous, yet.    As usual with McAfee, it puts green circles with check-marks next to internet sites it has tested that are "safe," yellow and red circles next to ones that it hasn't checked, or are probably not safe.    Allows you to set up parental controls for websites, based on the scanned content. Hasn't locked up my web browsers yet, so all appears to be working as advertised.	1
Installation was simple. During the setup you can configure settings for home network, firewall, and parental control. Choices are clear and you can change your selections later if you decide. You also get the opportunity to decide between simple and advanced interfaces. The advanced interface offers more configuration options which will likely be needed later if you plan to utilize the full features.  Updating took a little while when I installed from disk. It also required several reboots.  You can save initial setup time by downloading the latest version from Bitdefender's web site and using the key provided with purchased copy. The program offered the option to scan for viruses after install.  Scanning was pretty quick.  Deep scan took 1/2 hour,quick scan took 7 1/2 minutes. Detailed log files are created of the results. System impact seems minimal with real-time scanning enabled.  There is also a laptop/gaming mode that will further reduce background processes and resource consumption when gaming or on a laptop. The firewall seemed a little paranoid initially as I received pop-up firewall warnings the first time I started my web browser and any web dependent programs.  I had to grant access for a component of IE and Maplestory, however Unreal Tournament and iTunes were automatically configured.  Casual users might be intimidated by some of the initial warnings, especially if they have to choose whether or not to grant access.  However, a glance at the warning box can usually determine if the program is legitimate or not. I also received pop-up warnings when attempting to install a program from CD-ROM.  There is no easy way to temporarily disable real-time protection for software installations or other tasks that the AV might interfere with.  There's no right-click option to pause or disable from the taskbar icon.  Even after opening the program and manually disabling all protection options, the program still appeared to be running in the background.  Parental controls were not very reliable initially.  Despite selecting the Teenager setting during setup, I was still able to access inappropriate sites.  After fiddling with the settings, I discovered I had to set it to Heuristic mode to automatically block inappropriate sites. Once I did this, inappropriate sites were blocked, however, I was also unable to reach some safe sites that had advertising.  I added a site to the white list, however it continued to block links within the site.  I eventually disabled the Heuristic mode out of frustration.  I felt it was too much of an all or nothing approach.  The phishing filter seems on par with most of the others out there.  Overall, although I feel the predefined rules for the firewall and parental controls could be better, the program is otherwise solid and offers extensive options to fine-tune protection.  They may want to tweak the parental control in future updates as I honestly doubt a user would be patient enough to manually add sites and the links within to the white list on a frequent basis.	1
Unlike other anti virus software I'd been using, Bitdefender Internet Security updates hourly as opposed to two to four days. It also has settings protection and vulnerability scan which my other programs both did not have. As did the other programs, it also has parental controls for households with children.  I didn't encounter much difficulty during installation, though I did need to uninstall my previous anti virus program.  Because it is superior to the program I had been using, I am very satisfied and happy with the  many functions of this software program.  I recommend Bitdefender Internet Security with no hesitation.	1
Bitdefender works really well on both vista and xp machines, and I really like the clean interface and the fact that it runs pretty low key in the background without excessive popups requiring user responses and it doesn't drag down system resources.  It installs flawlessly, and even will uninstall other antivirus software in case you forgot to do this yourself, which I thought was a really nice touch.  My main criteria for security software is that it needs to run quietly in the background and not hog resources or cause other system issues - which McAfee Antivirus and Norton Internet Security can't seem to figure out how to do.  Before this I used to use Trend Micro PC-Cillen exclusively because it used very little system resource compared to the others, until their latest version which suddenly ballooned into huge resource hog - I don't know if they've fixed that yet or not, I haven't gone back to it since.   Bitdefender seems to have none of the problems that plague other security software, and I would switch to it exclusively, except on my main PC's I am sticking with Windows Live Onecare, which does the best job of integrating seemlessly into the OS (naturally, since it is Microsoft).   As far as which is better at stopping viruses and malware, I can't really say, since I am a low risk user and rarely am threatened with viruses and have never accidentally downloaded malware.  I suspect Bitdefender would out perform Windows Live Onecare on this score, which is why I would definitely recommend it to any who doesn't practice safe surfing.   All in all, it's a very comprehensive security package at a great price and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to friends and family.	1
If you have lots of time on your hands and need a new hobby, this package is for you.  Bitdefender used to be a top line product.  Not anymore.  After you buy the product, before it installs, there is a 25 mb download of the "latest" version.  Then after you install, it needs to download another 15 mb "update".  When the install doesn't work, as it didn't THREE times for me on a vanilla Windows XP machine, you have to go through the whole routine again.  And again.  And again.  The biggest problem is that there is no system tray icon to let you know that the program is actually working.  I happened to open the program from the desktop icon recently, and discovered that the real time protection had been shut down at some unknown time in the past.  With no notice that I was running unprotected. This is simply unacceptable.  When I tried to get tech support, their plan was for me to spend an hour or so collecting some huge data files to send to them.  As if that would explain the tray icon problem.  More wasted time.  Then there are the scans.  My machine has less than 12 gb total in files, on a 10,000 RPM WD Raptor SATA hard disk.  It takes Bitdefender over an hour to scan, and it wants to do this frequently.  Slow, slow, slow.  I suggest that you do what I'm doing, and try something else.	-1
I have tried all the antivirus programs, and like none of them. Bitdefender has faults, but is by far the best program.  However, you can do almost as well using: AVG antivirus, Spybot and Malaware.  Good aspects: does not slow the computer, comprehensive security. Bad aspects: non-existent customer service, slow scanning,vulnerability scan is poor, interface is non-intuitive.  I give Bitdefender a buy rating, but I admit that it is imperfect. Other programs are much worse	1
The software offers good, basic protection for the PC.  It is a little slow compared to similar products.  It automatically scans devices you plug in, which is a definite plus.  The software is pretty straightforward and easy to use.  The product seems to be a good value for the money.	1
For the price, Bitdefender's Internet Security 2009 (Family Edition) is bargain priced.  First, customers can run the program on three computers. Second, the program can be used for two years without additional costs, while it has all the features of the more costly Norton Internet Security.  It does lack some desirable features of Norton 360, Version 2.0.  But Norton 360 is more costly and subscription must be renewed every year.  If you want more features like Tune-up, Back-up, or Online Back-up, Bitdefender offers another similar program called Total Security 2009.  It has all the features of Norton 360, Version 2, and it also sells with a two year subscription.  I have installed and used Internet Security 2009 on Windows XP for almost two months without any problem. In fact, my computers seem to run a little faster than they did when using Norton 360 - for all Norton's claims of tuning up the P.C. and optimizing its performance. Additionally, Bitdefender's Internet Security 2009 runs without annoyingly drawing as much attention to itself as does Norton 360.  I'm permitted to update this review, and I will if I experience any problems.  Until then, I can only say that Bitdefender's Internet Security 2009 is a good program and a really good buy.  12/19/09 UPDATE: After using this program for about three months I took it off to install Kaspersky Internet Security 2010.  After the install and update, I ran a full scan and found a missed virus on one computer, a network threat and a privacy threat on a second computer.  This is not good, but it could be worse.  Neither the virus or the other missed threats caused me any harm.  And Kaspersky Internet Security 2010 is an incredable improvement over anything they have ever produced - possibly better than anything on store shelves.  If I could I would change this review rating to 4 stars.	1
Not bad at all. I'd stress tested this for 7 weeks now. Two things got by it, Root.v6 and SELOP.W32 which aren't even in the wild. Upon updating, it found BOTH of them, but had trouble with quarantine. I was able to manually delete from Windows backup and the sys32 folder without hassle.  Updates were smooth and not like the other "popular" types that are just bloatware with infrequent updates.  I'm NOD32-biased, but I was impressed.	1
My Computer: Vista Home, 2.6 ghz Intel pentium IV, 1.5 GB of ram, as you can see very old (6 years).  I'm going to try be as unbiased as possible when doing this review, so I will try to curb my praises for the meritorious Bit Defender program. Yes, I admit I have used this program in the past, so please don't hold it against me because I loved it then, and sorry, I still do. Now for the past 3 years, though, I have been using McAfee, so that is what I can compare it to, and have not used any other program.  Contrary to other peoples' posts on here about the product being a pain to install, I encountered no such thing. You place the CD in the tray, and it uses a website like installation progression. You are shown 10 steps that you have to go through in order to complete registration, you click next after each one and that is that. I had to install one update and restart only once. After that, it is ready to use. No more than 10 minutes I promise.  This software boasts the highest detection rate of all security programs with a 98% detection rate and updates hourly. Whether that's an annoyance or assurance, that is for you to decide. I felt the Bit Defender program take about the same amount of "taxing" on internet browsing as McAfee, for the fact it scans everything you look at, which is a part of an option you can turn off, to further elevate your assurance of their protection credentials. The plus side is that, it does not tax my SYSTEM physical performance at all, compared to the very sluggish program offered by McAfee.  The overall interface of the program is very sleek, very easy to read and all encompassing. You have 2 options with the interface, you can either show the Beginner or Advanced interface, which are both exceptional. The beginner has un-implicit titles to search through and the advanced is the polar opposite, both meeting needs for everyone. My history with this program and using the new one meet the same end. This program is the best anti everything. I have never gotten a virus/spyware in my computer when this program in use, something that McAfee can't say. And I don't want to wait years for this program to allow me to obtain one, so I'm going with what I know.  Now here are your quick positives: 1. 98% detection rate of virus/spyware according to av-test.org, the best out of all programs including, McAfee with 86%, Norton with 96% and Trend Micro with 95% 2. Doesn't use a lot of system resources. From my experiences, it slows down internet browsing much as the same as McAfee, BUT it is an option you can turn down or turn off. McAfee, also, really bogs down my systems physical performance, where Bit Defender does not. 3. Easy to manage options and interface, being able to switch between the novice and advanced views. 4. Anti-Phising, Anti-Root kit, Gamer Mode, Laptop Mode (power conservation), Excellent Firewall. 5. I almost forgot the omniscient scan itself! I have a 300gb Harddrive with 180GB of space used for data, the scan took under an Hour! I could also use other programs pretty comfortably while the scan was being conducted too. Not to mention my computer is 6 years old! McAfee took well over 3 hours. 6. Parental Controls, limiting a person on the internet, from material to time limits 7. Networking and accessing shared computers. With other computers around your network that has the same Bit Defender on it, you can set up access to the computers with the Users permission. This is handy for Corporate/Business offices  You know, as of now there are no negatives, I never had any negatives with this product. And it seems like I never will at this rate. I would consider myself an advanced user and this program does it all. The price is right, the product is right, and I love this security software.	1
You get the idea early on that this is the best, most robust solution that you have ever put on your computer. So many options, wizards, choices, and levels of protection, how could you not feel safe?  How? Well let me answer that. Try calling support and asking a question. I think you would get more help by cosulting the Tarot, holding a seance, rolling dice, or randomly guessing.  I can't fathom that with the budget their Department of Menu Choices was obviously alloted, that instead of a tech support department they should rather invest in a "Department of Deliberate Obfuscation"  If you feel any urge in your body to purchase this product, save yourself some time, and give yourself immediate frustration instead. Staple your foot to the floor, apply to be a mail carrier, or cue up at the local taco stand 10 minutes after the bars close.  Cheers!	1
As a former user of Norton & McAfee I am really happy with Bitdefender so far.  I don't get bugged all the time with updates and scan progress windows with this software.  It seems to be doing its job nicely in the background, like a waiter that just keeps quiet. Since the switch from McAfee I have noticed that pages are quicker to load.  I thought my internet speed was the problem but obviously that is not the case since I've seen such a difference just by switching the program.  It was also simple to load.  My husband is my "tech support" but I was able to take care of this in less than 10 mins from box to completion.	1
I have Trend Micro's Internet Security on one computer at home and BitDefender on another.  I have to declare myself thoroughly delighted with both of them.  The BitDefender gives perhaps a slightly better bargain for the buck, partly because it offers very slightly larger features and partly because it provides a year year license while the Trend Micro provides only one.  In fact, comparing the BitDefender with all other security programs, it just might be the best bargain.  The one thing that I don't like about the BitDefender as opposed to the Trend Micro equivalent is that my computer seems to drag a bit downloading some pages compared to the one with Trend Micro.  This might be attributable to the computers.  Some antivirus programs I've used really slow the computer down and make looking at pages on the Internet a drag.  If BitDefender slows down my computer more than Trend Micro does, it is only by the slightest of margins.  If you are looking for a very fine internet security program I can definitely recommend this one.  If I were in the market, the two year license would probably be the difference maker for me.  I definitely recommend the product.	1
Bitdefender has been a popular brand name for internet security for a long time, and this is a TWO-YEAR license for up to 3 separate PCs.  Really a great value!	1
UPDATE: The subscription suddenly expired about a year and a half prematurely, and technical support has proven to be unhelpful. I withdraw any recommendation for this product on that basis. I will have to uninstall and purchase and install a new antivirus software. ________ Old review: I have run only Norton antivirus products for the past 14 years, so I was hesitant but excited to compare Bitdefender when given the opportunity. My grandparents' computer was the perfect test subject. Comparisons are with Norton Internet Security 2008 which was previously loaded on the computer:  Bit defender installed easily without any problems, unlike many other reviewers' experiences. Make sure you have completely uninstalled all other antivirus software packages before installing bitdefender in order to avoid problems.  The program make little or no noticeable impact that I can discern on the speed of the computer while running in the background. However, I did not really have any issues with speed running Norton either. The complete scan seems to take longer than Norton to run.  Bitdefender seems to be a little easier for to customize, which is saying a lot since I am obviously familiar with Symantec configurations and was able to customize bitdefender's options with ease; very intuitive. If you have no desire or ability to autoconfigure; the default settings are load without asking a lot of confusion questions and seem to be appropriate for the average user.  The ultimate test for an Antivirus/firewall package is whether or not it protects against viruses and doesn't misidentify things that aren't viruses. I have never had a virus on any computer that I have had running an up-to-date Symantec product. It's hard to judge Bitdefender on this criteria by simply installing it. However, as I look at independent laboratory's assessments of the product, it fails to get 100% marks that characterize most of the other major Internet Security/Antivirus packages, whereas Symantec products regularly get 100% of viruses facing it. Generally, Bitdefender failed by misidentifying things as viruses which were not in the tests that I read.  Based on the laboratory tests and my past success with Symantec, I will be keeping Norton on my personal computers but will probably recommend Bitdefender as a low-cost alternative for family members who are at low virus risk.	1
Well, this version have something the new versions don't have, with photosnap, one of the goodies of version 9, I can manipulated the photos very easily anyway I want. I did had version 11 and since I could not manipulated the photos I took it off my computer.	1
Back in the early days of CD mastering software, Adaptec Easy CD Creator (now Roxio) was the only real player in town.  Then came Nero, which was light, swift, and powerful.  For those in the know, Nero was the choice application for CD mastering, and later for DVDs.  When I upgraded to Windows 7, I had a few applications that were no longer supported.  Nero 6.x and PowerDVD 5.x were two that I missed most.  When I saw a tremendous deal for Nero 9 Reloaded (free after rebate), I jumped at the chance to use Nero again.  I was excited to see the changes and improvements from 4 major updates (9 and 9 Reloaded are counted as 1 update each).  Despite all the negative reviews, I thought surely it couldn't be that bad.  Right?  PROS: - Familiar interface - Good burning performance - Many multimedia features & tools  CONS: - Excruciatingly slow install - Slow startup speeds for every app - Too many below average apps - Shameful forced install of Ask.com toolbar - Updates are not integrated or easy - Very poor value - Many apps outperformed by free or open source apps  For the sake of reviewing Nero 9 Reloaded, I chose to install all the applications in the suite.  This amounted to 2.98GB of space required.  I knew I'd uninstall most of the applications but wanted to be thorough.  Nero Burning ROM is 324MB by itself.  At the end of my evaluation, I nearly had to uninstall everything.  INSTALLATION At the very beginning, I was asked if I wanted to install the Ask.com toolbar and make it my default search engine.  I elected not to install it.  After choosing all the applications to install, I was prompted to install the required 3rd party software, which I was ok with, except that it FORCED me to install the Ask.com toolbar!  What.  The.  Heck???  I timed the actual installation time to be about 22 minutes, during which the installation screen displayed ads for Nero's other applications.  If I were staring at the installation screen for 22 minutes, I think I would have found tips on using Nero 9 to be more useful than watching the same 3 or 4 ads cycle over and over again.  This was a bad start.  After the install completed, I ran the Nero Control Center, which allows you to manage all the apps in the suite including checking for updates.  All it does for updates is open your browser to Nero's web page and you have to see for yourself if the version numbers match or if there is an upgrade available.  The version on the disc I bought was 9.4.17 and version 9.4.26 was available so I downloaded it.  All 204MB worth.  After numerous failed download attempts and even the failure to run once and re-downloading it, I waited an additional 15 minutes for the update to install.  The update forced another couple of 3rd party apps to be installed before completing.  All told, I spent over an hour getting Nero 9 ready to go.  NERO BURNING ROM Nero Burning ROM was 90% of the reason why I chose to even try Nero 9.  Well, aside from being certified for Windows 7, it is essentially the same as Nero 6.  Even the GUI is remarkably similar.  On the plus side, because I was so familiar with Nero 6, I was able to find everything quickly and get running right away.  Unfortunately, the interface was never a highlight of Nero 6 so it retains the unintuitive characteristics.  NERO SHOWTIME Showtime is the media player included in the suite and accounted for about 5% of the reason why I wanted to try Nero 9.  Since my old PowerDVD didn't run on Windows 7, I figured Showtime would be a reasonable upgrade from just using Windows Media Player.  While it does offer more options and useful tools, I found that the audio was unacceptable.  Watching Star Trek (2009) on it was a far more enjoyable experience on WMP than Showtime.  The audio was just bland and not very crisp.  What is wrong with this thing?  I tried messing with the audio configuration but nothing really helped.  Bummer.  NERO VISION Nero Vision allows one to take a video file, from say a Flip camcorder, and burn it to a physical DVD for playback on a standard component DVD player.  Other than adding a few fancy 3D menu templates, it is virtually unchanged from Nero 6.  This was the last 5% of why I wanted to try Nero 9.  REMAINING APPLICATIONS The rest of the suite is sorely below average.  I would use Audacity over the audio editing tools included in Nero 9 and Picasa or Paint. NET over the photo tools.  I don't have a TV tuner on my PC so I could not review the Nero Live tuner/DVR application but I'd guess more of the same.  The tools like DiscSpeed, DriveSpeed, and InfoTool are ok, but again, you can find free applications that do the same things.  I also did not review the RescueAgent and did not install the free backup software, BackitUp & Burn.  SUMMARY I thought I would end up writing a review proving all the negative reviewers wrong.  Instead, I am saddened by the mighty fall from grace that Nero has taken.  Nero 9 is the very definition of bloated.  Load times and performance on nearly every application in the suite was painfully slow.  And the only application really worth having, Burning ROM, has changed very little from FOUR versions ago.  Nero sells just the Burning ROM application for Linux at a reasonable cost and wish they would do that also for Windows because the rest of the suite has watered down the value of Nero.  Even then, they would have a hard time competing against a very good free Windows application called CDBurnerXP, which I recommend for those who only need something for data & audio burning and ISO capabilities.  It takes up less than 11MB of hard disk space and installs in less than 30 seconds.  Oh Nero.  Your time is up.	-1
After 10 years of Nero, I just paid to upgrade to 9. After installing it, I wish I can get my money back. The only reason I upgraded was Windows 7 did not work well with Nero 7 Ultimate. Oh, Nero 9 Reloaded, DOES NOT PLAY BLU-RAY ANYMORE!!!! So, now I have to spend more money on a Blu-Ray player for my computer (Will not be Nero!) Way to go Nero!! NOT!!	-1
After using Nero 7; this release is awful. It's awful because it fails to do the most simplest of tasks that version 7 had no problem with what-so-ever. I have nothing against any other reviewers but I sit here and wonder, how on earth could this release, muster any praise what-so-ever. If I hadn't purchased the retail box, I would have easily assumed this was a beta alpha release. It wasn't in any way, shape or form, ready for end-user consumption. The most simple task of writing multi session data CD-RW's is appalling.  It has been suggested on several forums that a major new update to Nero 9 is due in October. Nero needs to due something quickly as it has already alienated a large portion of its customer base. Installation time is horrid, it's bloated, buggy, and in desperate need of serious overhaul.	-1
I could not get this software to install on my peecee. My environment: Windows XP Pro, service pack 3, all Microsoft updates applied. Hardware is about two years old and was top-of-the-line when purchased.  I meticulously cleaned my file system and Windows registry before trying to install for the second (and third) time. I also attempted a minimal install: just two features. No dice.  I see that has not updated this software for five monthes, as of this writing. Perhaps they have just given up.  One final observation: if you google for similar problems, you will mostly find discussions that do NOT end with a successful resolution.	-1
I was running Nero 8 and installed a Blu-Ray player.  When I inserted a Blu-Ray Disc Nero started and told me I had to have Nero 9.  I bought the program and then found out it does not support any Blu-Ray.  Tech support was very rude and would not give me a refund.  Also it was extremly bloated and HD intensive.  Stay wither Nero 7 or 8 or another program all together.	-1
If you head over to Cnet you'll see they gave this a program a 10/10 review. Their short and overly sweet review doesn't mention the horrific installation process, the many conflicts with Windows restore, or the bloated, useless feature heavy nature of this software.  Professional (paid) reviewers totally loose their credibility when they give a P.O.S. like this a 10/10 review.  Stay away from this program. It's horrible. My work dell came pre-loaded with Nero 8, which was bad enough. I foolishly upgraded to 9 (at a huge discount through Dell) and immediately had to uninstall it when it started causing boot up problems (endless series of errors). Nero has got to do better than this.  I'm switch to Alcohol 120. It's a much better program.	-1
I've used my different anti-virus and security applications on many different computers over the years, and I'm reasonably impressed with Trend Micro Internet Security Pro. The application is easy to install, it's easy to adjust the settings to fit your needs, it automatically updates regularly, and it identifies threats that some other applications miss.  I've been running two other security and anti-virus applications on my computer over the last year and neither of those programs identified a Trojan Horse that had been installed on my computer. After I installed Trend Micro Internet Security, it immediately identified the Trojan Horse and quarantined the file to protect my computer. I did a Google search to find out more about the quarantined file (to make sure it was a Trojan Horse and not a safe file that was misidentified) and sure enough it is a known malware/Trojan Horse file that compromised my computer's security.  Thankfully, this application identified it and got rid of it.  Now, here are the minor problems I have with Trend Micro Internet Security: First, even if I set the application to only update at a specific time it will sometimes update immediately after reboot even if it has already updated the security software that day. This is good if you want to make sure your security files/virus definitions are up to date, but it stinks if you don't want the program downloading updates all the time.  Second, depending on the number of start-up applications I have running on my system, Trend Micro Internet Security Pro sometimes generates a strange error message telling me to stay off the internet until my parents have changed the parental controls. I'm a 31-year-old adult who is married and has a kid of his own. I disabled the parental controls (because my 2-year-old isn't using the computer yet) but I still get this strange error message about 50% of the time when I start up my computer. If the parental controls have been disabled (turned off) I should NOT be getting error messages telling me to stay off the internet until my mommy and daddy fix the computer.  Hopefully these two problems are corrected in a future update.  Overall, I still highly recommend this software for people who want to keep their computer's safe. I just hope the update schedule controls and parental control issues are resolved with a future update from Trend Micro.	1
In this day and age we all know that anti-virus software is a must for any windows based computer. However most software developers to give you all the protection you need throw in everything in including the kitchen to help you keep protected. The top 3 non shareware products and top of the game have become increasingly bad each new version with how much they slow down your computer (almost as bad as the viruses they are trying to prevent) However,  with Trend Micro Internet Security Pro these problems are issues of the past! Install was quit simple, and my windows based machine did suffer at all from performance. Quite simply Trend Micro is the way to go to protect you while not suffering from a 90% or higher CPU usage.	1
I have been a big fan for Trend Micro for the last four years; however, I made the switch away from Trend Micro when the 2007 version came out. Many security vendors continued to make improvements on the resource usages every year.  Trend Micro was getting worse with the initial load time. The load time for the security suite 2007 was too slow for my taste.  I figured I would give the 2009 version another chance. Once again I am not impressed with install and load times. The install too long because the update process, The load time after reboot continue to be a drag. Once loaded Trend Micro does NOT take a large amount of system resources and the scan time are fairly quick. However; I have decide to uninstall it and use other product because of the initial load time / update process.  The pro version is packed with many features, including my favorite the keystoke encryprtion. This will prevent any software application from stealing information as you type.  I would recommend the product for the protection value, scan speed, and the small load on the system resources and if you do not mind the initial load time then you will be completely satisfied. I just hate slower boot times. There are better products out there when it comes to preventing spyware/malware, so I recommend just using an additional anti-spyware program to overcome that. (Adware 2008, Spybot, Spyware Doctor Starter Edition)  Having something is better than nothing.	1
How do you review an Internet Security package? Well I had to think about that and this is what I came up with.  1) What I want more than anything is to be protected from viruses, phishing attacks, and intruders of all kinds. Does it protect me while I'm doing some online purchasing or banking? Some of this is hard to test without deliberately accepting a virus or phishing attack which I wasn't about to do. Some of the professional reviews did thorough jobs of checking these features with mixed results - hence my 4 stars instead of five. This is the most important feature and I'll leave it up to the experts to sort it out. 2) How easy is the software to load and operate? 3) Does it in any way hinder the normal operation of my computer? 4) Does it have the set of features I expect?  Trend Micro Internet Security Pro (TMISP)did a good job in all aspects as far as I could tell.  I loaded this software on a fresh build on my laptop, a brand new Windows XP Professional system with all new drivers. It loaded without incident in only a matter of minutes, then asked if I wanted it to check for online updates which I did and there were none. I was able to set up the features I wanted quickly and easily using the rather easy to understand Graphical User Interface.  I checked the boot up time for windows before loading TMISP and then checked after loading it. The first time I did this it took some extra time, apparently to set it self up. The subsequent start up times were not noticeably slower than without TMISP.  I tested the TMISP firewall by turning it on and attempting to connect to the computer from two other computers on my home network. The firewall completely blocked my attempts. I then turned off the firewall and the program warned me that I had turned it off but allowed me to disable the warning; nice.  This product is feature rich including everything I was looking for and a couple of things I wasn't expecting. It protects email, internet transactions, keyloggers, and some web browsing. One of my favorite features is I can load it on up to three computers for the price of one.  A nice built in graphic display of my home network is a bonus. Also in the Pro version there are some additional tools such as a dashboard showing how many threats were encountered and protected.  I was able to turn on automatic updates so my virus protection will always be up to date.  So far so good. I'll update this review if I find anything to complain about but for now I'm happy with this product. I do intend to install it on my three home computers and replace the software I had been using. Norton was a heavy load on my computer and I'm glad to uninstall it (if I can!). So far TMISP isn't impacting my computer the way Norton did.  The Amazon site does a pretty good job of exposing more features but there are more than listed. To me this is a keeper.	1
When comparing Trend Micro's Internet Security Pro with McAfee's VirusScan Plus, I found that both do their jobs well. I am especially impressed with their site advisory systems which enable the user to surf the web without fear. I did find that the Trend Micro system was a bit more of a resource hog, so it loses a star over that. Easy installation. Internet Security Pro also warns you about suspicious emails and IMs. It's not a bad system at all. 4 stars!	1
Flatly, this is the WORST software I've ever tried to use, and I have yet to find a computer it'll run with. If 0 stars were an option, I'd be there. It was rec. by Dell for my now 6 MO laptop, and said laptop became so possessed and slow that I couldn't delete it; I had to "go back in time" with System Restore. I just tried it with my new Sony, and it popped open windows faster than I could delete them, resulting in 50 windows and a crash. Upon restart, I deleted the thing as quickly as possible before it could do more damage.  With the XPs, it wouldn't load at all. In other words, this was $70 wasted.	-1
Trend Micro's internet security products have always offered great protection but have suffered from being hideously slow.  This version is much faster than older releases, while being just as effective.  It installed seamlessly on a three-year old Sony Vaio with Windows XP and an Intel Centrino Duo processor.  The user interface is pretty easier to figure out (thankfully as Trend Micro's telephone support has never been very quick or good), and one improvement over the 2008 release is that each web page you visit is marked with a green "safe page" notification as soon as you open it.  The safe page banner also appears next to a listing of search engine results, which sure beats after-the-fact clean up and quarantine.  I've been a Trend Micro user through 3 versions now so haven't compared to Norton or other products recently, although in the past, I always preferred TM to Norton.  But TM seems to have taken user complaints about speed to heart and my only complaint is that I didn't upgrade to this version sooner.	1
Installed this on my home server system (Dell Dimensions AMD X2-6000 with XP Media Center with 2GB RAM / 1TB HD).  I followed all the directions carefully by having previous antiviral software removed and rebooted.  Then proceeded with the install of this product.  The install went smoothly and almost finished.  Then I assume the program started and my system rebooted (I've disabled blue screens for reboots).  I thought okay, should be fine on the reboot.  Well the system rebooted and windows started loading but then it would reach a point where the system errored again and reboot.  Pattern was infinite, I powered down and powered back on with the same pattern.  Omigod I thought, this is terrible.  Apparently this program is causing a catastrophic error to the point I can't even get windows to complete loading.  So I decide it's best to boot into safemode to remove the program.  Should be easy.  Got into safemode and loaded the uninstall control panel.  Clicked to uninstall.  Wouldn't let me.  It tells me this particular vendor's installer cannot be uninstalled under safe mode. Ridiculous!  What kind of idiot makes an installer do this?  I kept trying to no avail.  I was starting to panic thinking my system was hosed by this commercial virus (that's what a virus does).  Fortunately, I was able to roll back to the last known good configuration which prevented this program from loading.  Horrible installer for this program.  Haven't seen anything like this in ages and to think this is commercial software?  Crazy.  My home server is very stable by the way, with minimal software and runs without fault for weeks, even months at a time.  I refuse to go through this pattern of insanity, plus wasting hours of my time, just to install it on another PC to see how it works.  Beware.	-1
In a sense, I feel like something of a techno-Goldilocks.  Microsoft OneCare had all the features that I liked, yet it couldn't function well with my wireless router and home network.  McAfee Total Protection 2008 seemed fine, and then I couldn't get the darn thing to register (thus preventing the necessary updates)  More so, I was so frustrated with McAfee's tech support that I finally sent the program back, with a long letter of explanation that unfortunately was never acknowledged.  And Norton Antivirus was a similar disappointment after a couple of months of use (it seems that it doesn't play well with MS Vista updates... at all). So now, here I am, a still happy user of Trend Micro Internet Security Pro after two full months.  Is it possible that I've found techno security happiness?  The features are top notch, network management within my AT&T U-verse firewall, active web site security (yes, I've had a couple framesets blocked as dangerous and I greatly appreciate that).  The regular scans have initiated as scheduled, sometimes finding a few suspect tracking cookies and once something more malevolent.  I particularly like the remote file lock feature, that I can use to store particularly sensitive documents, protecting them should the notebook get stolen.  And the registry cleaner is excellent, very fast and effective.  I had no problems installing it, and contrary to some, I've not noticed any resource degradation (and I'm always paying attention to that).  So, knowing full well that in three previous purchases, the my product/user relationship went south as soon as I published a glowing review; I have to give this a careful 5 stars.  If things go wrong down the road, I'll come back in and update this, but for some reason I think that this might turn out to be just right!	1
The installation was easy, and this program has already detected several suspicious files on my computer. I highly recommend this product.	1
I installed Internet Security Pro on my 2003 IBM Thinkpad x24, running Windows XP Pro on approximately 768mb of RAM.  This computer has been through a lot.  I've tried any number of virus, adware, and spyware programs in the past, including Norton, Spybot, McAfee, Adaware, and AVG Free edition.  As more and more rootkits and different types of spyware programs get created, I was constantly on the prowl for a free solution.  I've been pretty happy with AVG Free but the opportunity to try ISP has been a solid one.  The nice thing about a program like ISP is that it's a one-stop all in one service.  Gone are the days of needing separate programs to block popups, scan websearches for malicious content, clean your registry, and scan emails.  This product pretty much has everything.  I was able to uninstall lots of old software when I installed ISP.  A few of the features weren't much use to me, as I don't have children or need to remotely lock files.  What I like:  -Virus defnitions constantly update.  You can customize this.  Better still, unlike other programs, downloading the update doesn't seem to drag my computer down.  - All-in one product.  Yay for this!  - Anti-theft protection.  I'm not too worried about this anymore, but in the days of college, this would be a big bonus.  When you think about what kind of important life documents you keep on your computer, having a way to secure them is pretty nice.  What I didn't like: -Similar to other users, installation was not the "breeze" it could, or should have been.  -It's a bit of a memory hog and I'm anticipating needing to installed a new 1gb memory module to keep up with the demand.  -Web filter/security feature does tend to slow down browsing somewhat.	1
I'm a bit fed up with Norton. So fed up in fact that I decided to try one of its competitors. And I have to say, I'm surprised by my choice, and not only surprised, but pleasantly intrigued.  Trend Micro's Internet Security Pro v2 has all the right features and more that made me reconsider the value of incumbents. For example, Trend Micro has a nice graphical dashboard that identifies all the threads it neutralized on my computer, thus giving me this nice and cushy feeling of security. From the tests I did, Trend Micro detected and blocked all the malware samples I could come up with. Great Job!!! But from what I read online, it is not very successful at blocking keyloggers (couldn't test this myself). Then again, apparently they are a minor threat so I didn't lose any sleep over this.  I liked Trend Micro's firewall configuration settings associated with the unique pre-set profiles the application has. The software also blocked malicious sites I tried to surf, which is a nice feature considering the number of `evil' possibilities lurking out there in the open.  Overall, I recommend this application and would consider giving it as a gift to my family and friends.	1
The Good:  * Set it and forget it * Traditional firewall and scanners you expect from a suite and then some * Innovative features like anti-theft protection, keystroke encryption and wi-fi detector on your browser(tested on IE and Mozilla) * Provides Mobile security for many PDAs as well  The Bad:  * Anti-Theft protection could've been extended to do much more  The Bottom Line:  A great product from Trend Micro.  Once you install it, you forget that its even there.  It doesn't bug you for every little thing like other suites tend to do.  It provides a powerful protection silently in the background.  Of course you may choose to do scans manually.  It has firewall, virus scan and a tune-up scan.  This is also a great suite for laptops as its easy on the resources and provides Wi-Fi security on the browser's toolbar.  It will let you know if the Wi-Fi you are using secure or not, in addition to whether or not the website you are on safe or not.  The anti-theft lock feature is a mixed bag but is still a good addition to the suite.  In a nutshell, you set up a master password(which if you ever forget, they will email it to you.)  You have the option to lock a folder where supposedly you keep all the private data in.  If your PC/Laptop gets stolen, nobody will be able to access that folder.  All you need to do is go to Trend's website and report your computer stolen.  Once your lost computer goes online, that folder will always remain locked, even if they know the password to the vault file.  My only gripe is:  If its possible to lock one file, why not have the ability to lock the entire computer while you're at it?  However, that minor ding will not stop me from recommending this product to others as I hope I never get to use the benefits of anti-theft features.	1
This is a product that I have had the pleasure of using before the Vine Program. The Internet Security Pro was introduced last year in 2008 and I used it then. The difference between the regular and Pro versions of the Trend Micro Security Suite are the additions of some very handy computer management features. These include a System Tuner module that includes a Registry cleanup scanner, Startup Manager, Privacy Manager, a Remote File Lock service that protects important documents remotes by password protected backup, A Trend Micro Toolbar that includes a WiFi detector, keyboard encryption protector to thwart keylogging attempts has also been added. New for 2009 TM also includes a phishing page rating button, A Dashboard to track security threats encountered by the software and a Security Suite protector for your mobile smartphone! The software works smoothly, installation of the 09 version was faster than last year and it self configures. While you can review several options, the important ones are already configured. Use of the extended Pro Features is optional. Trend Micro makes a very solid product that does not bug you with too many pop ups and runs smoothly. The few times last year I needed to contact Customer Service, they were quick and problems were taken care of ASAP. I was pleased to see this in the Vine program. Some things I love about TM Pro include the Startup Manager to stop excess unneeded programs from launching on startup, the scans are deeper and show both time elapsed and percentage of the computer left to be scanned. I had tried Norton 2008 and it did not find as many items and when it did, you still had to manually remove them yourself. TM finds and removes items automatically. Norton also excessively updated itself in same sessions. TM keeps you safe and protected without nagging you. I had purchased their Smartphone security before the new 2009 version came out and am pleased with that as well. It is a nice addition to the Suite. I highly recommend Trend Micro Pro they have made an already good product even better, backed by support that actually listens to your concerns.	1
I recently had the chance to review Trend Micro Antivirus and found it to be an adequate antivirus. The program to be very user friendly and easy to install. And it seems to work well. Another plus is the fact that running the program doesn't slow your computer down. But honestly this isn't a program that I would buy just for the fact that it can only be used on one computer.	1
Installation was easy and it seems to be doing it's job.  I haven't noticed my computer slowing down at all from this software.	1
I have been a Trend Micro user and supporter for many, many years and easily can recommend most of their products.  I find their applications to do the job as advertised, are easy to install and use, and any time I have needed to call their support system, I get a REAL PERSON who is educated, friendly, and quick to answer the phone.  Every year the neweset Antivirus/Antispyware software has added more in the product, the footprint is smaller on the machine, and less resources are used as the years increase as well.  I love Trend Micro stuff and feel that if you need an Antivirus/Antispyware suite, look no further!!  ***** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED	1
Trend Micro does what it is supposed to do. very effective. I am having less and less problems on my computer since it's installation. recommended.	1
Now let me preface this review by stating that we have, in the past, used & been quite content with Trend Micro updating annually to their latest version, that was until we tried out a few other ones! What can i say.......WOW, there is a HUGE difference!   Now that I have tried about every AntiVirus software from Kaspersky to McAfee and Trend Micro has got to be about the worst software out there. For example, Trend Micro uses 284MB of RAM, now Vipre will only use 67MB at the most! Also, Trend Micro will sometime find a virus and will not let you delete, or quarantine it. Also, it is INCREDIBLY SLOW! While running a scan on my 4GB of RAM computer, it reduced it's speed by over half! So in short, it does the job, but slowly, it misses trogans, worms, and presently almost any other virus software is better. (But I do recomend Kaspersky for our needs)   At one time Trend was number 1 in my book, but as with all tecnology, if you don't improve, someone else will.............& that is what has happened.	-1
I have used this for sometime and find it to be very reliable, nothing speacial but it gets the job done well. It will protect from viruses and spyware -its simple and effective.	1
For home-use anti-virus/anti-spyware, I'm looking for three things:  1. Easy to install and easy to use  2. Operates light and doesn't slow down my laptop  3. The software works.  Trend Micro met all three of those expectations, so much so that I bought the full Trend Micro Internet Security Pro package for three users. After years of frustration with McAfee and Norton - software incompatibility and system resources bogged down - I am pleased with the Trend Micro experience.  I've also switched from IE to Firefox, which eliminated the frozen screens and slow Internet surfing. I recommend Trend Micro and Firefox, especially if you spend a lot of playing and shopping on the Internet.	1
Trend Micro AntiVirus+AntiSpyware provides a reasonable level of protection for home users. I tested it with a "safe" virus test suite from[...] and the Trend Micro software successfully detected all the viruses and quarantined them. The one feature this software lacks is that it isn't very "proactive" about alerting you to potential viruses or activities that might lead to viruses like some other antivirus programs. On the other hand, that means that Trend Micro isn't as intrusive as other antivirus programs and stays in the background. On that note, the updates are automatic and all stay in the background in Windows.  The Trend Micro software is simple to use and the interface is very slick and attractive. I noticed that the Trend Micro antivirus software doesn't impact my PC's system performance the way that Norton does ... so no slow down in computer speed. The one negative is that a full scan of the hard drive for viruses takes longer than other programs like Norton or Kaspersky.  Pros: * Successfully detects and quarantines viruses * Simple, non-intrusive interface with automatic updates * Minimal impact to system performance  Cons: * Not as proactive as other antivirus programs * Full scans of your hard drive for viruses take longer than other programs	1
Nobody likes viruses and spyware, so those of us who use Microsoft Windows know that antivirus software is essential for online security. With Trend Micro Antivirus + Antispyware, you get very good protection from viruses and spyware. Trend Micro is one of the best. It's always a good idea to update your virus and spyware definition lists because new viruses and spyware are being created on a seemingly basis.  Don't be fooled by the low price. This is quality protection!	1
Easy to install and has not crashed my computer so far.  The interface is pretty simple and easy to use.  Doesn't seem to use too many resources.  No problems with malware so far, at least as far as I can tell.  I like link protectors so you don't accidentally go to a suspicious website, but this product is their more basic version, so doesn't provide for one.  If your computer can handle it (i.e. not a netbook or single processor computer) then you should probably spring a little extra money for a fuller suite of protection.  I have used older versions of Norton and the newer versions of McAfee in the past.	1
I have been using Trend Micro products for years, and this is the best one yet.  I recently bought a new laptop and was using a freeware product called Avast.  I installed Trend Micro for the improved security coverage.  Installation was painless.  It required 2 reboots, the first when the Avast software was removed, and the second after this software was installed.  After that the software was updated online.  I haven't noticed any slowdown on my computer, updates are installed in the background and are unobtrusive.  I haven't hit any sites yet that were blocked by the software and it hasn't caught any viruses yet, but I'm confident it will perform admirably.	1
I started to install this on my new laptop but it already has the new Norton 360 on it. Some programs will work together but this one wants to be the ONLY security program on the computer. My old Norton had expired on my old Dell desk top so I thought I'd try this on it.    First I had to remove Norton and Norton's utilities and I didn't really like that. Then I had to remove the McAfee site advisor and SpyWareBlaster, all before the install would run.    After I finally got it installed I don't know how well it will work since I cant get my computer to run at all. I've tried booting it up several times. It will give me my desktop and short cuts but everything is locked up. I haven't had time to try a safe start and see if I can do anything with it. I might have to take it to my computer guy to get it going again.    The only other thing I got to say is that I'm glad that I didn't put it in my new laptop. I've got too much important data in this one to loose it. At least by trying it in my old desktop first it saved my laptop.  Update; I finally got my desktop computer that I installed this in to boot up. I don't know where this program went but it isn't there and when I tried to install it again the install was stopped. It said that the one installation that was allowed from this disc had already been used. All that I can say about it now is that I'm sure glad that I didn't have to pay for this because I would be very upset about it if I had and I would be demanding my money back.	-1
I installed Trend Micro AntiVirus plus AntiSpyware on a brand new computer with Windows Vista, the installation was simple and the only thing needed was an update.  The program integrated straight into Vista and auto configured without me having to make any adjustments.  One of the issues I have is that despite Viruses and Spyware being a real threat, when you buy a new computer you don't get any really powerful programs to stop them.  Windows Defender works to a certain level but when you use a good program then you realize it is limited.  I like this software by Trend Micro, it isn't over the top with unnecessary buttons, and the interface is simply and easy to use.  It runs seamlessly in the background and you wouldn't even know it was there until it pops up occasionally to let you know if there is a problem.  You can set the parameters on how you want the program to run or just let it run as already configured.  You have the choice on whether to do a scan right away or let it do it automatically at a certain time.  As far as effectiveness, since 08/03/2009, the program has intercepted 41 threats.  Admittedly these were low level and internet cookies but it still reflects that the program is functioning to a good level.  This software also protects your computer from any potential threats by protecting your files and not allowing any changes without your permission.  I would highly rate this and it is one of the better Anti Virus/Spyware programs I have used.	1
When I got this software I was anxious to install it. I used to use Norton and hated the fact that upgrades were so painful and sometimes failed completely. I have Trend Micro on my computer now and if there is one thing it does well is RUN seamlessly in the background....Luckily I paused to take a second look at the back of the box. At first it was deceptive because this product was Antivirus PLUS AntiSpyware and that product didn't appear to be listed in the comparison on the box. Then I got it...the Antivirus column was one and the same with this product and it only protected again two things.  PROS: It protects against Viruses and Spyware and prevents unauthorized changes to applications. Cheap price  CONS: Here are the ones that concern me the most.  It does not Block email and image spam. It does not stop malicious downloads from websites. It does not alert you to unsafe websites or halt their download. It does not stop webpages from hyjacking your settings so that the malicious site becomes your home page. This is perhaps the most annoying problem as it has happened to me with pop-ups.  Since you are only as safe as your last update, the above can lead to problems with new and fast spreading virus infections. For $10 dollars more you can buy Trend Micro Internet Security and have these important protections. It doesn't make sense to buy this even at the cheap price.	-1
I actually picked this up without reading the box. My bad. I like to try different security software to spread my luck around on the different equipment, hoping if one has a hole the other might not, and thus skirting system wide failure. But seeing that this is not even the internet security suite, I am not that brave these days. Antivirus and antispyware used to make me feel safe, but I like a widere birth of protection these days on my personal and the families PCs either way. So if you are okay with the bare minimum, this isn't a bad price, but I'd rather pay a bit more and get wider protection.	-1
The device itself is nice and small and very cool looking.  But the quality of the scans is a very low 200 dpi. Which means it is great if you trying to scan receipts and b&w documents.  But the quality of, let's say, a photo ad would be bad.  This really limits what you can do with this scanner.  I own a Fujitsu ScanSnap S510 that is just plain awesome.  I wasn't expecting that from the NeatScan for $150, but I was expecting high resolution scans - maybe just a lot slower.  There are much better alternatives out there for a little more money.  Check out the Fujitsu Scansnap S300.	-1
This new NeatScan to Office product contains the same hardware you will find in the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/NeatReceipts-Mobile-Scanner-and-Digital-Filing-System/dp/B001CQFRPO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">NeatReceipts Mobile Scanner and Digital Filing System</a>&nbsp;or the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/NeatReceipts-Mobile-Scanner-and-Digital-Filing-System-for-Mac/dp/B001CQDOMM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">NeatReceipts Mobile Scanner and Digital Filing System for Mac</a>, but instead of the full version of software, it comes with plugins for the Windows version of Microsoft Office.  The box contains the scanner itself, a USB to mini USB cable and a cardboard folder holding calibration paper, cleaning paper, a single use wet cleaning pad, a soft carry pouch and the software CD.  The scanner itself is amazingly small and draws its power from the USB connection, so it doesn't require a power brick and desk clutter is reduced to an absolute minimum. You probably won't find a scanner with a smaller footprint, and you won't think twice about slipping it into your suitcase when going on business trips, so you can get a headstart on filing your expense reports (if you plan on traveling with the NeatScan, consider purchasing the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Travel-Case/dp/B000KBFX6K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Travel Case</a>).  The software installs in a couple of minutes; it adds a NeatScan toolbar to Microsoft Office applications, from which you can control scanning. Configuration could not be simpler, and after a quick run of the calibration sheet you're ready to go. When scanning to Excel, you can use "Neat Sheets", templates allowing the software to know how to locate and assign information (this is geared towards filling up expense reports, but can be customized easily to perform a variety of tasks). When scanning to Word, OCR is performed automatically and results in an editable text document.  Scanning a letter-size page takes around 10 seconds. OCR processing can take about a minute on a complex page. The scanner is capable of passable color results with photographs, but it's clearly not its strongest point. The two buttons on top (Scan and PDF) trigger a scan (or scan to PDF) into the currently active Microsoft Office application (if available).  If you wish to upgrade to the full version of the NeatReceipts software, or if you're switching to a Macintosh, you can purchase the corresponding software directly from the company's web site (neatco dot com), and use it with this scanner.  This product is amazingly easy to use, and the Neat Company has quite a knack for crafting excellent software. If you need a scanner mainly for document archival and expense reports, it just can't be beat for the price. If you have lots of documents to scan, consider the more expensive NeatDesk scanner which is faster, easier to feed and supports duplex scanning.	1
I installed this scanner on my 6 month old Dell laptop running Windows XP Pro. The installation was quick and easy, and it integrated automatically into Microsoft Office.  The first document I scanned was a two-page contract. In 20 seconds, I had a PDF version on my computer that I could email to the customer. This alone is worth the price of the product: not having to drive back to the office to use the scanner to make electronic copies of signed contracts.  Next I tried some business cards. The scanner quickly delivered full-color scans. I'm looking forward to trying the OCR feature for database import.  The scanner comes with a felt bag to carry it safely in a briefcase. This is a nice touch that makes it an ideal mobile solution. There's only one cable-power is delivered over the USB connection.  This scanner is one more reason that I DON'T have to run back to the office. I'm really happy with it. I gave it five stars because it completely and elegantly solves the problem I had-scanning on the road. And by the way, it looks great.	1

Unfortunately it lacks the organizational tools that made NeatCo's flagship product, Neat Receipts, a killer app.  Also note that this is not a Mac product.  It will, however, work with VMWare or Parallels running Windows XP or Vista running a Windows version of Microsoft Office 2003 or 2007.	1
I think the best thing about this product is its size and the fact that it is powered by the USB and not an external AC adapter. Works just like advertised. Could be a bit faster. Wish I had received the mac version but if you are running Windows on your mac it will work.	1
This product was a cinch to install.  So far I've had no problems. I can't say how effective the product has proven in my system but I have had it for about a month now.	1
If you just bought a computer or planning to go for a antivirus/antispyware, PCtools Internet security is the answer, here is why :  Are there not any freeware security software that I could use ? Do not waste your time in looking in for freeware, most of them do not work - there is a substantial amount of work required to maintain the virus and spyware signature current and noone can do it for free.  Infact there are 'free' antispyware which are actually rogue-wave, here is a complete list, stay away from them: "[...]"  If you really want to use some freeware, here is my reccomendation:  -> AVG antivirus freeware  -> Super antispyware freeware  Still PCtools is the best among all of these  Will PCtools provide me with free updates to antivirus and antispyware ? New viruses and spyware are created around the world everyday and this needs to be kept up to date.  PCtools does provide you with frequent updates (at no extra cost)  Will installing PCtools decrease the performance of my computer ? To some extent yes, since it has to scan before you run any file on the sytem, But if you have a computer which you bought anywhere in the last 5 years, there should be hardly any noticable performance impact  How does PCtools compare with similar products? I have personally used Trend Micro, McShield and PCtools and I find PCtools to be the most effective in protecting and removing viruses and anti-spyware.  Trend micro is the worst of the lot and McShield is ok.  ~ Update 1 - 16th April 09 ~ Recently I got a software sent by an email from a friend, I called him, verified that it was ok to run, scanned with PCTools to make sure it was clean. After running it, i noticed that my PC was running slow, the performance deterioration was so subtle that you could notice it, but you would hardly suspect if something was going on.  Suspecting, I download a freeware version of SuperAntiSpyware and was able to identify a spamware in the software.  I understand that it is hard for any one tool to be capable of knowing all viruses and spam, but just thought everyone should be aware of it - if you get a suspecting file, scan it with more than 1 antivirus/antispyware and SuperAntiSpyware is a damn good thing.	1
Short Review: PC Tools Internet Securty 2009 is a security suite with all the usual bells and whistles.  It defends your computer without hogging resources and without being too invasive.  Long Reivew:  For all you computer guys out there, let me first tell you where I am coming from.  I am running PC Tools on Windows Vista on the Bootcamp partition of my late 2007 iMac with 2 gb of memory.  I did not test the abilities of the program (as in trying to infect myself with spyware or viruses), I leave that to the expert.  I will try to convey the experience and hope that the experts.  SET UP:  At first, I tried to set this up by running Vista in virtualization using VMware's Fusion.  I couldn't get it to set up and run.  I tried and tried but it just wouldn't go.  So, I turned off the computer and booted into Bootcamp.  PC Tools installed quickly and automatically with the insertion of the CD.  There were minimal questions to ask.  One quibble:  when typing in the password there is a screen that has two buttons:  'Submit' and 'Continue.'  I kept hitting the continue button and was unable to register the product.  Once I realized that you had to hit 'submit' I was okay.  I still don't know why there is a 'continue' button...  FIRST RUN:  The program set itself up.  The initial splash screen was easy to negotiate.  Each component has its own set up panel and is self explanatory.  There are buttons for  anti-spyware, anti-virus, anti-spam, and firewall settings.  Each menu is easy to negotiate and has a number of variable settings.  I didn't want to wait a long time for a full scan, so I opted for the more superficial, quick 'intelli-scan.'  The program did come up with a number of spyware issues that it quite easily deleted on command.  Of note, after installing it in Bootcamp, the suite worked flawlessly in virtualization.  RESOURCES:  Prior to running this suite, I was using Macafe's security suite.  In comparison, Macafe was a real resource hog, slowed down the machine, and asked too many questions.  What with Vista constantly asking for permissions, things were getting a little ridiculous.  The firewall seems to ask appropriate questions and allowed code to run after a single query.  Overall, I had a much better experience with this than Macafe and Trend before this.  Caveat emptor, I am no firewall maven so the efficacy of the firewall could be an issue here.  But assuming that the program performs well it works smoothly.  The experience here is a lot like running Commodo or Zone Alarm.  CONCLUSION: Overall, it works smoothly and as advertised.  There is nothing new, innovative, or sensational about it but, after all, it is a security suite. For me, I felt that unlike my past experiences, this suite ran without slowing my computer down to a crawl.  It also was less invasive than other firewall options.  I also liked its simple, no-frills user interface.  PC tools makes Spyware Doctor which is an award winning spyware remover and is part of the suite.  If the antivirus, firewall, and anti-spam features are as efficacious, this would be a great addition to any PC.  And for the price, it's a bargain at that.	1
I had some problems with this product at first because I was using another product that didn't seem to allow this system to operate properly.  I was getting some very strange conflicts.  I removed the other item to see what this would do and it worked very nice.  I set it to do several system scans and it located spyware that had evidently been active on my system for some time.  I uninstalled PC Tools Internet Security 2009 V6 and reinstalled my former sypware product.  After about two weeks I reversed the process and reinstalled PC Tools Internet Security.... again, several spyware operations were found on my PC.  I think this application is a good investment and does an excellent job at a reasonable price.	1
So I bought myself a cute little&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Samsung-NC10-14GB-10-2-Inch-Netbook-1-6-GHz-Intel-Atom-Processor-1-GB-RAM-160-GB-Hard-Drive-6-Cell-Battery-XP-Home-Blue/dp/B001I45TA8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Samsung NC10-14GB 10.2-Inch Netbook (1.6 GHz Intel Atom Processor, 1 GB RAM, 160 GB Hard Drive, 6 Cell Battery, XP Home) Blue</a>.  Oooh, shiny.  I also like the seven hours of battery life on one charge.  But it doesn't have a dvd drive.  I considered copying the software to a card and loading it through the card reader.  However, I ultimately ended up putting the CD in a shared/networked DVD drive and added my netbook to the office network.  I was able to install the program easily.  the scan was quick and it didn't seem to be the resources hog I have noticed with AVG and Norton.  I liked the fact that the firewall was very restrictive on installation and had to be adjusted for exceptions-- there's been a lot of problems over the years with software shipping in unsecure mode and users not realizing the need to adjust.  I'll probably add a couple of favorite security programs like Spybot S&D, and I have created a nonadministrative account for surfing the net, but I think this program is well worth having.	1
The price is right on this all in one package of PC security tools. There are others out there, each with pros and cons, but for the price this has a good set of programs. If you currently have no anti-spyware on your computer, you need to get something now. If you have no anti-virus yet, good luck.	1
I had high hopes for this product.  However, my hopes were dashed immediately after installation.  I installed the program on a fairly new machine running a fresh installation of XP-SP3.  Despite a problem-free installation, I noticed that I lost my Internet connection afterwards.  I discovered this while attempting to activate the program.  The application stated there was a problem with my Internet connection, but didn't realize it was the culprit.  I adjusted the firewall settings until I was able to restore Internet connectivity, however, a non-savvy user might have a harder time figuring out the problem, and they're the ones who need this type of application the most.  The program also displayed a bunch of pop-ups for firewall rules and real-time protection notifications, sometimes several at once.  I quickly opted to operate the firewall in "silent mode", which is supposed to limit notifications and create rules automatically, however, I still received quite a few pop-up notifications before they, thankfully, eventually diminished.  I then tried the update feature.  The update process was simple but it required two successive reboots to complete.  I finally got the program tamed, however, there were still some exisitng issues.  System resource impact wasn't too bad. Web browsing was fast and pages loaded quickly, although it takes quite a bit of time for web access to become available when starting Windows.  I also frequently lost web access and had to restart the browser several times to restore.  I also noticed a few extra seconds delay during startup and shutdown, but nothing alarming.  The scanning and malware engine seems pretty good and fast.  There is no right-click context menu scan, a major flaw.  In other words, no way to manually scan individual files, such as downloads, without scanning the entire system. The interface is otherwise clean with easily reachable menus/sub-menus.  The program can be completely or selectively disabled.  I feel the installation process is too problematic for the average user.  The default firewall settings are too restrictive and all of the initial pop-ups can be pretty confusing and irritating.  I also feel the lack of context-menu scanning and the frequent loss of network connectivity are serious minuses. I would look elsewhere.	-1
I really like this software program; it's easy and straightforward.  I was able to use the program right out of the box instead of having to read and learn how to use it from a manual. After installing PC Tools and Internet Security 2009 v6.0 I ran it and found many bugs that Adaware missed.  Also, the program ran very fast--faster than many other programs that I have tried and it was even more thorough. I completely recommed this program.	1
This software combines anti-spyware, anti-virus, installation was not complicted, but I did need to call customer support, who were very helpful and courteous. This product has the highest detection, blocking and removal rate of anti-spyware and anti-virus software. It scanned quickly and is very easy to use. I like everything the software offers and am very pleased with it and would recommend it without hesitation.	1
I'm kind of a personal computer security freak.  It seems I've tried everything out there at least once: Norton/Symantec, McAfee, Trend Micro, Zone Alarm, Avast, Kaspersky, etc.  I'll compare this product to the ones I have come across.  In terms of user friendliness, I give this product a 4.5/5.  It's visually oriented, without any complex menus and submenus to deal with.  Reminds me of Norton and McAfee in terms of the ability to quickly access what you need to get done with the program.  When it comes to your machine, handling this program, it's a 4/5.  It's definitely not as lightweight as McAfee, Trend Micro, or Avast, but it's way easier on your memory and hard drive than the infamous destructive force "I need a new computer b/c my anti-virus program destroyed it" Norton or the "I'm afraid of my next door neighbor hacking into my computer" Kaspersky users.  In terms of personal security, this program is really the works: antivirus, firewall, spam, spyware.  I give it 3.5/5.  It has a wide variety of things it monitors, but as often is the case with such products, the more you spread out your resources, the fewer bugs you catch.  In terms of variety of options, yet lack of a sophisticated and comprehensive database of bugs, this reminds me of McAfee, Avast, Trend Micro, Zone Alarm.  So, to finish off, see where you fit in:  If you are regular computer user, who doesn't go to "iffy" web site, doesn't download things from "iffy" sources, this is really an excellent program for you, especially for the money.  If you don't like this program for some reason, I'd recommend Trend-Micro, Avast (which is free but not nearly as comprehensive), or McAfee.  If you are constantly under threat from viruses/worms/hackers/spyware and want an extremely powerful and comprehensive program designed by a certified genius that will basically allow you to control every 1 and 0 that comes into your computer, you have the time to set it up and maintain properly, and you have an extremely powerful computer that can handle it, get the Kaspersky Security Suite.  I wouldn't recommend Norton to even my worst enemy.  Because it's the most popular program worldwide, virus makers and hackers love to target it with all sorts of new things, basically shutting down the program before it can even protect you (great, huh?).  And not to mention, that this program buries into your hard-drive so far down, that not even a professional can't salvage your computer from the damage (i.e. slowing your computer down), Norton causes after you uninstall it.  I beg you, if you are thinking of getting a new PC, DEMAND from the computer manufacturer that you DO NOT get a pre-installed free trial of Norton on your computer which is all too often the case as Symantec tries to purposefully dominate the market with its "superior" product.	1
I had been becoming of the mind that anti-virus software may actually be worse than the viruses and malware themselves.  Most retail offerings are overpriced, difficult to install, and confusing to maintain.  And then the cherry on top is that they typically bog down your computer's performance while letting the bad stuff through anyway.  But PC Tools Internet Security 2009 has turned me around on this topic.  It installed easily on my Windows XP (sp3) workstation after I had removed my prior security suite (begone forever, Norton 360!), including automatically retrieving all of the latest updates.  Registration was as simple as providing the product key and my email address - immensely less obtrusive than the Norton runaround.  The dashboard is easy to read, visually separating its protection against spyware, viruses, spam and intrusion (i.e. firewall) into different portions of the screen.  Globally useful information such as the most recent scan date and how many days are left on your subscription are placed in immediate view - no digging required.  Click any of the protection panes and you get detailed information including helpful links for setting runtime options and viewing historical results.  It's all very user-friendly and intuitive.  PC Tools really shines during routine use.  Aside from the times when it was running an update, the software's footprint was very manageable, both in terms of CPU and memory usage.  So no more slowdowns during browsing.  And it manages to provide this protection without cluttering up your browser with any branded toolbar nonsense - imagine that, Norton!  Its schedule, thresholds and notifications are all simple to customize so that you get the level of protection that you want without going overboard with non-stop messages and warnings.  Their IntelliGuard feature is aimed at ensuring ongoing protection while not overloading the average user with technical minutiae.  Let's face it - the average Internet user doesn't know (or even want to know) hot to properly configure his or her firewall.  IntelliGuard does a good job of doing it for the user, sparing a lot of the confusion which can actually lead to loopholes in security.  Its scans seem to be very thorough - it immediately picked up lots of resident malware and other nonsense that Norton had quietly let live on my PC for who knows how long.  This version also touts a new "Behavior Guard" feature that supposedly catches potential threats based on monitoring suspect activity in the OS of your computer.  Put another way, a virus doesn't have to become "known" and added to everyone's update list for you to be protected from it.  How well does it work?  Well, that's difficult for the layperson to assess, but I can tell you that a month in, I'm yet to have any virus or malware-related problems and I feel much more confident than I ever did with any other retail suite.  I'll certainly update this review if anything bad happens under PC Tools' watch, however.  The PC Tools Internet Security suite comes bundled with licenses for one year of protection for three computers, so it's also a good value compared to the retail competition.  This software has actually done what none of the other competitors I've tried could do in the past:  changed my mind for the better about anti-virus software.	1
We do allot of advertising and surfing to promote some of the new features of our websites from time to time. But every now and then we come across a few websites that try to upload some malicious software to our computers. Some webmasters are just scandalous! So we're always on the look out for some extra protection against these type of threats. We've been there, done that... and we don't want a return.  If you use any type of&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Traffic-Exchange/dp/1430315768/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Traffic Exchange</a>, both manual and auto surf programs, you know exactly what we're talking about. You'll find that this program works like a charm and is a great addition to your security arsenal. However, you will need to babysit your computer, because this program will go off like a high school fire alarm and nail just about every other website on those traffic exchanges.  On most of our computers, We usually rely on IE 7's Malicous Site security feature,&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Webroot-s-Spyware-Sweeper/dp/B0016PV4NA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Webroot's Spyware Sweeper</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Norton-s-Internet-Security/dp/B001E0RZ3U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Norton's Internet Security</a>&nbsp;which hasn't let us down... yet! But I know that sometimes they are not enough.  With all of that said, I do like this program. It was very easy to upload and didn't have any conflicts with any of our other programs, epecially with the use of&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/XP-Pro-with-SP3/dp/B0018RCAD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">XP Pro with SP3</a>. It didn't hog up our resources. We did choose to dump the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Norton-s-Internet-Security/dp/B001E0RZ3U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Norton's Internet Security</a>&nbsp;before uploading this program, just in case there was a conflict with the firewall. I do recommend that you turn off your&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/External-Hard-Drives/dp/B000VZCEUI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">External Hard Drives</a>&nbsp;when uploading the program, as it does have a tendency to write the program to them, as well.  Overall, very satisfied with the program and it's compatability.	1
The computer I installed this on was a 2 year old laptop with 2gb ram and Intel Core 2 Duo processor using Windows XP.  Installation went fine, which is good since I have installed, uninstalled, and re-installed the software 3 times.  The problem I am having with it is when I start my computer nothing is responding.  The cursor works, but I cannot open anything.  Putting the cursor on the little Internet Security icon on the task bar, it either says "starting" or "stopped".  Either way the computer needs to be restarted.  Usually it would take 3-5 restarts to get the computer working.  Once my computer was working the software was fine, and I think I might actually like it.  I have no idea why this would happen, my computer starts up and runs fine with out PC Tools Internet Security.  Currently I do not have the software on my computer.	-1
I have to admit, I am really dissatisfied with how McAfee takes over my entire computer. So I gave two PC Tools products a try, and the results were very satisfying. Internet Security 2009 has been perfect so far at keeping my computer clean from any unwanted visitors. Really worth your time and money!	1
When I started using this program I was nicely suprised. It picked up a few things that McAffee and Norton had not and took care of them quickly and cleanly. I was sold. I definitely highly recommend this. Worth every penny. It works quickly and effeciently!	1
-Installation was very quick and seamless. Minimal irritating pop-up windows (unlike Norton) and gets going with updates and scan quickly. -low resource consumption -Picked up waaaaaay more spyware than Lavasoft's AdAware and Norton. -Spyware removal was quick and no problems. -Just as a point of interest: uninstallation of this software is quick and with minimal fuss (some programs are a pain to uninstall)  I suppose no one program will cover all bases. Having said that, SPYWARE Doctor is definitely worth having as an additional measure of protection given its comprehensive detection tools. Well designed for the average consumer. For me, this program will replace my Lavasoft AdAware but I will keep Norton on for a while (even if it is the most irritating of all virus/spyware programs I own) and do a more careful comparison between these two.	1
In my work I run into all sorts of computer problems.  Many are caused by Spyware and Viruses.  This product will not remove viruses but it will remove spyware.  For those of you who have not had the misfortune to run into spyware consider yourself very fortunate.  Spyware comes in many forms but the most dangerous in my opinion is keyloggers.  A keylogger is a program that records keystrokes when it detects certain activities such as online banking and credit card transactions. Once the keystrokes have been recorded they are quietly transferred to the thief and used.  I have a client who nearly lost $5,000 from his bank account due to spyware.  Spyware Doctor in my experience is the best product at finding and removing keyloggers and other spyware on the system.  Most antispyware products disable the spyware but they do not always remove all of the programming code associated with the spyware.  Spyware Doctor on the other hand appears to remove all of the spyware code.  In fact, spyware doctor often finds two or three times more files associated with spyware than do competing products.  Con:  Spyware Doctor at times really slows down the system.  Particularly after coming out of hibernation on a laptop.  PC Tools is currently beta testing an update that is supposed to improve memory usage and performance.  If the free update improves memory usage and startup performance Spyware Doctor will be tough to beat.	1

I used both webroot's spysweeeper and PC tools Spyware Dr.  Last year it seemed they were close in detections.  Now Spyware dr is giving spysweeper a daily smackdown.  Spyware  dr consistently finds things that my other AV and/or anti-malware scanners miss.  At work, I run 2 anti-malware scanners for precisely the conclusion someone might draw from the above writeup.  No two scan tools are the same in detection capabilities.  Unlike anti-virus scanners, you CAN have more than one anti-malware detectors installed on a PC; (but you would probably want to limit things to only having one software pkg running in the background, in realtime).  And if by chance they WERE close in detection abilities; then there is a good chance that the actual REMOVAL of the detected "pests" might go well for one product, while another product fails miserably at removing detection "pests".  I will say that even spyware dr had some problems in removing an ActiveX trojan and I had to use JV powertools to remove the registry infections, at the registry level.  May 1st,2009 Update:  Incredible detection and removal in an  ACTUAL, real world circumstance just a day ago.  A co-worker got infected and gave his drive to me to clean.  I hooked it up as an external hard drive, via a USB external hard drive chassis.  I first scanned it with webroot spysweeper, then kaspersky AV and then Norton internet security 2009. Kaspersky and norton found trojans and deleted them. [In case you are wondering, I have 3 home PCs, each with a different internet security suite. But all with a secondary malware  scanner, which is Spyware Dr.]  I was ready to give it back, but since I was not going to see my friend until the later, I decided to give it a final scan. So as a final scan I used Spyware doctor.  I could not believe it.  Spyware dr found a #%^$#&  "Rootkit". Plus, it removed the rootkit.  I was happy for my friend, but very unsettled that the other 3 programs did not find & delete the rootkit. After all, how many IT techs would scan a hard drive as many times as I did, and with as big a variety of software scanners as I did?  I went ahead and did a clean install of XP on a different (new) hard drive, for my friend. I advised him to install and update an Internet security suite before hooking up the external hard drive and importing any of his old data.  Pros: 1. excellent detection - beat out 3 other programs in an actual test. 2. good cleanup/removal ability 3. new updates either daily, or close to daily.  Cons: It can add some extra overhead to your pc and depending on what it is scanning, can slow your pc. Best to set up a scheduled update and scheduled scan during your off hours (like when you are sleeping).	1
I was very disappointed with this software. It doesn't support 64 bit architecture, which more and more computer users are moving to.  Without 64 bit support this product is useless.  It has a good design philosophy but until Beta testing on 64-bit support is completed it is just a waste of disk space and shelf space.  I do plan to install the 64-bit version when I get the time to test it out. Once that happens I will update my review of this product.	-1
In view of many of the other more detailed reviews, let me be brief. This is an excellent tool for detecting and deleting spyware. SpywareDoctor is easily installed and finds far more spyware than many other programs I have tried. I give it top marks!	1
Even though the new computers I buy usually come with Norton, I like to switch out to other defensive programs.  So, I uninstalled Norton's from the HP laptop and put in Spyware Doctor.  It was easy to install and has a simple interface.  Initially, I did a full scan, and that took almost 2-1/2 hours to complete!  All it found was a couple of minor items (like cookies) that I tend to delete periodically anyways. Otherwise, surfing the net was pretty easy.  The program is unobtrusive, and does not annoy you with tons of pop-ups.  Guards are categorized into "browser" "cookie" "file" "immunizer" "keylogger" "network" "process" and finally "startup".  The best way, IMO, to avoid malware, is to be smart about which sites you visit and have a healthy respect for unrecognized email address/attachments.  I also delete temp files and cookies regularly - which is very easy to do in Firefox or Internet Explorer.  I find that site checkers are really useful in surfing the web - unfortunately, I did not see that feature in this program.  There are some free programs out there that seem to work very well too; I regularly use AVG and Spybot S&D.  Spyware doctor is not free, but I like it enough to give it my rating.	1
PC Tools Spyware Doctor 2009 v6.0 is incredibly straightforward and easy to operate.  Once the software was installed, I could use program right away, rather than having to comb through a lengthly manual. After running the program, it discovered many bugs that other programs that I have used missed. I especially like the real-time feature.  I feel much more comfortable knowing that my computer is safe at all times. I highly recommend this program and am sure that others will find it easy and thorough.	1
When I tried to install this product, it caused problems on my Acer laptop with Windows XP (slow boot, hung system), so I immediately uninstalled it.  When I have time, I will try it on another, newer, PC to see if it does better.  Then I will come back and edit this review to update the results.	-1
I thought the McAfee programs were bad about being memory pigs, but I've never seen ANY program that can come even close to being as big of a HOG AS THIS ONE! With it just running in the background, and only this,I checked my Windows Task Manager and it was using over 700 MB of memory and had the CPU pegged at 100%.  Yes, my computer is a little old. But its not that bad! It has a 1.7 Ghz processor, 512 mg of ram. Its an old Dell OptiPlex GX240 with a 35 gig hard drive. So ya, it ain't a hot rod like it was when it was new but it isn't ready for the trash can yet.   The thing is, I have never seen any program use up so much memory and CPU doing nothing! I ran a couple of scans with it, one quick scan that didn't find anything and one complete scan that took over 24 hrs. It didn't find anything either.   Then I ran my old SpyBot and SpywareBlaster and they both found a few things on just a quick scan. So don't waist your money on this one or your time installing it. Unless you have at least a gig or more of RAM memory don't even think about installing this and still be able to do anything else with your computer with this just running in the background. And even if you have plenty of memory, 3 or 4 gig, it still isn't worth installing. Not in my opinion anyway. There are several other programs that do better and use less and a lot of them are free.   Overall I'm very disappointed in this program and I would not recommend it to any one.	-1
I was interested in SpywareDoctor because of some good reviews about the product that I have read. That is important to me since I am no computer expert. The next thing I look for is ease of use and customer service. If I have a problem I want to be able to reach someone who can help me without charging me extra money.  PC tools website says customer service is open 21 hours a day. I have called a number of times with questions both for customer service and technical support and my calls were answered without a wait. The people I talked to were knowledgeable and I got the answers I needed. I have a competitor's software that I have purchased for a number of years and it takes forever to reach someone and if there is a problem there is a charge to speak to anyone with any real knowledge. So I do like SpywareDoctor. Quality accessible free support makes a real difference.  I did compare what spyware SpywareDoctor found on my computer to a free download I use as well as a competitor's product I purchased and I found SpywareDoctor found more spyware on my computer than the other two programs.  SpywareDoctor is easy to install, has good customer support, gets good reviews and the price is good as well. I recommend it.	1
I installed this program today and my observations are:  Pros: - Very easy to install. - Gave you the option to update after installation, which I did.  Updates listed out prior to download and allowed me the option to install only the updates I wanted.  I installed them all but thought this was a nice touch. - After install, I scanned my PC for spyware. It took about 6 minutes.  Spyware Doctor found 8 different types of infections.  It graded the risk of each type as Low or Medium, I had no High risk infections.  It also gave a count of each type of infection and a description of what each one was.  I then had the option to pick and choose what I wanted cleaned off.  This was important because the software picked up one infection that was a legitimate application but that uses registry keys that some people find undesirable.  I cleaned off everything without setting a restore point. The cleanup was very quick.  Cons: - None noted but the true measurement of software like this is how effective it is at getting everything that's on my PC.  I ran my virus software after Spyware Doctor to see if it would pick up anything else. After 20 minutes I shut it down, tired of waiting. However, in that time it didn't find any spyware.  Overall: Recommended.	1
Doesn't it stink that there are people out there who have nothing better to do than to SPY on you through your computer?  Besides the invasion of privacy that this creates where you are afraid to type any sensitive information on your computer fearing it will be stolen, these spyware programs bog down your computer and make it incredibly inefficient.  That's exactly what happened to my wife's computer before it was destroyed by the Koobface virus that hit Facebook.  We've replaced that computer and armed her with some of the best protection programs on the market today--including PC TOOLS SPYWARE DOCTOR 2009 VERSION 6.0.  We are confident any damage that could result from spyware on her new computer will be prevented and look forward to many years of protection using this easy-to-install software.	1
I have to admit, I am really dissatisfied with how McAfee takes over my entire computer. So I gave two PC Tools products a try, and the results were very satisfying. Spyware Doctor gets rid of all those annoying tracker cookies and pop-ups and "You Just Won A Million Dollars! Click Here!" ads that make surfing less than perfect. Give it a try!	1
A quick and to the point review of PCtools anti-spyware:  How does PCtools compare with the rest of the anti-spyware in the market ? PCtools is the best, I have personally tried and tested Mcshield, Trend micro ...  PCtools is the best in both protecting your computer as well as having the least performance impact on the processing.  Will PCtools protect and remove all the spyware on my computer ? Yes, it is remove most (90%) of the spyware, but not all. Download and install a free version of 'super anti spyware' - which will be able to remove most of the spyware on your computer.  Trust me, it is not a rogue wave, the free version works pretty well.  Will PCtools slow down the performance of my computer ? To some extent yes, but if you bought your computer anywhere in the last 5 years, the configuration should be good enough to run PCtools antispyware without much impact on the performance.  Why should you buy a buy a anti-spyware ? There are lots of free anti-spyware, but very few of them really work and remove the spyware on your computer.  Infact there are equally good number of rogue-antispyware which promise to remove spyware, but they are spyware themselves.  Here is a listing of all the rogue anti-spyware, so pls stay away from installing any of these: [...]  How is the support ? I am not too sure, you judge yourself with my experience with PCtools support :  my laptop was infected with Trojan. FakeAlert on Saturday evening and I created a ticket with PCtools online, I even uploaded the results of a malware detective utility that came with the scanner - there was no response from them till Monday morning and when I checked the status of the ticket - it was in closed status.  They did not even let me know that it was closed.  However, on Sunday I had resolved the issues myself by using the free Super anti-spyware hence did not worry too much about followin up with them.	1
If I could change my star rating, I would give it only 2 or 3 stars.  When someone invents a way to protect computers and web browsers from viruses without bogging down the computer, I'll be the first to try it.  Cons: After using this a couple times I found that it increased my computer's "boot up" time to over 2 minutes longer than it was.  Most spy-ware or scanning devices have the same problem, so I don't see anything here that makes it stand out from any other software. I have to turn "Intelligard" off completely to do any web surfing.  I didn't pay for DSL so I could have my browser slowed to a crawl by the PC tools program.  There is also no easy way to uninstall it!  It won't show up on my list of programs on the control panel, nor are there any instructions in the help files on how to get rid of it.  So, in a way, this PC Tools program has become like the things it is supposed to be protecting my computer from!  It takes up memory and I can't get rid of it.  Pros: It's easy to use, and gives you options as to what you might want to delete versus not.  It describes the risk level and type of risk, even offers to save a "go back" point/version in case you decide you deleted something you shouldn't have, and need to "go back."  Keeps a history file so you can see later what was removed.  I liked the option of having it automatically download and install updates without my having to affirm window after window in order to do so.  I also like that I can use it on up to three computers at home.  It didn't hog up a ton of memory on my hard drive.  It found several things that Norton and McAfee missed.  I had tried "ad-aware" but that program only caused more problems than it helped- (buggy, slow, incomplete coverage, etc.)  Overall, I'm very disappointed with this program and the way it has slowed my computer down to a crawl when starting up.	1
It's very frustrating, but after years of using Quicken, they've finally given sufficient reason to abandon it. Download of financial information has not worked for over a month; erroneous prices get imported into the program, and it take hours to remove it. Quicken's response is to say 2 things simultaneously: 1. They fixed it, and 2. Mutual fund price download doesn't work. Unless you agree with that definition of "fixed," it's time to look elsewhere.	-1
I found Quicken 2009 Deluxe Edition to be nothing but frustration.  I've had lots of problems hooking up Quicken to multiple banks. It will work one day and then stop working for a month. I've found it nearly impossible to reconcile financial accounts with Quicken balances.  The Quicken user interface is klutzy. You have to bang on a field few times to get it to open. The user interface is inconsistent across the program. The user interface is so vast and complex that it's hard to find anything. The user is presented with massive drop-down lists of various types of transactions, all with who-knows-what-side effects and restriction. This is an example of software automation taken to the point of unusability.  I can manage my finances on a spreadsheet faster than I can battle Quicken to make it do what it is supposed to.	-1
Intuit is a despicable company now. This is the same that company came out with really functional and reasonably priced products in early 1990's like Quicken, Quickbooks & Turbotax.  But somewhere in late 1990's this company was taken over by the same crooks who run the Wall Street. Instead of attracting users to upgrade to their product's new versions by improving them, like Apple does, the nitwits at Intuit blackmail you to upgrade to newer versions of Intuit products by taking away the functionality of earlier versions. For example they are blackmailing users into upgrading to Quicken 2009 by dropping support for online banking in earlier versions; and to Quickbooks 2009 by dropping support for payroll in earlier versions.  Now Intuit's motto is to gouge the customers as much as they can by hook or crook (mostly) by extorting them to upgrade to a poorly functional and buggy newer version.  1. They are forcing Quicken users to upgrade to 2009 version by blackmailing them: dropping support for online banking in earlier versions.  2. The newer version, Quicken 2009, is poorly functioning & buggy (as detailed by other reviewers too), not a better product.  The program shuts down every time I try to accept an individual downloaded transaction. The only way to stop that is to click on "Accept all"  2. Periodically the programs refuses to read the file and I have to restore the backup file. I used to backup once a month with earlier versions and now I do it every time I exit the program.  4. Online support to download transactions is also limited: for example I cannot download transactions for my credit card from Charles Schwab Bank.  5. After the upgrade they provide very limited technical support. For all practical purposes there is no technical support. They do not even provide a tech support phone number to call. You can contact them from the web site when they provide you with a useless ticket number. Instead they direct to Quicken User Communities. After taking your money, they want other users of Quickbooks to provide you with technical support!  6. So Intuit got your money, you got a buggy software with poor functionality, and no technical support. You cannot even do now what you were able to do in an earlier version. You paid money to go from a functioning product to a buggy software.  What a trade off! Basically Intuit screwed you.  Purchasing Quicken is, of course, just the beginning of the upgrade ordeal. Real nightmare starts when  you start getting all those error messages.  After you install Quicken 2009, you will find that it has become cluttered with useless features that you do not even need.  At the end you are left with the feeling: Intuit has screwed me.  Every time you deal with Intuit, you will be left with a bad taste and hate for this company.  Not only they blackmail you into upgrading, every time you have to pay the full price of newer version, there is no upgrade price. And you can get Quicken cheaper at Amazon than buying from Intuit directly.  I hate dealing with Intuit and dumped their Turbotax for Taxact in 2004 and was planning to dump Quicken for Mint. And now they have purchased Mint!  What are the alternatives to Quicken? Please leave your response in the comments section and help us dump Quicken.	-1
I was a loyal quicken user from the early 1990s until about two years ago, when I switched to MS Money.  Since that is now defunct, I am back to Quicken.  I am not a power-user and only use it to track account balances and monitor my investment performance.  A key function to me is the ability for it to communicate with my banks and update balances and transaction details.  The program does a thousand other things I simply do not care about.  My two gripes:  1) before buying I set up a quickenonline account (which is free) to make sure my banks were available for online downloads.  ING Retirement - my firm's 401(k) - was available on the free quickenonline version.  When I set up the quicken deluxe 2009 paid version, I could not locate the ING Retirement financial institution.  I contacted quicken support - which is based overseas and takes FOREVER to connect to via phone or internet chat - and they confirmed that ING Retirement is available on the free version, but not the paid version.  Feels like a bait and switch to me.  Oh, also I can't seem to get PayPal to work - but quicken says that is a "known problem."  2) the program is extremely slow.  I have a brand new computer with tons of ram and fast quad core processors.  There is no reason the program should take 10 seconds to load and a few seconds to respond to each command.  I'm diappointed.  The program does tons of things very few people use, but the basic functions are still not polished - even after 15 years or more.  Now that MS Money is out of the picture there is no competition and probably no incentive for them to improve.  Expect the cost to go up and the quality to go down.	-1
I have been a beta tester for Quicken (Windows) for a number of years.  Each year I think "I don't think anything can be improved over last year's."  And each year new additions and improvements are made.  I have been using the final version for a month and I have no complaints and I am very happy with its performance. RDA	1
I've used Quicken since the late 80s. I've tried MS Money, as well as other small accounting programs, but I always come back to Quicken. Though there are small things I do not like about Quicken (all the commercial stuff that gets offered) over all, I really think it is the best personal accounting system on the market. It is extremely easy to use. It looks just like a check book register, so there's nothing to using it to keep track of basic spending. It's also easy to set up categories and sub categories (like UTILITIES:SoCalGAS, UTILITIES:DWP) for your transactions so you can put everything into spending groups, for taxes or specialized reports, or just to be able to print out the payments to a particular payee or category like "INSURANCE:Health". Once you put in your credit card accounts, Quicken will be able to download every transaction for you, and put it right where it belongs. Those are just some of the very basic things Quicken can do. At years end, you can see exactly what you spent and where. But the things I love the best... you can attach PDF notes or scanned documents to each transaction. I download most of my bills now a days, utilities and credit card statements, and I when I make a payment, I click the attachment like and attach my statement and the online receipt I got when I authorized a payment. On CDs or other bank accounts, I click the interest transaction and attach the statements that to with that account. I attach all my utility bills to the payment transactions and receipts for items with warranties, so I always have them with the click of a button. I can run reports and print them in PDF format, so I can email a payee with all the information about monies I've paid to clear up any disputes Or I can export all transaction to a payee to excel. The new interface is more customizable than previous version, making it easier to set up the way you like to work. You can pay bills in Quicken, or do anything any of the others do, but I think Quicken is easier to learn and more reliable. I know that other accounting programs offer many of the same features, but over the years I've NEVER lost a file in Quicken. I've never had a problem upgrading a file or running reports on files that go back as far as 1988.	1

I am a CPA and accountant. I wanted a product to keep track of my finances. My father in law recommended this product so I went for it. I am very disappointed with this program. First, the program crashes frequently. Second, expense reports are much inferior to what most credit cards let you create online. The expense report created by quicken classify about 50% of my transaction in categories, the rest is dumped into a residual category - while online expense reports that credit card companies provide classify about 100% of my transactions correctly. A report that covers 50% of my transactions does me little good. Overall I find the software cumbersome, very intransparent, slow, and not helpful at all. I will be going back to my excel spread sheets that provided a lot more flexibility and a lot more transparency. I am amazed by some of the reviews I am seeing here on amazon.	-1
This is a good product...the defacto standard for personal money managet software.  However,I was basically forced to upgrade as Intuit stopped supporting my previous version.  Intuit "milks" it's users.  They come out with a new verion of the software every year by tweeking and rearranging rather minor item or features of the software with little real improvement over the previous additions....sometimes going backwards in terms of learning curve and real usability.  The product is good, but the companies upgrade practices are a pain in the butt.	1
Total crap.  My personal Excel file is more efficient.  Main gripes:    loads junk onto desktop   institutional interfaces, when they work, are corrupt and result in error   cumbersome edit features	-1
I foolishly decided to upgrade my 2007 version of Quicken to 2009 after being prompted by Quicken to do so. I figured the new version would potentially offer some improvements from the 2007 version, and specifically I was hoping that it would download my Vanguard ROTH IRA information correctly since my existing version never could tell the difference between a stock purchase and a cash transaction...  I am fanatical about backing up my data, and so I have several copies of my Quicken file that are on an external drive, as well as one uploaded to my online data cache in case of a fire. Without these backups, installing Quicken 2009 would have ended in tragedy.  Immediately after going through the update installation and first running the program, I knew there was a real issue. Almost all of my data was jumbled, with a total loss of historical data (including uploaded images of bank statements, canceled checks, etc). The program was sluggish, and when I ran the download function, nothing but my bank transactions and one of my credit cards downloaded. I double checked passwords and they were correct. The download failed again and every subsequent attempt I made failed as well.  I decided to start with a clean slate and deleted all Quicken files and registry entries, rebooted, and ran the installer again. This time the program did convert my old data file correctly and my historical data was intact.  However, the program still doesn't import my ROTH IRA transactions correctly, and the new layout is very poorly designed and frustrating to use. I use QuickBooks non-profit at work every day, and the differences between Quicken and their professional software seem to increase with ever permutation of Quicken. They have gone for a reductionist philosophy of design, and my making everything simplistic, have further eroded my ability to easily generate reports, track spending across categories, etc...  Overall this is an unnecessary update that includes nothing of substantial value. Worse, the new interface is poor and I find myself wishing for my 2007 version which I am seriously considering re-installing. Issues with the corruption of my data file suggest that the program has major bugs. I cannot recommend the program to anyone except those who are forced to upgrade (Users of 2006 and older versions of Quicken). If you do decided to upgrade, I strongly recommend you back up your data file to an external location before making the upgrade in case Quicken 2009 eats your data file. I also advise you to do an uninstall of the older version before installing the new version.	-1
I too have experienced downloading bank transactions with quicken premier 2009 XP version.  It would help if reviewers would indicate the operating system they are using.  Are the problems occuring with both vista and XP?? it is not clear.  I went back to quicken premier 2007.	-1
I have been using Quicken since it was a DOS version and it gets better each year, it is a great program and can be as simple or as complex as your needs may require. Highly recommend, I would use no other finiancial software. I have been a Beta tester for Quicken and each version gets easier to use, especially the 2009 version of Quicken Premiere.	1
I've got to say that I don't think I've ever seen so many 1 star reviews for anything here on Amazon.  So needless to say, I was VERY hesitant about upgrading to Quicken 2009.  When it comes to the world of personal finance software, we as the general public have very limited choices.  I've used Quicken since the DOS days and moved over to Money, then back to Quicken.  My most recent version was 2006.  I booted it up and it told me it was time to upgrade because they will stop supporting online downloads come 4/30/09.  Initially I was pretty hacked off...like a lot of others here.  Then I took a deep breath, and did the math.  I think my Deluxe version cost me about $20 somewhere (eBay perhaps??) so let's do the math together shall we?  $20/3 years is about $6.67 a year.  Holy Break The Bank Batman!!  Seriously people. Quit griping.  How about you not drink 2 Starbucks all year long and put it in your "Upgrade Quicken" jar.  This upgrade cost me $39 direct from Quicken and took 17 minutes to download.  So let's do the math for the next 3 years, shall we? $39/3 years is a wallet busting $13 a year!!  Skip your $5 footlong at Subway 3 times all year long and you can afford the upgrade...amazing isn't it?  The upgrade was flawless on my XP machine.  Double-clicked the start-up icon and away we went.  It found my previous version and un-installed it, installed the new version and ran for the first time.  It immediately found an update so I accepted it.  After the update, the program opened to the main screen.  All of my files imported flawlessly and I was downloading my newest transactions immediately thereafter.  One of the best improvements is how you can copy digital images into the register.  In my old version, I had to save the file to my desktop and then add it through a few clicks.  Now all I have to do is right click the image, click copy, open Quicken attachment and paste from clipboard.  Genius I tell you!  The interface has a very "gel" "XP" look to it.  I'm not a real big fan of that look, but I'm not going to rate it 1 or 2 stars because of it.  All in all, the upgrade, download, install and running of the program worked great for me.  So if you're reading all of these 1 and 2 star reviews, I'm living proof the program works, and works well.	1
[These comments are based on my continuing nightmare of lousy experiences with Quicken Deluxe 2008. This software, which has been getting continually worse since 2002, couldn't have possibly improved since then ... ]  For me Quicken 2008 was a forced/hostage upgrade from Quicken 2005. You "have" to upgrade since they've cut a deal with the financial institutions to cut off your online access with the institutions if you don't upgrade every three years. Just as found when I was hostage upgraded in 2005 from 2002, there's nothing more than a cosmetic face-lift, no meaningful fixes/improvements -- but there's even more bugs, problems and aggravation.  * Product now will not connect properly to Fidelity; no problem under 2005.  * Took forever to figure out how to turn off a "reminder" function ... that kept reminding me to pay bills already scheduled to be paid using the auto-pay function. 2005 did the same thing and it's not been fixed.  *You can turn off the product registration nag screen ... if you Google to find out how. Product does not have to be registered to use it.  * Un-reconciles accounts six months back every once in a while. I've been assuming that's being caused by a few bytes of bad data that occasionally comes from the financial institutions ... that the Quicken people have not properly coded so as to filter out. This bug also surfaced in 2005. Two weeks into 2008, I've seen it again already.  * You can't turn off the "free update/revision" nag screen unless you take the update. No such nag screen in 2005.  * When connecting, the completion screen used to show which accounts had new transactions to match and had convenient buttons next to each to take you directly to the account. Gone in 2008. Now I have to look through every account each time to see where transactions might have been retrieved.  * Icons everywhere attempting to peddle other unwanted Quicken products. One of the 'product improvements' in 2008.  * Doesn't handle stock distributions correctly (since they were not actually paid for); keeps generating error messages when you enter the correct posting of no cost incurred. Same problem in 2005.  * Tricky screens/checkboxes/prompts that try to bait you into using/enrolling for QuickenDot services when you don't have to or need to. Users that did so now post complaints they can't undo it and that the QuickenDot server is constantly down, causing problems/delays when trying to connect to other accounts using a one-step update.  Yet another company that's grown totally complacent about product quality while wallowing in its assured-for-the-moment revenue stream. It will bite them hard in the long-run. Postings indicate similar complaining regarding the major competitor product, Microsoft Money. If history is any lesson, there's no reason to suspect that these software products will ever get better under these conditions. Some other product will have to steal their customer base before they wake up and smell the coffee.  If you are not already committed to either of those two products, take a good long look at open source software such as GNU Cash.  [Update: April 15, 2008] Does now connect to Fidelity ... occasionally. When I opened the portfolio area today, the entire computer screen flashed with confusion and the product crashed. 2005 never once crashed. Still flashing but no subsequent crashes. Who knows what happened. Not me. Apparently not Quicken programmers either.  [Update: July 12, 2008] Connects to Fidelity now more or less on regular basis. Software still flashes/flickers routinely. Also slow to load, apparently trying to read every single record into RAM, regardless of age. Pop-up screen this morning stating "We've noticed you are not downloading your current Quicken Visa/MasterCard transactions, click here to ..." I don't have one. Obviously a deceptive come-on intended to trick users into the application process for a Quicken credit card. Nice. Still constantly beg-screens me to take the latest software update.  [Update: October 18, 2008] Just downloaded this week's financial transactions and Quicken wiped out four months of reconciliation on one of my credit cards ... again.  [Update: January 10, 2009] Tried to change the amount of an annual repeating payment. Refused to accept the change with the error message "You must make this change and sign on no later than six days before scheduled payment." Payment was set for April 4, 2009, almost three months in the future. I had to delete the payment, log on to make the deletion take effect, then enter the payment all over again for the new amount, then log on again to make that payment take effect. And when I tried to log on I rec'd an error message stating an Internet connection was not detected (a message I get rather often despite my always-on broadband). Luckily I can choose the "Ignore" button and it will go ahead and connect. Quicken programming staff = worthless carpetbaggers.  [Update: March 5, 2009] Wanted to stop an ongoing monthly repeating payment where the next scheduled payment was already in place in my register for March 27. I edited in a change for "how many times" from "unlimited" to "1." In other words, I wanted to pay on March 27 for the last time. When I logged on to the bank the first time, Quicken canceled the March 27 payment.  Now doesn't that take the cake--Quicken accounting/finance software programmers are unable to count up to one. And, as all too often anymore, the screen went wacko while I was logging onto the bank.  [Update: March 8, 2009] Quicken just UNreconciled one of my credit cards (again) back to the October, 2008 close. Luckily, its a card I don't use much. I suppose this has something to do with Quicken software coders not understanding the start of Daylight Savings Time.  [Update: March 27, 2009] The repeating payment change I referred to at March 5, 2009? The saga continues. When I tried to enter the NEW repeating payment, it wouldn't take. I entered it, connected to the bank and nothing happened. The payment did not show in the list of repeating payments or in the register. I tried deleting the payee entirely to start over, but Quicken wouldn't/won't let me delete that payee at all. It claims it cannot be deleted because there is a repeating payment in effect ... that would be the payment that is ALREADY canceled. Which means I can't cancel it so I can't delete the payee. To set up the new payment I ended up having to create an entire new payee to make the new payment 'take.' I had to put a dash in the middle of the account number to create the new payee since Quicken won't allow two repeating payments with the exact same account number. And I am still stuck with the old payee on file which I cannot delete at all. I had to call the bank twice just to make sure the durn payment is actually going to be made on time ... and made only once ... and for the correct amount. You would think there would be a way to force deletion of a payee. Then again YOU are thinking, Quicken programmers on the other hand are off somewhere slurping down a latte.  [Update: April 2, 2009] Have an established monthly recurring payment of $[...] and would like to change it to $[...]. Enter the Online Center, click on Repeating. There it is. Click on it then select Edit. Change the amount from $[...] to $[...]. Save the change. Seems simple enough. Log on to the bank. Result: (1) Quicken cancels the next pending payment, on April 19, of $[...]. So far so good. (2) Quicken enters a pending payment into the checkbook register for $[...] dated May 19. Huh? What happened to my April payment? God only knows what will happen if I tinker with this recurring payment any further. I will write a paper check for one month ... and hope for the best. A[...]  [Update: July 14, 2009] Quicken is popping up a screen telling me I am overdue on a July 10 payment to a vendor for $[...]. The register shows the payment was made and cleared on July 10. And it's reminding me to schedule another future payment ... that's already scheduled. It's the same durn thing I was talking about in bullet # 2 at the top of the review, apparently it's a zombie bug that has now risen from the dead. Still begs me to take the Quicken software update constantly.  [Update: September 15, 2009] Quicken has suddenly started reminding me ... once again ... that certain bills are overdue, even though they've already been paid using the automatic monthly payment function. It asks me if I want to delete, pay or skip. I can only guess what havoc might occur if I delete or skip ... so I just keep waiting for the nag screen to eventually go away.  When Quicken goes under, I'm going to wear a pink tuxedo to the funeral.  NOTE: I have posted a copy of this review under "Quicken 2010 Deluxe" and I will add any further comments and updates to that post.]	-1
I recently upgraded to Quicken Deluxe 2009 from the 2008 version of the same product.  I have no regrets, and believe it was well-worth the money.  I find the program works smoother and faster for me than 2008.  Converting my data files was a snap, and I have experienced no problems downloading transactions from my bank.  Not purchasing Quicken 2009 immediately upon release may account for my lack of issues with it.  I always wait until my bank insures compatibility with a new version before I buy it. The delay also gives Intuit time to correct any bugs that existed initially.  The graphics are fresher and brighter for 2009.  The task bar is a welcome addition.  Navigating through the program is easier than in previous versions.  If you use personal financial software several times each day, as I do, then this upgrade is easily worth the price in the improvements present.  If you are considering Quicken for the first time, I am aware of no other financial management package that comes to close to the quality and features found here.	1
First let me say that I do believe that every new version of any program is going to have issues. I've never used a totally bug free program with a new released version. Second, I've used the 2009 versions of Quicken for months and I've not seen the problem some have complained about here. All my accounts have always updated properly, on all my computers ( two desktops and three laptops). It can be true that some banks take time to update their systems to be compatible with newer versions of accounting programs. That is not just Quicken, but all the programs. If you check with any accounting agency they will all tell you they recommend Quicken over the others and to update to stay current. Third, I have NEVER, in nearly 20 years, EVER lost a file in Quicken. The only possible way to lose a file or have a corrupted file is to NOT backup as the program tells you to every time you close it. I can still use files from the 1980s, converted, updated and original files in old, saved versions of the program.  I've used Quicken since the late 80s. I've tried MS Money, as well as other small accounting programs, but I always come back to Quicken. Though there are small things I do not like about Quicken (all the commercial stuff that gets offered) over all, I really think it is the best personal accounting system on the market. It is extremely easy to use. It looks just like a check book register, so there's nothing to using it to keep track of basic spending. It's also easy to set up categories and sub categories (like UTILITIES:SoCalGAS, UTILITIES:DWP) for your transactions so you can put everything into spending groups, for taxes or specialized reports, or just to be able to print out the payments to a particular payee or category like "INSURANCE:Health". Once you put in your credit card accounts, Quicken will be able to download every transaction for you, and put it right where it belongs. Those are just some of the very basic things Quicken can do. At years end, you can see exactly what you spent and where. But the things I love the best... you can attach PDF notes or scanned documents to each transaction. I download most of my bills now a days, utilities and credit card statements, and I when I make a payment, I click the attachment like and attach my statement and the online receipt I got when I authorized a payment. On CDs or other bank accounts, I click the interest transaction and attach the statements that to with that account. I attach all my utility bills to the payment transactions and receipts for items with warranties, so I always have them with the click of a button. I can run reports and print them in PDF format, so I can email a payee with all the information about monies I've paid to clear up any disputes Or I can export all transaction to a payee to excel. The new interface is more customizable than previous version, making it easier to set up the way you like to work. You can pay bills in Quicken, or do anything any of the others do, but I think Quicken is easier to learn and more reliable. I know that other accounting programs offer many of the same features, but over the years I've NEVER lost a file in Quicken. I've never had a problem upgrading a file or running reports on files that go back as far as 1988.	1
I have been using Quicken 2009 for a couple months as a beta tester. There are some great improvements that will be noticed by all users, new setup tab makes the installation a breeze and the tab screen layout is very helpful. The beta helpdesk people who took our calls and emails were very interested in following up on the smallest issue and following it through to completion. Good job Intuit!!	1
Intuit is a despicable company now. This is the same that company came out with really functional and reasonably priced products in early 1990's like Quicken, Quickbooks & Turbotax.  But somewhere in late 1990's this company was taken over by the same crooks who run the Wall Street. Instead of attracting users to upgrade to their product's new versions by improving them, like Apple does, the nitwits at Intuit blackmail you to upgrade to newer versions of Intuit products by taking away the functionality of earlier versions. For example they are blackmailing users into upgrading to Quicken 2009 by dropping support for online banking in earlier versions; and to Quickbooks 2009 by dropping support for payroll in earlier versions.  Now Intuit's motto is to gouge the customers as much as they can by hook or crook (mostly) by extorting them to upgrade to a poorly functional and buggy newer version.  1. They are forcing Quicken users to upgrade to 2009 version by blackmailing them: dropping support for online banking in earlier versions.  2. The newer version, Quicken 2009, is poorly functioning & buggy (as detailed by other reviewers too), not a better product. The program shuts down every time I try to accept an individual downloaded transaction. The only way to stop that is to click on "Accept all"  2. Periodically the programs refuses to read the file and I have to restore the backup file. I used to backup once a month with earlier versions and now I do it every time I exit the program.  4. Online support to download transactions is also limited: for example I cannot download transactions for my credit card from Charles Schwab Bank.  5. After the upgrade they provide very limited technical support. For all practical purposes there is no technical support. They do not even provide a tech support phone number to call. You can contact them from the web site when they provide you with a useless ticket number. Instead they direct to Quicken User Communities. After taking your money, they want other users of Quickbooks to provide you with technical support!  6. So Intuit got your money, you got a buggy software with poor functionality, and no technical support. You cannot even do now what you were able to do in an earlier version. You paid money to go from a functioning product to a buggy software.  What a trade off! Basically Intuit screwed you.  Purchasing Quicken is, of course, just the beginning of the upgrade ordeal. Real nightmare starts when you start getting all those error messages. After you install Quicken 2009, you will find that it has become cluttered with useless features that you do not even need. At the end you are left with the feeling: Intuit has screwed me.  Every time you deal with Intuit, you will be left with a bad taste and hate for this company. Not only they blackmail you into upgrading, every time you have to pay the full price of newer version, there is no upgrade price. And you can get Quicken cheaper at Amazon than buying from Intuit directly.  I hate dealing with Intuit and dumped their Turbotax for Taxact in 2004 and was planning to dump Quicken for Mint. And now they have purchased Mint! What are the alternatives to Quicken? Please leave your response in the comments section and help us dump Quicken.	-1
Still the same good product, but some tasks have been made easier and I like the tab functionality better than the old buttons.  A good upgrade!	1
A financial software such as Quicken is suppose to make your life easier, which it was doing that when it first came out in the 15 years ago. But Intuit has slowly added a lot of "features" to Quicken over the years and made it more complex than it doesn't really need to be as a personal/small business financial software.  Each upgrade is not seamless, there's always something that doesn't match during the upgrade. Then you have to spend your valuable time to changes the unmatched records from the previous version to the upgrade. Now, Intuit is forcing the owner of Quicken 2006 to upgrade to 2009 by shouting down 2006 online features. That is an unethical tactic by any measurements.  There are only so many feature you need in a personal/small business financial software. Yet, Intuit is coming up "new feature" every year, which is fine for new user. But forcing the previous owners to upgrade by shouting down the services that was already sold? That is just low.  Intuit, DO NOT BITE THE HANDS THAT FEED YOU. We've supported you over 15 years. If you shout down the services we've already bought, we WILL file a class action law suit.	-1
I've had it with Quicken. From its bizarre copy protection schemes to the endless promotions of its own products within the program and some of the dumbest programming decisions around, such as downloading all transactions from a single financial institution into one account, even though you have separated them into multiple accounts. I don't need Quicken making these decisions for me.    The endless selling is intrusive and annoying. You have to be very careful that you aren't initiating some process that won't end up having you cancel it later.    Quicken's help file is ridiculous. It is incomplete or in many instances uses terms that are different than those used in the program itself. All too often the sketchy help file entries refer you to an equally poorly written and uninformative web entry - where Intuit attempts to sell you more of their products and services.    Because they were first to market and did a passable job in their early years, Quicken dominates the market. But, in my opinion, for the past several years, Intuit has abused its own customer base. I'm tired of it, tired of the endless marketing promotions in the programs, tired of the lousy help, tired of the ridiculous inflexibility of the program. I'll be looking elsewhere in the future and leave these moneygrubbers behind.  Jerry	-1
I use this primarily for cloning hard drives. see my "So you'd like to ... Guide" on "Protect your computer against a hard drive failure."	1
First of all, this version was new until just a couple of months ago and according to Acronis Customer Support, they have no inclination to have this software support Windows 7. Why? Because they want you to buy the new version, 2010. Even if you recently purchased 2009, you're just out of luck here. (Unless you purchased it in their 30 day window), but they did run a nice promotion for 2009 just outside of the official 2010 release. Customer service is slow. Very slow, and not at all helpful. They expect you to purchase a full license for all your networked computers with no discounts to apply them to say the laptop you also have (again according to customer service.).  The software itself is okay, but without customer service, inability to have this on multiple computers, and abandoning their old version, I can't suggest this company or any of it's products to anyone else. Also, prepare for a lot, a lot of promotional material in your inbox from this company.  Update: I finally installed Windows 7, and as I expected out of dozens of software I installed, this was the one and only one that would not work, and for a 2009 edition, completely unacceptable. Acronis is simply not up to par with their competitors.	-1
I purchased this software from Amazon about two months ago, installed it on my vista computer and backed up my hard drive to an external drive. I had problems from the start, it didn't back up everything, confusing boxes I didn't check, confusing terms were used to describe the backup, confusing ways to check out what had been backed up. Finally figured out how to back it all up. Then disaster hit my Dell. The hard drive crashed, but WAIT! I KNOW A TRICK! I have a backup! Not so fast mister, popped in the disaster disk, loaded it up, got these really confusing terminology acronims, what the heck did it all mean? stumbled through the steps, got this progress window, it had two green bars in it, one said "current operation progress", the other said "Total Progress", the total progress bar filled up, it stalled on "1 minute and 23 seconds left", the other window was filing at the rate of wet paint drying, not even noticeable movement. I assumed it had hung up, tried it again, same thing, only now I noticed the movement and now assumed that they had the bars reversed in the window. I waited, i waited, 8 hours later it said "FINISHED!", Yes I shouted, I rebooted, I waited, the black screen of death, nothing,my new hard drive was as dead as my old one, I got out my trusty retired Toshiba and went to ACRONIS, searched the forums for an answer, there was none, there is no support there, none, I will now have to reload my hard drive from scratch, even the D drive was taken from me by ACRONIS 2009, what a swell program, thank GOD I got it at a reduced rate, a sale, a real steal.  Somehow I feel cheated, but then all I have to do is look around me at the world, look at what we have become, dependent on a stupid machine, its horribly written programs, its insulting support people, the "figure it out yourself", folks, who don't care if you ever come back. Cheated? Naw, I guess I got what all these other people got who gave this program a ONE STAR rating. I got nothing in return, I only wasted my time, probably less than a couple of weeks. I only blew $40 bucks, less than a full tank of cheap gas, not even pocket change for our new government. Is everybody happy now?	-1
Besides disk 'cloning' - which is the reason I purchased it - True Image offers numerous backup and protection options and adds a number of utilities meant to preserve one's privacy by allowing to truly erase files and truly remove all traces of online activity.  True Image allowed me to upgrade my laptop's drive from a puny 60GB 2.5" SATA to a 500GB 2.5" SATA and do it without having to reinstall the OS, apply the service packs and then reinstall and configure 100 different little apps. True Image allowed me to do all of the above in about one hour, saving me countless hours of painful patching, reinstalling and reconfiguring. ____________________________ DISK CLONING:  The Utilities section has a 'clone' option that would copy EVERYTHING, including the Master Boot Record/Sector (MBR) from the puny 60GB drive unto the 500GB while allowing me to control the size of the active partition - this while the 500GB was connected through a USB wire and the laptop booted off the program's CD.  Once the operation completed (50 minutes) I simply removed the old 60GB drive off my laptop and replaced it with the 500GB drive. Once the laptop was turned back on it booted up happily, with a 200GB master partition and a 300GB second partition. There are 3 words that I have to use to describe the process: PERFECTION and COMPLETE SATISFACTION. This capability alone is worth the price of this product.  True Image even offers the option to completely clean up the old drive - for privacy - once the cloning completes - I did not dare to that but I may do it later. ____________________________  The backup/restore/recovery/protection features are numerous and they allow for a great deal of flexibility. I will probably add to this review later, after I become more familiar with them - there is a 135-page manual to read. At this time, I set up a backup schedule that would work while the computer is idle, whenever the external storage media happens to be plugged in.  Additional utilities include:  - Drive cleanser - remove confidential information. - File shredder - completely erases the selected files. - System cleanup - destroys all traces of usage history. - Try and decide - which I haven't tried yet, would allow me to install 'stuff' I find on the Internet and, if anything bad happens or I don't like what I got, it will restore my environment to what it was before I got myself adventurous.  I wish it was possible to grant this product more than 5 stars. This is a MUST HAVE for those who wish to replace the drive that came with their laptop and not go through the pain and frustrations associated with reinstalling and reconfiguring everything. ______________________________ Note to Acronis:  Did you REALLY HAVE to force your customers to enter a SIXTY-FOUR CHARACTERS activation string?	1

There is little to like and a lot to dislike about this program.  It insists on making you operate its way, and tries to force you to schedule everything, schedule, schedule, schedule. "Do it our way, and do it when we damned well tell you to do it."  For example, when you just want to do a quick backup, it has all sorts of calender nonsense, even though it's just a backup.  It won't use your name for the backup, so you end up with backup1, backup2, backup3, etc., with no easy clue as to when it was made and what is in the backup.  It does not have conventional menus to get you where you need to go, you have to fumble around and try to find something that looks like it might be what you want.  But few of the usual options are available.  In other words, the programmers are so convinced that you are stupid and have no idea what you want, that they have made it essentially useless.  There there is the fact that it takes up a whopping 123 mb on your disk, and forces you to load a "service" that runs all the time, slowing down and clogging up your machine (and perhaps conflicting with a program you really need). Yet another program by programmers who apparently believe that your only purpose in having a computer is running their "wonderful" software.  My son has a previous version of this software that I've used on his machine, and although I didn't like it much, at least it was functional.  I can't say the same about 2009.  I've uninstalled it, I haven't decided whether to throw it away or donate  it.  It's certainly not something I'm willing to use.	-1
If you have any problems you will not be able to get any tech support. In fact it is highly unlikely that you will ever be able to reach anyone at Acronis. I tried repeatedly using every method possible and nothing worked. Look for another product. Definitely not recommended. The product will not work with external drives. After 2 months I finally got a response but it was not an answer to my original problem but a just a question as to whether the issue was resolved! To solve my problem I bought another product that worked fine and told this to Acronis. Their new response was another question as to whether they could consider the case resolved. These people are really unbelievable. Strongly not recommended.	-1
great	1
I run Norton Internet Security on two 64-bit Vista Home Premium PCs.  It works great!  I'm impressed.  So I bought another copy to install on a 32-bit version of Premium, and a 32-bit version of XP Home.  It installed nicely and went about its business getting the latest updates and scanning my system.  However ...  I routinely right-clicked an icon on my desktop and Windows Explorer "had to close".  I tried everything I could think of, including pouring over Internet suggestions for 4 hours with no success.  Finally I rolled back to before I had installed Norton and Windows stopped being a jerk.  I googled for the error message with "Norton Internet Security" and found on a Norton support site that they were aware of the problem but there was no solution that I could use.  When a company reaches a certain size, it seems that they become incapable of fixing problems in their own products.  So, 5 stars if it works, and 1 star if not.	-1
NAV 2009 is so much faster than previous versions. I can browse and shop online knowing my laptop is protected. I recommend this product to everyone. I use it on my game computer and it run smoth. I'll recomend this solution for everone, there is no better solution out there in the shop's.	1
I should know; I've tried all the major vendors McAfee is as almost everyone knows is so sh**ty that they give it away. AVG is temperamental, based in Malta and you get zero customer service and I don't think that they even speak English as I've never gotten a reply from technical support. 360 is for amateurs; if you know how to work a PC, buy Internet Security because when they release the updated version you get it free for the rest of your subscription.	1
Norton Antivirus 2009 is one of the best antivirus software.   *  stops viruses, spyware, bots, worms and malicious threats   *  great interface   *  good virus database   *  it works on Windows Vista and XP	1
I bought this after trying it from Symantec.  I could not recommend it highly enough; if you're uncertain, I strongly recommend that you download the 14-day trial from their site and try it out.  It is by far the best security suite out there.  I have had older versions of Symantec/Norton, which were horrible - bloated memory hogs that offered minimal protection.  I went in search of something else when my Kaspersky 7 failed to catch a worm, and I had to restore from backup.  PC Magazine and others were raving about this, and I tried it.  What is good? - The memory footprint is tiny for a full security suite. - The CPU usage is also minimal for a full security suite. - It locks down IE and Firefox so downloads get scanned BEFORE they are saved to the hard disk, further minimizing risk. - It offers the best protection against viruses, worms, malware, and phishing.  Don't believe me?  Check [...] - It is easy to use.  Seriously, you could put this on your mom's computer without becoming her tech support department. - It recieves updates not daily, nor hourly, but as they are released.  On average, new signatures are added every few minutes!!!  What is bad? - Some of the more advanced features like firewall ports and specific scan settings can be hard to find in the simplified user interface. - I have not tested the anti-spam, but I have heard it takes some training for it to work right.	1
Installing Norton Internet Security has always been one of the least favorite things to do.  I have stayed with Norton because of its preformance.  This year upon installing with a CD all I got was a window wanting to install or modify Dell Support 3.2; then nothing.  Upon contact with Norton support they recomended that I just use the 2009 product code on my existing 2008 NIS; they told me the two products are the same.  As for the install problem they said to call Dell.  Dell now charges for support.  I wonder what Norton will tell me next year if I stick with their product?  Update 4/3/2009  Found the solution to the DS 3.2, it is at C:Dell\drivers\R130222\setup.exe. Just change the setup.exe to setup.old and the Norton program will install..... almost.  Have two on going problems both related to incompatiblity with other existing Norton programs. The problems are an error message that indicates a necessary file could not be loaded PIF:AlertEng.dll and the 2009 virus program will not be recognized.  Both problems appear to be related to the other Norton programs.  At this point I will stay with NIS 2008 for the next 11 months, then probably try another program next year.  Norton is not a bad program I have used it for many years, the teck service has gotten very bad.	-1
I'm not kidding when I say avoid Symantec as your Anti-Virus provider. This is probably one of the absolute worst companies I've dealt with.  VERY POOR support, and awful licensing structure. Worse, the myriad of useless web pages is not warming, to say the least.  Good luck finding/activating your updates and upgrades.  I admit that I'm not the swiftest when it comes to Symantec's solution, but I've had an easier time with Kaspersky, Sophos, Trend Micro, McAfee, AVG, F-PROT, avast, and Comodo.  I've even had better experience with older Symantec products not even five years ago.  So, if you want an exercise in futility, give 'em a go. Otherwise, save yourself some tears.  I will never buy another Norton/Symantec product again.	-1
WARNING to anyone thinking about buying this product! Please understand that you will not be buying this product only RENTING it. If you do not renew every year the product stops working....COMPLETELY! I'm not just talking about updates, etc. It actually tells you that it has stopped working and it won't work unless you renew. I have just wasted more than 2 hours with Norton's online tech support. This is the case with ALL Norton products and I am quoting the tech.	-1
I have been installing Windows systems since Windows for Work Groups and this is not a winner.  If you are not an experienced IT person,then you should just buy a preinstalled version from HP or whomever.  This is basically a bastardized SBS 2003 (with some fancy peer backup programs that use WIM files) that will not let you run most,if not all user desktop apps.  This is M$ marketing at work at it's most fiendish.  Here are a list of issues:  1)It cannot be used as a workstation,so forget about installing Office or whatever without having to hack the user account settings.  2)A number of printers (Brother networked all in ones)will not work because the install program will not recognize the OS.  3)Updates quit working after a while.  4)Admin is a nightmare,in that the client piece has trouble updating from the main server piece.  The price has dropped from $[...] bucks list to about $[...] in less than a year.  You want to know why?  It's going to be ditched reeeeeeeal soon ,as in dead product!  Get XP or Win7  and buy a 3rd part backup program like Acronis or Bounce back and run these in a peer mode.  This product is a certified loser!  Can you say ME or Vista?	-1
The online banking does not work. My bank, Wells Fargo, said it is a QuickBooks problem. Guess what?  QuickBooks wants to charge me to fix it! If you Google "QuickBooks Pro 2009 online banking" you will see endless complaints. Wish I'd done this before wasting my money on a bad software program.	-1
I was told to upgrade to Quickbooks by my accountant, I was using Quicken Home and Business 2009. I went to there web site and it said it would convert the Quicken files to QuickBooks. It would not convert the files said I had two many files????? So I copied to disk and deleted most of them only keep the 2009 files,then tried again. All I can say is what a joke, it would have been easier to just put in the data by hand. So after all this I called to get some help on converting the next company and found it it was going to cost me for any support. Also after trying to convert the files, Quicken could not open them. So I had to use my backups to get Quicken working again, looks like I just wasted $99.00 and after reading about the online banking issues looks like I'm glad I didn't get it working.	-1
Our accountant insisted we do this upgrade.  We have been using Quickbooks since 2000 and are used to having to upgrade on a regular basis, but this has been the worst.  We have a small business with at any one time 6-9 employees and receive money from a few sources, usually direct deposit.  We have two accounts and only one is on QB.  Our bookkeeper is also my assistant (very competent and conscientious)and I do all the technical stuff because I (usually) like to do it.  QB 2009 has nearly brought us to our knees.  I'm running it on a single computer, DID NOT install Google Toolbar or whatever it was this time-- seems every time I install a program any more I have tool bars pushed at me, and QB 2009 has made the computer slow to a crawl.  Right now I've shut down the anti-virus and the computer is functional (barely).  I had to talk fast to prevent my bookkeeper from calling Intuit and yelling at anyone who answered the phone.  She's fuming right how at how much harder it is to do paychecks and I am hiding in my office writing this.  QB is running (crawling more like it) on a newish computer with XP Home Service Pack 3, meets or better all minimum hardware requirements.  I'm totally at a loss but I expect I'm gong to be spending the next few days trying to track down the problem-- forget about customer disservice. No help there.  Edited to Add:  I received a comment from the company that I responded to by sending an email to the address given.  The email I received back essentially suggest three actions I had already tried.  I finally ended up buying another computer and installed it on the new computer (running XP Home by the way).  The program is still slow to load but it does work.  The next time my accountant suggests upgrading though we are going to have a serious discussion about the problems involved with this upgrade. It could easily come down to Quickbooks or our business.	-1
Intuit is a despicable company now. This is the same that company came out with really functional and reasonably priced products in early 1990's like Quicken, Quickbooks & Turbotax.  But somewhere in late 1990's this company was taken over by the same crooks who run the Wall Street. Instead of attracting users to upgrade to their product's new versions by improving them, like Apple does, the nitwits at Intuit blackmail you to upgrade to newer versions of Intuit products by  taking away the functionality of earlier versions.  For example they are blackmailing users into upgrading to Quickbooks 2009 by dropping support for payroll in earlier versions; and to Quicken 2009 by dropping support for online banking in earlier versions.  Now Intuit's motto is to gouge the customers as much as they can by hook or crook (mostly) by extorting them to upgrade to a poorly functional and buggy newer version.  1. They are forcing Quickbooks users to upgrade to 2009 version by blackmailing them: dropping support for payroll in earlier versions.  2. The newer version, Quickbooks 2009, is poorly functioning & buggy (as detailed by other reviewers), not a better product. They have omitted useful features like the ability to add multiple downloaded transactions from the bank.  3. After the upgrade they provide very limited technical support.  For all practical purposes there is no technical support. They do not even provide a tech support phone number to call. You can contact them from the web site when they provide you with a useless ticket number. Instead they direct to QuickBooks User Communities. After taking your money, they want other users of Quickbooks to provide you with technical support!  4. So Intuit got your money, you got a buggy software with poor functionality, and no technical support. You cannot even do now what you were able to do in an earlier version.  What a trade off! Basically Intuit screwed you.  5. And heaven forbid if you sign for Quickbooks full payroll service. You will have money taken out of your account with no explanation and when you call, you will be on hold for hours! Here they follow  the chapter from old AOL: make it easy to sign up and impossible to cancel! You can sign up for payroll service online by one click but if you have to make a phone call to cancel.  6. Quickbooks Payroll subscription is automatically renewed for year to year whether you want it or not. Call to the sales department is answered right away, and to customer support takes minutes and hours. After holding on the phone for minutes and hours, you will be forced to give up and the only way left to cancel subscription is to stop payment to Quickbooks on your credit card.  7. Online support to download transactions is very limited: for example I cannot download transactions for my credit card from Charles Schwab Bank.  Purchasing Quickbooks is, of course, just the beginning of the upgrade ordeal. Real nightmare starts when start installation and you start getting all those error messages. And while you waiting for technical support, you start browsing the user forums, and often your problem is solved by other users before the technical support even gets back to you. As one of the other users has pointed out, it is better to do a clean fresh install than upgrade. And if you able to install Quickbooks 2009, you will find that it has lost of functionality of the earlier versions, as detailed by other users. At the end you are left with the feeling: Intuit has screwed me.  Every time you deal with Intuit, you will be left with a bad taste and hate for this company. For example Quickbooks sales rep told me that he was giving me great deal for Quicbooks 2009 by selling me for one hundred and twenty and then I found out that i could have it at Amazon for one hundred(now they have raised the price). Not only they blackmail you into upgrading, every time you have to pay the price of newer version, there is no upgrade price.  I hate dealing with Intuit and dumped their Turbotax for Taxact in 2004 and am planning to dump Quicken for Mint. My only reason to use Quickbooks for business accounting is for payroll. This software is begging for competition. Are there any alternatives to business payroll like Quicbooks Payroll? Please leave your response in the comments section and help us dump Quickbooks.	-1
If you download transactions (checks, credit card transactions) as most businesses do -- DO NOT BUY QB 2009.  It is simply not functional.  I've used QB, Quicken and Turbo Tax for 14 years.  I have no idea what Greg Wright the Director of Product Management for QuickBooks was thinking, but he should be fired... at once.  They've had this product out for months and it is still not useable.  In Dec, Greg said he was passionate about fixing it.  I could care less about passion -- users need results.  You can read forum reviews for the specifics... but trust me, the online banking function is unusable -- and I've used it since it became available.	-1
Microsoft just gave me a FREE upgrade to Accounting 2009 as they did everybody who bought any previous version.  Unlike the notoriously unreliable Quickbooks it actually worked the first time without spending 2 hours on the phone with some outsourced technical support incompetent form Pakistan or India whose only "s0olution" was that I find another PC to install it on.  I used Quickbooks in the past and liked it but ever since the migration to .NET architecture it is notoriously unreliable.  There is just too much risk that an update will cause the dreaded open and then immediately close problem.  I won't risk my business on it.	-1
Not very pleased with this product, bought it to upgrade my older 2005 version & it is actually not as good as the old program. Push pins did not import properly & graphics are not a sharp as older version. Also errors in the new program are the same as in the old program.  For me it was a complete waste of money doing the upgrade. That said a newbie to the program might have a different feeling then I do and may like the program not knowing how the older version performed.  That is why I rated it as a 2 instead of a 1.	-1
In these days of online mapping, is there a necessity for a program as Streets & Trips? I suppose that in a case when one needed the ability to map out a destination with no Internet in sight (my jaded, snarky self asks whether such a place exists!), I suppose Streets & Trips 2009 would come in quite handy then, supposing one happened to have a compute (surely a laptop) on hand.  Barring that, one supposes, the good old paper map would be the fall back. Remember those?  All joking aside, Streets & Trips 2009 is a fine enough product, but one that seems to be losing the battle for computer-based "ordinary user" mapping (the hardcore GIS folks don't even bother with such trifling mapping software). Coupled with a GPS unit, one can perhaps start to see where the usability factor starts ramping up over the usual online mapping providers, but even then, portable GPS units with built-in mapping and turn-by-turn directions are cheap enough to give real competition to Streets & Trips which requires a mobile computer together with all that wire going between it and the GPS unit.  Installing is easy and so is actually using the software. Featuring an intuitive interface with nice buttons, I wish the printed maps could happen without having to also print out a background "texture" color and the route line sometimes obscures the names of the streets, but this piece of software is not what I would classify as a must-have. A nice-to-have, sure, but well, it left me a bit lackluster overall.  Now, Google Maps!	-1
McAfee Anti-Theft 2009 1 User needs Activation, to get the updates, and I would assume to register. It would be more ideal if written into the code of this activation was the Name of the person so that theft of any key files could be traced. This uses vaults to safeguard personal files , and for each password protected vault there is a set of three pre-defined questions if you forget your password ( no room is given for a user defined field). There are ten questions in these fields, and all seem to be standard social engineering style questions, and therefore accessible by someone skilled in that area; a definite risk factor. After the the solution questions, you then create the Vault Name, Size, and password. An advanced button allows for some more detailed manipulation.  The anti-theft step 3 gives instructions on how to secure one and only copies of files ( a risky prospect, but one useful for security ). When needed the vault can be transferred. Apart from the lack of any useful instruction on Password quality ( you would think a password generator might be included or even suggested) there is little to help secure the vaults. Whilst a person familiar with standard and non -standard security will get a good run on this software, the average user should steer clear of this item since it is eminently hackable, and if you are seriously after a way to secure files, and/or Drive contents, there are better, and far more secure options.	-1
Overall, this program worked well (e.g. fairly easy install, fairly fast performance).  One of the primary stated benefits that I found compelling was the ability to protect files on an external USB drive that you might switch between multiple computers.  For example, I generally work on my desktop at home, and then put files onto an external USB hard drive to take on the road with my laptop.  In order to actually achieve this benefit, however, you actually have to install McAfee on BOTH machines.  The one you may have used to create the vault (in my case desktop), as well as the one you want to eventually access the vault from (in my case laptop).  I didn't have time to read the user agreement in full detail, but I'm pretty sure this requires purchasing 2 copies of this software in order to be in compliance with the license.  Also, this means that if you put a vault on an external USB drive and then want to access that vault from another computer that does not already have McAfee Anti-Theft installed, you cannot.  This is a major shortcoming in many travel scenarios, when I often take my USB drive with me, but don't take my laptop. Instead, using a public/Cafe computer or some other local/borrowed machine when I get where I am going.  This scenario is not supported, unless you plan on taking the installation CD with you everywhere, and even then, you are not likely to have admin rights on public machines to install the software.	-1
I suppose people who use only free security downloads may have use for this program - if they really need to keep some files unavailable to other family members.  I doubt that Police, or any High School hacker, will have much difficulty getting access.  Still, it is another barrier.  I installed this program on my laptop running XP Professional.  Their was no problem loading, and no problems setting it up the first time I used it.  But, I have absolutely no use for this program.  McAfee brags that it will work with Norton and many other security programs, and it does work with my Norton 360.  However, Norton 360 includes a similar anti-theft feature using a vault.  It is just one of seventeen features.  Worse, it ignores the possibility of simply saving files you do not want anyone else to see on a memory card. You hide the card when you turn off your computer.  I do this with my Palm PDA files, just sticking the card in a drawer.  I would do this with porn if I had any, only I would hide it better.  HeHe  Save your money, and save space on your computer.  In my humble opinion, this program just isn't worth the trouble.	-1
I feel like a dunce writing this review, but frankly, I just can't figure this software out. I think I'm a reasonably intelligent and tech-savvy person, but I just don't find VideoStudio -at all- intuitive.  In all fairness, I have zero experience with video-editing software, and I haven't sat down and thumbed through the manual at length. I was looking for something that would help me quickly edit videos of my kids -- nothing fancy -- and jumped at the chance to review this software, since so many people seem to love it. I must be missing something, because I eventually gave up in frustration!	-1
I upgraded to X2 thinking that the bugs had been worked out but they have not.  The software takes forever to load and will frequently crash (locks up).  I decided (based on a professional photographer's suggestion) to spend the money to get Adobe Lightroom which is a fantastic product that I highly recommend.  I also bought Adobe CS3 (one version older than the current version, to save money) and find that I rarely use it.  X2 is cheap and when it works it is easy and powerful enough for most people's needs.  However, the unreliability of the software leads me to not recommend this product.	-1
An absolute disaster.  PC Fix-it Utilities 9 Professional software is a DISASTER.  I spent over 3 hours working on it, about over 10 total reboots, and the machine is faster with some things but is MUCH more unstable.  However, I CAN'T USE OUTLOOK AT ALL now, since it says it can't find MAPI32. DLL anymore and now Outlook says I should reinstall Outlook.  I tried getting a MAPI32. DLL from another machine and that doesn't seem to work either.  Every time it boots, Windows installer starts up 4 windows, and sometimes it hangs, and sometimes it boots up completely after it flashes through a bunch of other windows installers.  I hate  - the company who made it - Staples who sold it - and some dirtbag named Bill Machrone at PC magazine online who endorsed it.  Spare yourselves.	-1

It worked well for a while, but then went haywire on my Mac pro. I attempted to uninstall the old and install version 2, but it would not do a clean uninstall and kept the old corrupted settings. When you call tech support you get an endless loop and not help. It's fine for a time, but if you have problems, you are out of luck.	-1
I'm a former software QA tester (alpha and beta) so I have quite a bit of impatience with companies that release software that doesn't work right out of the box on all sorts of machines.  A good software company will test their software on multiple configurations.  Obviously other users are reporting excellent results, but that doesn't mean everyone will.  I have used Parallels 3.0 since it came out and I was overall satisfied, but found it a little slow.  Fusion 2.0 was released and I thought it would be a great way to get faster speed because that's what VMware was claiming and many users are reporting.  My biggest beef is the importation of existing virtual machines.  I have Win XP on my Mac that I use with Parallels.  VMware states that you can import from Parallels.  One, the process of importation is NOT intuitive and is made far more difficult than it should be.  Whoever designed this interface is not a Mac user.  Second, Fusion refused to accept the import stating that the virtual machine wasn't properly shut down.  So I go into Parallels and make sure that XP was been completely stopped.  Quit Parallels and go back to Fusion . . . oops, couldn't go back - first time in YEARS I saw the Mac gray crash screen.  I have never seen it on my Intel Mac until now.  I'm fine with Parallels.  I simply wanted to try Fusion because everyone said it was faster.  Yes, I could call customer support, but I that should NOT be necessary. I don't have patience for this kind of baloney, especially on my Mac.  It should work right out of the box, period.  I probably have hundred or more programs on my Mac and not one comes even close to being as big a pain as Fusion was in terms of installation.  Obviously many users have seen great results.  I did not.  Tread carefully or perhaps wait for VMware to release a major update.	-1
Turbo Thief" I have been a TT user for 15 years and a beta tester several times. The product itself is pretty good but the greed at Intuit is unbearable. In 2005, TT eliminated the free e-file coupon and raised the price. Now in 2008, TT again raises the price, charges for 1 e-file (weather you use it or not) and limits the number of returns to only 1. At half the current price, the product would be expensive. Now the cost is outright obscene. I couldn't possibly recommend TurboTax anymore.  I have read all the negative recommendations and blog posts here on Amazon and think "Larry" sums them all up.. "A name change is in order for this product now. It should be called 'Turbo-Thievery'."	-1
I've been using TurboTax and Quicken for many years and with each new version I buy, I edge closer to looking at the competition. This year's TurboTax is probably pushing me over the line.    First, I truly hate the endless in-your-face advertising for other Intuit products. I am buying a software product and paying a healthy price for the usability of the software - not to have an endless stream of ads for other Intuit products shoved in my face.    Secondly, TurboTax's help system is just plain awful. This is the first year I received Social Security payments - and I had questions about their taxability. I had to go through three layers of help menus before winding up with an official IRS publication. Why have three layers of superfluous inapplicable information?    Intuit pushes a lot of the burden online for help, which is not the most efficient - or helpful - facility to use.    Picking up your last year's tax return as a starting point for the current year is not a wise move. Better to start from scratch.    The "guided interview" is ridiculous. A one size fits all approach wastes a lot of your time.    Overall, I think this is my last year of not considering alternatives to TurboTax. Intuit has done a lot of rotten things to its customers. A few years back, they implemented a copy protection scheme that could cripple your computer. This year they implemented an outlandish charge for printing alternate returns. On both occasions, Intuit backed down with an explanation that they "blundered" - but not before trying to rip off their customers.    Hopefully there is an equivalent or better product out there because I am fed up with TurboTax and its arrogance toward its customers.  Jerry	-1
TurboTax 2007 caused me hours of wasted time. If I hadn't noticed that it didn't deduct what I had entered for section 179 depreciation, then I would have paid thousands more tax. Other people had the same problem based on what I saw on their support forum. I suspect TurboTax 2008 will also have its share of bugs and problems. SO CHECK YOUR RETURN CAREFULLY BEFORE YOU FILE! Also, expect it to nickel and dime you when you want to do a relative's return (or someone else's) after you've done your own. But I'm going to be nice and give them 2 stars because the competition also has its issues.  UPDATE 2008-12-29: Policy has changed and you now get "FREE: 5 federal e-files and unlimited printed returns included with every TurboTax 2008 product." Thanks, Intuit, for listening and responding!  UPDATE 2008-12-30: Product does not say it is compatible with Vista 64-bit, but it seems to be working for me on Vista 64-bit.	-1
Okay, I've had it. Every year, Turbotax charges more and offers less - and if you read the many comments here, you'll see that they went WAY over the top this time around with their attempt to charge users another $9.95 for each additional return printed by the software.  Let's be clear about something: each year's Turbotax is a DISPOSABLE product that will get used once or twice, and then discarded when the next year comes around. That already makes the "per use" charge higher than ANY other software I own. More than MS Office, more than Final Cut Pro.  Owing to lack of competition (Taxcut offers no Home & Business version for Mac users), Intuit charges sky high prices and offers no significant tech support. And now, the software largely forces you to use eFile (not "free," but another reason the cost has climbed) making it easier - and therefore more likely - for the IRS to decide to audit you.  If Intuit really cared about their customer base and treated them right, they'd have a money pump: I know I'd buy every year, and so would most Mac users. But instead, every year brings new problems, new limitations, new raises in price...and the same old contempt.  By the way, users reading these reviews should know that many (MANY!) one-star reviews were removed after Intuit made some conciliatory changes to their price structure in response to outraged customers. Otherwise, the combined star rating would be even worse than it is now.  Sorry, Intuit, I've had it. I'm gone.  ------------- UPDATE Feb 2008  Okay, I caved and bought TT just to stay consistent with previous years (though I found it for about $50 less than what Intuit wanted me to pay for it). Even so, I've been hugely disappointed that the program just doesn't work as well as in previous years.  Owing to (needless) interface changes, it seems that whole categories of expenses and deductions get skipped unless you go back to find them manually. The program then helpfully double-entered all my investment dividends, giving me the opportunity to pay twice the necessary tax.  Additionally frustrating was the fact that TT repeatedly failed to help me enter or calculate taxes, but instead simply told me that I'd need to contact the IRS for publications and forms. This is NOT what I expect from Intuit's most expensive tax product - and it's especially unacceptable in that I'm preparing a very uncomplicated return (funny how a lack of income will do that, huh?)  I'll wait until after tax time to see if I can pick up a dirt cheap copy of TaxCut, and give it a try. Unless it stinks on ice, that's what I'll be using instead of TurboTax in the future.	-1
I have been using this for years, but this year it proved to be an exercise in frustration. I had to file an amended return and the program had two contradictory sets of instructions or this. Twice I followed them only to go into an endless loop, and have amended forms that failed to show the original information. Over the years this program has gotten worse, and a lot more expensive. It used to be a good value, but now it is a cumbersome, bloated waste of money. Next year I plan to shop for another program. If you are thinking about buying this, note carefully that the number of one star ratings is higher than the number of five star ratings. This speaks volumes.	-1
I just finished my federal/state return on TurboTax and the experience motivates me to seek an alternate supplier for my next year's filing.  To my surprise, this year's edition of TurboTax appears to be harder to use, more cumbersome, less trustworthy than the previous year's.  - Entries that I had little difficulty filing last year - local income tax (yes, we have that) paid to the local tax collector but not recorded on the W2 - were buried in a maze of difficult to comprehend options hiding behind the cheerful, 'easy to use' interface. - Information, once entered, is sometimes hard to retrieve or readjust. The program creates dozens of worksheets and forms, most of them useless or unneeded and it's not easy to get to the source entry for some specific item of information. It's all in there, mind you, but so is the needle hiding in that proverbial haystack. - Attempts to revise or check information force a choice between plunging into the 'user-friendly' and largely redundant branch or the confusing maze of inter-connected forms, schedules and worksheets where it's difficult to impossible to anticipate the consequences of adjusting some specific figure to the return overall. - The program seems to be generating its own errors by creating worksheets on its own and then, when error-checking is run, finding that it doesn't have sufficient information to back... nothing. For example, it didn't know how much income did I generate by using my house as a home office, even though I never even HINTED that I did that. - The HELP engine that comes with the program is almost completely useless and its online branches are from 'inconsistent' to 'frustrating' to 'maddening'. For example. I was able to find some online discussions on how to enter my local income tax amount but I had to spend some precious time navigating through the HELP maze. In may case, I found another customer's advice but, it turns out, in most cases, you must first crate a UserID on the 'LiveCommunity'. And, of course, for ONLY $29.95 some 'live' adviser would be happily and cheerfully answer any basic question that you may have that the HELP facility should have included to begin with.  I am lucky because my tax return is relatively simple but I can see how much more frustrating the experience could be for those whose tax return needs are more sophisticated than mine.  I've been a TurboTax user for more years than I can remember but it is unlikely that I will be using TurboTax next year.	-1
I bought this software with two goals:  1. Have it import all my stock trading information to prevent hours of data entry. 2. eFile my return to get my rebate ASAP, so I could pay off some credit cards and avoid paying interest.  Unfortunately, TurboTax failed at both those tasks.  When first importing stock trading information from my online brokerage, it didn't calculate the cost basis, which meant that TurboTax literally tried to add $20,000 in taxes for what should have been a tax deduction because of a net loss.  I realized the error (things like that tend to *ahem* get my attention) and was able to research and enter the correct data after a few hours of work, but I'm disappointed because the avoidance of labor was one of the things I thought I paid for when I bought the "Premier" edition.  To make matters worse, TurboTax won't let me eFile! When I got to the end of my return, TurboTax told me that because I filled out part of a Schedule H (nanny tax) form, eFile isn't allowed because of what they said was "IRS Regulation".  Leary of the error message, I researched the matter and discovered the only time when both the IRS and Intuit's TurboTax site mention the form in question is to say it's supported for eFiling! I called support about it, and they saw no reason why an eFile shouldn't be allowed, so I'm assuming the problem is another bug.  What frustrates me the most about that is, 1. I paid for the eFile as part of the purchase price of the software and 2. since I want to pay off credit cards with my tax refund, the extra weeks required for paper mailing vs. eFiling mean more interest payments for me!  Also worth noting is that support calls require long hold times, and all the undertrained support reps do is search their website for help files, so they don't do anything you can't do yourself and they aren't especially helpful (especially on the day when the TurboTax website crashed and they had no other resource to fall back on).  The one thing I'll say about TurboTax is at least it beats researching and filling out paper returns by hand, and it imported last year's tax return information from an old TurboTax file.  The bottom line is that I expected more, and am ultimately disappointed, but it did at least save a little work over trying to figure all the forms out myself. If I had to do it over again, I'd probably go with H&R Block TaxCut instead.  UPDATE: After some waiting and heavy Googling, I discovered the reason I couldn't eFile was because I didn't check a box that said I paid my nanny's state unemployment tax by April 15, 2009. The good news is that I was able to eFile, but I still give TurboTax a demerit for not being able to tell me what was holding things up, either through the error message or telephone/email support.	-1
Turbo Thief" I have been a TT user for 15 years and a beta tester several times. The product itself is pretty good but the greed at Intuit is unbearable. In 2005, TT eliminated the free e-file coupon and raised the price. Now in 2008, TT again raises the price, charges for 1 e-file (weather you use it or not) and limits the number of returns to only 1. At half the current price, the product would be expensive. Now the cost is outright obscene. I couldn't possibly recommend TurboTax anymore.  I have read all the negative recommendations and blog posts here on Amazon and think "Larry" sums them all up.. "A name change is in order for this product now. It should be called 'Turbo-Thievery'."	-1

Clumsy interface and poorly designed. After using it, it told me I had to pay Federal and State taxes. I took my paperwork to a CPA and received a refund form both! Save your money and take your taxes to a qualified tax preparer.	-1
Despite what their website says, the importing of prior year's tax returns is buggy if you used the online version last year. I decided to go with the desktop version after their online version kept hanging (probably due to overload near the end of the tax deadline).  I downloaded this and found that it refused to import my TXF file from last years returns, despite the fact that I followed their online directions to a "T".  This is incredibly frustrating, because the whole origin of this difficulty is their determination to make each year's program not open any other year's, except for importing as prior returns. (That's why each year has a different file suffix.) They are clearly more interesting is squeezing as much money as possible out of you than in providing a quality product.  The only thing I can say in their favor is that after one hour and 10 minutes on hold, they finally gave me my money back...	-1

TurboTax 2007 caused me hours of wasted time. If I hadn't noticed that it didn't deduct what I had entered for section 179 depreciation, then I would have paid thousands more tax. Other people had the same problem based on what I saw on their support forum. I suspect TurboTax 2008 will also have its share of bugs and problems. SO CHECK YOUR RETURN CAREFULLY BEFORE YOU FILE! Also, expect it to nickel and dime you when you want to do a relative's return (or someone else's) after you've done your own. But I'm going to be nice and give them 2 stars because the competition also has its issues.  UPDATE 2008-12-29: Policy has changed and you now get "FREE: 5 federal e-files and unlimited printed returns included with every TurboTax 2008 product." Thanks, Intuit, for listening and responding!  UPDATE 2008-12-30: Product does not say it is compatible with Vista 64-bit, but it seems to be working for me on Vista 64-bit.	-1
As a reviewer with out the internet and self preparer, they still do not allow you do yor state return with out first accessing the internet. I had the samr problem last year and I am frustrated. I think next year, I will go back to doing it by hand and save money. Now they wanted to charge a fee to print returns. Lets get real, they should make Turbo Tax for the mass not only those lucky few who are able to afford the internet.  While I realize the internet is here and I fully support it, not all of us have access yet. What about us.  Alos when you go to print this year's copy, you get a "Not Finalized, do not Mail"  how can this be.  The form stays the same each year and the can update the information by November when the last tax issues are presented and voted on in congress.  I think I am going to try tax cut next year.	-1

Second year using TaxCut since I switched from TurboTax. The efile is $19.95 for a state return and was not available as a prepaid option this year. A big step back in the actual program was having to 'look' for an itemization. Right click in a cell, create an itemization. Go back to that field later and try to pull up the embedded itemization.... you are presented with a list of forms... WHAT! This is absurd, you have to hunt for the itemization. This is like going back to 1988. Since the interview doesn't list what form you are in at the time its difficult to find an itemization. That's why I started naming my itemizations. I can't remember TurboTax ever having this silliness.	-1
I bought TaxCut because at the time TurboTax had a stupid policy of charging an extra $10 for each printed tax return.  They later reversed this, but I had already started preparing a year-end planning pro forma return using TaxCut.  Now that I've used the product, it would have been better to stick with TurboTax even if I had to pay extra to print a planning return.  (And of course, now TurboTax has dropped that stupid charge, so it's no longer a problem.)  TaxCut advantages:  (1) it's a little cheaper, and (2) it has some limited audit protection service built in.  While I don't think it's as good as the extra-cost ($35) audit offering available for TurboTax, but for a relatively simple return it may save you from buying that kind of insurance.  That's it.  In every other way TurboTax is better.  Here are just some of the TaxCut deficiencies:  (1) Interview is MUCH less thorough.  I found numerous areas where TurboTax takes you through detail with explanations while TaxCut just has you fill in a number without a lot of explanation.  (2) One-click relevent help for each entry -- TaxCut often sends you to a generic help page that's not relevent, while TurboTax usually gives you immediate specific details about that particular line.  The TaxCut online help is poor. (3) One-click access to itemized lists.  Both products let you enter a mini-spreadsheet to sum totals for any entry.  But when you go to re-open a list, TurboTax takes you right to the list, while TaxCut just gives you a menu of all the lists in your return, with no hint of which is which other than Form and Line Number.  If you have a form open you can know the form and line number, but if you're in the middle of an interview screen you need to have it all memorized, or else open the lists by trial and error. (4) Import from Quicken had a number of errors which needed manual correction.  I could go on with user interface and feature deficiences, but I'll close with problems when installing updates.  I went through a lot of trouble when the product said it needed to update itself, which it proceeded to do, except the update didn't actually happen so it kept saying it still needed an update.  TaxCut support responded promptly via online chat, but gave me bad advice involving dubious system startup changes.  I actually found the solution in another one of these Amazon reviews when I did Google searches to find people who might have answers.  This burned off a number of hours I could have spent doing something else!  I do think TaxCut is adequate for relatively simple returns but I'm giving it a low 2-star rating because the alternative is quite a bit better and the prices aren't much different.  PS when comparing prices, don't forget that the cost to do STATE efile is big.  (TurboTax also dings you for state efile.) Remember that to gain the benefit of TaxCut's bundled audit assistance for your state return, you must efile.  PPS I also reviewed TurboTax 2008 when users were rebelling against the stupid pay-for-print policy.  At the time I gave them one star, but now that the policy has changed I would raise my rating, except Amazon has no way to change a rating once published.  If you happen to see both reviews, TurboTax is the better product.	-1
Putting it plainly, I am not the most adept at this sort of thing and I'm sorry to say I couldn't get this to work.	-1
The quality of captured video is not so good...grainy and colors not accurate. But the most annoying issue is that as you are capturing the video, it randomly gives the "PROTECTED SIGNAL" error and stops the process. The roxio says this error will appear if you are capturing copyrighted video, but these are my own. That's the whole point of using this! found that many people are facing the same issue. I do not recommend purchasing this product.	-1
Save your money for when there are groupon deals for converting your VHS.  I only had 6 tapes I wanted converted, thankfully most of my important recording were on DV Tape.  You will end wasting your time trying to reconfigure the settings and the setup to keep the video/audio synced.  Even when you disable all security software and nothing else running the program cannot handle the conversion. Not sure if it the software or the cable connection.  I cannot recommend this product.	-1
I was never able to get this program to work correctly for transferring VHS to DVD. I tried a few times then finally gave up. I want to try using it to digitize some old vinyl records but unfortunately our turntable doesn't have the needed connections. If we ever update our turntable, I will try  this program  & update my review.	-1
I had some old VHS home movies I was hoping to make digital copies of to preserve the memories in a more lasting format. This software appeared to be the answer. Unfortunately installation is marred by error messages. Even when you get it installed trying to get a decent looking image out of the software is painful. This isn't nearly as user friendly as it claims. You're better off taking your VHS to a local restoration shop and paying the extra to have it done right.	-1
I was unable to get this to complete a whole DVD of content. I wasted almost an entire spool of DVD's. I have given up trying to get this to work. I will probably end up using a service like Stash Space. I have less than 10 tapes that are worthy of converting so it will be worth having a pro do it. I wanted this to work so bad!  I received this product free of charge to try through the vine program. Would I spend my own money on this? No	-1
I was moments away from purchasing this at a retail store even though the only feature I really wanted was the ability to burn HD-format video onto a standard DVD (obviously with less time per disc due to the much smaller storage size). This was the number-one touted feature on the box (and on the Amazon website). I didn't have my reading glasses with me and almost missed the itty-bitty 2-point type down at the bottom that said that this feature was only available with a separate purchase of a special plug-in only available from Roxio. What the crud? This is SOFTWARE, not a mechanical device... if the software doesn't support the feature it advertises, then IT"S NOT A FEATURE... the plug-in is a separate software product and they should not be able to advertise it as part of the parent application! This is one of the most misleading cheats I've ever seen. At least on the web-site they don't hide it in 2-point type, you just have to follow the asterisks. If it's still worth it to you, and you don't mind rewarding deceptive marketing practices, the plug-in is available at the Roxio web site for twenty bucks extra. Let me know how it works, cuz' I ain't buying it.	-1
Roxio does not even try to behave.  I have had rebate problems in the past and they are playing the exact same game as ever.  The rebate company form requires you to enter your name for contact, then will not even accept it on their form.  Roxio has not viable method for contact that works either.  They hide up in Canada, seems like a one man operation de la swindle.  CROOKS!  Pass your copy around, they deserve license violations.  I would love to smack them!  What a pack of liars and thieves.  It's not worth fighting and that is how they operate.	-1
I have a very high end Mac Pro and bought Toast Titanium Pro in a bundle with an external Blu-Ray burner.  Every time I click the mouse in Toast, I get a spinning beach ball for 30 seconds.  I upgraded to the latest version of Toast.  This is a system with a very fast disk array and 24 GB of RAM.  Everything flies except for Toast.  Do not buy this or bundles with it; it's a total waste of money.  Update Nov 2010 -- Well, something changed or the newest version of Toast fixes the problem I was having.  In any event, I am finally able to use Toast to burn blu-ray discs.	-1
I've used turbo tax to prepare my taxes for the last seven years. Not any longer. They've substantially changed the way they charge for printing multiple returns, effectively guaranteeing that anyone filing more than 1 return will have to pay substantially more than before. This is not about 'improvements' or 'features.' It is all about corporate greed. I can completely understand corporations needing to increase prices a reasonable amount each year; that is just good business. But jacking prices through the roof and then hamstringing their core users with their sick new pricing scheme for each additional return filed is GREED.  Turbo tax has lost themselves a customer. I'll be pursuing other avenues to file my taxes this year.	-1
Last year Intuit did a major PR push to overcome the mistakes of 2006. After all that "good will" they are back to pissing off their customers, this time with new fees. Yes, I read the response from the VP of marketing; it may be good math for some, but not most. Shame. Intuit should be left to wither up and go away.	-1
As the informed customers in the crowd are probably aware, Intuit (the makers of TurboTax and Quicken products) released their TurboTax products for 2008 with a new pricing structure and much less flexibility than had existed in previous year's products when it came to allowing customers to work on multiple tax returns.  Apparently, if the news at C-Net is correct, Intuit has backed off on those fees and is 'responding to customer feedback and concerns' and going back to old rules when it comes to the product.  I guess the marketing genuises and/or bean counters at Intuit didn't do enough research on how the mob with the pitchforks would react upon hearing the news of the changes in the rules for product usage this year.  (It's not like pollsters ever get things wrong, right?)  I expect that Intuit got feedback along the way that said that the pricing change and restrictions on the product usage weren't going to be problems for most of their users.  Worst case that's what they heard from the product management team and others involved in helping to set prices and policy I'm sure.  To be fair, if they had given advance notice that the rules were going to be changing, customers may not have reacted (some would say over-reacted) to the changes so harshly, but unfortunately for many customers they weren't made aware of the changes until *after* they got boxed product home and were reading through the materials that came with it (or worst yet, until after they started using the product and bumped into the request to pay an additional fee).  This is just the next in a line of mis-steps made by management at Intuit/Turbo Tax when it comes to this product.  One would hope they'd learn their lesson once and for all, but I really am not sure they ever really will.  Will I use this year's product?  I honestly don't know.  I've been a loyal customer for many years, but they really have stepped in the stinky stuff this season and I'm just not sure I want to reward them (even if they have tried to make nice with customers).  Best of luck to purchasers of the product.  (New rating would probably be up in the 4/5 range if rating the product alone.  Unfortunately for the folks at Intuit, the ratings can't be changed after the fact the way the reviews can be edited)  ============================ Original scathing review left below: Original review title: Increased prices+new fees+less flexibility=1 star  I've been a loyal TurboTax user for many years now, but over those years the geniuses at TurboTax have thumbed their nose at myself and other customers several times, showing outright disdain for their customers.  It's senseless to use the space here to complain about their past mistakes, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't be raking them over the coals for getting greedy on prices for the 2008 version of this software.  The price increase (suggested retail pricing) of 33 percent is out of line.  Defenders of the product will say "but it includes free..." and that may be the case, but it's still that much more expensive to walk out the store with compared to last year. Lowering the fees in one place and making them up on the retail price just shifts money around needlessly and makes their software seem that much more expensive compared to competitors, or worse yet, compared to just getting plain old paper forms and doing taxes the old fashioned way.  Worse than the price increase though is that apparently TurboTax is tired of having their product used to do taxes for a whole family, or for friends of the family.  I sympathize with them in wanting to be paid fairly for their work, but they could have made things clearer on just how many returns the software could be used to manage/print/handle in the past.  Instead, they're now restricting the ability to do multiple returns with a single product and have chosen to do that on top of the increase in the price of the product.  Double whammy.  Of course the reviewers here at Amazon are making use of their review space to slam the product and protest these moves and as you can see I'm piling on too.  I like the product, but given the changes for the current year I'm seriously considering my alternatives.  Just how bad is TaxCut by comparison?  (From what I've heard of the product, it deserves a good hard look :-/)	-1
I've used Turbotax for years, but due to the licensing changes I am voting with my wallet and purchasing Taxcut this year.  I've seen Taxcut in action and it appears to be no harder to use than this product, so I'd encourage others to consider carefully which company they want to support this year.	-1
Thanks to all the other raters, I won't use TurboTax any more.  So I can't rate the product but I wanted another "1 star" to be added.  Like someone else said, we should be able to give it zero stars.  The Turbotax people must be nuts!  The $10 extra charge for each return is bad enough but what really makes me angry is how they're trying to hide it so the average user will just buy it, then pay the extra money because that would be easier than returning the software.  How sneaky.  I don't know about you but I don't forget things like this!	-1

Amazon is being dishonest and has rigged the product reviews.   "Customer Reviews submitted on Turbo Tax Deluxe Federal State + eFile 2008 prior to December 13, 2008, have been moved to the previous version of the product because the product was updated at that time. "   Amazon just decided on its own that reviews were no longer valid. Amazon has everyone's email, did they ask us?  NO! Amazon has done this before with spore and now tries to justify rigging reviews by say there was an update. Any way you look at it, Intuit is gouging its customers and Amazon is helping them. Come on Amazon, how stupid do you think we are!  "Turbo Thief" I have been a TT user for 15 years and a beta tester several times.  The product itself is pretty good but the greed at Intuit is unbearable. In 2005, TT eliminated the free e-file coupon and raised the price. Now in 2008, TT again raises the price, charges for 1 e-file (weather you use it or not) and limits the number of returns to only 1. At half the current price, the product would be expensive. Now the cost is outright obscene. I couldn't possibly recommend TurboTax anymore.  I have read all the negative recommendations and blog posts here on Amazon and think "Larry" sums them all up..  "A name change is in order for this product now. It should be called 'Turbo-Thievery'."	-1
UPDATE:  TurboTax has rescinded the policy I complained about, and gone even further:  Now an unlimited number of returns can be printed (last year I think it was five) AND you can e-file UP TO FIVE returns.  So that is improved over previous years.  Maybe they made a bad step originally, but it seems that they are willing to listen to customers.  I don't know how to change the number of stars in this review, but it should now be 4 stars, not 1 star.  I've been a fan of TurboTax since I first used it to prepare my 1992 tax return (it was owned by ChipSoft before Intuit bought it.)  There have been some ups and downs but I've been happy.  I'll be switching to TaxCut this year due to a completely obnoxious pricing decision by Intuit.  If you want to print another return, you have to pay $10.  I actually only do our joint return, but I often create new files to model "what if" scenarios, and I would be unable to print even a single form in the draft file without paying $10.  The Intuit web site is deceptive:  they make it sound like you'd have to pay an extra $10 to e-file a 2nd return but don't make it clear that even to PRINT you must PAY EXTRA.  (I'd be OK with paying $10 to e-file at 2nd return.)  I'm also concerned about reports already on Intuit's own TurboTax customer discussion groups that the $10 extra charge can accidentally be triggered while doing drafts of one single return.  I'm sure there are many untested situations in which I'd be dinged for payment even when I'm not trying to do a 2nd return.  And having bought the software, why should I pay if I want to do my sister's tax return on my PC with the already licensed copy of TurboTax?  This is a really stupid policy, and the only disclosure of this policy is in product reviews like this one (i.e. unless you read the reviews you won't find out until after you've bought the product.)  I would typically give TurboTax 4 stars, buy unless they change this is now a one star product and I won't be buying it.	-1
I downloaded the demo from their site. It didn't work. I sent them an email. They ignored it. So buggy software and lack of support. I bought Photoshop CS5. No issues. I never look back.	-1
This product works OK and is especially friendly to novices, but there's two things about it that make me wonder if Symantec has a monkey for a product manager on this product.  1) Users can't migrate settings for firewall, trusted zones etc. from one version to another. So for each upgrade you pay for, you get to spend a couple hours re-keying in all your special rules for your firewall so your P2P,  game software, tunneling etc. keeps working. - and of course, a year's worth of "let that program talk to the Web" responses are also lost.  2) You buy the product, but at the end of the yearly update subscription, you don't just lose the ability to update. The morons at Symantec have programmed it to TURN OFF YOUR FIREWALL COMPLETELY! Boom - you're left unprotected by the software you PAID for just because you haven't PAID AGAIN by a certain date for the new virus subscription. So if you happen to be traveling,  your computer could be left w/o even basic firewall protection until you get back and notice. This is TOTALLY un-acceptable!  So my recommendation is to spend your money elsewhere until Symantec wises  up. Unless these two issues are properly addressed, it really does not matter how good the other functions are. The product is not worth the effort to re-program the firewall each year and the risk of being left without even basic firewall protection just because the update subscription runs out makes it a non-starter.  I'd give it zero stars if I could.	-1
Like you, I don't have time to write reviews -- but this product is such a disappointment I feel I must. I've used PC's for decades. Norton was once the only reliable protection -- back in the DOS days. I dropped Norton 5 years ago because it'd become a resource hog -- and went to PC-Cillin -- but it grew slower, so after 2 years I tried Norton again -- finding it still a resource hog. After 1 year, I switched to Bitdefender -- and found it much faster, but it slowed email too much --even with email scanning turned off. When the subscription ran out, I read reviews saying the "new" Norton was now the most efficient, with competitive protection -- and chose it for the coming year -- just 6 weeks ago. It's turned out to be unuseable -- unpredictable slow-downs (even in "Silent Mode") with system lock-ups (no blue screens, but same effect). I can't wait a year this time. I'll just have to write-off the expense and find another. Truth is, I've no way to vet the reviewers -- too many are "planted" by the manufacturers -- or seduced by their advertising money. IT MAY WORK FINE on many machines, BUT Norton 360v3 is the worst I've encountered -- so bad I can't wait until next year to find one that serves me.	-1
The good news: Smart Surfing was easy to install and easy to configure. It can run checks on your existing files to look for malicious code.  The bad news: Although the software initially seemed to work fairly transparently, after a system reboot it kept me from being able to access the Internet using either Safari or Firefox. And this on the least intrusive settings.  The in-between news: It was easy to use Smart Surfing to check for malicious code on my previously unprotected (for years) Mac, and I was glad that it found nothing bad lurking on my drives. On the other hand, that also suggests that whatever I've BEEN doing (ie, surfing with reasonable caution) combined with the natural safety of the Mac OS, is all the protection I needed. If Smart Surfing was less expensive (and didn't bring my browsers to a halt), I might like having it as a safety net. But at this price, it just didn't measure up.  In fairness, I'll say that some of the protective features are probably useful for people who are inexperienced on the web, or who share their computers with inexperienced people. Additionally, the ability to block entire catagories of websites (like adult sites) could be useful for families with kids using the computer.	-1
While Corel Digital Studio 2010 will eventually allow you to do some video editing, DVD authoring, etc. what you end up with is not worth the journey. There is freeware available for each of the tasks that the suit covers that do a better job. The photo suit is useless. Once you manage to get your photos imported you no more functionality then Windows "Paint". After 20-yoars of teaching video editing, I thought I had seen it all when it comes to editing software, but this thing takes the cake. It has limited features, poor interface and is very hard to navigate. It will work, but why use something that is hard to use when the finished product is no better then Windows "Movie Maker". This suit is not worth the money.	-1
I've been trying to use this suite of applications for a while now, comparing it to my favorite suite, Roxio Creator, and I haven't had much luck.  I think the problem is I am looking for features that the application just doesn't have?  It's also not very stable and I can tell you that it's not my system.  I built my system myself and it's fully loaded with a Phenom II triple-core processor, 4GB of RAM, Windows 7 and all the bell and whistles lovingly maintained by myself.  Yet, this hangs/crashes most of the time I try to use it.  First, starting with the photo suite.  I had a really hard time figuring out how to get my photos imported into this program.  Why can't it just use the Windows 7 libraries I'd already set up?  Same for videos?  I didn't find there was a whole lot I could do with the photos once I got them up and running (after several crashes -- maybe it doesn't like they are all on my home server on the network?).  Microsoft Live Essentials is free and it works much better and I can do a lot more with it.  Second, starting with the video suite.  I never really got this working.  It just kept crashing trying to load in movies.  I can load in the same movies into Roxio and Windows Movie Maker.  I had to give up.  I really wanted to test the editing features here.  Third, DVD/CD burning.  I wanted to burn an ISO to a DVD so I could install Ubuntu on a new system.  I never found the option for doing so.  Is there one?  I had to use Roxio instead.  I never got around to trying to take some home movies and make a DVD out of it.  Again, crashing/hanging.  Finally, WinDVD.  I'd heard all kind of good things about WinDVD, especially the Bluray support.  Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to work with Bluray?  Maybe it does and I haven't figured it out?  Nothing seems to be intuitive here or it's so simple the features just don't exist?  Windows Media Center comes with Windows 7 and it can play DVDs.  So, now it's been installed for quite a while on my PC and I never use it.  I always go to Microsoft Live Essentials or Roxio Creator for what I need.  Eventually I will get around to installing it.  I've been agonizing over writing this review for a long time but this has been my experience.  It seems others have found what they are looking for/expecting but I have not.  I found the functionality limiting and it crashed/hung a lot on my PC.	-1
I cannot recommend this product.  The performance is bad on my Quad Core, 8GB, 64 bit system and feature set is too light  Corel has done a nice job providing a clean interface that is shared across the prodcut set. The software will index your images and videos on your computer when it work.  I pointed the software to my images folder and it failed to add about half of the subfolders. You create slideshows and videos, the burn to a DVD that you can send to your family.  The photo editing options are pathetic. (Sepia / B&W and little else)  Corel had really butchered the Ulead product line.  Yes these are the express version of the main productss but there is just not enough features to justify paying more than $30 for this prouduct. You are better going with the Adobe Photoshop Elements / Adobe Premiere Elements or using free products.  Google has done a great job with Picasa by the way..	-1
I chose this from my Vine list mainly for the photo paint shop. I have the Corel Paint Shop Pro XI and liked it in my old Dell Optiplex desk top with Windows XP but it doesn't want to run right on my new Dell Studio 17 with the Windows Vista. I thought since this was a newer program it would work better than the old one does with Vista. Wrong.  It took for ever to install it. There must be something with the Windows Vista that isn't compatible with this program. I've only got it to open, after several minutes, a couple of times. The first time I got it to open it started scanning my hard drive collecting or importing all photo files, all video files, and all music files on the hard drive. It did this without my permission and there was no way that I could stop it. It should have let me choose what photo files and video files that I want to import. I definitely do not like a program taking control of my computer. It also used up just over a Gig of my hard drive with over 20,000 files in over 2000 folders.  The few times that I've got it to run the Photo Paint Shop I haven't been able to save much of what I've used it for. The program usually stalls out and won't respond right in the middle of working on a photo loosing what work had been done. Then the only way that I can get it to shut down is opening the Task Manager and forcing it to shut down. What little that I have been able to use this program has been way over simplified actually reducing the usefulness of it and what it can do. So even if I could get it to run right there isn't anything that it can do better, or even as good as my other photo programs that were a lot cheaper than the price on this one. My Microsoft Digital Image Pro 10 is still the one that I use the most out of all the ones that I have. I haven't tried to use any of the video part of this program yet so I can't say much about it. But if its like the photo part it probably won't work right for me either.  So any who, I don't know if it's in this program or in the Vista on my lap top, it won't work for me. It probably will work with XP but I don't know and I don't have enough space on the hard drive of my old desk top to try it in that one. So if it works for you, great. But if you are running Vista on your computer I suggest that you try something else.	-1
Unfortunately, Corel has not yet learned the lessons of consumer behavior these past couple of years.  If you want a program with a flashy installation screen, transparent splash screens, 2.3GB of hard drive space taken up and a whopping 32,443 items added to your registry then this is your program.  It's no wonder the system requirements are so steep.  As a CD and DVD burner, I see little difference between this and the many other programs out there (including freeware).  Its DVD player is fine, but frankly I already have one.  The video studio has no real outstanding features that are better than any other cut and paste video program except maybe the ability to add soundtracks and voiceovers.  It's almost embarrassing to have only four different animated titles available and the fourth can't possibly be used for anything other than baby photos.  Seriously, four only?  Help is only located online and the instructions they give are very simplistic with a very small index.  I don't see a link to where you can ask questions either.  It's not really a studio, just four different programs.  This becomes evident when the icons appear on your desktop along with a gadget to open the programs just in case you weren't smart enough to double-click the icons.  Of course you were never asked permission during installation.  Corel also reassigns all the media files (movies, music, and photos) you used to play on Windows Media Player, your photo viewer or whatever you were using to Corel's programs without your permission too!  I call all this stuff vomitware.  Wake up Corel!  Out of all of the programs I used, the only one I found useful was the photo-editing program. The blemish removal and the suntan tool are useful, although the fake suntan could get red and blotchy if not used properly.  The red eye tool is supposed to work on pets too but I didn't find this to be the case.  The straighten tool seemed to chop up the photo more than straighten it.  The fine tune tool (aka the quick fix) brightened up pictures and made some of the old black and white photos I was restoring look really nice.  Strangely it made color photos look too bright and a little over saturated.  In short, it's fun for beginners to play around with but it's certainly not professional quality.  You get a whopping six edges and seventeen frames for your photos in this program.  It's basic, but it is easy to learn and it may save you time over competing photo editors.  Personally I would look around for a program with lesser system requirements and more features, especially since Corel needs to get more options in the features they already have.	-1
When I tried to install this it wanted me to uninstall my other spyware and addware, which I wasn't too happy about since those worked pretty good and were just out dated. After removing my other programs I tried to install this, and my laptop stalled out. I finally had to remove the battery to shut it down. I should have left it alone at that point but I thought I should try it one more time. Same thing, part way into the install m laptop stalled again. Again the only way to get it shut down was to pull the battery. This time I had all sorts of problems because the system files were damaged. I finally had to get the Dell tec support to take over control of my laptop to find the problems and fix it. At least it was still covered with the warranty. This was the second time that I've had a anti virus program screw up my computer when I tried to install it. I don't know if its because of a problem with the program or with the Windows Vista on my laptop. I'm more incliend to say its a problem with the Vista.	-1
In my past experience, Trend Micro has always made middle-of-the-road products that were never quite as good as offerings from Symantec and McAfee, but were also a step above freebies like AVG. Something that you might pick up in the bargain bin at a big box store while you waited for your "real" software of choice to be updated, or for them to offer a discounted subscription.  The latest Internet Security seems to continue their legacy of being destined for the bargain bin, and anymore, even that's too much to pay for what you get. It isn't particularly fast, it isn't particularly light, and it does the old "I know better than you do" tinkering with network connections. Rather than detail what's wrong with the software, I'd challenge anyone to point out what's right with it.  Sure, you get a dopey USB key with virtually no additional storage. But you're going to be downloading you definition updates and software updates, so really, how is doing the initial installation from a USB key a huge benefit? If you've done it properly, the first thing you're going to do is update (and consequently replace) the software as soon as it's installed.  For about 2/3 of the price, you can get a three-user license to&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/McAfee-Total-Protection-2010/dp/B002GUUO5I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">McAfee Total Protection 2010</a>. It's faster, and constantly updated. Right off the bat, you have a "Does more, costs less" product in McAfee. If you have more than one computer and care about maintaining legitimate licenses (I do, personally), it's a tremendous value, comparatively speaking.	-1
There are several better choice than Trend Internet Security 2010.  Below are the issues I found while using it.  I ended up uninstalling it and wen back to Avast and ThreatFire.  Windows Firewall is fine for most users.  ======== Required Avast be removed which is ok but it needed to reboot and only then did it tell me to remove ThreatFire after which it required a 2nd reboot.  Also ThreatFire is  designed to run with AV SW but Trend seemed to ignore this.  Pauses after installation but leaves install software screen up which is confusing.  Turned off Windows Defender but left it running in tray which made Windows Defender show an error status since it's no longer running  Windows firewall also has warning while Trend is updating even though Trend has a firewall.  Doesn't automatically update and scan after installation  The link to some "How To" videos is actually link to all products that Trend sells and it isn't obvious where to find the video.  Had to change Firewall profile from Direct Internet Connection to Home Network. Can Auto  change profile depending on your location so this might be useful for a laptop but I didn't try it.  Found my FIOS set-top boxes and one NAS drive but not my other Windows 7 PC's.  The default Firewall setting  is minimum  protection!  Parental controls is schedule based and can not enforce time limits.  I don't care if my kids choose to get online before school, after school or before bed but I want to be able to limit their time to say 30 minutes per day.  Trend doesn't allow this.  On Trend's web page the review page is misleading.  It has a PC Magazine review but it's for tlast years Pro version.  PC Magazine does have a review on the 2010 home version and they say it's "program we're not recommending."  Funny how that never made it to their web page.  [...] AV-Test came in 8 out of 10  ==============  In short this program is not worth it.  Even if it were free there are better choices.  Stick with Microsoft Security Essentials or Avast and you're better off.  And they're free.	-1
Nice that it comes on a USB to support NetBooks, but still this version is not much of an improvement from last year.  There are problems with this product--as it is not as effective as others in it's antivirus protection (viruses and malware attacks.)  The only features that were improved were the parental controls, user interface, and it is easy to install.  Which is not enough for me to consider this product.  Trend Micro needs to improve this product more before I would consider this my only PC security.	-1
The Anime Studio packaging makes one think the product is geared toward children or beginners. As a beginner, I can testify that this is not the case. I'm a software engineer. When I write software and design GUIs (Graphical User Interfaces), every function must be immediately obvious to even the most casual observer or have context sensitive help or both. This software would NOT have made it to production where I work.  I still have not figured much of this out. If I wanted to sit and go through long tutorials and read and study and try things for hours on end, then I could probably be productive with this. However, If you don't want to make a large time investment, this is not for you.	-1
I could not get this software to work. Every time it rejected the serial number that came with the CD.	-1
I was really disappointed by this software.  I had used PrintMaster products for many years.  I tried this version and it is very large (takes up a ton of space), the graphics and clip art are not great.  With Google Images nowadays, it's pretty easy to find the art you need and you don't need to take up 20+GB of hard drive space storing clip art.  I really found this version of the software unusable. I hope they improve the next version.	-1
I can't write a review on this one, it wouldn't load on my computer. We have Windows Vista, and it still wouldn't load. Sorry guys.	-1
I was looking forward to trying out PrintMaster Platinum 2.0 after seeing how cheap and versatile it seemed to be. I admit, I have no previous experience with PrintMaster, but everything I had heard in the past pretty much concluded it was simple to learn and work with. Well, that may have been true about past versions, but certainly not Platinum 2.0. There is nothing "platinum" about it. This is a clunky mess from the start. I have a quality PC with plenty of RAM, but this took forever to load. Once I finally got everything up and running, I still felt like I was stuck back in 1998 - everything I tried to do, whether it be browse templates or start a new project, ended up feeling like I was trying to stream an HD movie on 56k dialup. Impossible. Just trying to create a birthday card with my kids was tedious, and we ended up giving up and coloring one instead with good old reliable crayons. The thing about it is, things eventually loaded, but there really is no excuse for how long it takes to get ANYTHING done on here. After my experience, I cannot recommend this product, despite it's wonderfully low price. Do yourself a favor and consider forking out the extra money for&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Microsoft-Publisher-2010/dp/B0039L6FRE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Microsoft Publisher 2010</a>. It will save you an extended headache, and it's infinitely more reliable with plenty of options to boot.	-1
I have done a decent amount of printing at home using various software over the years.  Everything from banners, cards, and even cd-covers and labels.  Every type of project required me to use a specific program so I thought that Print Master would solve the confusion of having all these different programs on my computer.  Unfortunately the Print Master software has too many of its own design flaws to be usable.  First of all the installation process was a mess.  I needed to print some invitation cards so I thought I would install the program and get started but to my horror the process was still ongoing at nearly 30 minutes!  Granted my computer is very old but a printing program should not take as long as Microsoft Office to install!  Once installed, I found the program to be a bit hard to navigate and somewhat confusing.  It might be the learning curve that is involved but shouldn't software be designed so that even a new user can come in and start using the program without much fuss?  Despite these issues, the program is very comprehensive and does provide a lot of options so it may be useful to those that need professional level results.  Personally I just need a simple and quick program and thus would prefer to use my older task specific programs to do my print jobs.	-1
This PrintMaster program took forever to download. It was almost a half hour by the time I finished.  It has many templates to choose from for a variety of projects from work to school and home.  You can also creat a blank one.  I had attempted a postcard to create on my photo paper. No matter what I did to print, the object and text were minimilized on my 4 x 6 photo paper.  Even when I had tried to print a draft on a reuglar size piece of paper. I gave up and used Microsoft Works.	-1
I installed the program but it took a lot of space on my computer and the functionality was mediocre.  Thus, I uninstalled it.	-1
I have to add a "ditto" to the other reviewers who were unhappy with this version of PrintMaster (the review by "Jenn" states it very well). The problem is how BUGGY this software package is... I'm a Microsoft Certified software developer by trade so I usually can understand programming quirks and can get around them, but I came across too many in this package to make it worthwhile. It's a shame, because there are a LOT of good features and an excellent stock of images and clipart (which you can still use) which is why I even gave it two stars, but the bugs in the user interface will get frustrating. I'm running this (or trying to run this!) on a new PC with an Intel i3 processor, Windows 7 Pro 64-bit, 4GB ram, GT240 video card and a 10K RPM Raptor hard drive with a second 7200rpm drive for files and assets. That's not as powerful as my video editing rig but it should be more than ample to make PrintMaster run like the dickens. I had high hopes for this software, but it just wasn't well-tested before they released it. Let's hope the next version comes out of the gate strong!	-1
Like many other reviewers, I have used many project making software packages over the years. With how expensive greeting cards are these days, it normally pays for its self very quickly plus allows you to really make it personal to the person receiving the card--plus you get to make flyers, banners, etc for free.  No brand seems to ever really stack up against the PrintMaster package. The quality of the software, clip art, fonts, etc are the best you will find. I have used 5-6 versions of PrintMaster and loved them all UNTIL this "upgrade". I am not sure if they sold themselves to another company or just fired everyone responsible for making the good parts of the software but this has been redesigned from the ground up to be just plain crappy. It is slow, buggy, hard to use and full of disappointment. Honestly I wish I could find something I like better than PrintMaster Platinum 18 but there is nothing better and a LOT that is much, much worse.  Comparing the two products, this PrintMaster Platinum 2.0 has an average review rating of about 1.5 stars and this is with a ton of Vine reviews--where Amazon & the software company provides free software in exchange for reviews. The Vine reviews tend to be more positive since the person didn't pay anything for the product and because the reviewer feels guilty leaving poor reviews since they were asked by the company to do them. In this case, 7 out of the 9 four star reviews were from vine users and 8 out of the 9 three star reviews were from vine users as well. Removing those "purchased" ratings, the overall user rating would easily drop to 1 star--the lowest possible rating on Amazon.  Whereas, PrintMaster Platinum 18 is currently ranked at 3.5 stars by customers. It is faster, has better templates, better clip art and is better in every way. It is currently even cheaper than this version, but it has been discontinued so you need to grab it before it disappears leaving you with this crappy program as your only option.  Click below to find the MUCH better option--PrintMaster Platinum 18. <a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Printmaster-Platinum-Version-18-OLD-VERSION/dp/B000XB21JY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Printmaster - Platinum Version 18 [OLD VERSION</a>]	-1
I took the plunge and ordered a Toshiba 645D Satellite notebook PC running 4G RAM and an AMD Phenom II triple core processor.  Spec-wise, more than enough to run Windows 7.  In a nutshell, I have had nothing but problems over the 9 months since i've had this latest PC of mine.  I get system crashes, blue screens, programs that greatly slow down or bog down, system freezes, and major incompatibility problems with printers and anti-virus or internet security software!  This stuff happens WAY too often to be even remotely excusable. I am beyond frustrated.  I must conclude that Windows 7 is garbage.	-1
Microsoft has made some minor improvements to this version of Windows.  It's a little faster but by no means fast.  It's has some graphic-interface improvements which are clearly ripped-off from Apple's Mac Operating System (OS), but instead of improving on them, Microsoft took that usability down and actually made it worse (it's like the kid who cheats in class but still gets a bad grade).  You'll notice that all the people giving this OS rave reviews are comparing Windows 7 to older versions of Windows.  So they're comparing this OS to Vista (now 3 years old) and/or XP (now 8-9 years old).  Why don't they compare it to the Mac OS[...]  Because if you don't already know, the Mac is simply a superior, thought-out, well-tested, design and creates a much better end-user-experience.  Wanna be frustrated all over again like you were with XP?  Get Windows 7.  Wanna be frustrated like you were with Vista?  Get Windows 7.  It's your money, and it's your time (your life) - wanna spend both being frustrated and pissed-off and down-right angry because your expensive computer with expensive software isn't working like you'd simply expect it to... well, by all means, buy Windows 7 and continue to allow Microsoft to make your life miserable.  I have to use PCs - and Macs - I know the difference.  It wasn't until recently that I started using the Mac.  FYI, you can "dual-boot" a Mac so it runs both Windows and the Mac OS - so if you want, you can do your own comparison.  Or you can just ask a Mac owner and get their opinion.  Microsoft has been beating up their customers since day one - they don't love you.  They don't even like you.  They seemingly could really care less about you, your time, your money, your life.  It's your call...  I'm here telling you all this because, since I work so much with computers, I'm one of those people who's been beaten up badly by Microsoft, and I'm here trying to "save" others from that pain.  Best wishes to you all.	-1
Upgrading is causing me to have to buy new Adobe products. Several expensive programs that ran under XP no longer run under 7 in XP compatibility mode. XP compatibility is pretty much useless with products like Illustrator. Companies balked at buying new software so Microsoft made a virtual XP environment (XPM) for them but not for Windows Home Premium. We homebodies don't have any clout with the Microsoft monopoly.	-1
For a company that claims to be the greatest software company in the world it is ASTOUNDING that after all these years Microsoft have not mastered the upgrade process. They're not even GOOD at it! Most software packages will allow you to do a fresh install of an upgrade so long as you provide the previous serial as proof of ownership. Not these "geniuses". Instead, you are forced to install Windows XP and THEN install Windows 7! In my case, I was also upgrading my hard drive so I had no copy of XP installed. I should not have had to do two installs because their software team is fat and lazy. If their activation already ties the software to my machine, jumping through hoops should be completely unnecessary. There's a reason why Mac sales are growing. It's because installing software isn't a nightmare on that side!	-1
I'm using Win7Pro x64.  When it works, it works.  However, incompatibility issues can make this version of Windows a nightmare if you have legacy USB and audio gear from previous editions -- including Vista.  Unlike previous editions, what I'm seeing with Win7 x64 is a very slow adoption rate by OEM manufacturers. In the past, they were all in a hurry to jump on the bandwagon.  I guess this time, everyone it tired of the game and holding off for as long as possible before supporting this new version of Windows.  Frankly, it looks like the same nightmare Vista users endured.  I wish I had held off this version of Windows until 2011. If what you have works, don't break it with an upgrade until you can go to the store and Win 7 support on most all the gadget boxes.	-1
I use it with my work PC.  Windows explorer crashes all the time, problem with running SQL server 2005, and SLOW.  I actually prefer running Vista - UI is annoying, but is much more stable running applications.  It is a real productivity killer for IT professionals.  Also comes with Internet Explorer 8 which crashes all the time.  Must reboot the computer every morning due to some security patch download - which takes forever to shutdown & install.  Poor job of managing memory and multi-tasking (slow, and sudden pauses while executing programs).  This could be a OK personal operating system for accessing Internet and playing games.  It is a poor OS for running Visual Studio, SQL server, or doing any type of software development work.	-1
I believed the hype from Microsoft that Windows 7 was 'better' or 'fixed', 'more stable' ... whatever, so I bought it. First it is sooooo different from XP that it is difficult to navigate. I had to search the internet for instructions to do the simplest of tasks.  I've been running 7 for about 3 or 4 months. I get a blue screen of death about every week or two. The most recent example was yesterday morning. I started to upload a youtube video, went away to have breakfast and came back to a blue screen of death. It's not like I was doing anything complicated, just one IE window open and one upload happening. I'm so disappointed.  Speaking of Internet Explorer, it crashes more than in XP. It just stops working, dims, shows that it's thinking and won't let you do anything for minutes. A company that can not even get a web browser to work right has no business selling an operating system. It's time to upgrade to Firefox.  XP is pretty good. I use that at work everyday. I bought a laptop with Vista. That sucked soooooo bad that I ditched Vista completely and installed Ubuntu. I've had no problems with Ubuntu. I'm going to upgrade to Ubuntu on my desktop(the one with Windows 7 on it now). I will also never be purchasing another Microsoft product, hardware or software. I can't financially support a company that charges for such crappy products.  Ubuntu and Firefox are where it's at.	-1

I bothered with upgrading my computer with the hope of seeing a brand new Windows. I've never been disappointed before - from Dos to Windows 95, from Windows 95 to XP, from XP to Vista, there has always been lots of new, fancy stuff for me to explore and enjoy.  Not Windows 7. It is almost identical to Vista in every way. And then there is the downside: some of the programs don't work. I read in other reviews that 7 is very backwards compatible. Well, the first thing I used, a little Vista sidebar gadget called Network Meter, doesn't work at all. Very annoying. But more importantly, the intel graphics driver doesn't work, so my screen remained blurry! And Intel doesn't offer updates for my chip, they said. Luckily I was able to find the driver for Vista, and it worked in 7, so I'm okay. But this bit about 7 being backwards compatible is just a joke to me. Better watch out that nothing I have is going to work on it.  Like Vista, 7's sound recorder is stripped down to bare minimum functions. I love using the sound recorder in XP; it's small, efficient, and has neat functions.  What's new about Windows 7? Well, it has a math input tool. As a mathematician, I find that thing STUPID. I draw a 2 in there, and it thinks it is alpha. If I draw +, it takes it to be psi. Be faster to get it out of the character map.  Other than that, there is nothing interesting. It advertises being able to record TV shows. Big deal; XP and Vista can do it too; just buy the tv tuner!  (For Windows 7 also.) I recently bought one here at Amazon. Not too expensive, and works great:  <a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Hauppauge-WinTV-HVR-950Q-TV-Tuner-Stick-Personal-Video-Recorder-with-Clear-QAM-and-Remote-Control-Black/dp/B001DEYVXO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Hauppauge WinTV-HVR-950Q TV Tuner Stick/Personal Video Recorder with Clear QAM and Remote Control (Black)</a>  One thing I find irritating about 7 (and Vista) is its requirement for program signature verification. If it doesn't recognize a program you want to install, it flashes you a warning. I guess Microsoft wants everybody to register with them like they are the Gestapo. There is just one problem: I have used Vista for 2 years, have installed hundreds of programs big or small, and have NEVER encountered a program that owns the signature verification. This includes programs I download from Microsoft! So the warning is ubiquitous and meaningless like a grandma's caution against life's countless dangers. Why don't they give it up already? Nobody will ever sign up with them!  Another thing is, they won't let me put a file icon on the taskbar in 7. Worked fine in the other versions.  Another praise for Windows 7 is that it is stable and secure. I don't know why people talk about such matters; my XP and Vista computers are all plenty stable and secure. And just now, Windows 7 froze on the PBS online game my son is playing. So it's not like Windows 7 freezes less often.  I don't recommend Windows 7 if you already have Vista and is looking for something exciting in the new OS. They are the same. They even look the same. Otherwise; get either 7 or Vista; no need to get both, and you won't be disappointed.  I am getting rid of Windows 7 and putting XP back. I wonder if Microsoft will ever coming up with a new fancy OS again, or is this the best Windows is going to get? I am starting to think that those people at Microsoft have waxed fat.	-1
I bought both Windows 7 Home Premium and Windows 7 Professional pre-release.  Disregard all of the hype of the last 6 months - Windows 7 is NOT worth the cost, the time, the risks, or the hassles of upgrading.  My most reliable computer is still my Windows XP.  In addition - if you have the Vista Home Premium - you can NOT use the Windows 7 Professional upgrade.  With Windows 7 you get slight improvements on the task bar and interface - however - you risk losing your data, having to do a complete reinstall of ALL of your programs, and then - when you finally have it installed - many of your programs will crash with Windows 7.  DO NOT UPGRADE - if you have a working system.  The improvements are very marginal.	-1
At the moment Vista Home Premium is running on my PC and several others in my family, all preinstalled by the manufacturer.  I pre-ordered Windows 7 Professional upgrades for each back when they were being offered for a big discount.  Today the W7 upgrades arrived and only then did I discover - as apparently many others have too - that "upgrading" from Vista Home Premium to W7 Pro actually requires a "clean install" instead of an in-place upgrade, necessitating a LOT of manual work to save the data from each, install W7, and then MANUALLY REINSTALL ALL APPLICATIONS as well as the data.  And for some bizarre reason known only to Microsoft, this rude surprise only applies to certain combinations of upgrades.  Printed on the box: "This version of Windows 7 is designed as an upgrade to Windows Vista. If you are upgrading from Windows XP, you will need to back up your files and settings, perform a clean install, and then re-install your existing files, settings, and programs."  OK, so they make it clear that you have your work cut out for you if you are upgrading from XP, but upgrading from Vista should be - well - an upgrade. But it is not, except for a few very specific versions of Vista.  See the Microsoft site for the few lucky cases.  This restriction makes no apparent sense, especially since I am upgrading to a "better" version of Windows, and I can find no explanation from Microsoft.  I find it most disheartening to say the least, because it will require hours and hours of work that I was not expecting - and that assumes that I can even find all of the install disks and downloads, plus be able to recreate all of the configurations and customizations.  I am reasonably computer literate so I expect that I will be able to get through this onerous task - eventually - but there is no way on this planet that my wife would be able to do this by herself, and she will not be alone.  Die-hard computer hobbyists who don't mind spending endless hours just tinkering with their computers to make them work to the pinnacle of perfection might find doing a clean install to their liking, but I do not.  I have a computer because it is a tool to accomplish work other than maintaining the tool itself.  I hope that some day the pain of my having to do multiple clean installs of W7 on my family's computers will all be the past, but for now it remains in the future, and I do not know for how long because I will only be able to do it when I have many hours available during which I have nothing else to do and during which time I can afford to have my computer down.  And of course, nothing will go wrong in the process.  Thank goodness cars don't work this way!  I am very, very disappointed in both Microsoft and Amazon for not mentioning this little detail amidst all of the glow about the benefits of W7, and I strongly recommend to those who are contemplating purchasing the W7 Professional "Upgrade" to now be aware of this inexplicable hole in the Windows upgrade matrix and seriously consider whether you have the knowledge, time and patience necessary to deal with this.  UPDATE:  I have now completed the "clean install" upgrades on several machines. The whole process works well and reliably - it just takes a long time (4+ hours including the time to save the original data to a USB drive and then restore afterwards).  The Easy Transfer utility provided by MS really works well and is the highlight of the process because it saves all of the user data and settings from the pre-Windows 7 machines and restores everything perfectly after the clean install of Windows 7.  Without this, the upgrade would have been much more work, and much riskier.  I have seen companies advertising migration products of their own, but you don't need them because MS's free utility does everything you need.  Now that the upgrade experience is behind me I am happy it is done, but I still stand by my original assessment, i.e. that this product is misleadingly labeled as a "upgrade" when that term only applies to the pricing and not the amount of work required to actually DO the upgrade in most cases.	-1
I "Upgraded" from Windows Vista Home Premium 64 Bit to Windows & Home Premium 64 Bit and EVERYTHING runs SLOWER...From boot up to sending e-mail It is SLOWER..and this is on a Core2 Quad INTEL 3.00GHZ Procesor machine with8 Gb of DDR2 ram and a DEDICATED(or discrete 256 MB Invidia PCI EXPRESS Video Card)...I HATE Windows 7 and WILL be going back to VISTA by Sunday......I`m sick of putting up with sluggish performance and system stalls just so I have the latest Microsoft OS installed......PULEEEEEZE!	-1
I upgraded from Windows Vista Ultimate, which was running fine on my machine.  I had everything configured to wirelessly stream my media center information throughout my house, had my satellite hooked up to my computer so I could record and watch television.  None of my settings have carried over.  I am not a novice... I have been working in the computer industry for 20 years.  It has taken me two days of trying to reconfigure my machine and none of my media sharing and television are working.  What a complete nightmare.  I'm realizing how glad I am that all of my other computer systems in my house are now Macs.  Microsoft just keeps missing the boat.  I am about ready to install my system backup and just return this version!	-1
I believed the hype from Microsoft that Windows 7 was 'better' or 'fixed', 'more stable' ... whatever, so I bought it. First it is sooooo different from XP that it is difficult to navigate. I had to search the internet for instructions to do the simplest of tasks.  I've been running 7 for about 3 or 4 months. I get a blue screen of death about every week or two. The most recent example was yesterday morning. I started to upload a youtube video, went away to have breakfast and came back to a blue screen of death. It's not like I was doing anything complicated, just one IE window open and one upload happening. I'm so disappointed.  Speaking of Internet Explorer, it crashes more than in XP. It just stops working, dims, shows that it's thinking and won't let you do anything for minutes. A company that can not even get a web browser to work right has no business selling an operating system. It's time to upgrade to Firefox.  XP is pretty good. I use that at work everyday. I bought a laptop with Vista. That sucked soooooo bad that I ditched Vista completely and installed Ubuntu. I've had no problems with Ubuntu. I'm going to upgrade to Ubuntu on my desktop(the one with Windows 7 on it now). I will also never be purchasing another Microsoft product, hardware or software. I can't financially support a company that charges for such crappy products.  Ubuntu and Firefox are where it's at.	-1
it's the same BS that Microsoft has been dumping on their customers since day one!  One more example to prove that Microsoft really should not be in the technology business and instead should consider, maybe, tree farming.  Describe Windows 7... how about annoying, painful, frustrating, stupid(!), slow, and even abusive to you, the user.  If you're using XP you'll have to do a clean install.  That means you have to re-load all your software, set up all your settings, deal with drivers, etc.  This is going to take all weekend or longer to do.  Thanks to Microsoft millions of people are losing more of their valuable time.  Microsoft does not care about you or your time.  If you have Vista - you're most likely also going to have to do a clean install.  It is recommended by the experts either way.  The user interface borrows (takes) *some* of the good ideas Apple came up with, but then instead of advancing those design ideas, Microsoft actually makes them worse.  I clearly attended more design classes than the GUI designers at Microsoft - or at least I made better grades than they obviously did - and I was a Poly-sci major.  It really is mind-blowing how bad it is.  Fast?  Hell no.  Example: right-mouse click on a desktop item and you'll be waiting, waiting, waiting for the menu to appear.  Notice that all the crack-smoking, cool-aid drinking, folks who leave good reviews of this crappy OS say things like, "it's a big improvement over Vista" or otherwise compare this version of Windows to older versions of Windows - as if one should have expected this new version to *not* have improved after multiple years of development.  Doesn't that speak volumes to Microsoft and their products; and what people - even those who support Microsoft - really think?!?  Buy a Mac.  You're going to have to re-install all that software anyway.  You can "dual-boot" a Mac so you have both worlds.  I still use PCs - but I have to - if you don't, then buy a Mac.  It'll save you time, money, and frustration.  I tell this to my family members and my sister took my word on it.  She told me the other day, "I love, love, love, my Mac.  For the first time in my life I get home from work and actually look forward to turning on my computer."  Nuff said?	-1

Ups I did it again - I updated to a new but unproven Windows OS. I was stupid enough to do it with Vista and now I did it again with Windows 7. I am a sucker for new technology.  The updating to Windows 7 went way easier than to Vista. However, Kaspersky which used to run under Vista on my computer without any trouble does not even want to install on Windows 7. I feel like I am doing beta testing for MS again. Windows 7 runs faster than Vista and so far - 2 hours of use - has only crashed once. I would not say the system boots faster than Vista. That seems to be a myth from my experience and from what I have read. However, the menus feel more nimble. The computer seems to respond better. All in all I would say unless you are a technology freak, don't update. The system needs another half year to be ready for prime time. Let the freaks do the beta testing for you. Or be smart and buy a mac.	-1
Win 7 has the same problem as Vista. Too often you will not find features that were in XP. In some cases they were moved, renamed, and otherwise hidden. In other cases they are utterly missing. For example, the Explorer Options File Type tab is gone. Some of its features are elsewhere, good luck finding them, but the consensus on the internet is that Microsoft removed the NEW feature from the OS. Windows Help and Support was useless in trying to resolve this one way or the other. I found hundreds of complaints by users posted on the web. Multiply this by hundreds of things that you  know how to do in XP but have to search for in Win 7 and the improvements in Win 7 are overshadowed by the missing, moved, and renamed features. The arrogance of Microsoft is supreme.	-1
I have to hand it to Microsoft, they know how to market their software.  That's the only reason I can think of as to why anyone would be dumb enough to upgrade from Vista to Win 7...or from XP for that matter.  It's the same operating system!  I have both Vista and Win 7.  Win7 is on a newer system and Vista is on an older system.  Both run at the same speed...slow.  Both crash just as often.  Both are resource hogs.  This would have to mean that Win 7 actually runs slower if I'm getting the same performance from a newer computer.  Now, keep in mind, I'm not running cutting edge hardware, but I'm not using highly sophisticated software either.  I'm always amazed how Microsoft can maintain such a level of dominance in the OS market with this kind of sub par quality.  Mac has taken almost 10% market share from Microsoft.  Linux is slowly on the rise.  It runs at 5 times the speed using 1/3 of your resources.  I'd love to see a company with enough marketing power and sheer guts to take on Goliath.	-1
same ol' same ol' from Microsoft - but what can you expect from a company that's large, dysfunctional, and has such a history of poorly/slowly responding to their customers.  Want a hobby solving for why (your) computer(s) aren't functioning as expected - get Windows.  Want to instead spend your time 'using' your expensive piece of technology... get a Mac.  PCs are cheaper b/c there is a 'free-market' on the components - meaning there are lots of different components and thus problems with them working together nicely.  It's your time and you have to ask yourself - "what's it worth to me." I'd rather not loose the 10's of hours thank-you and instead use that time for something else.  Windows 7, my report to you, from me, a guy who owns PCs and uses them heavily in graphic design and high-end commercial production.  Sincerely.  Windows 7 is: *slow - example, right click on a desktop item and you'll be waiting several seconds before the menu appears - enough time for you to give up and repeatedly right-click - causing more issues (FYI I use high-end PCs with super fast SSD drives with 8 processors or more, with 16GB RAM or more, on a 64bit OS - and it's still slow)  *buggy - example, Windows 7 still ships with a blatant bug that causes the clock to not tell the correct time... a year after it's release, Windows 7 still is known to ship with this issue - your computer can't tell time correctly.  *stupid and poorly designed - MS tried very hard to copy the designs pioneered by Apple.  The user interface is XP blended with OSX.  Sadly, Microsoft didn't improve on that design; and actually did a rather poor job of copying it.  There are parts of Windows 7 that clearly still XP where you have windows that can't resize to reveal all of their data/messages/paths so you're forced to "scroll" or in some cases you simply don't get the ability at all (example: properties page for a folder - "location" only displays the first 50 or so characters - the window doesn't resize).  Areas of XP which needed improvement - take for example the XPs infamous "screen saver" - have actually been changed and made less-user friendly (the Windows 7 screen saver removes the ability to set the rate to an exact value - like every 3 seconds - at which pictures will rotate - instead it's "slow" "medium" or "fast" and no clue as to what those equal).  I could go on, but I have PC problems and OS issues I'm trying to solve right now - understand?  I'm just so frustrated at this moment I figured I'd let you people know that this Windows 7 will teach you to hate your PC all over again...  I'm here just trying to help.	-1
Windows Home Premium came bundled on my new Dell computer (I5 processor). Maybe the 64 bit operating system is necessary to utilize the new Intel processors. Other than that, my experience is that this product has NOTHING to recommend it and I would hardly call it an "upgrade."  (1) Older software for which I paid hundreds of dollars now works poorly if at all. As an example, Corel PhotoPaint (which I use for illustrations in technical articles) often crashes with something about a SmartHeap error. AAA Map and Go does not work at all. And I have used Compatibility Mode in an attempt to make them work properly. This in fact did correct a problem with my TomTom software, which is hardly a relic from the 8 bit or 16 bit operating system days.  (2) A laser printer for which I paid a couple of hundred dollars is now a paperweight because there is no 64 bit driver for it. The manufacturer's technical support department claims it did try to develop one but was not successful.  (3) Navigation of files with Windows Explorer is somewhat more difficult with the Windows 7 version than the XP version.  The biggest problem is however security. I have spent (wasted) hours fighting with Windows 7 over permission to modify or delete files and/or registry keys. Even though I am the computer's sole owner and user, many files have four or five "users" (e.g. System, Administrator) with different permission levels. I am now trying to install an update to my virus protection software but keep getting slammed with Error 1402, which shuts down the installation. Windows 7 blocked me from trying to apply the comprehensive solution to Error 1402 that I found online. Disabling User Account Control did not work either. My computer is therefore now without virus protection, so Windows 7 is quite frankly now a security exposure for me, although the virus software's manufacturer does offer support and can probably help me on Monday.  I am an experienced user and, despite hours spent searching Microsoft and other sites for a solution to the 1402 error, have not been able to find one. I can only imagine the frustration a regular home user or even small business person might have with this, or how much time even a large corporation's IT department could waste on fixing these issues.  Update August 21 2012  Features (e.g. Windows Update) simply do not work, and neither do the programs Microsoft supplies to correct the problems.  When I run Windows Update, it shows that 16 updates, including those related to security and function, are ready to install. I tell it to go ahead and do so, and it simply tells me the updates were not installed with a worthless error message: "Windows Update Encountered an Unknown Error"  I ran MicrosoftFixit.wu. LB.25268956865207935.1.1. Run.exe and it returned the message, "Repair Windows Update Components: Not Fixed" (another highly useful and informative Microsoft error message). Microsoft FixIt "Explore Additional Solutions" is an equally worthless Web page with no specific information whatsoever--only useless generalities.  These are just a couple of examples. This product is poorly designed, unreliable, and quite frankly worse than useless.  Update August 24 2012  Windows now scrambles my desktop icons instead of saving them as I arranged them (e.g. by category and function). Solutions posted online do not work.	-1
I installed an upgrade version of this product. Previous versions verified the product key before the installation. This one does not. Everything installed fine, however now I have trouble verifying the activation code. The copy is legit, but the activation does not work and provides no reason for why not. Now I have to contact Microsoft to figure out why the activation key is not working. Possibly I have to reinstall the previous operating system and then the upgrade again - or buy a new key. This problem might have occurred because I might have formated the computer before installing the upgrade. I think Microsoft built in this problem on purpose to sell more licenses. I have to use Windows for some tasks. However, I use mostly Macs now for my work and I can only advice anyone interested in switching to Apple to do it. Compared to the problems that Microsoft computers cause Macs are a bargain. Macs simply work, which works for me.	-1
This is a SINGLE-USE upgrade, good for either a 32 or a 64 bit system. If you ever have a disc change, or if you have to restore your system using the Microdoft SystemImage backup - you'll have to buy another copy, because the product key only works once after the 30-day period is expired - and Microsoft doesn't give a hang if you have to shell out again for the same product, on the same computer. In fact, they prefer to rip you off - they are, after all, Masters of the Universe.  The difference between Vista and 7 is considerable - no more screen freezes, slightly better graphics, much better flexibility, more rapid execution. But $119 for an upgrade is an horrific price unless your name is Gates or Allen. Vista was an abomination - 7,0 should have been a free upgrade to correct the huge troubles caused by Vista. If buy it you must, Amazon is the best place - the Microsoft Store charges the full $119.99 PLUS shipping of $4.99. Take it or leave it.  One thing for sure - my next PC will be an Apple.	-1

I bought both Windows 7 Home Premium and Windows 7 Professional pre-release.  Disregard all of the hype of the last 6 months - Windows 7 is NOT worth the cost, the time, the risks, or the hassles of upgrading.  My most reliable computer is still my Windows XP.  With Windows 7 you get slight improvements on the task bar and interface - however - you risk losing your data, having to do a complete reinstall of ALL of your programs, and then - when you finally have it installed - many of your programs will crash with Windows 7.  DO NOT UPGRADE - if you have a working system.  The improvements are very marginal and the risk too great.	-1
The best OS in the market (from Apple) is $40 to upgrade.  How much does this operating system offering for your money?  The most if improvement is the User Interface.  If you take away UI, it is functionally identical to Vista (which is considered as one of the worst OS in the market)  Internet Explorer 8 is also the one of the most memory hungry slow browser you can use.  The first time I lunched the browser, system crashed.  Had to reboot the computer.  UI is not that great - already getting behind Linux Compiz Fusion or Mac.  Coming from using multiple OS experience, Windows 7 UI offers nothing new.  The big difference is that Mac OS is cheaper than Win 7, and Linux is free.  So I have to ask, what is this OS offering for the money?	-1
I have spent years hating Vista, so I was eager to upgrade.  I bought an HP Touchsmart PC which came with the free upgrade to Windows 7 Home Premium 64.  With all the bugs and problems Vista had, I thought this had to be better right?  Hah!  no such luck!  First, the good.  I gave two stars for two reasons.  First, the UI is prettier and more polished looking.  I like the cycling wallpapers.  Second, DirecTV2PC actually runs more smoothly under Win 7 than it did under Vista, but like most programs, it takes much longer to load and be ready to use.  ALso, Media Center is updated to look slicker and offer some more information, but it is slightly more sluggish than the Vista version.  In all, if I wanted a Mac (for a pretty interface, but not much productivity), then I'd get a Mac.  Now, the bad (or at least as much as I can fit).  I used the upgrade rather than a clean install because I only had my computer for less than a month and I didn't have much running on it yet.  I used to boot up in 41 seconds with Vista.  Windows 7 is over 90 seconds.  Still not too bad, but over twice as long.  Most programs take longer to load in Win 7 than they did in Vista.  (I have a Duo Core 2.4 Ghz machine with 4mb ram, so that's not the issue.)  Then there are the programs that stopped working and the settings lost.  It took the better part of a day of frustration to get it to actually start serving music to my DVR's like it had been doing in Vista (weren't settings supposed to be retained?).  Then, I discovered that I can no longer print.  I had no problems printing with Vista, but my network access to the printer is now gone (it just cycles trying to connect until it gives up).  There are other problems too, but I think you get the point.  Then, there is the excitement over the touchscreen enhancements to Windows 7.  Only, I find out, the enhancement is a virtual keyboard.  The same virtual keyboard that HP was kind enough to include on the original Vista install for my Touchsmart!  Seriously, that's it?  What a bust!  I am really wishing I had stayed with Vista (and I NEVER thought I say that!).  The upgrade was free, but it still isn't worth the cost.  UPDATE:  I can print once again (I found drivers on my own and as I started installing the drivers Windows 7 took over and started installing drivers itself.  If it had worked this way from the start, I might not have been so harsh.).	-1
First, it took me three tries to get the upgrade to work, and when it did it had a minor bug I would not have seen for weeks if I had not gone looking for it.  I wound up doing a brand new install, but if you are going to do that you might as well buy the OEM disk.  It is cheaper and does not require a you to do a new install of the previous operating system.  Does the new operating system have cool features?  Yes.  Will it make me significantly more productive over the next 3-4 years over Vista?  No.	-1
This is nothing more than a faster booting Vista.  Internet Explorer still sucks hard, freezes and is just plain useless.  The OS itself is still rather slow compared to any mac os, still no more secure than XP, same UI issues as Vista with a few new ones, and is still just as annoying to use.  The price bothers me too because after the epic fail that was Vista this so called *upgrade* should have been free or sold the way Apple sold Snow Leopard for 30 bucks which is reasonable for a mod or simple upgrade tweak.  Apple acknowledged that SL was an upgrade patch with tweaks to fix issues in Leopard not a new OS. Windows 7 is the same exact thing, just a patch for Vista to make it boot faster, with a new coat of paint........so why does microsoft need to double dip and charge consumers 100-200+ dollars for it.  After Vista Microsoft should have been ordered by law to make this "improvement" free or hold them at gunpoint and make them fix their slow, bloated, unreliable, crap OS in the first place.  The only thing Windows is good for is playing games which it does right half the time, can't wait until Mac gets a games licence then I can deleted my Windows 7 boot camp partition.	-1
I've tried to figure out how ratings of antivirus software show where Trend Micro stacks up against the competition.  The ratings are all over the map.  Sometimes Trend Micro is listed in the top ten antivirus software programs and more often not.  It seems to depend on the methodology used to rate these programs, and of course on which set of rating one can trust.  But they all seem to agree that Trend Micro is great in threat detection.  I've found that both the email and phone support for Trend Micro are great, and a good tutorial would also be useful.  What I like about the program is its ease of use and the fact that it doesn't do anything that I find annoying such as trying to insist on presence of a toolbar for example.  It's easy to forget about the program and just feel confident that it's working.  The automatic updates and scans are excellent.  A big concern is whether one's antivirus program slows down the system.  Trend Micro doesn't slow me down more than anything else I've tried but I have never used one of the truly expensive antivirus programs that are touted as better in this regard.  My judgment is that Trend Micro is fast in its price category in which I am familiar.  This software does not offer everything.  It does not offer full Web protection or adequate protection against spam, a constant thorn in anyone's side.  It's not Virus Bulletin Certified 100% for Windows XP or Vista.  But the antivirus protection gets the job done well and that's why one would probably want to buy it.  I've noticed a growing awareness of this software as it continues to win the hearts and minds of desktop users such as myself.	-1
Do you need an antivirus (AV) program if you have a networked computer?  ABSOLUTELY!  Do you need an antispyware (ASW) program if you web surf?  You probably should.  Do you need Trend Micro's AV and ASW 2010?  Uhm, no.  TM's AV is BASIC.  If you have to pay for this, you can get the same basic AV capabilities using free online software (do a google search on free antivirus).  You'll note that when you look at the back of the box--not shown on Amazon, you can see that our of all the nifty gadgets and gizmos that TM AV premium has, and wonder why the heck you bought the basic version--there's not much there.  Sure, TM's AV/ASW 2010 quotes itself for being optimized for WINXP, WINVISTA, and WIN7, but to tell the truth, so do all the other AV's out there.  And guess what?  There's no proof in the pudding.  It's no faster or slower than anything else out there, but there's not much to the program, so yeah, it's probably much quicker than its premium cousins.  Big surprise.  TM's AV/ASW 2010 has a feature that is kind of odd is its behavioral engine--I have no idea what it does, and you'll never find out in the manual either.  Also, it does the basic quick scans, full scans, and scheduled scans, but the timing for the scheduler leaves A LOT to be desired.  Bottom line: should you purchase this?  If you don't do the research on any other AV program, and you really want to have basic AV protection, then yes.  However, I'd say just get a little web search savvy and pick up some freeware OR go to the well-established AV products from the "other" companies.	-1
This product did not work well with any of my computers (one runs XP and one VISTA) As always, you take your chances with software, so if it feels right for you take the risk. However, I would not recommend.	-1
This version is not much of an improvement from last year.  There are problems with this product--as it is not as effective as others in it's antivirus protection (viruses and malware attacks--missed alot of common virus and malware items during a test.)  The only features that were improved were the parental controls, user interface, and it is easy to install.  Which is not enough for me to consider this product.  Trend Micro needs to improve this product more before I would consider this my only PC security.	-1
I had this installed for about two months straight and out of all the virus programs I've used over the years, this has to be the worst.  First of all the program kept popping up saying it had viruses.. IN THE PROGRAM FILES FROM THE INSTALL.  With both Windows 7 and Vista I was unable to correctly get the instant updates going so once I installed it, my PC wasn't able to get virus updates for two months. Oh and it never alerted me to this fact! Only upon further exploration before this review did I notice it!  "Gamer Mode" DOES NOT WORK on my PC with: World of Warcraft, Guild Wars, or even full-screen apps from Facebook (think farmville).  As a matter of fact I found more popups and scans running while I was trying to play a game in gamer mode than when I wasn't trying to play a game.  Again, in both Vista and Windows 7 this feature did not work.  In the end I ended up going with a free virus software download aimed at consumers, instead of this mess.  It took a long time to uninstall and I had to do some manual file-deletion.  All together this is one of the worst executed virus software packages I've seen in a long time, and I'm a very technical person and very familiar with such things!	-1
I can't say much more than I absolutely hate this software.  It crashes, it conflicts, it never behaves, and its off of my computer.  I have never had so many problems with a security software package as with this one, and after weeks of fighting with it, I gave up.  Its too complicated for a mid level user such as myself or something.  Security software should function in the background protecting my computer, with only occasional demands for adjustment, but this one is like a spoiled child demanding attention continually.  I don't recommend it.	-1
I have been using this for a week now and so far I am not the least bit impressed.  1. I have done a full scan on my computer 3 times now and yet every time I restart my computer it tells me I have a security issue and that my computer has not had a full scan in a week.  2. I put the settings on gamer mode for my husband's computer. Gamer mode does not turn on and off with the click of a button like it is supposed to. I have to go in and change all the settings around each time. VERY inconvenient and time consuming.  3. I receive critical error messages DAILY where bitdefender wants me to send in copies of my log files so they can investigate the problems.  4. I also keep receiving a message that tells me bitdefender needs to be updated. The update fails every time.  5.  I have been having issues with some programs like Corel studios ever since I installed this. Could be a coincidence I guess but considering all the other problems I have been having with bitdefender I wonder....  The only positive things I have seen for this software are the anti-spam buttons integrated into my outlook express and the fact that the scan is quicker than I am used to. At least it would be quicker if I didn't have to do it repeatedly!  I am going to tinker with it for another week (maybe) and then go back to Norton or try out Vipre which seems to be working really well on our kids computer.  Note: just for reference purposes. I have a mid-grade Dell computer approx 1 year old running XP.  Update: after 3 weeks of use I had to remove it from both computers. If I was not reviewing the product I never would've kept it on even that long. It would not update properly, caused errors in several programs and slowed down the computers considerably.	-1
This is the worst antivirus program I've ever tried to install in my computer. First of all it wanted to be the only antivirus program and it removed my AVG, McAfee, and a couple of adware programs that I had. Then it would get part way through the install and lock up. I never did get it to finish the installation. The last time that I tried to install it, it said that it had already been installed on 3 PCs and couldn't be installed in another one. I never got it to install in one computer muchless 3 of them like it was supposed to! All it did was cause me a lot of frustration, strip all the protection that I did have out of my laptop and leave me with nothing for virus protection.	-1
I first tried Bitdefender Antivirus 2010 and found it reasonably good... the definitions were extensive, but it slowed down my system at times. It seemed more stable then the previous antivirus programs I've used, so I went ahead and updated it to Bitdefender Internet Security 2010 after about two weeks of use. Worked the same for a while until I started really noticing the difference between these programs and my last antivirus program, Spyware Doctor.  When I first installed Bitdefender Antivirus 2010, it found a couple of problems that Spyware Doctor didn't. However, since then it's found almost nothing, which is strange... when I used Spyware Doctor, I would scan every night and find four or five minor problems (tracking cookies, etc) over the course of a week. This program hasn't found anything in the last two months. I finally reinstalled Spyware Doctor and came up with several minor security risks that Bitdefender ignored. My definitions are automatically updated, so that isn't the problem.  After about a month of using it, I began having strange problems. First, Bitdefender's firewall suddenly began causing problems with programs that were normally allowed to access the internet. I tried removing them from the exceptions list then re-adding them, but nothing worked. I finally gave up and disabled Bitdefender's firewall and everything worked fine again. I emailed their support, but never received a response.  Second, around the same time I began having computer lockups... my computer would stop responding and run EXTREMELY slow. At the same time, the Bitdefender icon in the taskbar would turn grey with the message telling me that Bitdefender encountered a problem and I need to restart the computer. It usually cleared itself up within a few minutes, but would reoccur randomly. Sometimes it would go several days, other times it would happen two to three times in a single evening. I finally had to shut down the real-time monitoring, which seems to have cured this problem.  Well, after shutting down the process scanning and the firewall, and not being happy with the daily system scanning, what's left? Email scanning is flaky at best (will suddenly mark a single email in the middle of an entire conversation with a friend as 'spam'), and it's extremely slow (2-3x as long to check email). I also hate the fact that every time it finds a spam message it gives you a pop-up. I haven't found a way to shut these off, but by now I've given up and have moved on. One of the worst antivirus programs I've ever used.	-1
I was really hoping that this new product would be easy to use for a busy person like me. I just want a program that I can install and leave it alone.  It was very easy to load on my laptop, and runs fine on the laptop.  However, I have had big problems with the program on my desktop.  I can't get the virus scan to update at all. When I sought tech support, their suggested fixes did not work.  When I tried again, they still didn't work.  Now I don't know what to do. They did email me back within 24 hours; however, their literature suggests I call or email, but there is no phone number listed.  I was not able to correct the problem on my desktop.  I guess I'll have to load a different program on my desktop.  This one didn't work for me.	-1
Save your money.  Lame jokes, lame story.  Please stop giving Will Ferrell movie roles.	-1
Right around the turn of the century it became very fashionable to mine the nostalgia of the latest crop of people who are now adults with paying jobs - Gen X, basically. The truth is that many of the pop culture artifacts that have seeped into our consciousness earned their place not by being very good but by being very repetitive. There are many, many shows I watched not because I was interested in them but because you couldn't swing a television remote without catching Happy Days, The Brady Bunch, The Love Boat, Fantasy Island, etc. If you were a kid on a Saturday morning, this meant you couldn't avoid Land of the Lost.  Land of the Lost was never very good, but it didn't matter to me: It was the only way I was going to see monsters on television. Back then, any monster special effects were relegated to the big screen, and since I wasn't allowed to see most movies that featured them Land of the Lost was the only way I was going to see dinosaurs - even if they were poorly animated puppets or claymation. So you better believe I watched every bizarre episode I could, even if it never made any sense, the acting was frequently terrible, and the sets, costumes, and actors looked like they were made of rubber.  Producers who decide to update these nostalgia icons have a choice: revamp the terrible show with utter seriousness (think "Lost in Space") or shamelessly mock it instead. "Land of the Lost" chooses to mock its source material.  The problem is that it's not a loving mockery made by fans. It's clear the producers didn't do their homework. Oh they got some things right - they mimic the look-and-feel of the Sleestaks, of Cha-Ka, and Grumpy the dinosaur (sans claymation). But the innocent wonder is replaced with a smarmy, cynical approach that makes Will Ferrell out to be kind of a jerk.  The three main characters are paleontologist Rick Marshall (Ferrell), student Holly Cantrell (Anna Friel, sporting a variety of tight t-shirts), and randomly inserted gift shop owner and foil to Marshall, Will Stanton (Danny McBride). They fall through a wormhole, they have to get back, Sleestaks, dinosaurs, yadda-yadda, the end. Marshall's rivalry with Matt Lauer (as himself) over the existence of time warps is the funniest thing about the film.  Ferrell, who pretty much plays the same character in whatever movie he's in, doesn't have a warm cast to temper his antics. Instead he goes through a series of contrived set-ups with a punch line that ends in dinosaur excrement. This joke is used no less than three times. Scriptwriter Chris Henchy needs to find some new material.  And that's the thing. If you're not familiar with the original TV series, this is just another semi-amusing entry in Ferrell's oeuvre with dinosaurs thrown in. But the whole point of reimagining the series was to lure those fans back into the theater, and instead they ended up with a bunch of dino poop.	-1
Remember when Will Ferrel used to be funny? I do. What happened? Will he just agree to do any movie that comes his way no matter how witless it is? This movie is a dog. All of the humor is crude and unimaginative, and if you were ever a fan of the original series, you will likely be turned off by this dull "comedic" reinvention of the Saturday morning classic. Glad I got this movie from the library so I didn't pay anything to watch it. Skip this one for something worthwhile - unless you're into comedies that aren't funny. In that case, you won't be disappointed, as I was.	-1
Well I guess I didn't expect much from a film based on a low budget Saturday morning TV show, but this has got to be Ferrell's worst film to date. Sure the effects look pretty good with some nice dinosaurs and the Sleestaks, but the jokes that work are few and far between. If not for Ferrell, I don't think I would have laughed at all. Not only is the film bland, but it doesn't even know who its audience is, with some jokes that are very juvenile and others that are crude and may not be suitable for younger viewers. I'm not saying its unwatch-able, but there are so many better films out there than this boring turd. I didn't expect much, but with Will Ferrell I at least expect to laugh!	-1
Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):  1. Bad dialogue 2. Bad acting 3. Bad script 4. Bad movie - bad, bad movie!  Need I say more?  Ferrell and company lamely limp their way through this uninspired big screen version of a seventies' TV series.  So horrid are the dialogue and plot that this movie makes Brendan Fraser's "Journey to the Center of the Earth" look like a National Geographic special.  The end result of watching this tale of a time-warp -adventure-gone-stupid is a splitting headache from trying to keep your eyebrows in your head.  This is one that should remain lost.

Paint Shop Pro used to be an easier to use Photoshop type program that was comprehensive and yet understandable.  Slowly, with every release since Corel took the program from Jasc, the program has gone downhill.  They remove necessary features and add unecessary features. NO manuals, no support, just a useless program. DO NOT BUY OR INSTALL THIS PROGRAM AS IT IS ENTIRELY USELESS! UPDATE TO ABOVE REVIEW:  I have persevered with the program and it only gets worse.  It is now June 1, 2010 and Corel still has made no attempt to fix the project creator part of the program which STILL does not work at all.  There is NO excuse for this.  It is clear Corel does not care one bit for it's users and is interested in making money on a program, whether it works or not.  The new text tool could work if there was a user manual or the help files explained it properly.  As it is, the only way to apply text is by trial and error, a very frustrating experience.  I have been using this program since version 8 and it seems that they have gone out of their way to make it worse.  There is a project part of the program but there is no way to get photos into the project workspace.  It just doesn't function.  I wrote to Corel about this and they said they know it's a problem.  So it seems I've paid for a program they know doesn't work and have been really shafted by Corel.  The program is very new and already there is an update that so far fixes nothing.  What's wrong with a company that releases software that doesn't work and needs patches within weeks of release.  The saddest part is that Paint Shop Pro used to be a terrific program.	-1
I know there are fans of this software, and it's a good buy, but I prefer Photoshop Elements (Adobe) and can't get into the PS Pro interface. It's ok but I find it slower and clunkier than Photoshop Elements. I suppose it's what you are used to, that is, a matter of taste. However, it will do the job of editing photos. Meh.	-1
The marketing information makes this software look like it should be fabulous... lots of useful features that I would love to experiment with.  However, the software just doesn't work.  I will keep using my very old JASC version of this software instead.	-1
Corel used to be a reliable software company producing great software. I think it has matured and is perhaps on the decline because it seems more and more that new innovation is lacking and quality control is not sufficient. You can read the rest of the reviews and see a similar story. Not what it used to be.... I won't be using this software.	-1
I'm going to put this into bullet statements so that this is quick, easy and painless. My experience with this program was anything but.  1. This software took a ridiculous amount of time to completely install and relinquish control of my machine back to me.  2. I installed this on a nearly new machine with Windows 7 only 1 week old. This program started causing reboot problems with my machine almost immediately. Starting the program and trying use the features seem to also take forever. I was a bit afraid to try and render something or save a large file.  3. The interface looks like a slick version of Windows 3.1 (which is old, people. 1992 old) And for its lack of ability in anything but 16 bit, it seems almost fitting.  4. As technically overwhelming as Adobe Photoshop is, this program was about as intuitive as a rock and often behaved like one. I gave it a fair shot and spent several weeks going back and forth with it.  5. Freezes a lot. Crashes a lot. Lost work several times. Several of the features failed to load properly but was only apparent when I tried to use it.  6. Want to try to get a secondary manual to help you through learning the software? Guess again, there aren't many choices at all. This isn't a very popular photo editing product in the photography world at all.  7. It took forever to uninstall this program and it left behind so many registry keys and bloatware files that I decided to just scrub the entire windows installation as I thought this program may have actually corrupted my Windows installation. THAT hasn't happened in years.  8. Some of the features were just ridiculous, too. Corel needs to decide if they're trying to build a  web browser or a photo editing program. They're trying to be cool and do both, but it's just an awful sluggish attempt at both.  Epic Fail, folks. Epic.  ...	-1
I am hardly a professional photographer, but take a lot of digital photographs, and need quick, easy ways to get them ready to print and/or share.  Unfortunately, I struck out with this product.  The installation was slow.  The scan to find all of the existing pictures on my hard drive took forever (and I don't have *that* many pictures) and really bogged down my computer.  I had trouble using some of the features (or finding them).  I struggled for what seemed like an hour just to get the first picture done, and thought it would speed up after that (learning curve and all).  Unfortunately, the program seemed determine to slow down my computer, or crash it all together, leading me to eventually uninstall the program (slowly...).  So, I certainly don't recommend this program.  Not user-friendly, not computer-friendly.  All in all, a waste of my time and efforts.  Ugh.	-1
As a longtime user of Photoshop, I recommend that these high-end features are not for everybody, and I have been searching over the past few years for a good alternative for the beginning or lite user, who just needs a basic photo editing tool for red-eye removal, the addition of some basic but cool effects, and file management.  Core PaintShop Photo Express looked like it might be that tool, so I was excited when I was given the opportunity to try it out. Let me start with what I like:  1. Good integration with online services. It is very easy to go from PaintShop to post the photos on photo sharing sites or to even get them printed. However, this is not a feature unique to PaintShop and even some free programs (Picasa) do it almost as well. 2. Media organizer: For people like my grandparents who for some reason have a very difficult time organizing files and folders within Windows, I do think that the Media Organizer could be helpful. It is not quite as powerful as Adobe Bridge, but is very user friendly. Power users will be annoyed at its lack of features. 3. Simple edits: To do basic edits, Corel is very simple. Cropping, red eye removal, and pre-made enhancements are easy to add.  HOWEVER, as one reviewer has already commented, the fact that it overwrites original files is extremely dangerous, especially for the entry-level user at which this app is targeted. Yes it's cool to change the colors, crop, and add effects to photos. But these need to be saved as separate files so that the original untouched photo is still available. As far as I can tell, this isn't even an option. People like my grandparents won't even know what they're doing until they've changed all the pictures they've taken while playing around.  Also, all of the features that I like in Corel (see above) are done better in both Adobe Elements. As I said, the features of free programs like Google's Picasa really aren't that far off from what this app can do. So I do not recommend it. Rather, for the entry level person, I recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Adobe-Photoshop-Elements-8/dp/B002ID8R3Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Adobe Photoshop Elements 8</a>&nbsp;or Picasa, which is free. For the advanced user (or one who wants to be) I'd recommend you get&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Adobe-Photoshop-CS4/dp/B001EUBSL0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Adobe Photoshop CS4</a>.	-1
Corel PaintShop Photo Express 2010 has a slick looking but unconventional interface and very little functionality. In fact, common free photo editing software features much more functionality. I believe it is intended for people with very little experience with computers and no experience with other photo editing software. However, for the rest of us using it is mostly an annoying experience.  If you launch it by selecting a new photo and then right clicking you still cannot edit that photo as you can with basically all other photo editing software. You have to use the import functionality and import folders with photos. You edit photos by selecting them and clicking "Edit in Express Edit". Here you can straighten, crop, fix red eye problems, and use auto fix. However, there is no batch editing functionality, no resizing, you cannot import bit maps, no pen tool, no library of filters, no magic wand, no marquee tool, etc.  I should add that by adding photos to the tray you have some limited resizing options (small/medium/large).  Windows Live Photo Gallery is a free tool photo editing tool with all those editing features and much more. I am not referring to Windows Photo Gallery which comes pre-installed with Vista and is also pretty useless. I am talking about Windows Live Photo Gallery which is free and you easily can download.  After using an editing tool in Corel PaintShop Photo Express 2010 you click the Apply button to apply it and see the effect. When you leave the editor or go to the next photo your work is automatically saved to disk without prompting you. You can restore the old photo by opening up the editor again and pressing "Revert to original". Basically, Corel Photo Express 2010 automatically saves your stuff (whether you want that or not) but you can always revert back. This is good for users who don't understand the concept of file and save. However, it makes it virtually impossible to use other photo editing software in conjunction with Corel Photo Express 2010 and you are running the risk of destroying photos. Corel Photo Express 2010 will over write your work without your explicit permission one way or another.  Other things that annoyed me were; it is slow, it sets itself as the default photo editor upon install without asking for your permission, the install took a long time, there are new updates very often, and you cannot use save as to save file/photo wherever you want on disk. You can only save to folders you have imported.  You can use Corel Photo Express 2010 to create little projects like a Photo Book, cards, collages, calendars, and slide shows. To get nice results you need to create these projects and then order them on-line (rather then trying to print them yourself). I thought that the functionality for automatically uploading pictures to face book or send photo emails was nifty but not essential functionality. When you upload to face book it asks you for your user name and password and creates an album called "Corel Uploader Photos". If you find the face book up loader annoying that functionality has some value to you but I would not pay for it.  In summary, I can maybe recommend Corel Photo Express 2010 to the computer illiterate but with reservations. For all others it is definitely a DON'T BUY.	-1
Corel PaintShop Photo Express 2010 is  very basic program that wasn't what I thought it was.  It doesn't provide the user with enough tools to edit photos the way I had hoped.	-1
I really do hate giving a product only one star but this product has earned it. I am puzzled because Corel has most of the facilities to produce a user friendly photo editing program at low cost. After all, they have all of the routines coded already. In addition, since they bought out Ulead, they now have two different approaches to photo editing.  While I realize that they were targeting the casual photographer, that can be done with existing routines from their other products. I use Automatic Photo Correction all of the time from their Ulead Photoimpact product that does cost three times as much as this one does but it has so many more capabilities that cause it to cost that much more. But its basic functions could have been put into this product and been even easier to use than this one is with more capabilities and still meet their cost goals.  Their automatic photo correction isn't much better than Windows Picture Gallery and that is a free component of Windows. The only major capabilities missing from Picture Gallery are the ability to change the picture size and to rotate the picture. But those features are already functional in Photoimpact as well as several other Corel products.  The overall feeling I got using this product is the same I got using ACDSEE's editor only clumsier. The suggested retail price of ACDSEE is the same as for Photo Express but ACDSEE has so many more features they are not in the same league. Yet their target customer is the same as Corel's is, the casual photographer maintaining their home scrapbooks.  All I can say is that simple doesn't have to mean simplistic and even casual photo editors are going to want to do a few fancy things like add fancy text or stylize some of their photos.	-1
I can remember the glory days of Corel - that time in the 1990s when each release came with more and more clone fonts and clip art. The price was so low (compared to Adobe Illustrator, the only competition) that examples of Corel would show up in ordinary office documents, like the "Word-Art" equivalents as headlines.  But that was then. Nowadays Corel is, unfortunately, a second-string company, eclipsed by the Adobe Empire. But also the market has changed. There are millions of digital photographers, seduced by the promise of "No developing - pictures immediately." That's a market that's served by plenty of programs these days, and it's not as easy as it once was to make a name for yourself.  The market has several free and low-cost options which are simplified versions of major programs like Photoshop. Photoshop is my weapon of choice, but I'd be the first to admit that it's way too complicated for the average snap-shooter to understand. In many cases people just want to remove red-eye from flash, and have some easy way to sort their pictures.  Even Photoshop Elements is over the heads of many users, so the best choice for one's mythical "grandparents" are those free and low-cost programs for under $50. There are numerous options, including photo manipulating programs that come for free to download, or free with an operating system or camera. To succeed in this area a program will have to be better than the others.  Unfortunately Corel Paint Shop Photo Express just isn't different enough. Other reviewers have compared it to Picasa (free) and other cheap options. The interface simplifies tasks, but so do the interface in many similar programs. Free programs like Windows Live Photo Gallery and Picasa have advanced features like face recognition, which I couldn't find in the Corel offering.  So why is Corel's offering here? My only guess is that some unscrupulous salespeople in the big electronic stores will mention to a new purchaser of a Windows 7 computer that "it doesn't come with Photo-Editing software." They then point the buyer to a row of Photo-Editing software that they can sell to the unsuspecting, because you can download Windows Live Photo Gallery from Microsoft for free. It's not in Windows 7 so that other companies can get a shot at this market, but I think you'll find that the Microsoft offering is better than Corel's.  So, sorry, yet another voice against this program. A pity, because I would have like Corel to do well, but it didn't happen in this case.	-1
I like the idea of this software, a simplified photo "express" program that allows one to quickly and easily edit photos.  Unfortunately, the execution of Corel PaintShop Photo Express 2010 misses the mark.  The software is slow to install and seemed to bog down the computer system as soon as it was running.  The program also made itself "king" of all photo tasks on my computer, which I did not appreciate.  Like others have mentioned, the program overwrites your files without asking and without warning.  Not a big deal if you don't mind, but as is obvious from the other reviews, most people mind.  I have several different photo editing programs on my computer, based on how much editing I want to do and how long I want to spend.  These programs range from the free ones downloaded from the camera manufacturer's websites to&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Adobe-Photoshop-Elements-8/dp/B002ID8R3Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Adobe Photoshop Elements 8</a>, but I do not plan to keep PaintShop Photo Express as one of them.	-1
Very slow installation and didn't like the way it work, I got frustrated because this program is too slow I us it for one day and uninstalled.	-1
THE QUICK TAKE:  There's a real need for a product like this - something easy to use that will get all those photos off everyone's cameras and hard drives, and get the photos organized, edited, and shared.  Something to realize some of the promise of managing your photos electronically.  But sadly in practice Corel PhotoShop isn't that product - the emphasis and execution are off the mark.  THE FULL REVIEW:  The description of Corel PhotoShop Express 2010 really caught my interest. A program that could help me do a quick retouch, as well as organize my backlog of photos, could really be useful.  Digital photography makes it easy to take lots of photos, but more people are realizing the challenge of managing all those photos after the shot.  I've done a lot of photography and photography projects, and used Adobe Photoshop and Paintshop Pro quite a bit.  I like them both for different reasons, but there are a few key needs I'd come to realize weren't being met: - Sometimes I needed to do a quick retouch with a handful of tools, and at times the plethora of features of those more complicated programs just got in the way. - Those programs were also no help for organizing and tagging the backlog of photos. - Getting the photos uploaded (to share or print) can be time consuming.  I think lots of people have some similar needs.  So, a great idea, right?  Unfortunately the reality is a little jarring, at least for me.  I'm used to having some say about what is installed, and how, and how the program handles my files.  I also like to know what's going on - for example, when I click update, I'd like to know if there is an update, and how large, so I could decide when to update.  I only found out it was updating when I quit the program.  INSTALLATION:  I'm pretty tolerant of programs that need a lot of time and space to install, especially imaging programs - the input and output devices make it complicated.  Getting it right is what counts.  But 2+GB, really?  That's somewhere between 100 and 1000 times larger than some of my favorite imaging programs.  (A lot of the time seemed to be spent on configuring Microsoft's .NET framework - another product that seemed like a great idea but is cumbersome in practice.  And, it installs the Windows Media Encoder ... which might be great for some, but I have no plans to use it.)  Luckily System Restore will unwind this mess.  INTERFACE:  The user interface is very attractive, if cryptic and limited.  There are very few choices, tools or options.  (That may be a pro or a con, depending on your point of view.)  The help files are somewhat limited, but may be adequate for those likely to use this program.  FILE SEARCH: When you first start up PaintShop Photo, it starts searching for files.  Unfortunately, that's not what I wanted it to do, and not only could I not find a way to stop it, it didn't provide any update on how the search was proceeding, or where it was searching.  It ought to ask whether to do that, or to let the user manually import.  EDITING FEATURES:  The editing features are simply too limited.  Given the computer resources this product consumers, they could easily have included a broader range of features.  I'm not sure why they thought it was important to add a lot of video features, but give short shrift to the image editing - a good example of how they missed in emphasis.  BOTTOM LINE:  This might be a reasonable product for someone who is primarily interested in organizing and then sharing or printing photos; for whom editing is a low priority; who doesn't feel the need to know what the software is doing to your files; and who likes a program that will go ahead and make decisions without asking for input.  That's pretty much the opposite of me.  But if that's you, and you have a powerful computer - it may be a fit, and it has a very attractive and simplistic user interface.	-1
Corel Paintshop Photo Express is marketed as another alternative that lets you edit your personal photos on your computer without having to go to a professional editing place to do so. It's a little easier to use than Photoshop and the average computer user shouldn't have much of a problem navigating the software. It does some of the basics that Photoshop can do and gets done what's needed in most photo edits like red eye reduction, adjusting lighting, and eliminating defects in non digital photos etc. However, the software has some flaws that cannot be overlooked. When saving, the software does not make it clear that the picture you are editing will overwrite the original file. If you don't have a backup the changes the user made will be permanent. It's also slow at times and has a few stability issues in Windows 7 which will most likely be dealt with by patches and updates. Hopefully Corel will listen and fix a few of these problems the users face in order to make the software a little less annoying. It's decent but the software needs to work out a few bugs before it's more suitable for use otherwise stick to a more polished software like Photoshop Elements or CS4. The time it takes for the beginner to learn the features of Adobe's Photoshop software might be more worth your time and money.	-1
Don't just walk away from this purchase, run!  This has got to be the worst photo software I have ever used.  I think the Express stands for how fast you are going to get frustrated with using the program.  From the ridiculous way it overwrites the original pictures to the slowness of the program, this software has got to be the worst out there.  I'd rather use the free built-in tools with Windows than spend a dime on this software package.  Of course its not just the features of the program that are awful, there is also the general Windows 7 incompatibility.  If you have made the switch to Windows 7 be prepared for a world of headache with this program.  From constant program crashing to its inability to use any of the new features of the OS (libraries anyone?) Photo Express is a good example of how not to design a program to make use of a modern OS.  My final word on this?  Stay away!  Run!  Run! Run!	-1
So far I've had to uninstall this software from 2 computers because it slowed them down too much.  If you're looking for something lightweight that has a great detection engine I'd recommend Kaspersky.	-1
I bought this product after reading about AVG and its glowing reviews.  However, I had a problem with the install on my second computer.  The firewall simply would not install.  I tried the online fixes at AVG's Website but none of them worked.  I had to email "customer support," since apparently AVG is too cheap to provide a phone number.  Someone named Lakshmi, I am sure from India, emailed me back but his fix did not work.  I would recommend Trend Micro over this want-to-be anti-virus.  Trend has toll-free technical support and you get to speak with a live body, instead of being hung out to dry with second-rate support from India!	-1

Installation went well but as soon as I get in and start using this, it starts crashing.  I've visited the Corel webpage and I'm not finding anything helpful, just some .DLL replacement suggestions.  My computer never crashes, only with Corel software (oddly, I have issues with their Blu-ray playing software as well).  After fighting with it for an afternoon I uninstalled and never looked back.	-1
I give this product one star only because I can't give it zero stars! I was lucky to get my money back and that was only because Amazon came to my assistance.	-1

If you are considering buying this - don't!  Version 12 is a nightmare.  The DocuCom watermark appears on your scans.  To remove the watermark they charge another $99!  My advice is to use the scanning software that came with your PC, download OpenOffice and covert to PDF this way, download a free PDF converter from download dot-com, spend the money and get Adobe Acrobat Pro.  Any option is far better than PaperPort!	-1
Quick question:  How would you like your word processor putting "Microsoft Office 2010 (c) Microsoft" on the bottom of every page on your resume, or company brochure?  You would use Word Perfect instead!  PaperPort has the same issue-they insist on putting their name on the watermark of every scanned page.	-1
Not at all happy with this software. We run XP Pro with Microsoft Office Suite 2007.  After install, it created an instability on my computer and locked up the memory cache. Extremely heavy resource hog, running at 100%.  The overall concept is nice, if it were to work.  I don't recommend this for XP Pro users, but you may have better luck with Vista though.	-1
As a avid user of the older paperport 8 product I was hoping that I would love the improvements in paperport 12. Alas, not so much. I didn't have the disabling issues described by so many other reviewers causing big problems immediately. I found it was much slower than the older version and didn't offer any features that were compelling for the upgrade price.  It just seems more difficult to use and less dependable. If I'm doing a sequence of operations where I save something it never remembers the last folder. My scanner internmittently driver hangs with this version, apparently during transfer of the scanned item to paperport. Closing paperport and reopening it seems to resolve this issue until the next time.  For me this wasn't really an upgrade. Since I'm still running XP I probably should have stuck with version 8.	-1
I don't have the product, but I have been reading the reviews.  In the past I have bought Nuance's Dragon Naturally Speaking 9.5 and 10.0 and PDF Converter Professional 5 and 6, all of which worked fine.  Keep in mind that, like Corel and Avanquest, Nuance is a company that buys out other software companies to obtain their product line--so Dragon, PDF Converter and Paperport do not share the same origins.  Regarding PP12, consider this: List price for the non-Professional version is $100.  It sells on Amazon for $52.  Today (Thanksgiving) I received an email from Nuance that through November 30 they are selling it for $30, "70% off regular price", download or boxed.  There are basically only two times when companies sell at THAT much of a discount: (1) To get rid of boxed product when they are getting ready to launch a new version; or (2) When the product has a major problem and is getting lousy reviews.  Although I'm an attorney, I am a power user who worked as an electronic tech for 10 years, I worked several years as a programmer and I have worked extensively with computers for 30 years.  Nuance's extensive registry hack is ridiculous even if it does work (don't know).  One commenter says when he loaded the software his CPU usage went to 100% and it seemed PP12 was trying to index all PDF's on his system.  I ran into the same situation with Nuance's PDF Converter.  ADOBE READER INSTALLS AN "iFilter" THAT INDEXES ALL PDF'S SO WINDOWS SEARCH CAN SEARCH THEM.  VARIOUS NUANCE PRODUCTS INSTALL THEIR OWN INDEXER THAT DUPLICATES THIS ACTIVITY.  For PDF Converter Professional, the background indexer can be turned off by starting msconfig, selecting the Services tab, checking the Hide all Microsoft services box (not necessary -- just for convenience), and in the Services column uncheck PDFProFiltSrv, Manufacturer Nuance Communications.  Probably PP12's indexer can be turned off the same way.  I don't really know what the differences are between PP12 and Nuance's PDF Converter Pro 6 (list $100), but I have been quite satisfied with that (although I also have Acrobat Standard 9 and mainly use that).  Nuance's lower-priced variations of PDF Create/Converter can't scan documents, nor can PDF Converter Pro before version 6.  At their website Nuance does offer a 30-day free trial for PDF Pro Converter but not for PaperPort.  Per Nuance's website, the non-Pro PP12 does not have the virtual printer driver that allows you to create PDF's from any application. (You can use the free DoPDF program, ver. 6.3.)	-1
When Quicken goes under, I'm going to wear a pink tuxedo to the funeral.  [These comments are based on my continuing nightmare of lousy experiences with Quicken Deluxe 2008. This software, which has been getting continually worse since 2002, couldn't have possibly improved since then ... ]  For me Quicken 2008 was a forced/hostage upgrade from Quicken 2005. You "have" to upgrade since they've cut a deal with the financial institutions to cut off your online access with the institutions if you don't upgrade every three years. Just as found when I was hostage upgraded in 2005 from 2002, there's nothing more than a cosmetic face-lift, no meaningful fixes/improvements -- but there's even more bugs, problems and aggravation.  * Product now will not connect properly to Fidelity; no problem under 2005.  * Took forever to figure out how to turn off a "reminder" function ... that kept reminding me to pay bills already scheduled to be paid using the auto-pay function. 2005 did the same thing and it's not been fixed.  *You can turn off the product registration nag screen ... if you Google to find out how. Product does not have to be registered to use it.  * Un-reconciles accounts six months back every once in a while. I've been assuming that's being caused by a few bytes of bad data that occasionally comes from the financial institutions ... that the Quicken people have not properly coded so as to filter out. This bug also surfaced in 2005. Two weeks into 2008, I've seen it again already.  * You can't turn off the "free update/revision" nag screen unless you take the update. No such nag screen in 2005.  * When connecting, the completion screen used to show which accounts had new transactions to match and had convenient buttons next to each to take you directly to the account. Gone in 2008. Now I have to look through every account each time to see where transactions might have been retrieved.  * Icons everywhere attempting to peddle other unwanted Quicken products. One of the 'product improvements' in 2008.  * Doesn't handle stock distributions correctly (since they were not actually paid for); keeps generating error messages when you enter the correct posting of no cost incurred. Same problem in 2005.  * Tricky screens/checkboxes/prompts that try to bait you into using/enrolling for QuickenDot services when you don't have to or need to. Users that did so now post complaints they can't undo it and that the QuickenDot server is constantly down, causing problems/delays when trying to connect to other accounts using a one-step update.  Yet another company that's grown totally complacent about product quality while wallowing in its assured-for-the-moment revenue stream. It will bite them hard in the long-run. Postings indicate similar complaining regarding the major competitor product, Microsoft Money. If history is any lesson, there's no reason to suspect that these software products will ever get better under these conditions. Some other product will have to steal their customer base before they wake up and smell the coffee.  If you are not already committed to either of those two products, take a good long look at open source software such as GNU Cash.  [Update: April 15, 2008] Does now connect to Fidelity ... occasionally. When I opened the portfolio area today, the entire computer screen flashed with confusion and the product crashed. 2005 never once crashed. Still flashing but no subsequent crashes. Who knows what happened. Not me. Apparently not Quicken programmers either.  [Update: July 12, 2008] Connects to Fidelity now more or less on regular basis. Software still flashes/flickers routinely. Also slow to load, apparently trying to read every single record into RAM, regardless of age. Pop-up screen this morning stating "We've noticed you are not downloading your current Quicken Visa/MasterCard transactions, click here to ..." I don't have one. Obviously a deceptive come-on intended to trick users into the application process for a Quicken credit card. Nice. Still constantly beg-screens me to take the latest software update.  [Update: October 18, 2008] Just downloaded this week's financial transactions and Quicken wiped out four months of reconciliation on one of my credit cards ... again.  [Update: January 10, 2009] Tried to change the amount of an annual repeating payment. Refused to accept the change with the error message "You must make this change and sign on no later than six days before scheduled payment." Payment was set for April 4, 2009, almost three months in the future. I had to delete the payment, log on to make the deletion take effect, then enter the payment all over again for the new amount, then log on again to make that payment take effect. And when I tried to log on I rec'd an error message stating an Internet connection was not detected (a message I get rather often despite my always-on broadband). Luckily I can choose the "Ignore" button and it will go ahead and connect. Quicken programming staff = worthless carpetbaggers.  [Update: March 5, 2009] Wanted to stop an ongoing monthly repeating payment where the next scheduled payment was already in place in my register for March 27. I edited in a change for "how many times" from "unlimited" to "1." In other words, I wanted to pay on March 27 for the last time. When I logged on to the bank the first time, Quicken canceled the March 27 payment. Now doesn't that take the cake--Quicken accounting/finance software programmers are unable to count up to one. And, as all too often anymore, the screen went wacko while I was logging onto the bank.  [Update: March 8, 2009] Quicken just UNreconciled one of my credit cards (again) back to the October, 2008 close. Luckily, its a card I don't use much. I suppose this has something to do with Quicken software coders not understanding the start of Daylight Savings Time.  [Update: March 27, 2009] The repeating payment change I referred to at March 5, 2009? The saga continues. When I tried to enter the NEW repeating payment, it wouldn't take. I entered it, connected to the bank and nothing happened. The payment did not show in the list of repeating payments or in the register. I tried deleting the payee entirely to start over, but Quicken wouldn't/won't let me delete that payee at all. It claims it cannot be deleted because there is a repeating payment in effect ... that would be the payment that is ALREADY canceled. Which means I can't cancel it so I can't delete the payee. To set up the new payment I ended up having to create an entire new payee to make the new payment 'take.' I had to put a dash in the middle of the account number to create the new payee since Quicken won't allow two repeating payments with the exact same account number. And I am still stuck with the old payee on file which I cannot delete at all. I had to call the bank twice just to make sure the durn payment is actually going to be made on time ... and made only once ... and for the correct amount. You would think there would be a way to force deletion of a payee. Then again YOU are thinking, Quicken programmers on the other hand are off somewhere slurping down a latte.  [Update: April 2, 2009] Have an established monthly recurring payment of $[...] and would like to change it to $[...]. Enter the Online Center, click on Repeating. There it is. Click on it then select Edit. Change the amount from $[...] to $[...]. Save the change. Seems simple enough. Log on to the bank. Result: (1) Quicken cancels the next pending payment, on April 19, of $[...]. So far so good. (2) Quicken enters a pending payment into the checkbook register for $[...] dated May 19. Huh? What happened to my April payment? God only knows what will happen if I tinker with this recurring payment any further. I will write a paper check for one month ... and hope for the best. A[...]  [Update: July 14, 2009] Quicken is popping up a screen telling me I am overdue on a July 10 payment to a vendor for $[...]. The register shows the payment was made and cleared on July 10. And it's reminding me to schedule another future payment ... that's already scheduled. It's the same durn thing I was talking about in bullet # 2 at the top of the review, apparently it's a zombie bug that has now risen from the dead. Still begs me to take the Quicken software update constantly.  [Update: September 15, 2009] Quicken has suddenly started reminding me ... once again ... that certain bills are overdue, even though they've already been paid using the automatic monthly payment function. It asks me if I want to delete, pay or skip. I can only guess what havoc might occur if I delete or skip ... so I just keep waiting for the nag screen to eventually go away.  [Update: January 17, 2010] Repeating payment to my HOA increasing by four bucks a month. Learned already the hard way that if you change it by just increasing the payment, it doesn't take. So I first deleted the existing repeating payment entirely (but not the existing payee). Logged onto the bank. Deletion occurred properly. THEN I tried to create a new repeating payment (using the existing payee). Enter all the information - and nothing happens. Just like I never entered it at all. Rebooting, log on to the bank again, no change. So I created a new payee (with slightly different spellings for payee name and account number since those fields define the unique payee). Creation took place properly - after every desktop icon on screen flashed on and off screen for nearly a minute. Logged on to bank to let Quicken advise of new payee. THEN created new payment using the tweaked, new payee. Logged on again. More icon flashing in process. New repeating payment now appears in register. Although it has NOT always done so in the past, THIS TIME Quicken let me delete the old payee. For users that can't figure out these kinds of workarounds, the simple, everyday-routine, core process of adjusting the amount of a repeating payment simply doesn't work. It USED to work in older versions of Quicken, so I can only assume Quicken programmers spend their lazy afternoons destroying old code and functionality - instead of writing new code to fix known bugs.  [Update: January 26, 2010] The above described payment (at four bucks more) was made successfully to the HOA yesterday. In the Quicken Bill Reminder Tray it says I have FOUR payments missing - all to the HOA, all at the new 'four bucks more' amount, two of them due yesterday and two of them due today. As always when this tray incorrectly reports overdue payments, the tray's three choices are Enter, Edit and Skip. Which one would you dare use to try to get the stuff to disappear? If you choose Skip, will it take the payment back? Maybe in the mirror-image BizarroWorld that is Quicken software.  [Update: July 25, 2010] Used a certain credit card last month (that hadn't been used otherwise in about eight months). The account had been live and retrieving transactions without incident for years. The account password is saved in Quicken so that it can do so. But guess what, those new transactions did not retrieve after multiple log-ons (using Quicken's "one-step update" which logs on to all active accounts in a single pass). Quicken reflects the account as active for transaction retrieval, everything AOK. Quicken also reflects the connection took place with the account without error. If I didn't KNOW I had transactions not retrieved, I wouldn't have had the least idea there was an error. Not that Quicken would give me the least indication to do so, I went ahead and tried solving the error by re-running the account through the 'online initialization' process again. It worked. The transactions then retrieved normally. HOWEVER the NEXT time I tried to run through the logon/retrieval process, Quicken demanded I provide the account's password. That would be the very same password it had in storage to begin with - and that I JUST provided to Quicken a SECOND time when I did the re-initialization. Dumb, dumb, dumb. Also, after the re-initialization, I started getting a message that claims 'your last update attempt was not successful, do you want to re-try?" I figure that erroneous message will resolve itself after enough time has eroded since 'my last update attempt.'  [Update: August 8, 2010] I wanted to change the amount for a repeating payment (the equal pay plan for my utility bill was adjusted), so I used the `change' function. Kick me in the *** because (1) using the obviously correct approach in Quicken often means trouble and (2) I've tried this before and it's a major fail. I opened the repeating payment, changed the amount and clicked the OK button. As I was signing on, Quicken advised it would be changing the payment amount just exactly as I had entered it. Result: both payments, old and new, are in the register. I marked the old payment for deletion and re-connected to the bank. The bank generated an error message stating that the old payment had already been cancelled. I tried deleting the old payment from my register and it won't budge. It demands that I must log on in order to complete the deletion. As I just said, when I logged on the bank refused to recognize the deletion request.  OK. I have a new plan for opening a can of whoop@ss on Quicken's demons. I will delete the NEW payment, then delete the payee entirely. Then Quicken will HAVE to let go of the old payment, right? Then I will re-create the payee. I marked the new payment for deletion and logged on. It WAS deleted at both the bank AND in the Quicken register. But when I try to delete the payee, Quicken says "cannot delete payee for which there are repeating online payments scheduled." Go to the screen that lists all the repeating payments. Nothing there. Go back to the register. The old payment is still there. The old payment that refuses to be deleted until it yaks with the bank ... too bad the bank says it's already deleted and won't yak. Totally screwed by Quicken again.  Eventually I discover via Googling that Quicken has an undocumented save posted in their support blogs - to use CTRL to force the deletion of the old payment. It works. I suppose that's worth half-a-point. OK, now let's put the new payment back (like it was before I deleted it). I enter all the information, click OK. Nothing happens. Acts like I entered nothing at all. Try it three times, zippo. I look in the list of repeating payments. I look in the transactions pending for transmission. I look in the register. Nothing. Unfortunately I've been here before. This entire process has "imploded" the payee, making it unusable.  I'll have to create an entirely new payee. I go to delete the old payee. It won't let me. It STILL insists I have repeating payments outstanding against it. Whattaeffing piece of software cr@pola.  I already have two other old payees I can't delete that act just like this ... even though they haven't been involved any kind of payment in at least a year. Quicken says in that same support blog webpage that using the CTRL key also forces payee deletions. Wrong, wrong, wrong. Can't get rid of it. (You can see these kinds of problems also discussed earlier in this review.) I will have to put a space or something in the account number to create a brand new payee, since that account number has already been "used" and Quicken won't let me re-use it. And I am stuck with another old payee I can't delete.  Oh, and down in my tab titled "Scheduled Bills & Deposits Due" I still  (as described above) have listed FOUR TIMES my monthly HOA payment, as being overdue from 13 days ago. (It's a repeating monthly payment set up in Quicken months ago, and it was already paid on schedule.) The four listings are actually two pairs of amounts, each pair one day apart. All of these are artifacts from where I tried to adjust that repeating payment amount when I experienced an increase. The three choices are "enter" "edit" or "skip" I've learned to wait until well after the bill is actually paid, then enter "skip." Otherwise it may well try to pay twice. (I've already described this particular bug up above ... just a reminder, it never goes away.) Bottom line:  since about 2005, the Quicken product has become totally effed up.  I am now about six months now from the next cycle of Quicken's "sunset policy." Every three years, you have to pay for the Quicken upgrade or they cut off your ability to download transactions from your financial institutions (Quicken servers are the `middle man" between your software and the institutions). Maybe it's time to migrate to competing software product that works right, only has to be bought once ... and connects directly to my institution to collect unadulterated data!  [UPDATE: August 14, 2010] FREE AT LAST, FREE AT LAST !! After that last fiasco, I decided why invest more time trying to solve the Quicken problem ... when I could invest that time migrating to Moneydance 2010.  Moneydance, what a dream come true! And much less painful a migration that I imagined. Just buy the license at the website first, then download&install the product. Here's a couple of key points I learned (the hard way) that should make your migration run smooth as silk:  * Export the data from Quicken using the "all accounts' option (not one account at a time). I had to look for it but that choice WAS in the Quicken drop-down list.  * When importing IGNORE any advice Moneydance offers that you ought check the "Import account info only" option (ie, to import the structure/tables/fieldnames first, then to go back and re-do the procedure to get the data records). When I followed that advice, I had all sorts of screwy issues, records landing every which way. When I DID NOT check the box (in essence asking Moneydance to import everything in one fell swoop - both records & structure/tables/fieldnames for all of the Quicken accounts) everything dropped right into place, ready to roll. The only record that did not import correctly (and I had ten years of records over about fifteen accounts) was the "original transfer balance in" for one account.  After that I did have to do some minor clean-up for a while - entering stock symbols, entering the names I wanted to use for the accounts, other account details such as my credit card numbers. To make the stock prices update in real time (for some reason) you have to manually add-in two developer extensions. Easy to do (so long as you realize that you have to do it) and the user's guide explains how exactly. Quick and no glitches.  Moneydance swims slick as an eel. Downloading of records only takes three or four seconds at most. With Quicken it took a lot longer. Moneydance is connecting direct to the institution; Quicken is running you through its own server as an intermediary. I wouldn't be the least bit surprised to find that a lot of my earlier issues (such as missing or duplicate records) that I did NOT post in my reviews (since I did not attribute them to Quicken) turn out to disappear. Because they were being CAUSED by Quicken's intermediary server. We'll see.  The online banking download setup was easy, but there were the most minor of issues. Moneydance did not have any idea of course when the last download was done (with Quicken), so it retrieved all the available records at the institutions. (Be smart and bring your Quicken accounts and downloads totally current and as reconciled as possible BEFORE you export them.) Also, where I had multiple accounts at one institution, it got confused first go-round, mixing them all up - and changing the account numbers in the setup parameters. I just deleted all the downloaded records and went back and re-entered the correct account numbers. After adjusting that first 'initializing' download for each account, no problems.  I haven't started using the 'setup payments through Moneydance' feature yet. My bet it'll be easy.  Moneydance. Just do it.	-1
I have used several versions of streets and trips in the past and have always felt it was a decent product and worked well enough, but had room for lots of improvements.  This was back in the day when only a select few had internet on their phones and Google didn't even have maps (mainstream at least, definitely not satellite views).  I had high hopes for Mappoint where it is supposed to be for "business" and I suppose it does have some nice features like being able to create sales territories or zones and such, but aside from that and a few other features, it is almost identical to streets and trips.  Granted, I have not used most of the "collaborative" or "analysis" functions, but I still can not see justifying the cost.  I'm not going to go into detail here (because several other reviewers already illustrated my same thoughts) but my main complaints are still the following:  - Poor search bar integration and results (i get much better results using google maps and typing in the search term while viewing the area I want to search, in MP and S&T I get results all over the US and Canada).  There were some instances where it simply could not find addresses. - Poor quality maps (google and bing offers better rendered maps and SATELLITE (they could at least offer that option to view when you have an internet connection, but instead, they have a toolbar button that links to Bing) - Inability to create list in MP and export out - Could not figure out how to multi level sort and filter imported database  While I'm sure MP has its uses, I do not see it being that useful a tool in my business (I am not in Sales and Marketing).  So like another reviewer said, download the trial first to see if it does what you want before you commit yourself to the $250+ to own it.  My last thought is that if S&T is similar (which I can' t see why it wouldn't be), even at it's lower price, I think it needs serious updates especially in this age where wireless modems, tethered phones, and standalone GPS devices are getting cheaper and more capable.	-1
First of all, as many have said, there are far cheaper and nearly as efficient ways of achieving the same results that this product offers. I found that this product didn't offer much more than what could be accomplished with google maps and [...] (or whatever your preferred travel site is.). The difference is that those sites are free to use, unlike Mappoint with its ridiculous $280 price tag.  I can see if you own a business or for companies that have employees that spend a lot of time traveling, this may make things easier for bookkeeping/planning/itinerary purposes. Using the budgeting features in terms of per diams and what not. For personal use, however, you'd be better off saving your money and using it on your vacation.  I don't own a GPS, so I was unable to test out the GPS export feature. However, the fact that you have to pay extra for the MSN service to do so definitely rubs me the wrong way. If I just paid nearly $300 for your software, the least you can do is provide the ability to interface with (at least popular/common) GPS devices for free.  All in all, unless you are in a position where you or your employees travel regularly as part of your livelyhood and you want a one stop travel planning application, don't waste your money.	-1
Old version.  Not a terribly relevant product now with the popularity of smart phone and expanding internet cell coverage with free access to really good maps from other companies.	-1
UPDATE - September 2010 - Do not buy this program unless you carry your install disks everywhere you take your computer.  I have downgraded my review from 4 stars to 1, and completely deleted my original review text.  During a recent trip, I tried opening MapPoint and received the error message "Your registry settings for this application weren't copied correctly". The fix shown was to uninstall and re-install the program. A significant difficulty since I was on the road, and don't typically lug around the install disks for every program I own whenever I leave home.  This was bad enough, but I understand there are sometimes odd glitches and just dealt with it until returning home. It did put me in a bad situation as I had all my maps and route information stored in the MapPoint program. Fortunately, my GPS was able to take over and everything worked out.  After returning home, over the course of the next few months I tried uninstalling and re-installing the program, following the Microsoft online instructions for a clean install. Same error message. I then tried uninstall/reinstall, clean reg, remove all saved maps, add another user and then open. Same error message.  Next step, contacting Microsoft directly. Unfortunately, unless you have the Product number you need to pay $35 for the pleasure of speaking or typing to someone. The product number is, of course, only accessible within the Menu once you open the program - WHICH I CANNOT DO. If I could open the program, I wouldn't need to talk to Microsoft about a program that won't open. See the problem here?  I've searched the internet, tried ever fix and workaround listed, and come to the conclusion after a few months of messing with this thing that even if I could get it up and running again, I would never trust it to not fail during another road trip. Thus, rendering a Map program, which I use for TRAVEL, completely useless.  I have a feeling that my problem stems from doing an install from an external DVD player. My travel laptop does not have an internal CD/DVD drive, so this is my only option, but I have a feeling it's the root of the problem.  My suggestion to anyone looking at this or the updated MapPoint 2011 is to only purchase it if you will be using it exclusively on in a desktop environment, and only if you are installing from an internal CD/DVD drive.	-1
I will give it to Microsoft when it comes to MapPoint. It has always been a breeze to setup, relatively simple to use, and very effective at what it does. That being said, there's not enough new content in MapPoint 2010 to justify an upgrade if you have any earlier version of the software, unless you absolutely need the new features. The improvements on MapPoint 2010 as opposed to 2009 are relatively minor. Pushpin management has been overhauled, and you also have about 300 new pushpins to choose from. Map Settings has been cleaned up slightly allowing for a sleeker presentation. Also, you are now able to import / export .gpx files, making for easier data sharing. If you need new features like these then by all means, I would recommend purchasing MapPoint 2010. If this is your first purchase of MapPoint, take advantage of the free trial download online, and also compare MapPoint's features to those of the cheaper Microsoft Streets & Trips 2010. Personally, that is what I use most often and it is perfectly suited for my individual needs.	-1
I've had this program for a while now, and I can confirm that it's not that good.  However, it's better than Streets and Trips. It has the same abilities, but is also suited to add info to Microsoft Office applications. I can see how some businesses could save the cost of the software very easily, but if you just want a street guide go with S & T.  What worries me considerably is that Microsoft has introduced what appears to be a very similar application - Bing Maps. This application is only available direct from Microsoft, and the cost varies with the number of seats you license.  That makes me wonder how long MapPoint will be available, and whether Bing Maps will be a better program.  In addition, other map companies like Google may already have similar applications or be about to release them.  I suggest you do a lot of research before you choose which application you'll buy.	-1
I have a screaming fast computer. Raid 10 drives, I7 processor, Lots of fast memory. The only thing that runs slow on this computer is Quicken. And I run a lot of different software programs on this computer. Sure can't recommend this. I wish there was an alternative, but since there is no Microsoft Money, these jerks have an undeserved monopoly.	-1
I keep purchasing Quicken hoping that it will finally do something of value. Whoever is designing this software is not in business for themself. Awful. If all you want to do is record what $$$ you have and what you are bringing or spending then just use Excel. Quicken offers no other advantages. Doesn't even xfer data correctly to Turbotax. Ergo, I refer to this as junk software. I think Intuit should refund the cost of this software to everyone who finds it as useless as I have.	-1
OK, it does what I bought it for, mostly, eventually.  I got out of the quicken habit many years ago when I didn't upgrade.  My previous experience was that the the software was fine but that intuit was annoying in that they never lost an opportunity to market to me or install unwanted crap on my computer.  Well, my new experience is that they did manage to miss a few annoyance opportunities but have addressed those problems.  I wish they had paid as much attention to shipping a better product.  Seriously, this version is slower than the one I used in 1996 and that was on a computer from that era - about 250 times slower and smaller than my current one.  The new quicken doesn't download account data any better or faster in spite of the broadband versus the old modem connection.  It's still doing the slow agonizing one account after another thing too.  The user interface feels positively sluggish.  Note, this is on a brand new laptop that is otherwise fine.  Having run software organizations, my suspicion is that quicken is a legacy product that no one at Intuit is comfortable programing anymore.  They do their best to adapt to new versions of windows, but that appears to be about all.  Other than that, they bandage what they must to keep this cash cow a-milking.  They probably don't even have a product engineering team in place anymore.  Nothin' there but marketing folks and a product manager pairing up phone support contracts with the cheapest possible suppliers.  They will however, find new and innovative ways to market to us.  Good for them, they have a monopoly and are willing to use it.  Hmmm, this market is starving for a competitive product ...	-1
Not much help in the items I bought it for. Don't bother purchasing this book.	-1
I have used Quicken in excess of ten years.  The program doesn't have credible competition which may be a reason that there are issues with every new version.  Even with the speed bumps I will continue to use Quicken as it does have value.	-1
I am sooooo fed up with dealing with Intuit and their products!  IF YOU HAVE A CHOICE, DON'T GO THERE!!!! Quicken is buggy, buggy, buggy.  Things just don't work.  Example:  Set up a loan, and watch it work on properly amortizing principal and interest within payments...for a few months. Intuit...well, they simply suck.  They will build in obsolescence so that they *force* you to buy the next version; I only bought this piece of crap because my 2007 version (that is only 3 years old, folks!) was intentionally timebombed to stop working with downloads from my bank and financial institutions.  Yeah, the software still "works"..but won't do what it used to...just because Intuit forced it to stop!!!!  I simply hate this company.  Don't go there, if you have *ANY* choice.	-1
There is not much to say for this piece of software. As others have observed, it is hard to find anything new and useful. Big change, the BANK tab. Older irritations are still there. This is comforting, since I would hate to lose my old friends and complaints. Intuit needs to hire someone that has some new ideas and a programmer to implement them. One hopes that a competitor comes along with stock update and decent bank access. Until then, plan to waste money every three years for an "upgrade" that one hopes does no harm.  The 2010 software seems to work OK. I already caught Quicken in one mistake, but it was easy to fix. The older version never made a mistake - but this is an upgrade, so you have to get something for your money - excitement. Personally, I like my financial management software to be boring, easy to use, and quick to finish the tasks so I can get back to something more interesting (almost anything, except taxes). I'll write more on Quicken 2010 after I get a chance to use it a bit longer.  I do like the new color scheme and the extra nag screens selling things.	-1
I have used Quicken since the Windows 95 days and upgraded on a regular basis.  For the most part I have found it be a very good product.  This time, I was forced to upgrade my two year old version which worked fine, because the company disabled all the account download features (the only reason to use it) effective this April.  On installing the new version, I can see no improvement over the old version.  In addition the new version constantly harasses you via annoying pop ups that cannot be disabled to buy additional products.  I resent being extorted into buying needless upgrades which are not upgrades at all.  I really resent spending a lot of bucks for a software the sole purpose of which seems to be to further the Intuit companies greed.  If zero stars were possible that would be my rating for this outrage.  ADDED LATER:  I have used this version now for about 8 weeks and find it even worse than my first comments.  It is unstable, frequently downloads inaccurate values for mutual fund shares, and the new interface is less user friendly than earlier versions.  I just wish I could have my old one which worked fine...back.	-1
Intuit continues its downhill slide in quality control and user irritation across their product line with Quicken Deluxe 2010 (Windows).  The most infuriating thing about upgrading to this version is that it introduced literally dozens of categories into my data file without even asking me.  My categories ('accounts' in accounting parlance) have been in use satisfactorily for many years and I had no need for these crazy new ones that Quicken 2010 inserted:  "Ads", "Car" (I had "Auto" and subs), dozens of "Biz" entries, etc.  My memorized reports all ask me what to do about the new categories, they show up in lists, etc ... so I'm busy purging them all at the moment...  Readability of various screens and lists has decreased over earlier versions.  Problems with reports that have existing since the 1990's still exist.  Responsiveness of the application is ridiculously slow as you page or scroll through lists, delete categories, etc - as if none of it was natively programmed.  Old (really old) bugs still exist - such as scheduled transactions not picking up the proper amounts from memorized transactions the first time you enter the payee - have to switch to another payee then back to the intended one, possibly a few times.  Instead of fixing old problems, including speed (remember when Quicken was "quick"?  I do.)...and report formatting (remember when subtotals were in a different column?, account names were not truncated?  There was space control under subtotals, and more?  Yeah - that was Quicken for DOS in 1990)  they introduced more garish charts, buttons, tabs etc that just complicate the user experience.  They still install (without asking) irritating advertising buttons on your desktop - and of course advertise for more paid services in the product.  Look, if they gave away the product, then they can shove advertising at me in return.  But, we all paid for this.  We should have an 'opt out' box on the installation screen saying "No, I do not want to be presented with any icons, in-product offers, or e-mails for services from Intuit or any 3rd party."  Oh, I cannot count the ways that I hate this corporation...  If there was another product that could convert 100% of Quicken (and Quickbooks) data to allow one to move forward and leave Intuit's products behind ... I would jump ship. Intuit either needs a strong competitor, or to seriously get their act together. --------------------------------- Update 4/3/2010:  Besides the comments I linked to the original review, I just found a really bad bug (or really stupid change in behavior) that anyone preparing their taxes should be aware of:  For the last 20 years, if you customized a report to show "Tax-related transactions only", you would get all transactions for categories that were flagged as 'tax related'.  As of Quicken Deluxe 2010, any such old reports are now broken if you had categories that do not have tax lines assigned to them.  Only those items checked as 'tax related' and which ALSO have a tax line assigned will show up in a tax-filtered report now.  In the past, the tax line assignment was simply a convenience for TurboTax users/importers - and also allowed a tax-line oriented report.  But, it was not required.	-1
Quicken 2010 is a powerful financial software program that you can do a lot with.  You'll be able to consolidate and organize a great deal of data about your financial picture.  One of things you can't do with Quicken, however, is extract that data for use with another program (such as the cross-platform Moneydance) in any kind of reasonable time frame or with any reasonable chance of success.  The only way to get data out of the program is in .QIF format, one measly account at a time.  It's worth noting that Quicken no longer supports _importing_ .QIF files for most account types, claiming (in article 3886 on their support site), and I quote, "QIF technology is over 10 years old and was designed for technical support purposes. ... QIF Data Import requires many steps to download, can provide a poor customer experience, and can lead to duplicate transactions and errors."  That old technology is good enough for you should you want to _export_ data from Quicken, however.  Intuit is going to make darn sure that you have a "poor customer experience" and suffer from "duplicate transactions and errors" if you try to take your data to any other program.	-1
When Quicken goes under, I'm going to wear a pink tuxedo to the funeral.  [These comments are based on my continuing nightmare of lousy experiences with Quicken Deluxe 2008. This software, which has been getting continually worse since 2002, couldn't have possibly improved since then ... ]  For me Quicken 2008 was a forced/hostage upgrade from Quicken 2005. You "have" to upgrade since they've cut a deal with the financial institutions to cut off your online access with the institutions if you don't upgrade every three years. Just as found when I was hostage upgraded in 2005 from 2002, there's nothing more than a cosmetic face-lift, no meaningful fixes/improvements -- but there's even more bugs, problems and aggravation.  * Product now will not connect properly to Fidelity; no problem under 2005.  * Took forever to figure out how to turn off a "reminder" function ... that kept reminding me to pay bills already scheduled to be paid using the auto-pay function. 2005 did the same thing and it's not been fixed.  *You can turn off the product registration nag screen ... if you Google to find out how. Product does not have to be registered to use it.  * Un-reconciles accounts six months back every once in a while. I've been assuming that's being caused by a few bytes of bad data that occasionally comes from the financial institutions ... that the Quicken people have not properly coded so as to filter out. This bug also surfaced in 2005. Two weeks into 2008, I've seen it again already.  * You can't turn off the "free update/revision" nag screen unless you take the update. No such nag screen in 2005.  * When connecting, the completion screen used to show which accounts had new transactions to match and had convenient buttons next to each to take you directly to the account. Gone in 2008. Now I have to look through every account each time to see where transactions might have been retrieved.  * Icons everywhere attempting to peddle other unwanted Quicken products. One of the 'product improvements' in 2008.  * Doesn't handle stock distributions correctly (since they were not actually paid for); keeps generating error messages when you enter the correct posting of no cost incurred. Same problem in 2005.  * Tricky screens/checkboxes/prompts that try to bait you into using/enrolling for QuickenDot services when you don't have to or need to. Users that did so now post complaints they can't undo it and that the QuickenDot server is constantly down, causing problems/delays when trying to connect to other accounts using a one-step update.  Yet another company that's grown totally complacent about product quality while wallowing in its assured-for-the-moment revenue stream. It will bite them hard in the long-run. Postings indicate similar complaining regarding the major competitor product, Microsoft Money. If history is any lesson, there's no reason to suspect that these software products will ever get better under these conditions. Some other product will have to steal their customer base before they wake up and smell the coffee.  If you are not already committed to either of those two products, take a good long look at open source software such as GNU Cash.  [Update: April 15, 2008] Does now connect to Fidelity ... occasionally. When I opened the portfolio area today, the entire computer screen flashed with confusion and the product crashed. 2005 never once crashed. Still flashing but no subsequent crashes. Who knows what happened. Not me. Apparently not Quicken programmers either.  [Update: July 12, 2008] Connects to Fidelity now more or less on regular basis. Software still flashes/flickers routinely. Also slow to load, apparently trying to read every single record into RAM, regardless of age. Pop-up screen this morning stating "We've noticed you are not downloading your current Quicken Visa/MasterCard transactions, click here to ..." I don't have one. Obviously a deceptive come-on intended to trick users into the application process for a Quicken credit card. Nice. Still constantly beg-screens me to take the latest software update.  [Update: October 18, 2008] Just downloaded this week's financial transactions and Quicken wiped out four months of reconciliation on one of my credit cards ... again.  [Update: January 10, 2009] Tried to change the amount of an annual repeating payment. Refused to accept the change with the error message "You must make this change and sign on no later than six days before scheduled payment." Payment was set for April 4, 2009, almost three months in the future. I had to delete the payment, log on to make the deletion take effect, then enter the payment all over again for the new amount, then log on again to make that payment take effect. And when I tried to log on I rec'd an error message stating an Internet connection was not detected (a message I get rather often despite my always-on broadband). Luckily I can choose the "Ignore" button and it will go ahead and connect. Quicken programming staff = worthless carpetbaggers.  [Update: March 5, 2009] Wanted to stop an ongoing monthly repeating payment where the next scheduled payment was already in place in my register for March 27. I edited in a change for "how many times" from "unlimited" to "1." In other words, I wanted to pay on March 27 for the last time. When I logged on to the bank the first time, Quicken canceled the March 27 payment. Now doesn't that take the cake--Quicken accounting/finance software programmers are unable to count up to one. And, as all too often anymore, the screen went wacko while I was logging onto the bank.  [Update: March 8, 2009] Quicken just UNreconciled one of my credit cards (again) back to the October, 2008 close. Luckily, its a card I don't use much. I suppose this has something to do with Quicken software coders not understanding the start of Daylight Savings Time.  [Update: March 27, 2009] The repeating payment change I referred to at March 5, 2009? The saga continues. When I tried to enter the NEW repeating payment, it wouldn't take. I entered it, connected to the bank and nothing happened. The payment did not show in the list of repeating payments or in the register. I tried deleting the payee entirely to start over, but Quicken wouldn't/won't let me delete that payee at all. It claims it cannot be deleted because there is a repeating payment in effect ... that would be the payment that is ALREADY canceled. Which means I can't cancel it so I can't delete the payee. To set up the new payment I ended up having to create an entire new payee to make the new payment 'take.' I had to put a dash in the middle of the account number to create the new payee since Quicken won't allow two repeating payments with the exact same account number. And I am still stuck with the old payee on file which I cannot delete at all. I had to call the bank twice just to make sure the durn payment is actually going to be made on time ... and made only once ... and for the correct amount. You would think there would be a way to force deletion of a payee. Then again YOU are thinking, Quicken programmers on the other hand are off somewhere slurping down a latte.  [Update: April 2, 2009] Have an established monthly recurring payment of $[...] and would like to change it to $[...]. Enter the Online Center, click on Repeating. There it is. Click on it then select Edit. Change the amount from $[...] to $[...]. Save the change. Seems simple enough. Log on to the bank. Result: (1) Quicken cancels the next pending payment, on April 19, of $[...]. So far so good. (2) Quicken enters a pending payment into the checkbook register for $[...] dated May 19. Huh? What happened to my April payment? God only knows what will happen if I tinker with this recurring payment any further. I will write a paper check for one month ... and hope for the best. A[...]  [Update: July 14, 2009] Quicken is popping up a screen telling me I am overdue on a July 10 payment to a vendor for $[...]. The register shows the payment was made and cleared on July 10. And it's reminding me to schedule another future payment ... that's already scheduled. It's the same durn thing I was talking about in bullet # 2 at the top of the review, apparently it's a zombie bug that has now risen from the dead. Still begs me to take the Quicken software update constantly.  [Update: September 15, 2009] Quicken has suddenly started reminding me ... once again ... that certain bills are overdue, even though they've already been paid using the automatic monthly payment function. It asks me if I want to delete, pay or skip. I can only guess what havoc might occur if I delete or skip ... so I just keep waiting for the nag screen to eventually go away.  [Update: January 17, 2010] Repeating payment to my HOA increasing by four bucks a month. Learned already the hard way that if you change it by just increasing the payment, it doesn't take. So I first deleted the existing repeating payment entirely (but not the existing payee). Logged onto the bank. Deletion occurred properly. THEN I tried to create a new repeating payment (using the existing payee). Enter all the information - and nothing happens. Just like I never entered it at all. Rebooting, log on to the bank again, no change. So I created a new payee (with slightly different spellings for payee name and account number since those fields define the unique payee). Creation took place properly - after every desktop icon on screen flashed on and off screen for nearly a minute. Logged on to bank to let Quicken advise of new payee. THEN created new payment using the tweaked, new payee. Logged on again. More icon flashing in process. New repeating payment now appears in register. Although it has NOT always done so in the past, THIS TIME Quicken let me delete the old payee. For users that can't figure out these kinds of workarounds, the simple, everyday-routine, core process of adjusting the amount of a repeating payment simply doesn't work. It USED to work in older versions of Quicken, so I can only assume Quicken programmers spend their lazy afternoons destroying old code and functionality - instead of writing new code to fix known bugs.  [Update: January 26, 2010] The above described payment (at four bucks more) was made successfully to the HOA yesterday. In the Quicken Bill Reminder Tray it says I have FOUR payments missing - all to the HOA, all at the new 'four bucks more' amount, two of them due yesterday and two of them due today. As always when this tray incorrectly reports overdue payments, the tray's three choices are Enter, Edit and Skip. Which one would you dare use to try to get the stuff to disappear? If you choose Skip, will it take the payment back? Maybe in the mirror-image BizarroWorld that is Quicken software.  [Update: July 25, 2010] Used a certain credit card last month (that hadn't been used otherwise in about eight months). The account had been live and retrieving transactions without incident for years. The account password is saved in Quicken so that it can do so. But guess what, those new transactions did not retrieve after multiple log-ons (using Quicken's "one-step update" which logs on to all active accounts in a single pass). Quicken reflects the account as active for transaction retrieval, everything AOK. Quicken also reflects the connection took place with the account without error. If I didn't KNOW I had transactions not retrieved, I wouldn't have had the least idea there was an error. Not that Quicken would give me the least indication to do so, I went ahead and tried solving the error by re-running the account through the 'online initialization' process again. It worked. The transactions then retrieved normally. HOWEVER the NEXT time I tried to run through the logon/retrieval process, Quicken demanded I provide the account's password. That would be the very same password it had in storage to begin with - and that I JUST provided to Quicken a SECOND time when I did the re-initialization. Dumb, dumb, dumb. Also, after the re-initialization, I started getting a message that claims 'your last update attempt was not successful, do you want to re-try?" I figure that erroneous message will resolve itself after enough time has eroded since 'my last update attempt.'  [Update: August 8, 2010] I wanted to change the amount for a repeating payment (the equal pay plan for my utility bill was adjusted), so I used the `change' function. Kick me in the *** because (1) using the obviously correct approach in Quicken often means trouble and (2) I've tried this before and it's a major fail. I opened the repeating payment, changed the amount and clicked the OK button. As I was signing on, Quicken advised it would be changing the payment amount just exactly as I had entered it. Result: both payments, old and new, are in the register. I marked the old payment for deletion and re-connected to the bank. The bank generated an error message stating that the old payment had already been cancelled. I tried deleting the old payment from my register and it won't budge. It demands that I must log on in order to complete the deletion. As I just said, when I logged on the bank refused to recognize the deletion request.  OK. I have a new plan for opening a can of whoop@ss on Quicken's demons. I will delete the NEW payment, then delete the payee entirely. Then Quicken will HAVE to let go of the old payment, right? Then I will re-create the payee. I marked the new payment for deletion and logged on. It WAS deleted at both the bank AND in the Quicken register. But when I try to delete the payee, Quicken says "cannot delete payee for which there are repeating online payments scheduled." Go to the screen that lists all the repeating payments. Nothing there. Go back to the register. The old payment is still there. The old payment that refuses to be deleted until it yaks with the bank ... too bad the bank says it's already deleted and won't yak. Totally screwed by Quicken again.  Eventually I discover via Googling that Quicken has an undocumented save posted in their support blogs - to use CTRL to force the deletion of the old payment. It works. I suppose that's worth half-a-point. OK, now let's put the new payment back (like it was before I deleted it). I enter all the information, click OK. Nothing happens. Acts like I entered nothing at all. Try it three times, zippo. I look in the list of repeating payments. I look in the transactions pending for transmission. I look in the register. Nothing. Unfortunately I've been here before. This entire process has "imploded" the payee, making it unusable.  I'll have to create an entirely new payee. I go to delete the old payee. It won't let me. It STILL insists I have repeating payments outstanding against it. Whattaeffing piece of software cr@pola.  I already have two other old payees I can't delete that act just like this ... even though they haven't been involved any kind of payment in at least a year. Quicken says in that same support blog webpage that using the CTRL key also forces payee deletions. Wrong, wrong, wrong. Can't get rid of it. (You can see these kinds of problems also discussed earlier in this review.) I will have to put a space or something in the account number to create a brand new payee, since that account number has already been "used" and Quicken won't let me re-use it. And I am stuck with another old payee I can't delete.  Oh, and down in my tab titled "Scheduled Bills & Deposits Due" I still  (as described above) have listed FOUR TIMES my monthly HOA payment, as being overdue from 13 days ago. (It's a repeating monthly payment set up in Quicken months ago, and it was already paid on schedule.) The four listings are actually two pairs of amounts, each pair one day apart. All of these are artifacts from where I tried to adjust that repeating payment amount when I experienced an increase. The three choices are "enter" "edit" or "skip" I've learned to wait until well after the bill is actually paid, then enter "skip." Otherwise it may well try to pay twice. (I've already described this particular bug up above ... just a reminder, it never goes away.) Bottom line:  since about 2005, the Quicken product has become totally effed up.  I am now about six months now from the next cycle of Quicken's "sunset policy." Every three years, you have to pay for the Quicken upgrade or they cut off your ability to download transactions from your financial institutions (Quicken servers are the `middle man" between your software and the institutions). Maybe it's time to migrate to competing software product that works right, only has to be bought once ... and connects directly to my institution to collect unadulterated data!  [UPDATE: August 14, 2010] FREE AT LAST, FREE AT LAST !! After that last fiasco, I decided why invest more time trying to solve the Quicken problem ... when I could invest that time migrating to Moneydance 2010.  Moneydance, what a dream come true! And much less painful a migration that I imagined. Just buy the license at the website first, then download&install the product. Here's a couple of key points I learned (the hard way) that should make your migration run smooth as silk:  * Export the data from Quicken using the "all accounts' option (not one account at a time). I had to look for it but that choice WAS in the Quicken drop-down list.  * When importing IGNORE any advice Moneydance offers that you ought check the "Import account info only" option (ie, to import the structure/tables/fieldnames first, then to go back and re-do the procedure to get the data records). When I followed that advice, I had all sorts of screwy issues, records landing every which way. When I DID NOT check the box (in essence asking Moneydance to import everything in one fell swoop - both records & structure/tables/fieldnames for all of the Quicken accounts) everything dropped right into place, ready to roll. The only record that did not import correctly (and I had ten years of records over about fifteen accounts) was the "original transfer balance in" for one account.  After that I did have to do some minor clean-up for a while - entering stock symbols, entering the names I wanted to use for the accounts, other account details such as my credit card numbers. To make the stock prices update in real time (for some reason) you have to manually add-in two developer extensions. Easy to do (so long as you realize that you have to do it) and the user's guide explains how exactly. Quick and no glitches.  Moneydance swims slick as an eel. Downloading of records only takes three or four seconds at most. With Quicken it took a lot longer. Moneydance is connecting direct to the institution; Quicken is running you through its own server as an intermediary. I wouldn't be the least bit surprised to find that a lot of my earlier issues (such as missing or duplicate records) that I did NOT post in my reviews (since I did not attribute them to Quicken) turn out to disappear. Because they were being CAUSED by Quicken's intermediary server. We'll see.  The online banking download setup was easy, but there were the most minor of issues. Moneydance did not have any idea of course when the last download was done (with Quicken), so it retrieved all the available records at the institutions. (Be smart and bring your Quicken accounts and downloads totally current and as reconciled as possible BEFORE you export them.) Also, where I had multiple accounts at one institution, it got confused first go-round, mixing them all up - and changing the account numbers in the setup parameters. I just deleted all the downloaded records and went back and re-entered the correct account numbers. After adjusting that first 'initializing' download for each account, no problems.  I haven't started using the 'setup payments through Moneydance' feature yet. My bet it'll be easy.  Moneydance. Just do it.	-1
Here's a blow-by-blow account of the numerous bugs I've encountered using Quicken the last five years. It ain't pretty. The product's just been getting worse since 2002.  Quicken 2008: Was a forced/hostage upgrade from Quicken 2005. You "have" to upgrade since they've cut a deal with the financial institutions to cut off your online access with the institutions if you don't upgrade every three years. Just as found when I was hostage upgraded in 2005 from 2002, there's nothing more than a cosmetic face-lift, no meaningful fixes/improvements -- but there's even more bugs, problems and aggravation.  * Product now will not connect properly to Fidelity; no problem under 2005.  * Took forever to figure out how to turn off a "reminder" function ... that kept reminding me to pay bills already scheduled to be paid using the auto-pay function. 2005 did the same thing and it's not been fixed.  *You can turn off the product registration nag screen ... if you Google to find out how. Product does not have to be registered to use it.  * Un-reconciles accounts six months back every once in a while. I've been assuming that's being caused by a few bytes of bad data that occasionally comes from the financial institutions ... that the Quicken people have not properly coded so as to filter out. This bug also surfaced in 2005. Two weeks into 2008, I've seen it again already.  * You can't turn off the "free update/revision" nag screen unless you take the update. No such nag screen in 2005.  * When connecting, the completion screen used to show which accounts had new transactions to match and had convenient buttons next to each to take you directly to the account. Gone in 2008. Now I have to look through every account each time to see where transactions might have been retrieved.  * Icons everywhere attempting to peddle other unwanted Quicken products. One of the 'product improvements' in 2008.  * Doesn't handle stock distributions correctly (since they were not actually paid for); keeps generating error messages when you enter the correct posting of no cost incurred. Same problem in 2005.  * Tricky screens/checkboxes/prompts that try to bait you into using/enrolling for QuickenDot services when you don't have to or need to. Users that did so now post complaints they can't undo it and that the QuickenDot server is constantly down, causing problems/delays when trying to connect to other accounts using a one-step update.  Yet another company that's grown totally complacent about product quality while wallowing in its assured-for-the-moment revenue stream. It will bite them hard in the long-run. Postings indicate similar complaining regarding the major competitor product, Microsoft Money. If history is any lesson, there's no reason to suspect that these software products will ever get better under these conditions. Some other product will have to steal their customer base before they wake up and smell the coffee.  If you are not already committed to either of those two products, take a good long look at open source software such as GNU Cash.  [Update: April 15, 2008] Does now connect to Fidelity ... occasionally. When I opened the portfolio area today, the entire computer screen flashed with confusion and the product crashed. 2005 never once crashed. Still flashing but no subsequent crashes. Who knows what happened. Not me. Apparently not Quicken programmers either.  [Update: July 12, 2008] Connects to Fidelity now more or less on regular basis. Software still flashes/flickers routinely. Also slow to load, apparently trying to read every single record into RAM, regardless of age. Pop-up screen this morning stating "We've noticed you are not downloading your current Quicken Visa/MasterCard transactions, click here to ..." I don't have one. Obviously a deceptive come-on intended to trick users into the application process for a Quicken credit card. Nice. Still constantly beg-screens me to take the latest software update.  [Update: October 18, 2008] Just downloaded this week's financial transactions and Quicken wiped out four months of reconciliation on one of my credit cards ... again.  [Update: January 10, 2009] Tried to change the amount of an annual repeating payment. Refused to accept the change with the error message "You must make this change and sign on no later than six days before scheduled payment." Payment was set for April 4, 2009, almost three months in the future. I had to delete the payment, log on to make the deletion take effect, then enter the payment all over again for the new amount, then log on again to make that payment take effect. And when I tried to log on I rec'd an error message stating an Internet connection was not detected (a message I get rather often despite my always-on broadband). Luckily I can choose the "Ignore" button and it will go ahead and connect. Quicken programming staff = worthless carpetbaggers.  [Update: March 5, 2009] Wanted to stop an ongoing monthly repeating payment where the next scheduled payment was already in place in my register for March 27. I edited in a change for "how many times" from "unlimited" to "1." In other words, I wanted to pay on March 27 for the last time. When I logged on to the bank the first time, Quicken canceled the March 27 payment. Now doesn't that take the cake--Quicken accounting/finance software programmers are unable to count up to one. And, as all too often anymore, the screen went wacko while I was logging onto the bank.  [Update: March 8, 2009] Quicken just UNreconciled one of my credit cards (again) back to the October, 2008 close. Luckily, its a card I don't use much. I suppose this has something to do with Quicken software coders not understanding the start of Daylight Savings Time.  [Update: March 27, 2009] The repeating payment change I referred to at March 5, 2009? The saga continues. When I tried to enter the NEW repeating payment, it wouldn't take. I entered it, connected to the bank and nothing happened. The payment did not show in the list of repeating payments or in the register. I tried deleting the payee entirely to start over, but Quicken wouldn't/won't let me delete that payee at all. It claims it cannot be deleted because there is a repeating payment in effect ... that would be the payment that is ALREADY canceled. Which means I can't cancel it so I can't delete the payee. To set up the new payment I ended up having to create an entire new payee to make the new payment 'take.' I had to put a dash in the middle of the account number to create the new payee since Quicken won't allow two repeating payments with the exact same account number. And I am still stuck with the old payee on file which I cannot delete at all. I had to call the bank twice just to make sure the durn payment is actually going to be made on time ... and made only once ... and for the correct amount. You would think there would be a way to force deletion of a payee. Then again YOU are thinking, Quicken programmers on the other hand are off somewhere slurping down a latte.  [Update: April 2, 2009] Have an established monthly recurring payment of $X and would like to change it to $Y. Enter the Online Center, click on Repeating. There it is. Click on it then select Edit. Change the amount from $X to $Y. Save the change. Seems simple enough. Log on to the bank. Result: (1) Quicken cancels the next pending payment, on April 19, of $X. So far so good. (2) Quicken enters a pending payment into the checkbook register for $Y dated May 19. Huh? What happened to my April payment? God only knows what will happen if I tinker with this recurring payment any further. I will write a paper check for one month ... and hope for the best.  [Update: July 14, 2009] Quicken is popping up a screen telling me I am overdue on a July 10 payment to a vendor. The register shows the payment was made and cleared on July 10. And it's reminding me to schedule another future payment ... that's already scheduled. It's the same durn thing I was talking about in bullet # 2 at the top of the review, apparently it's a zombie bug that has now risen from the dead. Still begs me to take the Quicken software update constantly.  [Update: September 15, 2009] Quicken has suddenly started reminding me ... once again ... that certain bills are overdue, even though they've already been paid using the automatic monthly payment function. It asks me if I want to delete, pay or skip. I can only guess what havoc might occur if I delete or skip ... so I just keep waiting for the nag screen to eventually go away.  [Update: January 17, 2010] Repeating payment to my HOA increasing by four bucks a month. Learned already the hard way that if you change it by just increasing the payment, it doesn't take. So I first deleted the existing repeating payment entirely (but not the existing payee). Logged onto the bank. Deletion occurred properly. THEN I tried to create a new repeating payment (using the existing payee). Enter all the information - and nothing happens. Just like I never entered it at all. Rebooting, log on to the bank again, no change. So I created a new payee (with slightly different spellings for payee name and account number since those fields define the unique payee). Creation took place properly - after every desktop icon on screen flashed on and off screen for nearly a minute. Logged on to bank to let Quicken advise of new payee. THEN created new payment using the tweaked, new payee. Logged on again. More icon flashing in process. New repeating payment now appears in register. Although it has NOT always done so in the past, THIS TIME Quicken let me delete the old payee. For users that can't figure out these kinds of workarounds, the simple, everyday-routine, core process of adjusting the amount of a repeating payment simply doesn't work. It USED to work in older versions of Quicken, so I can only assume Quicken programmers spend their lazy afternoons destroying old code and functionality - instead of writing new code to fix known bugs.  [Update: January 26, 2010] The above described payment (at four bucks more) was made successfully to the HOA yesterday. In the Quicken Bill Reminder Tray it says I have FOUR payments missing - all to the HOA, all at the new 'four bucks more' amount, two of them due yesterday and two of them due today. As always when this tray incorrectly reports overdue payments, the tray's three choices are Enter, Edit and Skip. Which one would you dare use to try to get the stuff to disappear? If you choose Skip, will it take the payment back? Maybe in the mirror-image BizarroWorld that is Quicken software.  [Update: July 25, 2010] Used a certain credit card last month (that hadn't been used otherwise in about eight months). The account had been live and retrieving transactions without incident for years. The account password is saved in Quicken so that it can do so. But guess what, those new transactions did not retrieve after multiple log-ons (using Quicken's "one-step update" which logs on to all active accounts in a single pass). Quicken reflects the account as active for transaction retrieval, everything AOK. Quicken also reflects the connection took place with the account without error. If I didn't KNOW I had transactions not retrieved, I wouldn't have had the least idea there was an error. Not that Quicken would give me the least indication to do so, I went ahead and tried solving the error by re-running the account through the 'online initialization' process again. It worked. The transactions then retrieved normally. HOWEVER the NEXT time I tried to run through the logon/retrieval process, Quicken demanded I provide the account's password. That would be the very same password it had in storage to begin with - and that I JUST provided to Quicken a SECOND time when I did the re-initialization. Dumb, dumb, dumb. Also, after the re-initialization, I started getting a message that claims 'your last update attempt was not successful, do you want to re-try?" I figure that erroneous message will resolve itself after enough time has eroded since 'my last update attempt.'  [Update: August 8, 2010] I wanted to change the amount for a repeating payment (the equal pay plan for my utility bill was adjusted), so I used the `change' function. Kick me in the *** because (1) using the obviously correct approach in Quicken often means trouble and (2) I've tried this before and it's a major fail. I opened the repeating payment, changed the amount and clicked the OK button. As I was signing on, Quicken advised it would be changing the payment amount just exactly as I had entered it. Result: both payments, old and new, are in the register. I marked the old payment for deletion and re-connected to the bank. The bank generated an error message stating that the old payment had already been cancelled. I tried deleting the old payment from my register and it won't budge. It demands that I must log on in order to complete the deletion. As I just said, when I logged on the bank refused to recognize the deletion request.  OK. I have a new plan for opening a can of whoop@ss on Quicken's demons. I will delete the NEW payment, then delete the payee entirely. Then Quicken will HAVE to let go of the old payment, right? Then I will re-create the payee. I marked the new payment for deletion and logged on. It WAS deleted at both the bank AND in the Quicken register. But when I try to delete the payee, Quicken says "cannot delete payee for which there are repeating online payments scheduled." Go to the screen that lists all the repeating payments. Nothing there. Go back to the register. The old payment is still there. The old payment that refuses to be deleted until it yaks with the bank ... too bad the bank says it's already deleted and won't yak. Totally screwed by Quicken again.  Eventually I discover via Googling that Quicken has an undocumented save posted in their support blogs - to use CTRL to force the deletion of the old payment. It works. I suppose that's worth half-a-point. OK, now let's put the new payment back (like it was before I deleted it). I enter all the information, click OK. Nothing happens. Acts like I entered nothing at all. Try it three times, zippo. I look in the list of repeating payments. I look in the transactions pending for transmission. I look in the register. Nothing. Unfortunately I've been here before. This entire process has "imploded" the payee, making it unusable.  I'll have to create an entirely new payee. I go to delete the old payee. It won't let me. It STILL insists I have repeating payments outstanding against it. Whattaeffing piece of software cr@pola.  I already have two other old payees I can't delete that act just like this ... even though they haven't been involved any kind of payment in at least a year. Quicken says in that same support blog webpage that using the CTRL key also forces payee deletions. Wrong, wrong, wrong. Can't get rid of it. (You can see these kinds of problems also discussed earlier in this review.) I will have to put a space or something in the account number to create a brand new payee, since that account number has already been "used" and Quicken won't let me re-use it. And I am stuck with another old payee I can't delete.  Oh, and down in my tab titled "Scheduled Bills & Deposits Due" I still  (as described above) have listed FOUR TIMES my monthly HOA payment, as being overdue from 13 days ago. (It's a repeating monthly payment set up in Quicken months ago, and it was already paid on schedule.) The four listings are actually two pairs of amounts, each pair one day apart. All of these are artifacts from where I tried to adjust that repeating payment amount when I experienced an increase. The three choices are "enter" "edit" or "skip" I've learned to wait until well after the bill is actually paid, then enter "skip." Otherwise it may well try to pay twice. (I've already described this particular bug up above ... just a reminder, it never goes away.) Bottom line:  since about 2005, the Quicken product has become totally effed up.  I am now about six months now from the next cycle of Quicken's "sunset policy." Every three years, you have to pay for the Quicken upgrade or they cut off your ability to download transactions from your financial institutions (Quicken servers are the `middle man" between your software and the institutions). Maybe it's time to migrate to competing software product that works right, only has to be bought once ... and connects directly to my institution to collect unadulterated data!  When Quicken goes under, I'm going to wear a pink tuxedo to the funeral.  [UPDATE: August 14, 2010] FREE AT LAST, FREE AT LAST !! After that last fiasco, I decided why invest more time trying to solve the Quicken problem ... when I could invest that time migrating to Moneydance 2010.  Moneydance, what a dream come true! And much less painful a migration that I imagined. Just buy the license at the website first, then download&install the product. Here's a couple of key points I learned (the hard way) that should make your migration run smooth as silk:  * Export the data from Quicken using the "all accounts' option (not one account at a time). I had to look for it but that choice WAS in the Quicken drop-down list.  * When importing IGNORE any advice Moneydance offers that you ought check the "Import account info only" option (ie, to import the structure/tables/fieldnames first, then to go back and re-do the procedure to get the data records). When I followed that advice, I had all sorts of screwy issues, records landing every which way. When I DID NOT check the box (in essence asking Moneydance to import everything in one fell swoop - both records & structure/tables/fieldnames for all of the Quicken accounts) everything dropped right into place, ready to roll. The only record that did not import correctly (and I had ten years of records over about fifteen accounts) was the "original transfer balance in" for one account.  After that I did have to do some minor clean-up for a while - entering stock symbols, entering the names I wanted to use for the accounts, other account details such as my credit card numbers. To make the stock prices update in real time (for some reason) you have to manually add-in two developer extensions. Easy to do (so long as you realize that you have to do it) and the user's guide explains how exactly. Quick and no glitches.  Moneydance swims slick as an eel. Downloading of records only takes three or four seconds at most. With Quicken it took a lot longer. Moneydance is connecting direct to the institution; Quicken is running you through its own server as an intermediary. I wouldn't be the least bit surprised to find that a lot of my earlier issues (such as missing or duplicate records) that I did NOT post in my reviews (since I did not attribute them to Quicken) turn out to disappear. Because they were being CAUSED by Quicken's intermediary server. We'll see.  The online banking download setup was easy, but there were the most minor of issues. Moneydance did not have any idea of course when the last download was done (with Quicken), so it retrieved all the available records at the institutions. (Be smart and bring your Quicken accounts and downloads totally current and as reconciled as possible BEFORE you export them.) Also, where I had multiple accounts at one institution, it got confused first go-round, mixing them all up - and changing the account numbers in the setup parameters. I just deleted all the downloaded records and went back and re-entered the correct account numbers. After adjusting that first `initializing' download for each account, no problems.  I haven't started using the `setup payments through Moneydance' feature yet. My bet it'll be easy.  Moneydance. Just do it.	-1
As a user coming from Microsoft Money, I was not at all pleased with this product. I work with computers daily and adapt to new & changed applications and ways of doing things on computers on a regular basis.  I've also been an MS Money user since version 2002 or before. Microsoft has stopped making Money and will stop producing it and support it soon. As an offer from Quicken embedded in MS Money as an advertisement, I was invited to buy Quick with a discount.  I found the product was cheaper on Amazon.com, so I bought it here with no "discount".  One major gotcha is the Quicken automatically scans your history for recurring payments and creates reminders for them.  If you have reminders set up in MS Money, you are supposed to "delete all reminders" before importing the data into Quicken... but nothing during the import process says this, nor in the non-existent instructions but after searching for the problem in the support forums I found out what I should have done.... So I was off to a bad start from the very beginning.  So that problem being what it was, I started exploring the interface. I was entirely, totally lost.  This is not really the fault of the company, as I'm used to a competitors product, so I tried to do a bit of exploring and really didn't find myself happy with what I was seeing.  So... eventually I'm probably going to end up using this product.  Eventually I'll probably know how to use it. But until then, without any better migration tools or instructions, I am going to take my chances with MS Money and be very happy, pleased and "quick in" my money matters...	-1
Currently using Quicken version 2006, using Windows XP Pro SP3, 1280x1024 display resolution. User since Quicken Dos. Do not use for downloading banking or stock information. Uninstalled previous version first. Install of Deluxe 2010 and conversion of data went smoothly.  Problems: Account List displays only about 16 lines of accounts vs. 31 lines of accounts in 2006 version. If you "user select" to display more than one column choice, such as Current and Ending Balances you have to pan right as more than one selection will be off the screen. 2006 version fitted on screen.  "Help" button is locked at bottom of register screen resulting in more wasted screen space and less register lines being displayed.  Edit scheduled transaction screen extends off the side of display so you must drag to the left to access. No longer fits on screen like earlier version.  Intuit tech indicated that display problem corrections are being worked on for the Accounts List.  Attachments. In Quicken 2006 using any version of Adobe Reader 7 or higher results in you having to manually "end process" the "acrord32" in Task Manager before you could delete or replace attachments in the registers. Same problem in Quicken 2010, I had to revert to Adobe Reader 6 if I did not want to end process "acrord32" everytime. Using Quicken 2010 with Adobe Reader 9.2 and end processing "acrord32" you still can not delete or replace attachments.  Back in 2006/2007 Intuit tech said they were working on this "acrord32" problem with Quicken and Adobe Reader. Duh.  I have moved back to using Quicken 2006 and plan to check periodically for the new revisions of Quicken 2010 to see if these problems are fixed otherwise before the 60 days satisfaction period expires I will submit for refund from Intuit.  Only reason to purchase is to maintain online access to your accounts, otherwise wait a couple of months for revisions to fix problems.	-1
I have been a fan of the Quickbooks series for quite some time. Back when Windows 95 was the alternative to DOS I used to fight my boss about the benefits of Quickbooks over say, Peachtree which used to be DOS only. Move ahead to now and I don't think I would recommend this package to anyone. The overall functionality is there. The thing that really chafes me is the way they dangle "add ons" that you must purchase. Why? Its because they know the average user does may not need payroll. Fine, then don't ship it with the software. Instead, make this addon an inexpensive purchase, NOT a subscription. That is highway robbery. Sticking it to the small business that may use this software is underhanded and petty.  Pros:  >> Easy to use >> Low learning curve >> Basics are plenty for most small businesses  Cons: << Subscription service to add payroll & more << Feel ripped off when using this software like they just want to dip into your pockets every time you use it.  Overall if you just need a basic accounting software for your business you may be better off looking somewhere else. This package is "very" basic and you will need to add a good deal more subscriptions or addons to get it to the level of some higher priced initially, but overall better software packages.  Thank you for reading my review.	-1
Unfortunately, the choice of using Quickbooks is probably not up to you. Most companies are already using it or the people they have are used to it. Or even worse - the accountant that you are using requires you to submit the info in a QB file.  BUT - if this is not the case and you are a small biz that is just starting or is able to switch around - then I highly suggest that you look other places to deal with accounting (like Yodlee). The problem is that Intuit has pretty much garnered a strangle hold on the market and they are acting pretty monopolistic. They require you to upgrade every two years and often times the product is not very good. (See the 2009 version).  There are free tools available for a period of time if you are a small business (Like Microsoft Office Accounting Express 2009) << [...]>> However it looks like MS may not be in the biz of acctg software for much longer. The good news is that it is free and will not fall apart like quickbooks after 2 years.&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Microsoft-Office-Accounting-Professional-2009/dp/B001FOPUZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Microsoft Office Accounting Professional 2009</a>  Anyway - I would look at open source software, older Microsoft (free)products or even online resources from your bank or other financial institution before going down the path of no choice with Quickbooks. I can only see their product deteriorating even faster in the near future. By that time it will cost a whole lot more to switch to something else .....	-1
I migrated an XP machine to my quad core iMac. I should have power to spare, but startup can take 10 minutes and after that performance is often very slow.  Clearly something is wrong, but I can't figure this one out.  If you have version 2 and it's working, don't upgrade yet.	-1
I bought the expensive TurboTax Business to do the taxes for two trusts held at our broker.  Quess what?  This expensive version can not download those transactions into the program.  WHY!!!!  I would expect most trusts have investments held at a broker, but TurboTax doesd not see fit to give you an easy way to get those transactions into the tax return.  The reasonably priced Deluxe version works just fine at downloading those same transactions into my personal tax return.  So I had to manually enter each one of the stock transactions.	-1

I bought my full version, H&R block Deluxe [with 1 state return software included] online, from a reputable vendor.  The federal tax software portion loaded fine and I completed my federal return okay.  When it came time to install the state edition, I got an error message and was told to contact customer service and give them error code WCDF.  My first call to H&R customer service went fine and the woman quickly emailed me a download link. It was received within 5 minutes.  So far so good.  When I went to download the state edition, the download stopped/timed out after only completing approximately 650K out of a 2.48 meg file.  I contacted H&R block again and this time the CSR was not very friendly and certainly NOT helpful.  She wanted me to PAY $29.95 for another download?  I got tired of her failure to address the download problem [stopping after only 650K out of 2.48Meg] so I asked to speak to her supervisor.  I got a supervisor named Derek and he proceeded to try and blow massive amounts of smoke up my backside.  He asked what type pc and internet connection I had. I told him it was an athlon II and a cable modem. He then said that my connection was slow, like dialup, and I should have just waited longer!?  I knew this guy was CLUELESS because a DOCSIS 3 modem that can download at speeds exceeding 10Meg is NOTHING like a 56K dialup connection. Converted to the same measure of speed, kilobits, the comparison is 10,000K vs 56K.  I told this supervisor to check the H&R block server log files and he could see the download only reached 650K out of 2.48Meg  before it STOPPED.  He claimed no one could do that.  He asked where I got the software and proceeded to tell me I needed to contact the company that sold it to me, in order to get support.  I read the back of the H&R block software package to him, which clearly STATED that the end user was to contact H&R BLOCK FOR SUPPORT.  When I directed him to the online vendor's website, he said that vendor was NOT authorized as a reseller.  I brought up the software vendor's website and informed Derek that the same vendor was selling a newer version of H&R Block tax software again this year. He still acted like the online vendor was NOT authorized to sell H&R block's tax software.  I have NEVER had a customer service person act so assinine and try to pass the buck as many times as this guy did. And he was a supposedly a supervisor???  I ended up filing a BBB complaint against H&R Block for their failure to provide the state software package, which I paid for and which WAS a part of the Deluxe package.  I have been a user of taxcut (now renamed to "H&R block at home") for probably 10+ years. The previous year I switched to turbo tax, because it was on sale at a very good price. Apparently I should have just stayed with turbotax.  Obviously now I'll be looking at some other tax prep software for the next tax season.	-1
I moved mid-year and have to file taxes in two states.  I read somewhere that a second state costs $15 ... but that was wrong.  It's actually $29.90 - which is the same price you pay to download the full federal + state version.  A bit of a rip-off in my opinion.	-1
Can you believe that Norton doesn't know how to backup 64bit drivers.  Their instructions?  Go out on the web and find the drivers you need for your devices.  This answer is.... bull.  To Symantec's credit, they allowed me to return the software.  I purchased Nova Backup which worked perfectly.  In fact, I've fully restored my system using Nova, and everything went so smoothly that I hardly noticed a restoration had taken place.  The way it should be.  Certainly not Norton's way.	-1
I like Norton products and use NIS and their utility program, but this program is not supported.  proof: It is not windows 8 compatible.  It rejects the product code and says it lacks drivers to load properly, even after using live update.  It doubled Win 8 boot time, and trips up the Metro bypass programs that everyone uses to get the Start button back.  Win 8 has been out for 8 months and longer for developers.  It is still version 15, which is 3 years old!  Hello.  I read most of the huge manual only to find by online searches that it will not work with Win 8.  Good thing I got it free.	-1
Buyer Beware:  not only produces non bootable copy, but also makes original non bootable.  This is a very dangerous product.	-1
I decided to finally do a good job of backing up my home computers and bought a QNAP TS-110 NAS and installed a Hitachi 2 TB drive.  I already had an external SATA drive which I increased in size to 2 TB also.  I have the system working well and can share folders and have mapped network drives between the computers and the NAS.  So it is time to install Ghost 15.0.  The installation works well but when I set up a backup I can't access the NAS shared folder for the back-up.  I keep getting a error: "Multiple connections to a server or shared resource by the same user, using more than one user name, are not allowed.".  It turns out that Ghost has to access the NAS using a user name that does not come from the PC being backed-up. I had to Un-Map all my network drives and reboot. I added a "Ghost" user name to the NAS (Nas-name) with its own password.  I made a new network drive Q: with the location \\Nas-name\username; Re-connect at log-on; CONNECT USING A DIFFERENT USER NAME The user name to make the connection was "Nas-name\Ghost" and the corresponding NAS password.  I then added the normal network drive connection Z: under the normal user name.  OK, I have found out how to do this after many hours when they could have provided some warning and instructions in probably 2-4 sentences.  The backup completes without any errors.  I now check that I can recover the drive using the Symantec Recovery Disk (SRB).  When the computer boots from the Ghost SRB it can't find the Windows network.  I worked hours searching the forums and trying differnt things.  The Norton technician also did a remote link for 1.5 hours and he still could not get it to function.  So I have a backup that can't be reloaded on a clean hard drive.  So I have succeded in doing nothing after 20 hours of work.  The program looks like it works well for a backup to an external SATA drive (why I gave it 2 stars instead of zero)but will not work to a NAS even though the documentation states that it can.	-1
I happily used ATI (Acronis True Image) for years with XP, and ONLY used it for full image Backups/Restores (I beta test Security Products, and a 30yr software tech). I upgraded (?) to Win 7 (32), and needed  new Image Backup Software (ATI had growing pains with Win 7 at first)  I "Mistakenly" went to G15 (Ghost 15)!  G15 worked pretty good for normal Backup/Restores, but when my HD (Hard Drive) crashed! It would not copy my Validated Backup to my new HD!?- G15's "clueless" outsourced free chat tech support was no help, and wanted to "upgrade" me to paid/no-guarantee support? NOT! Grrr! Full System Restore!  There was no way to post comments on the G15 backups, so you look at the dates & try & remember the system state...? ( In ATI you create the Backup, go to Recovery, and Right click on the new file/Edit Comments/Detailed...)! ~~~~~~~~~~~~ BTW!- WD (#1 Western Digital) & Seagate both have free downloads of  basic ATI (Backup/Restore only, which is all I like anyway!- Browse their websites!), but you MUST have "one" of their drives installed on your system (mix is OK, but I had Hitachi, and since "upgraded" to WD Black on my laptop!)! ~~~~~~~~~~~~ I then upgraded to ATI trial, but it did not have all the available features of paid/registered.  NOTE!-I don't like the Incremental File/Image Backups on either G15 or ATI!- Every time you defrag, they see this as a file change!- Backups recopy & Quickly become HUGE/SLOW! Only do New/Full backups (I keep last 3, and 1st after a fresh System Restore!)!  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ "My" 100% Tried-n-True ATI Backup/Restore Procedure(adapt for G15 too, and I'd Print/save... it!!)!-  - For Backups- I fresh defrag "after" a fresh no-activity reboot. I wait 8min, then defrag (all files are released). Free MyDefrag is GREAT, but you MUST disable Win defrag by searching for services.msc & Right click/Run as admin(same with most Any 3d party defrag!), and then two no-activity 4min wait reboots!   -Wait 4min & "temp disable your AV!", wait 4 more min (HD light has now stopped flashing?), and do your Backup/Restore! Right click ATI & Run as Admin (ANY ATI... procedure! Win 7/Vista, blocks system changes!)! Wait 2min after every closing of ATI, for the first no-activity reboot (it's slow to release files!). -For Backups- Wait 4min, and do a normal reboot. Go into Recovery, Right click on the new backup, and Validate/Reboot!  -For Recovery- Wait 4min & do a Reboot Wait 4min & Shutdown (not many system changes are "fully" complete, until After a cold startup!?)!  Note!- "After" you have registered "either" Trial, be sure & go into Tools, and cut a New Emergency Boot CD (In case your HD crashes... Trial CD will not copy to a new HD!). ~~~ On a new HD copy...,  if you ever get a message about a bad BOOTmgr...!- Reboot from your Win CD/Repair System...,  and Repair Start Up, "3" separate times!  Done! ~~~ Yea!- I know This is Very time consuming, but it works "100%" for me (learned it the Hard Way!)! Sure Beats a System Restore!	-1
I do not like this software:  - It could not retrieve my 2008 return - The stock sales are confusing and unclear - Scary : they knew my health history. Where did they get this info and how?   I am very disturbed.  Stay clear and use an accountant.	-1
stop including efile in the cost of the program. the gov allows FREE efile if you are under a specific salary.	-1
This isn't a software product I can recommend getting. It's not polished enough. It doesn't work smoothly enough. There isn't enough space available for the amount of money they want to charge.  This might've been fine a few years ago. At this point, there are just too many services out there that'll happily give you 5+ GB of cloud storage to use as you please for free (including Amazon itself), and I've played with several of them to compare against this and they're also better.  Obviously this is more than 5 GB, but you can get good deals elsewhere on similar amounts (or more) with better interfaces and support.  There ARE significant benefits to this kind of thing over using an external hard drive. You should definitely have external hard drive backups, but also having one stored somewhere else entirely will save you if, for example, someone breaks into your home and steals your computer AND the backup drive.  This also sits in an awkward size range... a few GB is plenty generally for something like sharing files between your computers, sharing photos with family, and keeping basic backups of documents you want to access regularly. But you need a lot more than 25GB if you're going to back up an entire computer (complete with applications and your media files) typically. So 25 is sort of way too much for some purposes, and nowhere near enough for others.  I'm also sort of hesitant about how secure they really are. I don't see anything in the product description (and didn't notice on the program) about exactly what kind of encryption they're using... if any. I don't know if things are being encrypted before being transmitted or after arrival or not at all or what.  On the whole I just... this isn't a complete disaster, but I haven't been able to come up with a scenario where I would tell someone "This is your best option."  Edit: By February of 2014, I'm seeing Google throwing in 100GB of Google Drive space with Chromebooks and 50GB with a Moto X phone. You can get 50GB of Dropbox with certain phones (like Samsung galaxies). Microsoft has a program going where it's pretty trivial to get 100GB on OneDrive. (Most of these offers are for 1 or 2 years btw, not permanent). I point all that out just to emphasize the point that I don't really see where this offering from Norton realistically fits as something it'd be worth getting.	-1
Terrible, barely functional and I am beginning to seriously second guess my faith in Norton products.  Slow, not worth the money let alone the time, don't buy this !	-1
If I am going to trust someone to back up my data, I want to know what the terms are.  That is more important to me for this type of service, which relies entirely on their ongoing behavior, than for most other services or products.  Norton does not usually offer any clear summary of how their stuff works (or doesn't work), with the barest website imaginable as though nobody could ever want to know anything about their services.  Everything is hidden in the legalese text (which was not located in any obvious place, except for during the signup process).  So I actually read the enormous terms and conditions, which I would normally skip.  As best as I can figure, if your renewal payment fails, Norton will INSTANTLY "suspend" your account, and will delete your data in 30 days.  This could be pretty bad if you happen to be out of town when your renewal is due, or if you happen to have your credit card stolen at that time.  Yes, it is unlikely to take more than 30 days to work out, but deleting all of your stuff is a pretty bad thing.  Furthermore, with a "suspended" account, "Symantec shall not be obligated to [...] forward such Data to You."  Obviously they won't allow full use of your backup service if your payment fails or if you don't want to continue using it (especially if, while attempting to fix a payment issue, you develop a distaste for Norton's famous customer service).  A reasonable policy would be that they stop you from uploading new data, but give you that 30 days to retrieve the old data.  NOT holding your data hostage instantly.  After I signed up and logged in, I notice that this service still shows up as: Norton Online Backup - 5 GB [...]Storage Amount  5 GB  The package has a sticker for the new 25GB size over the old 5GB.  Apparently they didn't update the label on the website?  But the details line also says 5, not just the title line, so who knows.  Norton is always plagued by absurd hiccups, and they really ought to get their "stuff" together.  5 GB was pitiful when that was the offer (which was larger than older offerings), but now in the year 2013 25 GB isn't so great either with most people having loads of images, music, and even videos.  Norton always manages to make their backup size just not quite big enough for many people to use without paying for an upgrade.  And how much does that upgrade cost?  Here are the offers they give me when I select the option to buy more space: 5  GB Storage 39.99 10 GB Storage 39.99 25 GB Storage 59.99 50 GB Storage 69.99  The cheapest upgrade is 40 bucks, or 60 if you want to buy an upgrade of the same size as your initial purchase.  They apparently have a sale on the 10 GB right now, not that it is a very good deal.  That is a huge price increase over the always-on-sale initial 25 GB, and an absolutely horrible deal anyway.  Norton is obviously doing the old crack dealer trick where they give you a lower price on the first trip and then shake you down when you need more.	-1
If we could return or exchange this product, we would ... its features and pricing have been beaten like a drum, and it's spot in the marketplace superceded by numerous others.  One good example: We noticed only very recently that GMail unified its storage with Google Drive online about six weeks ago (May 2013).  Together they now offer 15 gb online storage for free.  Free to start, with an annual renewal price of free. As opposed to this product,&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Norton-Online-Backup-2-0-1-User-25GB/dp/B002X8V326/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Norton Online Backup 2.0 - 1 User / 25GB</a>, priced at $25.99 for the software and first year, $19.99 renewal fee per year thereafter.  There are others, but it hardly seems fair to compare, so I'll stop right there.	-1
I have a two-year-old, high-end iMac.  The back-up process is hung up.  I can't get anyone on chat.  I'm not sure this 5GB is worth messing around.  I've tried everything I can think of.  I've had trouble with Norton before.  I felt it was ridiculous that I had to have someone remotely correct the problem on my computer. I just had a similar problem with a wireless printer.  It seems that when I run into problems I get charged for their time.  I know the warranty says free chat support, but in parenthesis it says that in some cases they charge fees.  Read the small print.  It doesn't say anything about fees for service for over a year.  These days, 25MB is a dinosaur.  The sample I got is for 5MB.  I'll let you know if I get it working.  It's been hung up for hours.	-1
This product arrived a few days ago - I was excited to try it out.  I'm always looking for additional storage and backup options. I logged in to my Norton account, registered my serial number, was sent to a download link for my (Mac) software.  The link didn't work.  I tried it again several times with no success. i tried to contact Norton Support for assistance, but gave up after waiting nearly an hour with no response to my chat request (although the support site promises short waits.) Until two days ago, I'd only ever used one browser, Safari, on my MacBook.  Frustrated by the unresponsive download link, I installed Google Chrome and was finally able to download the software.  Installation was easy, but when I launched the application, it started to scan my hard drive for the suggested files for backup, and six hours later it was still scanning. So it is now four days since I received the product in the mail, and  I have encountered a non-existent support site, a bad download link, a software application that can't even seem to successfully scan my hard drive to set itself up.  I think I can safely say for the purpose of this review that I do not like the product.  I'll stick with Dropbox, thanks. Coda: Today, after much tinkering, I was able to launch the software and start a backup. It was a slow process, but after an hour the backup was complete. If Norton can eliminate the bugs in their setup, this might become a functional product.	-1
* The 25 Gig storage space turns out to be much smaller PER BACKUP  * Instructions not clear  * Initial storage not enough  * Extra storage costs too high  * This product does not meet the normal standards of excellence associated with Norton products	-1
This is yet another disappointing product from Norton. Their antivirus software, although one of the most famous antivirus software in the world, falls flat of the promise to catch all viruses and to protect your computer to the fullest extent (<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Kaspersky-Anti-Virus-2012-3-PCs-Old-Version/dp/B0056CZATI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Kaspersky Anti-Virus 2012 - 3 PCs [Old Version</a>] is a much better product); sadly, this online backup product follows a smiliar fate of being inferior to the what's available in the marketplace.  I would recommend using Amazon's Cloud Drive, Microsoft's SkyDrive, DropBox, SugarsSync, or any other service before you attempt to use Norton.  As previously noted by other reviewers, this package offered 5 GB, instead of the promised 25GB. I'm not sure if this is because this was a sample product or if the Amazon listing is incorrect. Buyer beware - you might not be receiving the promised 25GB.  Not that it should matter. The software, although not too difficult to install, is way harder to install than its competitors (compare it to the simple two-step process with Dropbox). Also, this is only an annual subscription. You buy this now, and will have to buy a subsequent key/renew to continue storing the data on Norton's servers. With so many options offering you free storage (read: 5GB from Amazon), why bother uploading your data for only a year? I'd recommend securing a more permanent solution (possibly even buying an external harddrive and backing it up the old fashioned way!).	-1
I have been using online backup services for years and have become accustomed to how easy to use most have become.  The real benefit of online services is that they allow me to chose which folders and which devices I want to backup and then automatically take care of the rest.  The Norton Online Backup seemed like a similar proposition but unfortunately it was not.  It only allowed me to backup from my computer.  Once this was set I could not access my files from other devices (such as a tablet or phone) as easily as some of the other backup systems (such as Dropbox) let me do.  For the price of this product I can buy a Pogoplug device and use a USB storage device to do my own network storage without the headaches (and fears) that this Norton Online Backup creates	-1
The Disc version costs $120 currently, and product key version $106.  The Disc version can be installed on three PC's instead of just one for the product key version.  The Disc version provides for easier emergency recovery/reinstall (no downloads) compared to the product key version.	-1
Worse than Vista; productivity destroyer of the year. If you have never used Word before this product would still be terrible because of the poor help. If you already know how to use Word, this product throws away your experience. Your muscle memory of where to click doesn't work because most things are in different locations and are organized differently. I am spending hours searching for features that I know how to use in previous versions. The product has terrible bugs that lock you out of files. Converting to docx files (or not) as you choose is clumsy. The help screens are an advertisement for the search engine Bing. Too often I can't find where they hid a feature in their help system and have to go to Google and find the answer from Joe public.	-1
I wrote a review of this product a few months ago that dinged it pretty hard. I had purchased it, tried it and shelved it. I took it off the shelf after someone challenged me to try working with it and to review it again. Well, not much has improved in my thinking. A few things are a little more convenient (after you get accustomed to them) but overall the program is a drag on time consumption and ease for writers (authors). The 'ribbon' is okay, but it takes up room so in the end I dump it (hide it) and work without it until I need to use it. I convert books to eBooks and at that time the Ribbon is okay, but not more efficient than Microsoft 2000, actually making hyperlinks in 2000 within a document or to the Net is a ton easier in MS Word 2000 than in this version. For some reason Microsoft must have felt that hyperlinks should be made as difficult as Adobe makes them in InDesign. MS Word 2010 provides a neat image compression button for Web use and eBook use but does not resize them, so in the end I use Photoshop for that. BTW, you can resize the image for your local printer, but that does not resize it for the Web or eReaders. IMHO, 2010 is better than 2007 but fails to improve on Word 2000 and is therefore, just another change for marketing purposes and not necessarily for those who need to create material. I have Microsoft Office 2000, Word 2003 and Word 2007. I dumped 2003 and 2007 (uninstalled them) and now use MS 2000 for the bulk of my work. I have kept MS Word 2010 installed, but find that I don't gravitate to it, simply because my time is too valuable to put up with the geeky stuff.  Edit December 19, 2012: I have now had MSWord 2010 for about 8 months. For writing copy, books, etc. I still prefer MS 2000. For making eBook files for others I use the MSWord 2010. A few updates have helped with hyperlinks, but that's about it. The picture compression is handy for making eReaders like Kindles, Nooks, and other EPUB and iBook files. MS 2010 does open all older files and you can save them in the older version format if you need to. But I confirm again that MS 2010 costs too much labor time to switch copy writing or the writing of books and other large documents from 2000 to 2010.	-1
Microsoft Word 2010 builds on an idea that Microsoft is famous for, which is to refine the dashboard of the car, not the engine or performance of the car, building on an already successful overload of bloated and reckless programming. I can't 100% vouch for this, because I don't work for Microsoft, but this program is yet another example of where Microsoft completely depends on the fact that many businesses and end users are ONLY familiar with Word, and little else. Had this not been the case, Microsoft Word would be an incredibly awful piece of over-priced, bloated, buggy software.  Still chock full of inconsistencies and performance/reliability issues, it's possible that much of the talent behind this program is fresh meat or Microsoft didn't seem to put much effort into Design Verification testing. Other similar Word Processors seems to be less crash-prone in Windows than Microsoft's very own Word Processor. I will defend Word here, that the Auto-Save/recovery technology is pretty good....and necessary.  Now, the more frustrating thing I find that this program does NOT do well, is to give the end user a way to move objects, pictures, boxes, and charts around the page without utterly and completely destroying certain aspects of page formatting. There are some facets that Word can handle well, such as the realization that the end user wants each new line to continue with a number, bullet, Bold, etc. but outside of that, Word is pretty, well....dumb. It also seems Microsoft, as usual just makes it more complex and frustrating by changing where things are like a department store. This simply DOESN'T work for end users. Ever complain that your local grocer re-arranged the store, and now you have to spend twice as long re-orienting yourself with the layout, and having to ask for help twice as often?  Even the help isn't very intelligent or useful? Sound familiar? It is here.  I will still use Word, because like I said, it's what I'm very familiar with, but I still curse at it often. I actually found it more enjoyable to take a week to learn Adobe's InDesign to accomplish much of what Word never could dream of doing on a page. Like some very prominent authors state they use Word for writing, they certainly don't use it for any type of finished product. Not that Word is expected to be a full-on publishing application, but with the price Microsoft puts on Word it should at least try and compete beyond the limits of freeware.  Conclusion: If you're only familiar with Word, and you are required to use it, or have many people you send/receive documents from that use Word, stick with it and you'll survive life. If not, give some other programs like OpenOffice a good whirl until Microsoft can at least work out their own internal incompatibilities and inconsistencies, while hopefully taking better control of their own pricing.	-1
Microsoft seems to have stripped most of the functionality out from previous versions of word and the help function is pointless.  This program is far inferior to any previous version. Not an upgrade at all.	-1
I find this program harder to use the Word 2007. The new "clean" design makes it take longer to identify buttons and to click on them.	-1
It didn't work with my new Windows 7 computer so I returned it. Microsoft makes things so complicated.	-1
Just misses the mark. I suppose the software is good but it is a little difficult to get to do what I want it to do.	-1
Extremely frustrating version. I'm REALLY tired of new products that just rearrange things for the sake of doing it and add features that make things automatic, which don't work and slow everything down. I have a good workflow in 2007 and 2010 is a massive fail IMHO.  - The Search function is slow and fails on a regular basis. - It can't seem to open my old 2007 files without the app being run in Administrative mode. It tells me I need an administrator account to open the files, but my account is the only one on the machine and is administrator. - I run an ecommerce site and once or twice a day we have to check the header information on suspected fraudulent email orders. This is now buried and not easily accessible. - The UI is 'new and improved', except it's not. Admittedly there are a few things in locations that make more sense, but mostly it's just an annoying redesign that has made my workflow less efficient. Having used it for the last month or so has not improved things. - Many other small things... I've had nothing but trouble with it.  I'm switching back to 2007. This was a waste of money.	-1
In my view, this product is now useless UNLESS your computer already has Office 2010 already installed and you can merely enter the code you are buying with this product.  If you need to download Office 2010, good luck.  I am very computer savvy and found Microsoft now only supports 2013 downloads. I found other places where one could obtain links to download 2010 and used on that was supposedly relatively reputable. After installing the software and using up my code, AVAST popped up (love Avast) and said I had a rootkit type virus and it needed to run a boot scan on next start-up.  So, in my experience, this product is now useless UNLESS you already have 2010 Office installed (as in preinstalled) on your computer. Otherwise, you are taking a risk of finding a virus free place to get a copy of 2010 onto your computer.  (Or, it would also work if you have an Office 2010 Disk handy where that disk has been used but you can use this new code with it.)	-1
The product is what it is.  But, Microsoft has made tracking the download link all but impossible to find.  After 15 minutes, I found a support number.  I feared that I would be connected with an Indian call center, but was pleasantly surprised ... the Central American agent was very pleasant and helpful.  Still, my beef with Microsoft is the ridiculous difficulty associated with their software.  Had my wife been able to get by with OpenOffice or LibreOffice, I would have gladly avoided the hassle and $90 expense.	-1
The Amazon description notes Media: CD-Rom. Truth is, this product is a key card, only.  If you want the key card version, pay ten bucks less and get it with Prime delivery.	-1
I own the 2007 version (3 licenses) and tried the starter version that came with my new computer. I see no great improvement, for my needs. Someone else may think differently, depending on his/her needs. For now I am sticking with MS Office 2007. Right now this is my verdict on this new version, that costs upwards of a hundred dollars. Tell me if I am wrong.	-1
This review is of WordPerfect Office Standard X5 -- a suite of integrated products -- but the same comments apply to X4.  This review focuses on how WordPerfect's vaunted ability to convert other program files, is hot air.  Other reviewers have covered the pro's (and there are many) and cons (and there are many) of creating documents IN WordPerfect.  If you don't have much need for converting pdfs or other files into WordPerfect, then please skip my review.  If you seek a word processing program for complex documents you will create in that processor, then pick WordPerfect.  Simpler word processing needs are better served by Word.  So now, onto the hot air of WordPerfect's vaunted ability to convert pdf and other files (which is my main need for updated versions of the program).  Sidebar: I just bought X5 and will return it (more on that story at the end of this review).  I own X4.  This review is long, but it offers alternatives to the dysfunctionality in WP, since like many others I'm stuck with it.  Hope the ideas prove helpful.  Yell at me if they don't.  'Starting with the non-WordPerfect components:  forget Quattro Pro.  It can't retrieve wk1 files in either X5 or X4.  X5 doesn't even have that as an option, though X4 does, and when you try to retrieve ANY wk1 file in X4 or X5, you get an error message that there are invalid characters in the file name.. and then the program crashes.  My XP Pro (SP3+) altogether freezes for some minutes, despite 1GB RAM, Pent4 and 3.4GHz.  BUT if I first retrieve the wk1 in Excel 2002 and prior, no problem except to change the font from their stupid Courier default to Franklin Gothic Medium (etc), and save as xls.  Only THEN can X4 or X5 of QP, read the file.  So much for vaunted conversion back-capability.  Dysfunction City.  At least pre-2007 Excel can read wk1 files, which for millions of us are still the workhorses in our day.  My whole business is built around them for the last 30 years; I designed the templates myself.  Run in a DOS window, old Lotus 1-2-3 2.x is fast and sterling, full audit trail especially with Funk Software's Worksheet Utilities.  Wish IBM, who owns the rights to both programs, would resurrect them.  Fat chance.  So QP better not quit its day job.  Forget the other things in the WP suite, they don't work either.  Lightning sends XP Pro into a hang, can't read anything I tried to use it to read, and Mozilla is not compatible with it, so your browser crashes when trying to use it.  Forget Presentations, totally unintuitive and how do you get to the next page?  Forget Thunderbird, it won't store your passwords in a logical place, so what's the point of it being able to ask for email?  You have to BE THERE each time to type in the password, SINCE THERE IS NO PLACE WITHIN THUNDERBIRD TO STORE PASSWORDS.  Instead, it stores passwords in an insane 'profile' which has a name no one can remember.  Or, you have to sync to the internet, store that vital information in the cloud, where someone can hack. Not to mention, its huge screen real estate taken up with a blank border in Preview, and other unintuitive idiosyncracies which prove Outlook Express shouldn't be allowed to die.  Use full Outlook, if you're on Windows 7.  Software interfaces need to make sense right out of the box.  Forget the rest of the WP suite, then.  So now let's talk about WordPerfect X5's dysfunctionality.  I gave WP X5 two stars for only one reason:  one star for the fact you really can CREATE good documents in it;  second star is for its backwards-compatibility with old WP docs back to version 6 (and if you have 6, you can convert pre-6 to 6).  But with other old word processing software?  Well, not quite as advertised, because, just as is true for X4,  * I couldn't get it to work on Multimate Advantage docs, though it recognizes THE FIRST HALF of the fields (doesn't recognize the close of the field).  Older WP versions recognize the whole thing correctly, from versions 6 through 12. * Same, for X5's inability to convert Word docs (more on that follows below); or, * any of the other older word processors I've used over the decades. *Can't read .tif.  That's an MS standard, Tagged Image Format, native to every Windows computer, scanner reader.  But to WP, it's not a 'valid format'.  I thought WP prided itself on integration with MS and especially, for scanning, in its hoopla praising X5?  Guess again. * Like X4, X5 Can't read csv files.  Everyone else can.  So if you download your address book from Yahoo Mail to go into WP's address book, well -- it can't parse it, even though you set up the delimiter specs aptly.  * X4 and X5 can't properly convert a Word 97-2003 ONE PAGE document;  formatting squishes when Word spacing isn't single line (i.e., if you specified 1.5 line spacing or a large font).  This is very important, as many legal documents are created in Word, especially by the big law firms who do pension prototypes (like Relius, McKay-Hochman, Wolters-Kluwer).  Big market.  Don't use WordPerfect if you do this kind of thing.  Keep to Word, or you'll have mush for your client.  * Can't convert a three-page RTF created by a major national law firm which makes pension plan prototypes in RTF, either.  All squished, font comes in as Arial though it was made in a different font, all the formatting is wrong.  * Can't read mht file, nor html, though I pulled the html from online, and easily edited it in Word.  LOL, WPX5 just crashed as I was typing this review, trying to convert a second html file.  * It also crashes when trying to search your hard drive, UNLESS all the files in a folder are WP-originated files or pdfs.  X5 doesn't crash with a greater mixture of file types, but it does crash if the folders are large. X4 crashes nearly every time. * WPX5, like X4, seamlessly converts older versions of Word Perfect (version 12 and prior, I have them all) -- but sucessfully converted no other format I tried in X4 or here in X5, except a blank page with only a faked letterhead.  * X5/4 are lousy with pdf file imports.  X5 is only marginally better.  With it, I tried converting Google-doc pdfs, no luck.  Messed up no matter what open/convert/import pdf option I picked (recognize, partly recognize, don't recognize text).  Same, for any of the pdfs you want to name from JStor or ccel.org.  When I tried to bring in the SCANNED Complete Works of Shakespeare (19th century book Google SCANNED in, freely downloadable from Google Books) -- WP claimed the file was encrypted or corrupted.  Funny, other pdf readers can read it just fine.  * This matters if your job depends on pdf manipulation.  I do a lot of tax filing work, so use a lot of Government pdfs (instructions, Government forms, etc).  WPX5 can't convert any of them, claims they are encrypted or corrupt -- yeah, right, the Instructions for your 1040 in pdf are corrupt or encrypted? -- or only converts if you choose DO NOT RECOGNIZE TEXT option.  For example, if you import the Downton Abbey schedule from PBS, what comes into WordPerfect is a complete blank, no matter what import/convert options you select.  A short Government form with DO NOT RECOGNIZE converts as readable, but is way off, so you may as well have imported it in Word.  * When I tried to bring in a large pdf I created WITH Word, WPX5 completely mangled the text no matter what choices I made for importing, and it couldn't read the links.  Complete disaster.  * Oh, and it crashes when you bring in government pdf files longer than two pages.  If only two pages, your scroll bars disappear until you go back to Settings and tell it to 'browse by' (how unintuitive) Top and Bottom or Top or Bottom.  Then suddenly the scroll bars appear.  * By contrast, I have no trouble at all converting from or to pdf files into/out from Word with Smart PDF Creator Pro, a $70 program I often use to convert pdfs to Word and back for the Department of Labor's EFAST2 program (filing pension plan information returns).  So if you want to convert a variety of docs or jpg, tif, spreadsheets to pdf, get that instead of WPX5.  Great for converting stuff to pdf for email attachments, too.  The advantage of converting government pdfs is that you can then edit each line item with short instructions to remind you what goes on the line, instead of keeping the ponderous instruction manuals on your desktop.  So think of the uses for other pdfs -- same idea.  True editing of a pdf, without spending lots of money for Adobe Acrobat (which is a pain to use, anyway.)  As for how WPX5 handles Word document conversion, the other thing X5 crows about in its ads, well -- it turned my 152-page Word document to mush. * It did read many (not all) of the bookmark links intra-document, * but it changed the faded highlights to bright colors, * squished most of the headers, * didn't align the borders properly, so that the text and lines were askew; * couldn't read the koine Greek text though I have the koine Greek fonts installed, * lost all the cell background colors in the many tables, * can't display half of the page in landscape mode native to the Word doc, * and of course repaginated the document, though in Settings I told it NEVER to repaginate or change the formatting of the opened document.  In short, the only non-WordPerfect (i.e., Word doc) conversion that WPX5 did properly in this testing of X5, was a simple mock Word.doc stationery page (no text, just the letterhead which is not in the header section).  All else I've tried, it mangled, or crashed trying.  Worthless.  WordPerfect's time-honored annoyances were preserved in X5;  like the fact  * you can't disable hyphenation across the board, but only per document; * it forces repagination for your printer despite Convert settings which says DO NOT FORMAT. * Then there's the perennial annoying WHITE SPACE of all those margins, wasting your desktop view, along with a bizillion buttons taking up three or four rows at the top (or sidebar) of the window. You can turn off the buttons, but then it's harder to edit. * You can't turn off the dang margin whitespace, even in Draft Mode. * And Reveal Codes? FORGET IT.  MS Word is bad because you can't see where formatting begins and ends, and Styles you pick are dysfunctional. A mistype or change in style suddenly resets the format in ways you didn't select, i.e., if you select a style with a font it changes the font size to something not in that style or in the former style.  WordPerfect's Reveal Codes would be an improvement over that, but the lower Reveal Codes' window has always been unnavigable.  You scroll forever.  So why don't they create object markers, instead? You know, like Comment triangles in Excel -- in the WYSIWYG window you can toggle on and off, or see the codes when you hover?  Alas, smart design is not part of Word Perfect's philosophy.  Instead, jargon and help chm's which only tell you what you already know, abound.  Typical of all word processors of Windows vintage.  * At least MS Word can do a merge, however stupid its system: it requires a special external spreadsheet with ONLY the merge data in it.  Carefully specify the field names to match the worksheet column names, no spaces, not too long, either.  And here's the trick: the spreadsheet you create, is a shell.  Its cells ADDRESS a spreadsheet UNDERNEATH the shell;  so that lower spreadsheet (say, your customer list or participant data), you can combine (copy into the lower worksheet) at will.  So you need never type data twice. WordPerfect claims it can do the same thing, but that's not really true.  I've been trying since 1985 to get it to work.  Prior versions of WP have these problems too; I've always hated working with WP for that reason.  Have kept it only because I have thousands of documents in prior versions of WP that I need to read on this computer. Old WordPerfect (version 12 and prior) works far better.  UPSHOT: if like me you have tons of important old Word Perfect files you must access in Windows 7 or XP, maybe get X5 -- but don't expect it to perform as promised on pdfs and pre-Word 2007 docs, mht, html, etc.  Whoever creates a truly intuitive word processor that can merge without a bizillion steps, will become rich overnight.  Multimate was the last good one (but doesn't have WYSIWYG); I still use it to generate my merge reports, as nothing better has come along.  PS:  I didn't buy this X5 from Amazon, but from Corel, because Corel badmouthed Amazon, blaming my X4's bugginess because I bought it at Amazon.  But the X4 disk SAYS OEM right on it, and is original, not a copy.  So now Corel can't blame Amazon, since this X5 review is of a onsite COREL-purchased copy.  Which, I will return in 24 hours.  PPS: it's now 12 hours later, and they have to issue me an RMA hopefully sometime tomorrow, before I can get refunded on a product I've not yet received.  The product will arive in snail mail in a week, which I will return unopened.  So it will take a month or two before I get the refund.  BUYER BEWARE:  do do do buy at Amazon.  They mean it when they say no hassle refunds;  I've never seen such a dedicated bunch of employees in my life.  Each one I've encountered in my many (too many) calls to them, takes the problem to heart.  As if an owner of the company.  So  I aim to shop here first, for everything I need; only if I can't find it here, will I shop anywhere else!	-1
Final Update - On February 1, 2011, I went to the Autodesk website to check for additional updates and found that FreeStyle had been withdrawn from sale.  Customer support stopped April 1, 2011.  Update 10/7/2010 - The first product update was released a couple of weeks ago. The major change fixes the first item below...you can now create custom symbols and store them in the library.  I'm still in the process of evaluating the release and will update this note after I've used it a bit more.  Original Review: The designers of a package like AutoCAD FreeStyle face a classic challenge: It needs to be easy to use for a novice, with enough features to be useful, yet not so powerful that it will cannibalize sales of the high-end (and much more expensive) AutoCAD systems.  After spending a couple of days using AutoCAD FreeStyle, I think the designers set the bar way too low.  The interface is simple and easy to learn, but far too many features are missing for FreeStyle to be a competitive program.  That's not to say that FreeStyle can't be used to produce usable drawings; it just could be much better if it included basic features that are in other systems.  Let me go through some of the areas that stood out...  Symbol Library - A library is a collection of symbols that are created once and then used on multiple drawings.  FreeStyle comes with a collection of prebuilt symbols that are sufficient to get started, however it's not a complete enough library for a lot of projects - when I attempted to draw my sprinkler system, I discovered that there are no sprinkler components listed.  In most CAD systems, this problem is addressed by allowing the user to build custom symbols.  Once they're added to the library, they can be repeatedly used in future drawings.  This release of FreeStyle doesn't have that capability.  The symbols that come with the program are all that you've got, and that simply isn't enough.  Incidentally, what's in the library is even a little strange... the Electrical Symbols tab includes five Gas and Water symbols along with the basic electrical symbols and the Building Components section only contains six fireplace facades...I'm sure that in real life there are more building components than just those.  Paper Size and Scale - When you start a new drawing, the program asks you to select the size of the paper and the object that you' re going to draw.  e.g. you pick 8.5 x 11" paper and select that the page represents a 30' x 40' space.  The scale shows that " equals 1'.  This makes perfect sense to anybody not used to using a CAD program, but is backwards from the norm...normally a designer would select a paper size and a scale.  Splines - Splines are a way of smoothly connecting a series of points.  By adjusting the "handles", you can easily draw complex curves.  FreeStyle doesn't have a way of drawing with splines.  The menu allows you to draw with arc segments, straight lines and freehand "doodles".  You can adjust the points of inflection on the doodle and eventually get to the desired curve, but it's not as easy as it seems.  True spline capability would be easier.  Radius line joins - When drawing a floor plan, most lines meet with a sharp corner, but that's not always the case.  Sometimes a drawing needs to have a rounded curve joining the two lines.  Most 2-D drafting systems can do that automatically, but FreeStyle lacks that capability.  You can manually accomplish the same thing by drawing a small arc, but why?  You're only talking about a millisecond of computer time to have the program do it for you.  Double lines for walls - Often walls in architectural drawings are shown by two parallel lines, representing the inside and outside surfaces.  Freestyle doesn't have that ability built-in.  To do it correctly, it's a little more complicated that just having a double line as a selectable line type....you need to specify wall thickness, join corners correctly and scale appropriately as the drawing size changes.  Again, all this can be done manually, but the basic idea is to have the program save time by doing the work for you.  Incidentally, the work around is to simply draw a thick solid line for walls...look at all the sample drawings for examples.  Draw a wall of a house.  Now drag a window or door from the symbol library and place it onto the wall.  You'd think that the wall would break and allow the object to be inserted.  It doesn't.  OK, now manually break the wall into two separate line segments and drag the line ends apart to create the necessary break.  That would work, if there was a way to break a line into two pieces, but there isn't.  So you nuke the whole side of the house and redraw two separate line segments on either side of the door.  That works...until you realize that the door is 6" to the left of where it should be.  The algorithm that calculates color fills is flaky.  When you drag the fill icon over a fillable area, the area is highlighted with a light version of the fill color. It's a nice idea, so you can see exactly where the color's going.  Unfortunately, a single open pixel prevents an area from filling.  The highlighting, though, isn't nearly so discerning.  It's not unusual to have an area highlight, but fail to fill when clicking on the mouse button.  I also managed to fill in an object and then select the color and move it while leaving the outline behind...it was a little strange.  There's no instruction manual.  You can get help for any of the commands by selecting that command and clicking the question mark icon.  Clicking on the icon showing three stacked baby letter blocks takes you to the Freestyle website where there is more detailed information.  It's annoying, though, not to have something you can skim through.  I was trying to figure out how to color in a tree and it wasn't until I saw a picture in the on-line help that I realized that the color was coming from a filled in circle located behind the tree.  I could add more, but you get the idea.  If the product manager at AutoDesk chooses, all of these can (and should) be fixed in a future release.  Until then, though, I'm only giving FreeStyle two stars.  The simple user interface is right on the mark for a non-technical consumer level product.  The omitted features, though, cost it dearly in the ability to produce usable and functional drawings.	-1
Yes, everybody else is right. This sucks. It doesn't even have the bill pay calendar. At best, it's just a bunch of account registers all in one program. It was a waste of my money.	-1
"Quicken Essentials For Mac" is a toy plastic knife for the tasks of skinning the personal finance grizzly bear. Its lack of essential features is a longstanding, running joke in the Mac personal finance user community. Intuit's epic failure to update Quicken for Mac -- now extending over more than seven years since release of Quicken for Mac 2007 in August 2006 -- the subsequent release of "Quicken Essentials", which actually was a downgrade, and Intuit's general neglect of the Mac OS, amount to the worst betrayal of customer loyalty and dashed customer hopes in the entire history of Mac software.  If you are looking for personal finance software for Mac, Intuit is the wrong place to look. Intuit has not updated Quicken for Mac since release of the 2007 version in August 2006. Quicken for Mac 2007 was just patched two or three times when its bugs and incompatibilities stopped it working in updates of Mac OS X. This "Quicken Essentials For Mac", although a later product than Quicken for Mac, has not been updated since 2010. It is a downgrade, and a contradiction in terms, because it has even fewer essential features than its out-of-date predecessor. It has no counterpart in the far more capable Quicken For Windows range.  The most capable and best-supported personal finance software for Mac, by far, is&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/iBank-5-Download/dp/B00GUXLRCQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">iBank 5 [Download</a>]. It has a different interface and works differently to Quicken, but has many similar capabilities, such as multiple currencies, that Intuit provides in its Quicken Windows products, yet inexcusably has failed to provide for the Mac OS. After accumulating 14 years of detailed financial data in Quicken for Mac, futilely waiting for a QFM upgrade that never came, and observing the release of this QEFM downgrade with despair and disgust, I switched to iBank at its version 4. Now I have almost 16 years of data in iBank 5 -- more detailed, reliable and useful than any data I previously kept in Quicken. My only regret has been that I did not switch sooner. My review titled 'The best and most full-featured personal finance software for Mac OS just got better', explaining in detail my experience of iBank 5, is at http://www.amazon.com/review/RUKMMLY61JDC6/  Ignore the silly, misinformed, unsubstantiated and fake reviews attacking iBank: iBank 5 is really a 4 to 5-star application. On the face of it, on average, Amazon customer reviewers rank both iBank and QEFM as two-star products. This appearance of equivalence is misleading: it suggests that these two products, iBank and Quicken Essentials For Mac, are equivalent, and that all "customer reviews" are equal -- or genuine -- when it is self-evident, on close examination, that none of this appearance of equivalence is true. The best substantiated, most factual reviews of Quicken Essentials For Mac prove that it is a deficient and inferior product with relatively few capabilities; while the best substantiated and most factual reviews of iBank prove that it is a capable, reliable and superior product, with many more capabilities and features for personal finance than QEFM.  For a far more accurate picture of what customers really think about these products than can be obtained from the raw numbers of positive or negative reviews in Amazon, it is necessary to consider the much higher proportion of helpful votes on substantiated positive reviews of iBank, compared to the highest proportion of helpful votes on substantiated *negative* reviews of QEFM.  So, how bad is "Quicken Essentials For Mac", really? The worst of all personal finance software for all operating systems, according to Amazon customer votes. QEFM is so bad that Intuit itself recommends Mac users seeking more and better features use, instead of QEFM,&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Quicken-Personal-Finances-2007-for-Mac-OLD-VERSION/dp/B000GI0HR2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Quicken Personal Finances 2007 for Mac [OLD VERSION</a>]. QEFM is so bad that Intuit admits its inferiority to an obsolete and deficient product which it has not updated for *more than seven years*.  Here are some revealing, mind-boggling actual statements copied and pasted from Intuit's own blurb for "Quicken Essentials": "Quicken Mac 2007 and earlier users should note that this is a brand new product, so some of the features you've grown used to may not be included." (Double take. Read again. Yes, the maker explicitly admits that its "brand new product" -- which itself has not been updated for about four years -- lacks features of a slew of much older outdated products it supposedly replaces.) "If you need more more advanced investment features, try Quicken Mac 2007." "Can I export my data to TurboTax? Quicken Essentials for Mac does not support that capability. If you'd like that functionality, we recommend trying Quicken Mac 2007."  "Quicken Essentials For Mac" is so bad that Amazon customers have given more helpful votes, by multiples, to negative one-star reviews of it than to any positive or negative review of all personal finance software -- including all Quicken Windows products. This is an accurate reflection of the global Mac personal finance user community assessment of this backward product, and our frustration with Intuit.  Why Intuit has not drawn the right conclusions from Mac user feedback on product development, and has not taken the obvious and necessary course of cross-platforming the many good features it has rolled out in Quicken for Windows, is one of the great mysteries of the personal computer age.  At this date, the review with the most helpful votes (1,567 of 1,608) of *all personal finance software* in Amazon.com is Brent Stanley's one-star negative review of "Quicken Essentials For Mac", titled 'Don't even waste your time', at http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CHAGVHW73QDO/ . My personal favorite QEFM review is the third top-rated (294 helpful votes of 300), by George Beahm, titled 'In the words of Intuit's CEO Aaron Patzer: "Holy crap!" ', at http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KNUPS0QOPJER/ .  My review of the tragedy and stagnation of&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Quicken-Personal-Finances-2007-for-Mac-OLD-VERSION/dp/B000GI0HR2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Quicken Personal Finances 2007 for Mac [OLD VERSION</a>] can be read at http://www.amazon.com/review/R18R6HHP6PYNQ/  Some reviews and comments here in Amazon misguidedly advocate an extraordinarily risky, expensive and distasteful alternative to the obsolete Quicken Mac products: emulating, on a Mac, the Windows operating system that most Mac users never want to touch, for the sole purpose of running a Windows version of Quicken. No-one has better refuted this proposition, exposing its flaws and risks in detail, than Bernard A. Torbik in his one-star negative review of&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Quicken-Deluxe-2014-Download/dp/B00E7X9RUK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Quicken Deluxe 2014 [Download</a>], 'Save your money' at http://www.amazon.com/review/RHP4GOMV9CLL5/ .

That's right: Quicken's most popular and best-supported personal finance product *for Windows* cannot attract even half the number of helpful votes to its top-rated positive customer review as has been received by its top-rated negative customer review. What does Mr Torbik now use and recommend in his top-rated review of Quicken Deluxe 2014 as the best personal finance solution for Mac? --&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/iBank-5-Download/dp/B00GUXLRCQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">iBank 5 [Download</a>]. He is a wise man.	-1
The other reviews I read indicated this was totally useless. That is correct. I have a new Mac (mountain lion) and I have had to find a different checkbook program.	-1
I have used Quicken for YEARS - from the MS-DOS, Tandy Deskmate, Windows, and Mac versions. When Quicken 2007 for Mac became unusable under the "Lion" OS release, I didn't hesitate to try "Essentials"...WHAT AN UTTER DISGRACE / DISAPPOINTMENT!  THIS PRODUCT IS A JOKE!!! Unless Intuit releases a replacement version for Essentials for the Mac, I will stay with IBank!	-1
This program should have been named Quicken Unessentials.  The budgeting program is useless, it will only show you a budget for 3 months, not YTD (who does budgeting for one quarter of the year?).  It is impossible to enter mortgage or car loans and do general financial or retirement planning.  All this program is good for is downloading your credit card or bank account statements, and you can do that for free by going to your bank's website.  After two years, Intuit has not improved the program.  The only update "improvement" was to include a password to start the program (hello, computer programming 101).  No improvements to budgeting or other features the program is lacking.  Now, Intuit is offering a Lion version of Quicken 2007.  Sounds like they are about to dump this program if they are sending people back to the previous one.	-1
Not a good choice for most people.  Essentials only does allows basic functions and has very few "reports" available.  WORST feature - you cannot export QEM data files to any other financial software.  Intuit has allowed the data files to remain non-transferrable to IBank or to any Windows version.  They know the data cannot be exported and imported to other software and they do not care -- it must be part of their plan to keep customers.  SO BEWARE that if you buy QEM and use it for any length of time -- you will not be able (as of now) to import your data files in a useable form to any other financial software - such as IBank4 -- which is the financial software for a Mac that you should have used to begin with.  (The new IBank4 has many solid improvements and is a fully functioning financial software choice for Mac owners!&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Ibank-4/dp/B003WT1KAK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Ibank 4</a>  QEM is very basic and a minimal financial program.  It is not for any one who has used and liked other Quicken software or 0Money or a previous version of IBank.  Essentials is very limited and limiting!!!	-1
It is interesting to me that Intuit just merged with the makers of Cha-Ching. Cha-Ching had one of the best interfaces for a Mac Financial App but there ceased to be development on it for months. Now that the companies have merged there may be some great possibilities for future versions of intuit software.	-1
Quicken has abandoned the users of the Mac platform, so the users of the Mac platform should abandon Quicken.  Like most other people reviewing the product, I became accustomed to Quicken for Windows, and then sought a similar financial software title after switching to the Mac.  Despite the "Quicken" logo on the box, this is NOT a solution for my needs.  If you're going to spend this much money on financial software, it's safe to assume you need it to do more than provide you with a running total and colorful icons - you need it to track each transaction, INCLUDING INVESTMENTS, have robust budgeting features and flexible account / category creation / interaction.  Quicken Essentials for Mac does not fit the bill.  I found, and after a slight learning curve, have come to love&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Moneydance/dp/B00005A9VI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Moneydance</a>.  The software is no longer available from Amazon, but can be downloaded directly from the developer.  It's written in Java, so it's completely cross-platform (running exactly the same way on Mac, Windows, or if you swing that way, Linux).  It has almost all of the features of Quicken, with the exception of tight integration with TurboTax- you can download new transactions for all accounts with one button, it securely stores account passwords, it can track most every type of investment transaction (notable absences include not-yet-vested stock and option grants), it can print checks, and you can design as many budgets and reports as you need.  Plus, it's extensible, so you can download extensions that will allow you to export tax-relevant transactions to the TXF format (used by TurboTax), or perform a number of other useful features.  Finally, Moneydance absolutely CRUSHES Quicken when it comes to data freedom - it stores all your data in XML format, and can easily export data should you ever want to move back to Quicken (you know, if you're a masochist) or to any other financial title.  Anyone who's ever tried to extract a decade's worth of data from Quicken will be sure to appreciate this feature, and recognize the confidence the developer must have in his software if he doesn't feel compelled to trap you into using it (a la Intuit).  Since Intuit can't be bothered to write good financial software for the Mac, support developers that can.  Get Moneydance, and you won't regret it.	-1
I bought this from Quicken directly, downloaded it this morning, played with it this afternoon and uninstalled it by 8pm and asked for my satisfaction guarantee refund from Quicken.... This product is seriously lacking, in fact it's missing tons of features most of us would consider "essential" but Quicken essentials is missing. Below is part of a post I put in the quicken user forums regarding my purchase and lack of features.  ---  I did find on their site this link [...] which explains what I wanted is no longer part of quicken essentials and I wish this was front and center BEFORE i placed my order. Who would have thought that basic accounting reporting would have been left out? This is after all called "Essentials" and if lifetime planner, cash flow, debt reduction, tax planner, etc are not essentials then I don't know what is.....  I guess if Quicken called this Quicken 2010 Lite for Mac then I would expect a cut down version, but to hear them say how they revamped it, rewrote it from the ground up and it's so much nicer plus with a hefty $70 price tag and called "essentials" you would think it had what you would need. I mean it's not like the windows versions where theres different versions to choose from, Mac's have one version and one version only.  Yes the info was out there, I just needed to dig for it so that's my fault. And I have since taken responsibility and requested a refund and will just use their free mint service or use another tool. I'm not about to spend $70 for a program that doesn't do much of anything and yet is toted as "redesigned with you in mind" and providing "snapshot of your most important info" when it really doesn't.  If anyone else is wondering here is the part from Quickens site that explains what has been left out. (#8 is where my interest is at) -----  1. Can I track my investments?  Yes, Quicken Essentials for Mac allows you to track the overall value of your investment accounts and the value of your specific holdings by automatically downloading from your brokerage.  It will not, however, track investment buys and sells, some advanced investment performance reports, and it will not support manual entry of investment transactions or positions. If you need more advanced investment features, try Quicken Mac 2007.  2. Can I export my data to TurboTax?  Quicken Essentials for Mac does not support exporting into TurboTax. If you'd like that functionality, we recommend using Quicken Mac 2007.  Quicken Essentials will allow you to create customized, printable reports listing your tax-related expenses, which you can send to your accountant or use when filing your own taxes.  3. Can I pay my bills within Quicken?  Quicken Essentials does not support bill pay from within the product ("direct bill pay").  4. Can I print checks from within Quicken?  Quicken Essentials does not support check printing.  5. Can I import or export QIF files?  QIF files are no longer supported in current versions of Quicken.  6. Can I transfer my data from an older version of Quicken Mac?  Yes, you can transfer data from Quicken Mac 2005, 2006 and 2007. For details on how to convert your data, please go here.  7. Can I convert my Quicken Windows data to Quicken Essentials for Mac?  Yes. Not only does it convert Quicken Windows 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010 data, but also data from your Microsoft Money 2007 and 2008. For details on how to convert your data, please go here.  8. What other Quicken advanced features are not included in Quicken Essentials?  Quicken Essentials does not include many of the advanced features in other versions of Quicken, including business features, rental property lifetime planner, file attachments,. cash flow forecast, debt reduction, tax planner, and home inventory manager.  9. Are any of these features coming in future versions of Quicken for mac?  We are currently considering many new features. If you have ideas how Quicken can make your financial life easier, we would love hear your feedback.	-1
This product is a joke.  Almost no capability and yet priced as high as the regular Quicken products.  You can buy several shareware products on the market that have MORE capability, and FAR less bugs for 20-40 bucks less.  It is absolutely amazing just how little is here.  Many of the shareware developers are part time people who have full time jobs on the side and still manage to code better products with MUCH more capability.  Intuit has a serious problem with their team (assuming there is more than one very part time person on it) because this product has been under development for the last 2.5 years and yet it consists of virtually nothing.  I vote for this as the number one software screwup for the year 2010.	-1
I tried installing it, and as most programs work I had to restart the computer. I did, and when it turned on, it told me to enter my key code, a second time.  Went through the install process agiain, only to restart my computer and ask for the key code again.  It was like the movie Groundhog's day, after the 4th time I gave up.  It will be uninstalled soon.  I can't recommend it, because it never installed.	-1
I was happy to get this software today.  I anxiously installed it.  The first thing was that a newer version was available, so I tried to download and install it.  It failed, and an error message came up saying there is a "known problem" and "strongly recommended" a manual download/install.  It provided some very confusing instructions, but I'm fairly competent with computers, so I managed to manually download/install the new version.  The most disturbing feature was that during every restart of the computer, prior to Windows loading, a Acronis page appears, making you select to go to one of the Acronis applications or you MUST select Windows to go to a "normal" Windows startup. I went to "MSConfig" to the "Startup" and "Services" tabs and shut down anything regarding Acronis.  But I couldn't kill the Acronis startup page.  So, I explored the program, under tools but didn't find any help.  There was an "Options" button, but it didn't work (deactivated?).  I looked under "help", again without results.  I tried "Customer Service" links, but they were deactivated (I wonder why???).  I tried looking though the history of problems others were having, and was amazed that such a new program would have volumes of problems reported already.  So, I went to the control panel and uninstalled the program.  Unfortunately, afterward, the Windows backup and restore functions no longer worked.  I was able to complete a "system restore" and recovered the Windows backup and restore.  I use Windows backup and restore and Norton Ghost, but I'm not going to touch a Acronis product again!  Yuck!	-1
I'll just add another voice to the chorus here saying that this product is a disappointment. It's confusing to use, particularly if you want to actually use it for its intended purpose... what good is backing up if you can't figure out how to restore from a backup?  I hoped Acronis would see all these reviews and make improvements, but I see that the new version has poor feedback as well. There are many products out there to choose from, and there's no need to use one that's as unstable and unintuitive as this one.  The second star is only because I read another reviewer used and loved the disc clone feature, which I haven't tried/needed. At least someone's butt got saved.	-1
Unfortunately, I'm going to have to give this product a negative review.  I have been unable, to date, to get it to install on my Dell laptop (Vista OS) via the disc provided.  I shut down all my security programs so that nothing would interfere with the installation, but it reaches a certain point and then just crashes.  I've been in touch with Acronis customer service and they provided me with a new, downloaded version of the program, but the same thing happened.  I am still in touch with customer service and am trying to figure out how to get the program to install, but right now it is useless to me.  If I ever do manage to get it working, I will come back and revise my review and rating.	-1
This version didn't work on our computer, it wouldn't even load! Would not recommend this old version. Wish I could say more, but it just would not work for our Windows 7 computer. Didn't work on XP either.	-1
In this day and age, it's easier and better just to mirror your ENTIRE drive to another spare drive.  There's no need to have tape-backup style incrementals and such nonsense, which are resource intensive and prone to problems.  Many backup programs already support automatic scheduled mirroring but not true image.  You have to manually click away to do it.  Not good, and for commercial software this is really bad actually.	-1
This program should be banned. It often creates more problems than it is supposed to fix. It will make changes to your computer that will make it unuseable and you will need to be an expert to fix them. I have given up on Acronis, they have no tech support, at least none that answers questions. I suspect they know their software is buggy and not very good so they ignore those users with problems.  I need to make images of my main drive so I was going to try Acronis one more time to make a clone image (exact copy). Now it cannot even find any hard drives on my computer and it has 3! I reinstalled the program and still doesn't work. I tried uninstalling it and cannot even do that! Absolutely no answers from Acronis either. You would be better off throwing your computer out the window before using anything from Acronis.	-1
I don't "hate" this product like some reviewers here. I think the software is decent, the price is not too bad, and it has a neat control panel. In other words, if you've been using Trend Micro for years, and it works for you - I'm not trying to talk you out of it.  The problem for me is, I don't know why I would ever be compelled to buy it. It's inferior to the free options out there. So if you're looking for the best protection, there is no single option that will cover all your bases. But fortunately, the best rated programs are all free.  Here's what our IT staff recommends:  * For Anti-Virus: Either AVAST or AVIRA. Both free, both fairly equivalent in protection, in speed, in program size, etc. They will give you some annoying popups asking if you want to upgrade, but the basic home version is both adequate & free.  * For Firewall: If using Windows XP, 7, or Vista, just enable the Windows Firewall. In tests, the Windows Firewall does as well as others. Never run two firewall programs, as this can cause problems. If using an older version of Windows, use Zone Alarm (also free). Also, your router acts as a secondary firewall (even if you only have one computer hooked up).  * For hijacks, redirects, popups, & malicious web sites: Use HostsMan. This tiny little program (also free) amazingly keeps a list of malicious sites and prevents them from loading on your browser.  * For emergencies: Install these programs just in case - Spybot Search & Destroy, C-Cleaner, & Malwarebytes Anti-Malware. Run C-Cleaner once a week - to keep your system running optimally, to clean up unwanted files, and clean your registry. The other two programs are to run just in case you have a problem, and it's super handy to already have them on your computer in case a virus or hijack is preventing internet access.  So I can't really recommend the Trend Micro, but I'll go ahead and share my experience with it:  -Install was a nightmare process, slows down boot time, bulky program.  -I really don't like the free online backup, because you are forced to renew every 12 months. In my opinion it's a marketing gimmick to get you to renew, when there are many options out there which are better (and free). For important files, I back up manually on Google Docs. For bookmarks, backup on Google Bookmarks. For backup of everyday programs and files, there are about a dozen reliable (and light) programs out there.  -Does not block some of the malicious sites, hijacks, and redirects out there. Instead, make sure you use HostsMan.  I hope this saves you both money & time. Good luck!	-1
Program refuses to install.  Hangs up and stops at about the 80 % point.  My machine is a pretty vanilla Windows 7 X64 with an AMD processor.  I've not had any other programs (of about 25 or so) that fail to install.  Typical lousy Acronis product.  Update:  Tried the trial download of the latest version, still won't install.  The "fix" suggested by Acronis support does not work.  Giant waste of time and money.  If they would just write a program that didn't rely on a large number of Microsoft add-ons and libraries, it might work.  As it is, there is always another reason why it won't install.  Fix one, and another shows up.  Poor program to begin with, and this version will just waste your time.  Suggest something else unless you have a fondness for pain, or need a new hobby.  If you are dead set on using this, I suggest that you download the trial version and see if it will work on your machine.  If it does, and you actually like it, you can by the program and just enter the product key (which is a 64 DIGIT ALPHANUMERIC CODE!!!!!).	-1
I have been involved with computers for 22 years. I am no expert in designing or programing of computers, but I have a ton of experience using computers. In today's world, you should not even think about going online without protection from viruses, or being hacked.  I am a long time user of Trend Micro's line of products, and have had nothing but the best results using their virus protection, and firewall to protect me from all threats while being online.  When Trend Micro brought out this newest version of their program, I jumped right on it. I didn't feel a need to research the product, since I trusted the company 100%. As soon as I installed this program, I regretted doing so.  First of all, it has no firewall protection at all. The company says that their program "enhances" the firewall available with the Windows operating system, yet refuses to give details of just how it does this. Also, many users are having trouble with lost files, and getting the program to allow known websites to be recognized as friendly.  Basically this program is a dumbed-down version of their software, giving the user less protection, and next to no control of how the program functions.  After I decided I didn't want this junk protecting me, I attempted to roll back to the older version of the program. It was a 3 hour ordeal trying to get the software to uninstall. Windows' uninstall program could not get rid of it. Next, I tried to download an uninstall tool directly from Trend Micro, but that didn't work either. I had to purchase a copy of the older version of the program, right here on Amazon, since Trend Micro didn't offer it on their site. That copy had a "Forced Uninstall" tool on the CD, which finally cleaned this newer version off my computer.  Bottom line: Stay away.....very far away, from this program. If you want the best program, from my experience, go with Trend Micro's "Internet Security Pro" program. It's from the same company, but is a top notch program. You can get the program right here on Amazon, at a great price.	-1
I have a new PC with Windows 7 preloaded.  After THREE attempts to install NaturallySpeaking 11 it still will not startup. It is stuck on the "welcome" screen. What a waste. Shame on on Amazon for selling this program. There is NO help from Nuance.  What a shabby way to treat customers. Save your money. DON'T BUY!	-1
I spent too much time talking into my computer only to get so-so results with this software. A year later I get my cell phone and it is awesome. I hope newer versions are better, but I would pass on this one. This was such a hassle, I never use it much after the initial setup. I bought it for my wife and after my setup, she never even bothered trying to use it.	-1
If you have any respect for yourself, avoid this company at all costs. It has no support even though they advertise that they do. You'll get really frustrated trying to get any help from them. If you do buy, buy from Amazon so that they will deal with a necessary return when you discover the software may not work well in your system. And use a Mastercard since MC backs anything you buy. Do not use PayPal...you'll never see a refund for this product when you demand it. At any time in the future you need help, Nuance won't be there. Before buying try to get support as though you own it. Try their Web site then try to call them. The software is not worth the aggravation that you'll get. Please take care. If you have money to throw away, then no prob. If you want your bang for the buck, avoid all Nuance products. I've been through their top six products and believe me, it isn't worth the demeaning nature of their "support." Yes, you're correct. I should have learned years ago...but I started with Strictly Speaking and OmniPage before Nuance bought out the developing companies.	-1
The ability to turn your spoken communication into text is an admirable goal.  Unfortunately Dragon Naturally Speaking Premium 11, even after a few hours of "training" (both of myself and the software) the effort required to produce a few lines of incorrectly transcribed English made this product seem much more like "obstacle" than "aid".  Yes, I tried the plug in headset that comes with the software.  Yes, I also tried the microphone that works perfectly for skyping and magic-jack phone calls. Yes, I spent two hours interfacing with the machine, reading prepared text back to the software and "teaching" it corrections to the mistakes it was making. No, I don't speak with a lisp or use English as a third language after being raised in China or Eastern Europe.  This product would only be recommended for those who are not fluent with a keyboard, or who wouldn't mind scads of errors in their text.  I'm not giving up on the prospect that suitable software may exist in the future, compatible with common PC set-ups.  Truth in advertising: I received my copy gratis as an Amazon Vine Voice reviewer.  Obtained free, I still do not use this product.	-1
It took me a very long time to configure this program and even now I have problems. As with any speech recognition software, you need to 'teach' it to recognize your own speech patterns. I'm still fighting with it even after a month of constant use. I constantly have to check if it interpreted my commands correctly and end up doing about 50% of the work via mouse and keyboard. The rest of the configuration is little better.	-1
No changes in my hardware. No changes in my software (Windows 8). Same word processing (Word). Wish it worked. Wished I hadn't bought it.	-1
I bought this because my brother, who by his own admission is neither a good speller nor typist, recommended it so highly. The reason we got talking about it was that I was curious about some of the errors in his emails, which it turned out he was dictating. Since I am working on several novels and am always open to the help technology can give, I reasonably thought it might be a real boon.  But it is more trouble than it is worth. Not only does it lag behind my not-particularly-fast speech, but it makes grievous errors. I am trained as a radio announcer so am quite precise with p, t and other sometimes-elided consonants and have standard American English, I believe without regional inflection. So the software's inability to decode my speech accurately seems unreasonable. I used it for quite a while and went through many, many hours of training on it, but still I was spending more time correcting its errors than it would take me to type out a tract from the beginning. And of course sometimes I was missing its errors which horrified my editor soul.  Then came Dragon's invasive advertising, not just emails, but popup windows which I thought I had disabled on this computer. Even worse, something kept popping up that claimed I had not registered my copy when in fact I had. It comes with two copies. I wonder whether it wanted me to register both copies so if I switched computers, I'd have to buy anew?  I believe I'll follow another reviewer's suggestion to try Windows' speech recognition software. At any rate, my advice is to steer clear of this.	-1
Really interferes with other programs.  I got rid of this one as I could not stand it blocking other programs.  People who make this program kept trying to get me to buy things from them.  The setup process was really a scam. DON'T BUY THIS PROGRAM.	-1
I have had this item for over a year and finally installed a few months ago.  However, I never got to use it a/c I never could register it.  I may be stupid -- Amazon has a telephone number to call and links to "guide me through steps (on the Internet) to acquire the registration Key."  It came with a key but nothing included in the sticker on the inside of the case works when you try to register it.  Anyway, I got tired of it taking over all of my photos and even anything that was scanned (documents, etc.) and not being able to view the items like I did before like slide show etc with Windows or Microsoft Office.  I never gave the program permission to be the program that works with my photos.  So...I uninstalled it.  Sorry I can't give any info on how it works.  It was weird to me so I gave up.  I prefer the software that came with either my HP ink jet printer or my HP Scanner. Photo Premiere - gives perfect color but I can't find an updated one.  Sorry.	-1
I recently installed this on my ASUS eee Netbook and days later the entire computer crashed. I don't know if Kapersky Anti-Virus had anything to do with it, but if there was a bug, it didn't catch it. I will not being using Kapersky products in the future.	-1
I wasn't as impressed with this software as I was hoping to be.  The files could only be saved as files that only these programs could read...couldn't be saved as jpegs or anything else that would make it easier to upload scrapbook pages anywhere else.  I also like software where I can interchange graphics from one program to another, such as pulling art from the scrapbook program and putting into a photo editing software to make my own creations, and this program makes it very difficult to do that.  I guess the problem is that I like to have more freedom to create exactly what I want, and so far, this software seems very limiting.	-1
There is not much to love with this set.  First of all, you get four separate programs, each with its own installation disc.  That you means you do four separate installs and have to type in four separate very long serial numbers.  In the Photo Album 7 alone, the program was a separate install from the clip art and the user guide, so if you want those, add two more installs to that list (although without 2 more serial numbers).  That annoyed me right in the beginning.  Then, the programs are very light on functionality and limited in options.  The photo program offers no more than I get with the free program that came with my Canon camera, and if I want more functions than that, it tells me I have to buy and install yet another program, Paint Shop Pro Photo.  I was very unimpressed.  The one capability it had that was value-added for me was the ability to burn a disc of your photos; my other photo program doesn't have that.  The paint-it program turns your photo into a painting-like image, which I can see would produce interesting images if you wanted a stylized version of your photos.  I rarely want that; I really want to see my photo in all of its glorious detail.  I already have scrapbooking programs that are more functional than the one that came with this set, which is a little bit tedious and annoying to use.  I selected the "Hip to Be Square" layout and tried to drag photos to the large boxes in the center of the page, but I was not allowed to do that; you can only drag a photo to the boxes labeled "Drag photo here."  This is pretty restrictive in terms of the creativity you're allowed.  The panorama plus is a nice and rather useful program if you don't have a camera that already lets you stitch images together.  Overall, I just felt that I would rather have just one program with all of these functions integrated into it, and I would like much more functionality than these provided.  They could keep the nice user interface and the simplicity and just beef up the functionality without making you buy more programs.  Of the four programs, the one I would most like to see enhanced for more functionality would be the photo program.  I thought I was going to be able to correct my photos much more extensively than this program allows.  On the other hand, if you are a beginning computer user with no existing software that does any of these things, this might be a good choice for you, because the programs are not difficult to use and provide basic functionality.	-1
Corel makes it look like you are getting a good deal because one is getting four products (Paint it, Photo Album, Scrapbook Artist, and PanoramaPlus X4) At first glance one may believe he or she is getting a great deal. Sure the price is more than fair for what you get. The problem I have is the software is not that powerful.  You would be better using Google Picasa for organizing and editing your photos. That takes care of Paint and Photo Album.  Yes the Paint It products does have more filters you can apply to your photos to make them more artistic.  The reality is while it is fun to play with, I only need to enhance my photos. You could also spend a little more and get Photoshop Elements. Even Serif offer free photo editing software if you go to their website.  You can get a good free photo stitcher from Microsoft. Search for Microsoft Image Composite Editor.  I am not a digital scrapbooker but your cost can rise quickly as you buy add ons for the software, which makes the software more expensives  While the product is not expensive I would recommend it to my friends and family because Picasa gives them more than enough feature for free	-1
I've been a computer user for many years - starting with command lines and dos prompts way back in the dark ages. When Windows first came out, one of the programs I used at work was Corel Wordperfect. My home computer was loaded with Microsoft Word and I slowly eased the office towards the Microsoft program, not because there was anything really wrong with Wordperfect, but because there just wasn't enough right about it.  Over the years I've tried other Corel offerings, every time I'm excited by the possibilities and neat options listed on the box, then frustrated and disappointed by the end results. It's not that the program is bad necessarily, just that it seems it's not very intuitive, it's slow loading, laggy, or simply the end result is not very impressive.  Create It had all those problems in spades. For one thing, this is not one program, or a suite of programs, it is a bunch of individual programs that you have to open separately and work with separately. Even remembering what each does (and some overlap) is difficult. I found myself opening a picture in one program, only to remember it wasn't the one I was thinking and have to open a different program to make things happen. Working with files that included more than 20 photos made everything lag so badly it was ridiculous.  The thing is, I use Photoshop. It is not "fun", but if I spend the time to create something, the end result is impressive. I thought Create It! might add some fun to my photo editing, but it's just too cumbersome to be fun, and it's not robust enough to put up with the problems.	-1
I think I got my first version of PDF create 2.0 with my first Xerox scanner about 10 years ago. It was very useful and handy, it helped create PDF file from anything that can be printed. Since then, I have accumulated almost every version of PDF create, most of them came with one or the other multifunction machine or Paperport. But PDF Creator version 7.0 is the slowest and the most buggy.  PDF Create produces PDF files in 3 ways.  1). PDF create 7.0 installs itself as a printer on your computer. Let us say you want to create a PDF file from a webpage, you will print the webpage on PDF Create printer, give the file a name, and it will create the PDF file. This is the way I use it most of the time.  2). It also installs a program called PDF Create Assistant on your computer and you can add the files that you want to make PDF from, say a Microsoft Word document, click create the icon Start PDF Creation and it will turn the document into a PDF file. It works but I rarely use this way.  3). The third way to create PDF files with this program is from that PDF create toolbar in Microsoft office.  I found that to be very buggy, and it crashes the Microsoft Word. I had to uninstall that toolbar.  Instead of making the program better with the newer version, Nuance has made it even slower and buggier. Here are the problems I encountered with this program.  1). It installs with Visual C++ 2005, even though my computer as all newer versions of Visual C++ including 2008 and 2010. I think all of those were installed by one of the other Nuance program. These guys at Nuance cannot get their act together, each of their programs installs a different version of Visual C++, without even checking if the newer version is already on the computer.  2). Unless you choose custom install, it will install the PDF create toolbar in Microsoft office, which crashes the Microsoft office. I would also not install any add-ons to PDF Create 7.  3). At the end of installation, it asks you to register the program, and then the registration screen freezes. I had to press Ctrl-Alt-Delete to get out of that.  4). It also installs registration reminder and update program on Windows Startup, which really slows down your computer. Run msconfig and uninstall those startup programs.  5). The program is still named ScanSoft PDF Create! The name of the company now is Nuance. It tells you how much attention to detail Nuance pays.  6). Nuance has Draconian activation policies. They allow only one activation for each program. Tough luck if you need to reinstall the program because you changed hard drive or got a new computer.  Since there is no law to force Nuance to eat its own dogfood before feeding it to the customers, the market should punish the sloppy companies. I would not buy this program, I think there are cheaper and faster alternatives available out there. On one of my computers, I use PDF Xchange 4 to create PDF documents, it is much more versatile, cheaper, and faster. I use it in combination with scan to PDF, which converts scanned documents into PDF files. And you can download a free version of PDF Xchange to try.	-1
This software allows you to combine files and make those files into PDF's.  (For the record apostraphes can be used to pluralize initialisms. Google it.)  So if you don't want to pay $40 to do that, you can get Cute PDF or OpenOffice for free, and either one is much more fully featured.  If you want even more free choices, go to Wikipedia and look up "List of PDF software"  You will find a list of software broken up into:   *Converters   *Editors   *Development Libraries   *Creators   *Viewers  Save yourself a dime (actually 400 dimes) by doing your homework and you will be doing more wihtout being out any money. Actually, I started your homework for you. :)	-1
I ordered this so that I could convert docs to editable PDF's, but this product does not do the job. I'm so disappointed...but learned later that the product that actually makes editable PDF's is the "convert" program, not the "create" program. Do not buy this is you are needing to convert docs to editable pdf's.	-1
I was really hoping that this program would be easy---it isn't.  It doesn't even follow the booklet you get with it.  The booklet for quick start says you will get the easy screen, but you go right into the advanced edit screen.  On that screen, there are three buttons across the top:  capture, edit and share.  So I chose capture and then you have to select your soucre.  My source is an SD card, so I chose the option closest and that "Import from Digital Media" which brought up a list of everything on my computer.  It was really unclear to me what that meant---I thought I was trying to choose where the captured videos would be stored.  I tried to press the "start import" tab at the bottom, but that was greyed out.  I fumbled with this, then saw in a dark grey print across the top that this was the source for the import.  I don't know why they made it so dark---it's pretty important.  So I clicked on My SD and and nothing happened.  I clicked the + sign on the right and clicked the next one down and so forth, but nothing happened.  There is a little black box between the + and the SD button and if you click there it will check mark the box in red.  So I did that and pressed OK at the bottom.  It said no valid content.  I kept drilling down until I got to a block that had no more +'s.  Here it said "no valid content in the path" and I pressed OK and a content folder with thumbnails came up.  So now what?  I am looking for anythign anywhere and finally on one of those tabs that are in grey at the top---these are not intuitive---the 7th one over will let you import all.  Click on that and then the button at the bottom "start import" will light up and you can click on that.  So now you can look at each clip in an edit window.  One of mine was shot sideways and I just wanted to rotate it---there was nothing anywhere to tell me how to do that.  I'm getting something else.  This is just not user friendly and I don't want to suffer through it any longer.  The import should have (1) followed the booket (2) have screens that make sense (3) and have things celarly marked.  The import should be super easy, and it was not.  I don't have enough confidence in this product to want to go forward.	-1
An utterly worthless forced upgrade from Quicken 2008 (or any earlier version) if you want continued online access to your financial accounts.  Minor gratuitous changes to the UI, and while it's nice that user data is now stored in a single file rather than multiples, it's almost TWICE as large.  Yet another example of the larger problem software companies have when they make a mostly stable, mature product but need to keep increase revenues.  Upgrade only if you must.	-1
I owned Q2008, Q2005 & Q2002 and I used them daily. during that decade, I observed no significant product improvements, just a huge increase in software bugs.  Look up the Q2010 and/or Q2008 products, where I posted detailed logs/diaries of the endless bugs, errors and frustrations I endured as a Quicken user.  In August, 2010, I finally migrated to the Moneydance product and--after the migration and learning curve issues--I find it swims slick as an eel. I wish I'd done it years sooner.  Since at least 2002, Intuit has been using Quicken as a pure 'cash cow' - a product to milk revenue out of, but making no investment in it - while it continues to toy around with other new product developments toward future revenue streams.  The history of the Quicken product doesn't suggest a bright future for Quicken users. Don't get suckered into starting up with Quicken. Go with Moneydance.	-1
Well, I've been using QuickBooks 2007 for my small business, and am a fan of that product: 2007 retail version, and it works quite well!  I was quite excited to get an opportunity to review QuickBooks Pro 2011 - a great chance to upgrade and use all the new features!  But I could never get the installation to work successfully.  I will say I did have QUITE a bit of trouble with this installation: QuickBooks 2011 did not want to install on my computer at all: I am running Windows XP on a 5 year old laptop with plenty of memory and RAM (and incidentally, meets all the minimum requirements listed on the box).  The disc would spin up and begin installation, but would always stall out and fail.  So I went and bought more RAM just in case, and tried again after installing that: still fail.  I took it over to my brother (who runs his own computer business) and he could not get it to work either: he suggested perhaps I had a bad installation CD.  Whatever the case, I am quite disappointed that I can't use or give a 'real' review on QuickBooks Pro 2011, but can only write about a failed installation.  Kinda hard to 'return' a product when you received it write a review...so my review is about a bad installation disc...so sad.	-1
I'm running QB 2008 which is decent. Each time I tried a newer version I had issues either with installation or crashes. Makes you pay for features that should be free!!! LET ME SAVE MY DATA TO MY OWN HARD DRIVE. The one star reviews tell all. Hold off till October when 2012 will be released. Maybe they will redeem themselves.	-1
I have use Quicken for over 15 years and I can't believe how cumbersome and poorly conceived this version is compared to past versions.  The main page is useless and you now have to open multiple windows to get the information you need, then you have to close all the windows you opened to get to the next account.  When looking at a performance page of your investment accounts you get a pie chart instead of a bar graph.  What good is a pie chart when you are looking at performance data over a specific time range.  I thought the purpose of newer versions was to improve the existing version and not regress.  If Microsoft still had a financial program I would be forced to migrate to another program.  Intuit needs to change it's company name because this program is not intuitive.  It is ill conceived and makes for a frustrating experience.	-1
I used Quicken for at least 10 years, going back to around 1990.  I stopped using Quicken about 8 or 9 years ago, due to all the bugs.  Well, I needed something to track my investments.  I needed to know, if overall I was making a decent return.  I don't want it for banking, etc.  I tried Acemoney and Moneydance.  Both of those were unable to download a "starting" balance from my brokerage accounts.  So, I reluctantly went back to Quicken.  By default, Quicken sends your data to it's website.  Turned that off!  I have brokerage accounts with Fidelity and ETrade.  So, far it works ok with Fidelity.  I have my accounts set up for dividend reinvestments.  ETrade goes out to 6 decimal places.  Quicken goes out to 6 decimal places for balances, but only 3 for transactions.  What?!  So, every dividend re-investment ends up out of balance and it makes you put in a place holder transaction for those fractions.  Updating the original and deleting the placeholder is a big pain.  This was a bug 8 or 9 years ago.  Obviously they did not do a good job of testing this software.  If you have ETrade, I would recommend staying away from this product.	-1
Intuit stores some of your information on it servers. That is what these vague sections in the TOS mean.  Otherwise: Would be very useful, if it worked.  The product could be very useful for managing multiple bank accounts and expenses. Indeed, I had a very good experience with it for the first few weeks. Unfortunately, after a few weeks it stops downloading transactions reliably. This is definitely a software bug, because it happens with multiple banks, and I have confirmed that the data sent from the bank contained the missing transactions. As it is unable to download transactions, it becomes virtually useless after a few weeks. I spent several hours reading and corresponding with the technical support about this issue without making any progress.  If it were a working product, I would highly recommend to use it, because understanding your expenses saves a lot more money than this product costs. Right now, it is a fancy excel spreedsheet that requires a lot of manual updates.	-1

It was bad enough when Quicken simply littered your desktop with icons linking to Quicken Loans, Free Credit Reports (which are never free) and a sundry of other financial pay-to-play products. Now they've taken things to a whole new level with ads literally BUILT INTO the GUI (Graphic User Interface: the 'skin' with which you engage with the program). An example: in the new 'refinance calculator' there is a large banner ad for CHASE BANK. The refinance calculator itself is poor and majorly inferior to free ones available online, but more on that later. I don't expect to pay upwards of $50.00 for a piece of software that contains banner ads! That is simply unacceptable. In freeware, I understand it, but not in something I paid full retail for!  Adding insult to injury, INTUIT has actually removed one of the best features of previous Quicken releases, the CASH FLOW monthly chart. They've replaced it with a projected balances chart which is ugly, harder to read, and doesn't convey nearly as much information as the previous version. A line chart is inferior for the purpose, and INTUIT hasn't even managed to make the data points (low and high balance points along the chart) display the actual balance when you mouse over them. This is a miserably bad design--they've managed to take a very useful tool and turn it into garbage.  The supposed new features are junk. The refinance calculator is extremely simplistic compared to far better online versions (check out Equitrend Financial Calculators if you're looking for sophisticated, free calculators). It doesn't allow the user to enter current mortgage interest rate or PMI, and instead makes you enter the total payment and then the "impound / escrow amount." If you have your mortgage set-up to be tracked in Quicken, the tool cannot incorporate that data into your analysis. You must manually enter everything. The tool also does not take into account the tax implications of your refinance. Overall it is a tacked on, basic calculator that is nearly useless.  The obligatory re-skin of the program (which INTUIT trots out each year rather than making substantial or meaningful changes) is adequate, but unnecessary. Every year they tweak fonts, colors, and layout, and design elements. This year is no exception. None of the changes make the program more efficient for the end user. I don't have a problem with utilitarian designs, as long as the underlying software is substantial. INTUIT seems to leverage much of their development budget into GUI tweaks, while doing little to improve the software itself.  Another major issue is that INTUIT cannot manage to keep their data file consistent from year to year. 2011 is no exception and required me to convert my 2010 data file. Admittedly this was much more painless than the massive difficulty many experienced with upgrading from 2008 or 2009 to 2010. I wish that the developers at INTUIT would make a forwards compatible data file type and just stick with it.  SUMMARY:  PROS:  1) Potentially better GUI (depending on your preferences)  CONS:  1) Ads built into the GUI itself  2) Removal of a significant feature (cash flow and balance chart)  3) No substantial improvements to the underlying programs  4) Added 'features' are poor quality, even when compared with free alternatives  5) Requires yet another data-file conversion  6) Expensive! Especially considering the ads built into the program  FINAL THOUGHTS:  What am I getting for my money here? If you love this version of Quicken, can you kindly explain to me why it is worth upgrading? I have yet to find a single compelling reason. Am I missing something or did I just flush my money down the toilet?	-1
MS Money is going to disable some online sync capabilities, so I switched to Quicken to ensure I'd be able to download my transactions.  Quicken will not download any transactions.  It won't even attempt to.  There's an option to "active for one step update".  When this is clicked, the dialog closes and no accounts are updated.  When I try to manually sync my accounts, Quicken will not sync my credit card accounts.  Now I paid $60 for software that is less capable and harder to use than my old version of Money. MS Money was simple and intuitive to setup.  Quicken is not.	-1
Like others have mentioned, when you buy this almost $200 program, you do not get a full package - it is merely a instrument for them to charge you subscription fees.  It reminds me of some shareware programs that disable features until you buy the full version, but in this case you have already bought the full version and they still want to get more money from you!  I'm sort of the "go to" guy in my circle of friends and family when it comes to technical and/or business software and even though I would never spend a penny on this, noticed a friend had purchased this so I decided to see for myself and it only reiterated how disgusting Intuit's business practices are.  Here are a few reasons why you should avoid this program:  Payroll.  The ability to write paychecks and pay income withholdings is one of the most basic accounting tools one would expect from a "pro" accounting package but it is missing from this program.  Even if you do it yourself, you have to pay an extra $200 each year to have the privilege downloading tax forms and you can only shell out the extra $200 for 3 years because after spending $600 in the end of the 3 years, you'll have to buy the newest version of Quickbooks.  Again, this is for DO IT YOURSELF!  You'll print the checks on your own paper, your own computer and all they'll do is give you the tax tables.  They can easily integrate the tax tables in the software but their excuse is that it may not be up to date.  That is a complete cop-out because all they would have to do to fix that is to let you adjust the table if rates go up or down;  besides, they require you to replace the program every 3 years anyway.  They used to offer one free tax table download in the older versions but they wanted more money and they got rid of that. There IS a hidden "manual payroll" option, but even if you can find it past all the ads for subscriptions, they get you if you want to print the forms for the IRS.  Yes, in order to use the same IRS forms that you can download for free from the IRS, you have to pay intuit for their integrated version.  file attachments As others have mentioned, you have to pay to save attachments to invoices in your own computer!  bloatware What was one a simple program now install a ton of nagware that you don't want with no option to shut it off.  no easy way to export They know they got you so they don't have any tools to convert their files to other format.  /*****************************edit**************************************************/ I give up.  Intuit using their "customer retention managers" to pressure amazon to delete negative reviews and comments aside, since the changing of the new social security tax rate (employee end), I can no longer print my tax forms and at the begging of my CPA, I was convinced that I have to get the new version AND since the new version doesn't let you print tax forms without subscribing to ENHANCED PAYROLL AND PAYING EXTRA FOR THE UNLIMITED EMPLOYEES, this $200 program will cost me around $500 for the first year and around $300 each following year until they force me to upgrade again.  This is a MONOPOLY.  So enjoy my money for now Intuit, you have won this round. The time will come when the DOJ hits you with an anti-trust lawsuit, FTA will come down on you for making fake positive reviews, or an enterprising software company beats you at your own game.  ******UPDATE 2***** This is seriously as bad as everybody says.  Nagware everywhere.  I can't even click on a link before getting "interviewed" to see what spam they can sell me.  I've tried removing them but it's nowhere to be found in the options.  I subscribed to enhanced payroll and had to stay on tech support in India for an hour to figure out why the $300 I had just shelled out wasn't working.  Where are you DOJ???	-1
Computer crashed after a month and wasn't able to get codes to reload.	-1
We bought this thinking it would be a way to capture checks written while we were traveling - we have Quickbooks on our home PC, but wanted something lighter that would allow us to print checks, and then import the Quicken results into Quickbooks.  Quicken treats you like an idiot!  First off, it wants to make sure it has access to all your banking - interesting, but not something we wanted, and not something our travel will allow.  Second, everything is dick and jane metaphor, and we are power users.  It was mind numbing working with it.  On Quickbooks, we could open the check register and type in the info and be done with it.  Not so on Quicken - we had to follow a moronic script that took way too long.  We eventually started handwriting checks, recording them in an Excel spreadsheet, and going to the Windows Control Panel and removing this unfortunate purchase.	-1
Quicken 2011 is a powerful financial software program that you can do a lot with. You'll be able to consolidate and organize a great deal of data about your financial picture. One of things you can't do with Quicken, however, is extract that data for use with another program (such as the cross-platform Moneydance) in any kind of reasonable time frame or with any reasonable chance of success.  The only way to get data out of the program is in .QIF format, one measly account at a time. It's worth noting that Quicken no longer supports _importing_ .QIF files for most account types, claiming (in article 3886 on their support site), and I quote, "QIF technology is over 10 years old and was designed for technical support purposes. ... QIF Data Import requires many steps to download, can provide a poor customer experience, and can lead to duplicate transactions and errors."  That old technology is good enough for you should you want to _export_ data from Quicken, however. Intuit is going to make darn sure that you have a "poor customer experience" and suffer from "duplicate transactions and errors" if you try to take your data to any other program.  Finally, Quicken has updated their support information (Article ID: GEN82402) to helpfully list the types of information you can no longer export from the Quicken software in any format whatsoever.  If you ever want to move to another accounting software title, (or even to move from one Quicken Database to another) be prepared to manually re-enter all of the following data types.  AND I QUOTE:  "The following items cannot be moved to a new data file with the import and export procedures and must be entered manually.   1.  Asset allocation information  2.  Budget settings and data  3.  Calendar notes  4.  Category group information  5.  Credit report information  6.  Customized category information such as associated tax forms and lines  7.  Customized Quicken file settings  8.  Debt reduction information  9.  Desktop layout and settings 10.  Fiscal year settings 11.  Investment lot identification information (This information can be lost after the import.) 12.  Investment transaction information. (For ESOGs, all data is lost. For ESPPs, grant period and grant price data is lost. For cash transactions in the investment account, the security name is lost; the export includes only the date and amount of the cash transaction.) 13.  Loan payment schedule information like principal and interest amounts 14.  Saved reports and graphs 15.  Memorized Payee List information (You may be able to rebuild the Memorized Payee List in the new file by pressing Shift while selecting Memorized Payee List from the Quicken Cash Flow menu.) 16.  Payee List in the new file by pressing Shift while selecting Memorized Payee List from the Quicken Cash Flow menu.) 17.  Multi-currency information 18.  Online account information including financial institution, account number, and routing number 19.  Online Center e-mail information 20.  Online Payee List 21.  Online payment information 22.  Online transactions stored in the compare to register window 23.  Paycheck setup information 24.  Portfolio Watch List information 25.  Retirement Planner information 26.  Savings goal amounts and due dates 27.  Scheduled Transaction List information 28.  Historical security price information (You can recover up to five years of historical prices). 39.  Tax Planner information"	-1
Two things I won't use it. After importing from other software, you lose information. Secondly, it's so hard to customize a form. for something in that price range, you'd hope they put more effort into it. It looks like the people at Quickbooks don't have any Mac experts on their payroll. They need to see the light, Mac is transforming the new computing era. Get used to it, quick!	-1
I keep hoping that updates will fix old problems with Quickbooks software for the Macintosh and they don't.  I overpaid, even at Amazon, for a really poor product that has a stranglehold on the accounting industry.  I feel forced to pay for and use this buggy software.	-1
Those who have been using Quicken for any period of time know that upgrades are mandatory, as Intuit starts turning off functionality in older versions as time goes buy.  So every three years or so, I find myself forced to cough up $50 for a piece of software that does substantially the same thing as the previous versions (including all the same bugs).  Quicken 2011 is no different.  Here are the major drawbacks:  1. We continue to be unable to import any file from anyone who has not paid Intuit for the privilege.  Some smaller banks and many 529/401(k) programs do not want to spend their money on this so there is no way to download transactions from those companies directly into the software.  There is not even a simple import format that they could provide for manual import--that has been completed eliminated from the Quicken product.  They should at least provide that so someone could build a spreadsheet for import.  Contrary to Intuit's position, it is not rocket science to build a file with "Txn Date", "Txn Description", and "Amount" line items.  2. The UI unnecessarily provides all its own elements.  That is, it does not use the standard text boxes, toolbars, and so forth built into Windows that you see in a browser form and most other applications.  The result of this is a very slow refresh time every time you switch pages within the product or switch to Quicken from another application, noticeable even on a fast, modern machine.  3. About every six months, an account randomly gets itself out of balance.  TIP:  It is often the very first transaction for the account that has been corrupted--perhaps you started with an opening balance of zero four years ago, and all of a sudden the opening balance is $76.23 or something, so everything is off by that amount.  4. Ads abound.  They are littered across your desktop, your start menu, your program menu, your taskbar, the UI itself.  You cannot even start the application without being asked if you want a Quicken credit card before you can use the program.  I paid for this software--I should not see ANY ads.  5. You are not buying this software, you are renting it.  It will cease working with full functionality in 2014 (or earlier if Intuit's CEO has a bad day at the races).  6. Getting support is very spotty.  Support from Intuit itself generally consists of, "let's try to uninstall and re-install your software and keep our fingers crossed.  If you have to re-enter 15 years of transactions across 25 accounts afterwards, well, that's too bad".  You can get support from the Quicken forums, but unfortunately it consists primarily of "yeah, that happened to me, too--let me know if you solve it" and bombastic fanboys telling everyone else that it couldn't possibly be Intuit's software causing the problem; it is obviously your fault.  Bottom line:  The reality is that the only reason a thinking person buys this software is because there is no viable option, and Intuit knows it, which is why none of this is ever going to change.	-1
Watch out, don't let the name deceive you.  Although Quickbooks is a wonderful package on the PC, this Mac version is awful especially considering the price.  If it were selling for 75% less, I would still slam it but at the price offered here and everywhere, it's an embarrassment.  The worst part for me was the difficulty in money account transfers.  What's the deal here. I had software from the 1990s that could do this efficiently.  The PC version doesn't have any problem with it.	-1
I haven't spent nearly enough time with this to give it a thorough review. But it only took me five minutes to figure out it couldn't do one simple thing that QB for windows has had since at least 2004.  Call it Progressive billing or partial invoicing, whatever you call it is a ridiculously simple transaction that is practiced in every trade and profession, and in some is the prime transaction.  Simply put, you can create an invoice from a sales order or estimate, etc. In windows you can invoice for part of the sales order or combine multiple sales orders onto one invoice. In the mac version, NADA. One more time. You can't bill someone for part of an PO. It's all or nothing.  When I was looking around the support forums on intuit's site, I came across a posting about someone complaining that intuit left this feature out of the QB 2010 for Mac. An intuit Product manager chimed in that "it wasn't left out, we chose not to include it because we don't think our customers require this feature. but if its important to you you should send in a feature request." Nice.  What's incredible is that we aren't talking about some hugely complex function and ultimately it boils down to QB 2011 for the MAC is going to be of very limited use to a very small number of businesses.  Oh by the way, 2011 still doesn't support creating an accountant copy, so good luck with that too. Intuit has got to be the worst/last company that still makes crippled versions of its products for macs. Honestly I don't know why they even bother.  Its less work to use boot camp or parallels than try to workaround all the limitations of mac versions of quicken products.	-1
If you are using Quicken 2009, 2010 - make sure you read all the reviews of this product before you watch you money flit off screen !!! This high-cost low-value product extension still has the inherent weaknesses of the prior versions - incompetent file handling for investments, inability to recognize the new symbols for options when downloading, constant problems with financial institution interrogation, slow to load and process, and the visual impact of a bowl of week-old spaghetti. If you do buy this, either because you are forced to by the end of MS Money or the auto-obsolescence of you prior version of Quicken, be sure to construct a new category for your expense under "Waste." It isn't tax-deductible, but still more satisfying than seeing it categorized under "Software" or "Office Supplies" or "Miscellaneous" or just "Personal."	-1
There are so many bugs in the software it is extremely frustrating to use.  Many of my accounts it will not download transactions for.  Some investments accounts it has all by stocks, but show a total of $0.  Combined with the inconsistent downloading, it's almost impossible to reconcile the accounts.  There is no support at all. I have wasted hours searching forums only to find that many people have the same problems, but no answers.  Microsoft, please bring back Money.  It had none of these issues.	-1
It gets tiresome to have to keep updating Quicken every few years because they prevent you from downloading stock prices.  The graphics are a little better but the functionality has gone down compared to Q2008.  They no longer give you performance on your investments as a quick tab but have to no go through the menus to access this information.  The performance reports quicken 2011 gives has less info than 2008.  What they do give you more of is their adds to buy their products, most of which you can get for free if you do a little investigation.  You can often get free online banking and bill pay through most banks.	-1
I know, giving a product one star because it fails at one feature that not every user needs may seem unfair.  But everyone knows Amazon's rating system is utterly subjective -- and for me, this one failing on the part of Quicken Deluxe 2011 is extremely annoying and devastating.  I had been using Money 2006 for several years.  As everyone knows, that product line was discontinued due to lack of demand.  I decided to get Quicken Deluxe 2011, which promised Money file compatibility.  While waiting for Quicken to arrive from Amazon, I uninstalled Money 2006 to reclaim some disk space.  To my great distress, I discovered, upon launching Quicken, that Money must be present on the system for Quicken to import the Money file!  According to the dialog box, "Microsoft Money 2007 or 2008 must be installed on your computer before we can import your Money file."  Okay, so maybe Money 2006 wouldn't even have worked, so it probably wouldn't have made a difference in my case.  But this is just absolutely ridiculous.  My Money file has no password protection, and I just don't see why Money is required to be installed for Quicken to read the file.  So I decided to give Quicken a spin anyway to see if it was worth my time to start from scratch.  When I clicked on that big "Get Started" button, Quicken started downloading an updated financial institution list.  After 10 minutes, it was still doing the same (the status indicator was simply moronic and indicated little).  I stopped out of that, and clicked "Get Started" again, this time Quicken began downloading a program update, but then nothing happened.  At this point, I decided to write up this review.  One other thing I also noticed is, after I ran Quicken for the first time, my quad-core PC, which had always been zippy and extremely responsive in everything, has begun to show some random slowdowns, which reminded me of the days when I ran Symantec's awful Norton Anti-Virus software.  I really wonder if Intuit installed some background services that have a significantly negative impact on my otherwise optimized system (Win 7 64-bit).  As you can see, my getting-started experience with Quicken Deluxe 2011 has been entirely negative.  I regret having wasted almost 40 bucks on a competely useless program.	-1
if i look over the history of quicken upgrades, it seems the only "real" upgrades happen every 3-4 years. the 2011 upgrade seems to be one of those instances where all you get are a few cosmetic changes, but nothing really useful. the big "feature" of 2011 is a projected cash flow graph? that has been in quicken for years if you use calendar view. i guess the fact that 2011 uses a line graph virsus bar graph is big news. save your money and wait for a future upgrade that really is an upgrade.	-1
I owned Q2008, Q2005 & Q2002 and I used them daily. during that decade, I observed no significant product improvements, just a huge increase in software bugs.  Look up the Q2010 and/or Q2008 products, where I posted detailed logs/diaries of the endless bugs, errors and frustrations I endured as a Quicken user.  In August, 2010, I finally migrated to the Moneydance product and--after the migration and learning curve issues--I find it swims slick as an eel. I wish I'd done it years sooner.  Since at least 2002, Intuit has been using Quicken as a pure 'cash cow' - a product to milk revenue out of, but making no investment in it - while it continues to toy around with other new product developments toward future revenue streams.  The history of the Quicken product doesn't suggest a bright future for Quicken users. Don't get suckered into starting up with Quicken. Go with Moneydance.	-1
If Quicken 2011 is anything like Quicken 2010 it runs like a 7th grade science project. It misses transactions, the interface is confusing, the screens are amazingly amateurish, account lists take several tries to assemble themselves. I could go on, but any of you who own the program, know what I'm talking about. With the loss of Microsoft Money, Quicken is the "last man standing". Too bad that man is walking wounded.	-1

Not happy with this upgrade. Upgraded from Quicken 9 to Quicken 11. Been a very happy Quicken user for many years. Quicken 11 is missing the cash flow tab/function (in/out/whats left). It was a very key function in Quicken for me. Intuit says it will see about returning this function it in a future upgrade/update. Had I known this I would have not purchased this upgrade. Beware of this upgrade if you want this function. Its gone!! Shame on Intuit.  Update 12/4/10 to this review: Quicken has updated the program with update R4 which brings back the cash flow tab. It is now beter than ever. It has to be customized to a tab function. This tab can now be customized to the users needs. Thank you Intuit!	-1
Here's an example of how lousy Quicken is:  After using it for many years, and for several months on this version, I suddenly had it hanging up my PC about 75% of the time when I started it and entered my password for the data file.  Hours and hours were spent with Quicken "support" (who blamed Norton Internet Security) and, then, with Norton support (which is nothing short of stellar!!!).  Then, back to Quicken support (again, dealing with an Indian who had bad English).  The final answer is supposedly that Quicken does not work reliably if you have the file on any disk drive other than the C: drive.  Are you kidding me?  I've worked with it for years on my data (F:) drive.  And, so, I looked everywhere I could to see if it said anything like this in user guides, on-line help, etc.  Hell no!!!  These guys have created a piece of junk, full of little "gotchas".  Here's another:  They will make your software suddenly stop working, because they have decided it is too old.  Yes, they kill it.  Oh, you can still *run* it, but it will no longer interface with banks, etc.  Nice, huh?  If you haven't gotten in bed with them, I suggest trying to find an alternative...although there seem to not be any left out there.  If you do buy it, then fasten your seatbelt, because the ride may be rough...and their "support" is a bad joke.	-1
Not really much I can say about this other than on a Windows 7 64-bit machine it did not work at all.	-1
It's a strange world. Despite being what most lay-people would think is the also-ran to Adobe products, Corel has apparently decided that doing the right thing by customers is simply not important.  I'm speaking, of course, about the Protexis Licensing service that they install, without user knowledge, that runs as a service in the background. This is the service they use to prevent piracy, and without it you cannot run the program. Further, as others have pointed out, the user agreement is draconian.  It's too bad - the software is a nice alternative to Photoshop Elements, and if they were a more customer-centric company I think they'd win converts.  As it stands though, with the EULA and spyware they install, this is unusable to me. As an aside, I did try to use X4 when it came out, and was unable to get it to install on ANY of the three machines at my house.  Corel: if you want customers, deal with the poor coding, the invasive EULA, the horrible Protexis module, and start acting like you care about people that buy your products. Until then, I don't see you getting out of the one-star basement.	-1
I have the limited edition with exclusive bonus pack which provides "over $250 in extra value" of a 2FB USB flash drive, KPT collection plug in, Corel Painter Essentials 4, and Corel WinZip 14.5 Pro. Mine came with a short quick start guide (which was too bare bones to be helpful) and a small page size 137 page paper guidebook. The fact that Corel issues different packs, some with a user manual and some without is something that some customers are upset about.  I own and older edition of Photoshop Elements (a less expensive pared down version of the professional Photoshop) and am used to PS Elements. I will note that PaintShop Photo Pro X3 is the same pricing as PS Elements and from what I have been able to figure out, the two programs are very similar in content as well.  Before I tell why I am dissatisfied I'll share my opinion that if you already have a photo editing program, you probably should stick with that product and buy updates as you feel are necessary. There is a large and painful learning curve when moving from one software to another. I just learned this the hard way. The terms are different, the process is different, and it's just too painful to put oneself through unnecessarily. I am asking myself why I bothered to want to try PaintShop Photo Pro X3 when I was happy with (my no longer latest version of) Photoshop Elements. I guess I was thinking maybe this was better and why not get this and stop using PSE? I'm sorry I wasted my time. Before I say why I don't like this program I'll give more info.  I am looking for very basic photo editing tools. I take photos with a DSLR but am more into the actual taking of well composed and well lit photographs than I am into spending hours of my time editing shots.  What I want photo editing for are some simple things such as: cropping photos, resizing photo files to make them smaller when necessary (i.e. submitting photos to newspapers and websites), to remove red eye, to make a soft edge on a photo and perhaps to adjust an overexposed or underexposed photo.  Regarding projects, which this software does, I'm honestly not sure how I would use this. When making a photo book I would make it right on the site that professionally prints the book. When I make a photo Christmas card I make the soft edge on the photo right on the warehouse store website.  When I make a photo calendar I used the warehouse store's website to create it from home on the internet, and they print it and I pick it up at the store.  I have a six month old computer PC: Windows 7 Premium and an i3 processor. It is not yet clogged up with too many files and had plenty of room on it for new programs. Installation was easy and took me about 90 minutes only because I would walk away and realize there were many steps and it was waiting for me to keep clicking more boxes.  I was confused though, over having to install multiple programs all from the same CDROM, and was unclear what the differences were between: Paintshop Photo Pro X3, Project Creator, Painter Essentials 4 and KPT collection (that one I did not even bother installing). I did the registration online; there were no phone numbers for me to call. Some reviewers mentioned ads on the screen, I saw no ads. I have over 30,000 photo files on my hard drive at the time this was installed. I don't understand why other reviewers are saying it took hours to load this software given the number of images on their hard drive.  The instruction manual was promising offering 4 ways for new users to learn to use the system: the Corel guide, the Learning Center palette, the help system and web-based resources. Despite this seemingly wonderful array of options when it came down to figuring out how to do something as simple such as resize a photo to scale it down to 72 dpi I could not find the answer. I still can't figure out how to see if it saved the file as jpg or if it is saving it with some other format (i.e. raw, gif). I was annoyed that searches with common keywords such as `resize' turned up no results. I could not find any of this information in the user manual either.  When working to edit a photo I was annoyed that multiple images I was not using were lined up at the bottom which it randomly pulled off my hard drive, it was distracting. I am used to working with a program where the only thing on your work surface is what you have chosen to work on right now. I found that I could adjust the viewing box to get larger that pushed those off the screen.  The absolute worst thing about this program which is why I am uninstalling it and giving up is ---- the program over-wrote my existing program to view photo files that were already on my hard drive. When I try to open a photo by clicking on the file on my hard drive, it opens in the Corel Instant Viewer which is a piece of garbage that first pauses for 2 seconds doing nothing while it loads, then it shows an image for 2 seconds in a pixelated blurry mess before sharpening up to view it. Moving to the next photo using the arrow, such as to view photos you took on a certain day, takes 4 seconds to load each photo and my eyes go crazy with the sharp to blurry to sharp to blurry images. I cannot stand this Corel Instant Viewer.  It is impossible to quickly click through the photos. My old software from the Canon camera would instantly load with no pause and it would immediately be in perfect focus. This thing that Corel has is ridiculous.  After spending 4+ hours installing and trying to edit one photograph to just crop it to zoom in, reading the user manual and the online help, just trying to get one photo to convert to 72 dpi and jpg format, and not being able to figure it out, I give up on the program and am going back to Photoshop Elements. The simplest editing task should not be that difficult to figure out.  At at the very least a photo program on a brand new, high speed computer should not take 4 seconds to load one photo image and make us look at it for 2 seconds blurry first - there is no need for such madness.	-1
There is a lot of functionality here, which makes it an acceptable program for photo editiing.  The menu is easy to access, and there are not very many mystery icons that force you to guess.  I can do all the basics like fix red eye, cut out portions of photos, airbrush, and easily sync and manage my pictures in one location.  It is far from perfect though.  The loading time is over 40 seconds, which is way too long for a mid-range photo editior program.  There are at some key functions missing.  I cannot resize images pieces that I've cut out, which my free Windows Paint program can do.  The image review carousel is also too small.  I have a 20 inch screen, and most of my images have to be viewed as a small thumbnails instead of midsized photos.  Fix these problems, and take out the spyware, and we will have a 5 star program.	-1
I travel as a tourist  a lot and have bought a super zoom camera to take pictures.  The computer I process and store pic on is seldom on the  internet. I therefore cannot use the program without the internet on.  I have to buy another software.	-1
The only good thing I can say about this is that it comes with an ancestory.com trial. The previous versions were better. The menus and options have changed, and not in a good way. Things that used to be easy are now convoluted. I would not recommend it.	-1
I'd taken a long break from my genealogy research, so I had no idea that my former favorite software was now produced by Ancestry.com. After loading it I began to wonder what had happened to what I'd felt was the best program out there. The learning curve for the software is steep, it's not intuitive at all. It was so frustrating to have to try to remember the steps over and over again to get to the different pages I needed. Ugh. The program seems to be designed now to be a big advertisement to Ancestry.com. A great site and all, but I don't need to be continuously reminded of it. I felt like they broke what didn't need to be fixed, and looking at the reviews of the past versions, this year's is an "improvement" but they need to go a lot further. The free months subscription is nice and all, but they really need to make it more user friendly like the Broderbund versions of Family Tree Maker.	-1
I thought this software would make it easier for a total novice to get started in genealogy.  Nope. All it did was succeed in making me frustrated.  I quit & never tried again.  Too complicated & too confusing.  There has to be better software out there.	-1
A concise review:  THIS DOES NOT WORK WITH WINDOWS 7.  Not an uncommon problem, just contact the publisher for support/upgrade, right?  WRONG.  Poor customer service to me means avoid this product.  It should be something to be used for years as a personal research tool and resource, but how could you rely on the publisher to support you?	-1
My biggest complaint was that the  installation failed on Windows 7.  I tried jumping through hoops and it wasn't happening. I was able to install the program on an older laptop with Vista and it loaded fine.  As for the program itself, I have to admit, I'm not all that impressed. Maybe I expected too much?  You have to still save your own files separately as the program will not do it for you. To me, it was as if someone handed me a blank scrapbook and said, "Here, now fill it".  I am glad to read that others enjoyed the program.  Unfortunately, I wasn't one of them.	-1
This product is secure and super-easy to use. It allows to to upload, store and share large files quite easily. Files are encrypted with 256 bit AES - nearly military grade encryption.  This alleviates some issues with file sharing. Normally email can't handle large files. Also encryption and decryption is handled for you.  The standard subscription lets you store a maximum of 2GB of storage and 40GB of downloads. This is pretty limiting for some applications. For example - graphic artists, videographers, and other creatives might have the need for a lot more space. There is a Pro plan which allows for 8GB of storage for a higher fee.  Buyers should be aware of how much space they may need and plan ahead.  In my mind this service is WAY too expensive. Dropbox (for example) provides the same level of service for free (and you can get 250MB of storage for every friend you refer). For a little bit less than this basic level of service, Dropbox gives you 50GB a year.	-1
This works fine... but is unnecessary.  You can use online free products like yousendit.com and sizeablesend.com and many others (just google).  It would be fine if it allowed huge downloads but you are limited to 2gb and you pay 120 a year.  I can't tell what people have downloaded.  I see no benefit to this except that it automatically zips.  If you use the free products and you have more than one file to send, you zip them into 1 first.  This does that automatically.  Big deal. Just highlight the files and right click compress files and you have zipped them.  you don't have to pay all of those dollars for this product.  It seems to work online anyway.	-1
I looked forward to trying this product, but the serial numbers didn't work to unlock the main X5 Suite. I Tweeted Corel and they responded back promptly (with an email address for contact). I emailed all the serial numbers, saying I can't unlock the main suite. Days later, I STILL haven't heard back.  If this has happened to me, I have to wonder if it will happen to someone else...(And yes, I tried typing the serial numbers several times. The WinZip one worked, but not the main suite).	-1
Norton sucks do not buy	-1
I hadn't used a Norton product in a while since the last version I'd had (around 2003) caused massive crashes on my computer.  So I decided to give this one a whirl assuming that after almost 10 years they might have ironed some of these problems out.  Now I can't speak to the virus protection because I didn't attempt to intentionally infect my computer to test this skill.  What I can tell you is that once this product was on my computer the processing speed decreased dramatically.  Then programs started acting screwy.  Things wouldn't open, or would open and not connect to the internet.  Some functionality seemed to not work on some of my programs.  Then it was constantly updating itself and slowing the computer even farther.  After about a week of being installed this was removed from my computer (not an easy task let me tell you) and I went back to using my free AVG.  I don't have much high value stuff on my computer and I don't frequent places that would make me prone to viruses in the first place.  Perhaps if I was running a company and needed a heightened level of security the hassles might be worth it.  For me, the decrease in processing speed and the on again off again functionality issues made this a "no go" in my book	-1
Well, I'd tried all I could to get this to work on W8 or W7, it simply won't install. Couldnt install on W8 beta, nor Win7 but DID get it on a fresh install of XP with SP3. Scan time of 2TB drive, all files 700MB-2GB each, terrible 45 minutes scan time.  Uninstallation? FORGET IT. Took me an hour deleting everything I could find left over in the registry after uninstall.  Same old Norton. I hate it.	-1
well, I'm in the middle of a month before my virus definitions subscription expires. so, Norton has pleasantly given me notices every frickin' day to remind me that they're expiring. you can't turn this off. it interrupts whatever you're doing, regardless if you have more improtant things to do. Their customer service is no help. This is like forced SPAM on an espresso blitz. so, think you'll like Norton? go for it. enjoy. no, really.	-1

Autodesk Sketchbook Pro 2011 wasn't compatible with my version of MAC.  If I knew that from the start I wouldn't have gotten it.  I am getting a new computer soon and I will try again.  But from the looks of it I'm sure it will be fun.  I can't wait to try it out again.	-1
The only good part of this software is that it transferred the information from last year correctly. Many of the prompts and explanations are incomplete at best, confusing and misleading at worst. Kept dropping my entry for insurance deduction. Miscalculated the health insurance deduction. Would not print the form to attach for signature required by the IRS without a lot of messing around (had a "Print" button but it didn't do anything). Could not trust the outcome without manually reviewing every form/calculation. I could have entered the data on paper and mailed it quicker than using TurboTax Business 2010. Also, it automatically popped up an Internet Explorer window to review the software (which I did, of course) but when the final submission screen came up for the review it said it was for tax year 2009, not 2010. WAY TO GO Intuit!	-1
TurboTax Business 2010 has still not fixed bugs that have existed for several years.  In fact, I cannot tell that there is a single improvement over prior editions.  I think Intuit is milking this product for profit rather than investing in it.  For example, for corporations, the Form 1120 defaults to assuming that someone owns 20% or more of the firm, forcing the listing of such people on a form G.  As in years past, you must switch to forms mode, uncheck the box (never offered in the interview) that says someone owns more than 20% of the firm, and then manually delete the G.  The most infuriating thing about the 1120 is that as of yesterday, March 13, you could neither print nor e-file the return - which is due on March 15 (!) - because the TurboTax forms were out of date.  Yet, the iRS released the final 1120 forms on March 1.  How could it possibly take a vastly capitalized corporation like Intuit more than a day to make whatever minor adjustments were in the final forms?  TurboTax did update itself today, March 14, to allow for filing.  Infuriatingly last-minute nonsense.  When e-filing the 1120 today, now that the forms are available, I chose ACH debit (as opposed to EFTPS) to pay the tax due.  On the confirmation screen, TurboTax confirmed that I selected EFTPS (not) with an edit button to change it - clicking the Edit button took me back to the screen showing ACH and the bank routing/account numbers/etc.  Just one of a dozen or more glitchy buggy things.  A cosmetic bug, but one that is disconcerting, is a screen under Federal Review that just says "This is Heading Text / This is a Subheading"  (screenshot posted with product images above).  Clicking the Federal Review tab again gets the correct page, but, really.  For trusts filing 1041, expenses allocated to income are still not allocated, by default, to interest and dividends (etc) by pro-ration, as is done by most tax preparers, not is there a question or checkbox in the interview to allow for that.  As in years past, all expenses are subtracted against interest, fully, first, then dividends/other income.  You have to switch to forms mode and find the checkbox to manually check to do the allocation as desired.  K-1 allocations are also not complete, with Foreign Tax credit not properly allocated to the beneficiary.  These are just a few of the issues in this clunky, never-improved, Intuit cash-cow.  For folks who are not tax nerds, you should have any return that is prepared by this software reviewed by a tax professional.  Foolish me, I keep buying this each year thinking that it will improve.	-1
The interview is fine, it usually takes you where you need to go, BUT!  line items have no link back to the data source, so you can't figure out what the software is doing and if you entered data correctly at an earlier step.  After I efiled 2010 taxes, I discovered that the 2009 software never carried forward passive losses and thus they were not captured on the 2010 software.  BIG MISTAKE TURBOTAX.  TT also could not handle a 401K partially being rolled into a traditional IRA and partially into a ROTH IRA.  It is nearly impossible to get to help on their web site,  Their pricing seems very deceptive.  You never know how much you are going to pay.  Every time you turn a corner there is a new place to charge you.  Let's be honest and UPFRONT about pricing.  Bottom line, if you have basic taxes, you will probably be ok, but if things get difficult, your experience will get very difficult and quite possibly your results will be wrong.	-1
I can't believe how Intuit is putting out such poor products.  Quicken 2011 is a waste and now Turbo Tax.  I have used both products for many years and was usually satisfied. It seems like they streamlined the questioning during the program.  The data transfer from federal to state was incomplete and I had to manually enter the data.  After calling the Pennsylvania Dept of Revenue the tax person stated that they have had a lot more problems with Turbo Tax this year.  I takes forever to start the program and I don't know for sure what Intuit is doing with my information.  When I called the Quicken Tax expert they didn't know the answer to my questions or about the problems of the data transfer.  They said they would get back to me the next day ( they never did).  When I called in again, that's when they said I would have to manually enter the data.  Then they said my tax problem was too complex and recommended I get an accountant to answer my question.  So much for their expert tax advice !!!	-1
I've been using TurboTax for two decades.  Just purchased and downloaded 2010 Premier.  It will not install.  Generates an Error Code: 1326.  Went to Intuit support.  They are aware of the issue but have no solution.  No Amazon buyer protection or refund.  The software download site is Amazon by name only.  Kind of like the Android Market.  Problem?  Not our problem.  Zero support.  I'm running Win 7.	-1
I have used this program for two years and just bought V1.2 as a renewal for my three computers.  (It's been upgraded X times.)It has never made any of my computers crash, and while it does take more than one click to use, it is easy both to install and to use.  I think it works as claimed, but the Police have never taken in any of my computers for criminal investigation.  (THAT'S A JOKE.)  Actually, Windows Cleaner One Click does more than erase sensitive files, it seems to keep my computers running at good speeds.  I'm retired, live alone, and don't much care if my files are viewed by anyone else.  I just want my computers to run properly.  With this program, and Kaspersky's Internet Security, I have never had any computer/Internet interface problems.  But, you pay your money and you take your chances.  UPDATE 2/6/2012  After using this program for years I let it lapse for two months.  When my computer suddenly started taking more than 2 minutes to boot-up, I renewed my subscription ($9.99).  They downloade4d an update making it version 7.09.  The problem is it still takes me more than two minutes to boot.  Furthermore, other things I thought would be fixed was the section supposed to erase Invalid Registry Items.  It is presently identifying 82 items, and it indicates that they have been removed.  But when I check through "More" and "Win-Reg" in the program, all the items are still present.  Then when I try to delete these items, two more come up that were not included in the 82.  When I think I am erasing these items the screen shows the message that a back-up of these files has been made.  Okay, so I then have either erased them or placed them into some back-up file and have rid myself of them.  None is the case: The next time I run the program all 82 are still there.  I must ask: If the program tracks and identifies Invalid Registry Items why is it that I cannot get rid of them?  In the previous version I could get rid of this stuff by going through all these steps.  When I wrote the original Review I gave the program a CLASS 5 vote.  It is still possible that using this program is doing something beneficial.  Is it actually clearing off Temp Files, Junk Files, etc from my hard drive?  I just don't know what it is really doing.  But it is clearly evident that the program is not as good as it should be.  UPDATE 10/15/2012:  I am now running last update - version 12.18.  When I run the One Click program it states that I have over thirty one Megabytes in my Internet Clutter file.  I click on confirm and it is supposed to erase all checked files that it has claimed to find.  I close and reopen the program and it is still there.  Then I click on the MORE and click on Win Clutter, check all boxes, and remove manually.  Same result.  Thirty one Megabytes of clutter is still there.  Next, I reboot my computer and run it again.  This time the same and also Windows Internet Junk File finds over one hundred and thirty Megabytes.  But I just restarted my computer after cleaning everything.  I had not been on the net.  Honestly, something is clearly wrong with this program.  I don't know what it's doing.	-1
There is so much that can be said about what makes a great security software. The software has really changed overall. First they are actually installed in the computer. But now, they are trying to be more external by USB port, than just installing it in the hard drive. I have heard the Fix Me Stick recently, and honestly it does not deliver as strongly by sucking the viruses and Trojans out of the computer. But all of this has came to the beginning with the Win Cleaner, the As Seen On TV device which is less expensive, but honestly provides much less security overall to protect you from any damage. Honestly when I had used it, I wasn't impressed with it. I really found that my computer really did slow down, and was still infected with viruses. I definitely didn't find this to be a must buy. To be truthfully honest with you, I would really suggest that you do stick with a Anti-Virus program for the money, like BitDefender or McAfee. This security software isn't worth the money.

GUEST REVIEWER  ! MRS KNOW IT ALL ;b  This software package gives you a lot more for your money.  AVG internet security 2011 software will protect your PC from malware, malicious sites, spam filtering and not tax your computers speed.  The best part is that this software includes free identity theft recovery service and a PC tune-up utility (free one-time usage, then you have to pay).  I like the ability to at least be able to see what the tune-up utility will find----then I can run it once and then look FREE software to do the same trick.  The things I don't like about this software is that this software is not that good at removing detected malware, antiphishing is not that accurate, and the sets can be complicated to set up.  I don't think I could trust this product to give the full protection I need, so I am going to pass.	-1
Our daughter tried multiple times to put this on her notebook, and was unable to complete an installation.  She got error messages, and even crashed.  Bad disc?  Most likely, but it's pretty hard to review something when it won't work.  Sorry AVG....  (I will say that my wife has been pleased with the AVG free antivirus over the years.  The ONLY actual infection of her computer - and it was bad - came several years ago when she was still using Zone Alarm.  We've since moved WAY beyond that product!  She's had AVG (free) ever since, with a Comodo firewall, until very recently.)	-1
In a few words: after trying out this product I was not persuaded that I actually needed it and I removed it from the computer on which it was installed. And here it is why.  - As a Windows 7 user I am perfectly happy with Microsoft Security Essentials, a free product that does not expire and therefore does not spam me with renewal reminders that I need to renew my subscription soon. To my knowledge, MSE works on Vista as well but I'm not sure about the XP. - There is very little if anything that  AVG offers that is not available 'for free' from other sources. For example, Windows 7 and Vista already come with their own firewall. All Web browsers come with some built-in Phishing protection and most public email providers have near-perfect Spam filters. Another worthy feature that AVG provides - the ability to flag 'dangerous' sites is either supported by browsers natively or can be enabled with free extensions. - Some of the claims on the box (marketing) can be quite funny. For example, the writing on the back of the box states that AVG provides "Hassle-free security that won't slow you down**" But, when you go to the ** fine print it reads "All security software uses memory and processor power and can therefore result in slower system performance." Another claim is that AVG 'keeps your information safe' while shopping and banking. I expect that the banks would dispute that banking is less safe absent AVG as for the overall safety of 'my information', the leaks usually originate from hackers or other agents attacking/accessing or demanding 'my information' from the banks and AVG can't protect me from that.  Considering the above, I see no reason why I should pay for features and services already provided for free by my computer's operating system, browsers or email providers AND go through the hassle of annual renewals and slow down my computer in the process. If AVG offers anything 'extra' when compared to whatever I get from MSE/Chrome/Gmail, it must be very little because I didn't notice it while AVG was installed. The 2 stars rating (means "I don't like it" and in this case "I don't need it") is justified because, in my view, paying for an AVG one-year license can't be justified.  ___________________________________________  SPECS  System requirements - minimum requirements with 'recommended' requirements within ()  - Pentium 1.5 (1.8) GHz - RAM: 512 MB - HDD space: 390 (510) MB  Compatible with:  - MS Windows XP - MS Vista (32/64 bit) - MS Windows 7 (32/64 bit)	-1
It may do a good job at detecting viruses, but let's face it, if running an antivirus program throws so much junk on your system and slows it to a halt, how is that much different from just installing a virus?  OK, it isn't quite that bad, and I put it on a 3 year old Vista PC rather than messing with my nice Win 7 PC, but the slowdown over Vipre was very noticeable.  When a scan starts, the computer just stops.  I almost thought it was crashed when this happened.  It didn't catch any security threats, but that's because Vipre had already kept that PC clean in the first place.  I do like the website warnings before you click on the site, but if you have a good AV program running, it will catch the problem in time anyway.  In summary, this program looks nice, but it is way to system heavy!  The addition of add-ons, toolbars, etc. is inexcusable for a security program!	-1
If you've spent much time on PCs this past decade, no doubt you recognize the familiar 4-color AVG logo from their wildly popular AVG Anti-Virus Free Edition. The free edition has been downloaded at C-Net's download.com an incredible 356 million times.  This is their full-featured suite, the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/AVG-Internet-Security-3-User-2011/dp/B003WT1KFA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">AVG Internet Security 3-User 2011</a>. It's a breeze to set up, and just as easy to use.  Most all the features are configured for you right out of the box, and the features operate in the background, even the updates.  But there is a serious Achilles' heel for AVG. I'm always sensitive to resource usage of programs, especially multi-tasking programs like this one, and that's is where the AVG Suite falls behind.  Ten separate AVG processes are running in Task Manager, and the system speed slowed considerably.  I've tested Bit Defender Total Security 2011 and I use Norton 360 at work, but not even a noted resource-hog like Norton drags down performance like this. There were noticeable lags in bootup and operation, even on an advanced system such as mine, 2.66 ghz Quad-Core with 4 gb memory.  If you're system is equal or less powerful, I'd recommend against this product.  Two stars for ease of setup and use.	-1

This year we opted to use H&R Block Premium & Business instead of TurboTax Deluxe and TurboTax Business, due to the many problems we have encountered with TT software year after year.  At first, we thought the H&R Block software was less buggy, and had less problems, although the user interface and interview portions are somewhat Spartan in their design.  Immediately after Efiling our 1040 return this evening, we noticed a glaring error in our HRB printed return.  The HRB software had calculated a lower refund that it should have - it opted to use the default option of the Itemized Deductions rather than the higher Standard Deduction, and our refund could have been $630 higher.  Put another way, nothing in the HRB software warned us to take the higher Standardized deduction and we missed the little check box as we passed through, and did not notice that the lower itemized deduction had been applied instead.  When I contacted HRB Support by phone this evening, they were apathetic, and did not seem to care about the problem I pointed out to them; about the obvious design flaw that should have been caught during the error check process at the end (as is the case with TurboTax by the way). I asked for the call to be escalated to a supervisor (Edwin) whose faux courtesy did little to soothe the pain that this is the first time EVER that we have had to file a 1040X Amended Return.  He REFUSED to ESCALATE my quality issue to the QC department and REFUSED to give me the contact number of the corporate office to report the problem we encountered, refused to have someone follow up by calling me tomorrow, and did not even provide a mailing address to write to the corporate office about an easy-to-fix problem, a problem that will cause us several extra hours of refiling the Amended 1040X return.  Also he refused to refund my purchase price or to honor their "Maximum Refund Guarantee" as detailed on their website.  Apparently, their guarantee is worthless, just pure marketing BS.  Bottom Line:  DONT BUY H&R BLOCK PREMIUM & BUSINESS!  They do not care about the quality of their software and they don't care about their customers either.  Worse, their Customer Support agents are poorly trained and incompetent know-nothings to boot.	-1
Kaspersky Pure is a new all-in-one package from the Russian anti-malware veterans, combining security with backup, parental control and tune-up modules. If your anything like me, you care about 2 things.  First will this program bring my PC to a crawl and second, does it work.  At first glance it looks like an attempt to hop on the Norton 360 bandwagon, but as the seemingly clean front-end opens up into a rabbit's warren of subpanes showing statistics and configuration options, you realize it's a more complex, less novice-friendly program.  So if you not that strong technically, STAY AWAY from this program.  THE GOOD Good collection of security tools. Good with antivirus, smart firewall controls of access for applications. Full remote management over network.  THE BAD  The software bluescreened our test computer, which is BBBAAADDDDDD but Windows was able recovered our PC. Access control feature will blocked both malware and valid programs which could be a pain if you don't know what your doing.  BOTTOM LINE Not user friendly and it bluescreened our test  pc.  Pass and look at other options.	-1
I've been using Office heavily since the 1995 version and always considered it one of the best products MS has ever produced. Starting in 2007 they introduced that horrid Ribbon interface which completely replaced the traditional and intuitive drop-down menus with a confusing jumble of icons spread amongst different tabs. Almost immediately the user base was divided between people who like the ribbon, and people like myself who can't stand it. In the years since I've been forced to use Office 2007 and 2010 at work, I've gotten used to the ribbon to some extent but I still hate it. In addition to that, newer versions of Office introduced a new .docx file format which Office 2003 does not support. This change strikes me as a blatant attempt to force users to upgrade in order to share documents with users of Office 2010.  Office was a victim of its own success. Office 2003 is superb, it does everything I need it to do and more, and it does it well. Office 2007 and 2010 take the same basic functionality and change the user interface and file format for the sake of change. So long as Microsoft continues along this path, I will stick with Office 2003 at home.	-1
...unless you just must have the latest version. But without an upgrade-path pricing option, not sure this is worth the cost of full retail pricing.  Download time will depend on how long it takes your broadband provider to deliver the 665 MB executable. This is the only variable out of Microsoft's control. The things they could control don't add up to a compelling reason to upgrade from any earlier version of Office.  The interface is essentially the same tabbed interface from Office 2007 (that probably still stumps previous users of Office 2003 and earlier suites).  Installation on a desktop computer(4 GB RAM, 3GHZ Intel dual core processor) running Windows 7 Professional and with an existing Office 2003 Professional version already installed took about 20 minutes. Installation was trouble-free. While the document history entries in the Windows start menu were erased after the install, the recent documents history were available within each of the Office applications. I don't use Outlook for email at home, but do use it for calendaring. All of my existing entries were preserved and displayed immediately in Outlook; it also recognized my existing preference to start Outlook in the calendar view).  While the interface is familiar, application launch time is slightly faster, and there is improved feedback to users on recent files accessed in a navigation pane that appears under the File tab.  So, with a familiar interface, a problem-free install and apparent improvements in navigation and responsiveness...why 2 stars? Because the Office Professional suite is very expensive. The only reason I'm doing this review is because I had access to a deeply discounted purchase price via an educational licensing agreement. But if you are currently running an earlier version of Office, I can't offer a single compelling reason to sink anywhere from 220 dollars (for a product key to activate the trial versions on new PCs) to more than 400 dollars (for a version delivered on DVD).  If you have very basic productivity suite needs (Word, Excel, PowerPoint) you can consider the stripped down "student version" instead for much less...if your needs don't include Outlook, Access or Publisher. Alternatively, if you have an affiliation with an educational institution that has an academic licensing arrangement, you should have a access to a very reasonably priced Professional version.  Otherwise, unless you're just a "current version junkie" who enjoys having the latest and greatest version of every application, all, I can't offer a good case for spending this much on a set of tools that looks, feels and performs almost exactly like its predecessor.	-1
Current Office 2007 users won't find any surprises in the 2010 version: the interface is the same tabbed interface that remains a mixed blessing --at best-- for those who were experienced users of Office 2003 and earlier versions, and are still a little awkward with the tabbed/ribbon interface. Even with minor tweaks, Office 2010 offers essentially the same user experience as Office 2007.  Installation of Office 2010 on a desktop computer(4 GB RAM, 3GHZ Intel dual core processor) running Windows 7 Professional (and with an existing Office 2003 Professional version already installed) took about 20 minutes. Installation was trouble-free. Although the document history entries in the Windows start menu were erased after the install, the recent documents history were available within each of the Office applications. I don't use Outlook for email at home, but do use it for calendaring. All of my existing calendar entries and display/printing preferences were preserved and displayed immediately in Outlook; it also recognized my preference to start Outlook in the calendar view).

This suite is overpriced no matter how you slice it, and the lack of an upgrade price and package --which Microsoft touts as "simplified"-- makes it more so.  If you have very basic productivity suite needs (Word, Excel, PowerPoint) you can consider the stripped down&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/student-version/dp/B00337D8U6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">"student version"</a>&nbsp;instead for much less...if your needs don't include Outlook, Access or Publisher. Alternatively, if you have an affiliation with an educational institution that has an academic licensing arrangement, you should have a access to a very reasonably priced Professional version.

The 2007 version was a huge disappointment and more expensive than the package price.  The most significant expense came with the manditory retraining on use of the inefficient ribbon menu.  2010 is the prior version with few valuable enhancements.  I had hopes for something better, but the menu is still not optimal.  We're looking into OpenOffice given its favorable pricing ($0.00) and more intuitive menu layout.	-1
well, I'm in the middle of a month before my virus definitions subscription expires. so, Norton has pleasantly given me notices every frickin' day to remind me that they're expiring. you can't turn this off. it interrupts whatever you're doing, regardless if you have more important things to do. Their customer service is no help. This is like forced SPAM on an espresso blitz. so, think you'll like Norton? go for it. enjoy. no, really.	-1
In installed this on 2 computers and the computers were running at about half speed. the services that were running in the back ground were incredible. it was a memory ram hog!! Internet was super slow too.. it was like others had said - like dialup.  I called customer service and the person on the other end was kurt, rude, and not wanting to talk to me at all.  I dislike the software, the customer support, and the product. Everything. Im beginning to doubt these types of sftware.. and think maybe they are guilded malware.	-1
Before installing this anti-viruse my computer was runnning fine, it was really fast and performed excellent. Unfortunately I ran accross this Norton 360 and all changed. My system, overall, is significantly slower, especially when Norton is updating. The protection is fine but it does slow down my machine. I switched to Kasperski and that problem was solved completely, no more performance issues.	-1
Feb 2013 Update Renewed Subscription Now it crashes. Does not work with Outlook 2013.  BEWARE!  *** I switched from McAfee to Norton.  I now get tons of spam.  Lots of spam consisting only of Chinese characters.  No way to stop it.  Endlessly clicking the "spam" button but to no avail.	-1

Everything was running along swimmingly on my HP desktop prior to the installation of Norton 360 version 5.  I'd previously had&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Kaspersky-Pure-3-User/dp/B004DTLWZ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Kaspersky Pure 3-User</a>&nbsp;on this machine, both of which I obtained as part of the Amazon Vine reviewer program.  Kaspersky Pure had been on my PC for three months and I'd noticed no problems with it - doesn't hog resources, unobtrusive - however it can be a bit slower than I like on the scans. I've avoided Norton products for approximately 6 years because they've proved to gobble resources, however after reading lots of positive reviews for the product, I jumped at the chance to give it a try through Vine.  Installation of this product was super fast!  Under 3 minutes from the time I put the disk in the drive until it was installed.  Automatic Update (Live Update) didn't start automatically, but I manually upgraded the virus updates and scanned the computer with the quick scan.  No issues were found.  I attempted the full scan, but found my PC kept dropping into sleep mode, which stopped the scan.  I decided to abort.  After looking at the dashboard of this software I was mighty impressed with the offerings, and looking forward to added features not found on Kaspersky, such as Facebook Wall scanning of links.  I tried it and it seemed to be working, but it said 'scanning' for hours... and finally I got tired of it and stopped it.  The features are rich in this software suite as outlined by other reviewers, however I found it tough to get all of them to work for me.  I did run the Norton 360 Registry Cleaner - something I usually do with free software; Glary Utilities or CCleaner, after running a quick scan.  This may be the root cause of the crash that happened later.  Happy with the software initially, I installed it on a second machine - a Win 7 laptop.  Both machines have been upgraded to Win 7 from Vista 64-bit, and neither had pre-existing problems prior to the Norton installation.  The laptop is my back-up PC, and I've not played with it since installing Norton and running the Live Update.  (I hope it fares better than the desktop - read on.)  This morning I fired up the desktop and it seemed less smooth in opening Windows than usual.  Once open, I didn't notice anything fussy though and did a quick check of email before heading to the gym.  Came home to a black screen.  Usually that would mean it was in 'sleep', so I tried to wake it and realized it was awake.  Then I thought... monitor must be dead.  Check its connections and power - it was fine.  After troubleshooting as best I could without a monitor I shut things down and restarted.  I was able to get the opening screen giving me options like 'boot sequence', which is when I grabbed my Windows 7 Rescue Disk that I made when I upgraded.  I booted to the disc drive and did a system restore prior to Norton's installation.  Problem solved! PC is back and Kaspersky Pure is back too. Less feature-rich, but stable.  I'll keep Norton 360 on the laptop until it crashes that one, but I'm disappointed in Norton once again, and it's probable I'll avoid them for the foreseeable future.  I'm an intermediate to advanced PC user who has tried over 20 different software utility suites in the past 10-12 years, and while I really, really wanted to like Norton 360 for all that it promises, I can't and won't recommend it to anyone due to its problematic instability.	-1
My NIS 2010 subscription was running out, so I purchased Norton 360 from Amazon.  After installation, I received an error message, then was directed to online support.  I followed its directions then got another error message. Called Norton Support (S Asia).  Spent 30 minutes with their representative going through the same troubleshooting I went through, then finally uninstalled and reinstalled N360. Still same error message.  I was then connected to a support supervisor who uninstalled and reinstalled at least four times.  Then he started to mess with the registry files.  He decided that N360 didn't removed the previous version of NIS properly.  On the next uninstall-reinstall cycle same error message.  After 1:10 with me, he then proclaimed it must be a W7 problem, eventhough NIS was working fine yesterday and haven't had any issues with W7.  He is now reinstalling W7 and will call me back in an hour.  What a joke!  I had hoped Symantec got its act together.  Looks like I am wrong!	-1
It's a great fallacy that the best way to learn a foreign language is the way that babies learn it, i.e., through total immersion.  This is because:  1.  Babies don't have any other way to learn language; and 2.  Babies' brains are wired for language acquisition in a way adult brains aren't.  (BTW I have a degree in Linguistics, so I'm not just making this up).  Rather than trying to teach how to use Spanish, the program just plunges you in by giving you random words and phrases by categories (countries, food, etc.).  There is no attempt to distinguish between commands and statements, teach verb forms or anything else you would learn in any high school or college language course.  So you might memorize a few statements, but you won't really understand what you are doing.  Then there's the pronunciation (and some of the grammar and word choices as well).  It's Castillian Spanish, which is only spoken in Spain.  Spanish varies from country to country, but for anyone most likely to be using Spanish in the Americas, learning to speak with this pronunciation isn't really helpful at all.  If you just want to learn a few words and phrases for a tourist trip to Spain, then maybe this program is okay.  To really learn the language, you are better off paying for at least one term of actual classes and putting in the time with a decent Spanish textbook and doing the work.	-1
i got this for my son who wanted software for learning Spanish.  I speak spanish fluently as well as English.  This software is crapware... if you want something to help you learn Spanish, look elsewhere.  My son, after checking it out, has never used it further and I don't blame him.	-1
Wow- OK, I admit that my comparison of online/digital language courses is being compared to Rosetta Stone, but as an educator in general, this program is awful. They teach you words at random (not in word sets), verbs are non existent in the beginning phases, and the voices and illustrations (not photos) are boring (very elementary in drawing style). For $30 you are paying them tp package and ship this junk to you... not to learn a language. If you are looking to truly learn a language in a natural, tested, setting online/digitally I would strongly recommend the Rosetta Stone series. I learned more in an hour trial version of Rosetta Stone than in an excruciating hour of this one. This product is very much NOT recommended for beginners or for anyone who wants to learn Spanish or any other language.	-1
I received a review copy of this software.  I was excited because my wife wanted to learn some Italian.  Unfortunately, this product isn't going to be the method that gets her there.  The software doesn't install on the computer.  With the cost of storage being so low these days, and with effective compression algorithims for audio (.mp3) and video (.mpg) that reduce file size, there's no reason to create a software product that runs from optical disc alone.  Even on a fast PC I built (AMD Phenom II 1100T 3.3 mhz hexacore processor with 8gb DDR3-1600 RAM, running Windows 7), the product takes a long time to switch between features, either because of the inherent slowness of optical disc access times or because you have to swap discs out to use different features.  Once upon a time, that was par for the course.  Now it's simply frustrating.  As others have commented, the interface leaves a lot to be desired.  These days it isn't hard to come across people with talent for graphical and website design, and there are dedicated software tools that make the process simple.  Unfortunately, none of those people or products appear to have been involved here.  This could be fun for younger users, but it doesn't have much staying power for the rest of us.  I haven't used Rosetta Stone, but I have to imagine it puts this product to shame.  In some instances, you get what you pay for.	-1
I've been using Microsoft Street and Trips 2011 and I am not too enthusiastic about it. It does have some added value over online mapping solutions. However, it also has a lot of issues and in the end it is not a product I would pay for.  It is easier to create detailed multi stop routes using Microsoft Street and Trips 2011 than using online mapping solutions. I especially like the "Find Nearby Places" feature. The Microsoft Street and Trips 2011 application also has a lot more options and settings and it is easier to personalize. It is nice that you can work off-line and save your plans as a document, reload the file, update the route, save again, etc.  You are also supposed to be able to download your routes to your GPS device. This would be a nice feature if it worked. However, I have never gotten this to work. I have no problem downloading maps and other features to my GPS devices from, for example, the Garmin web site and other sites. However, I get "device not detected" no matter which Garmin GPS I use, and no matter which USB port I use, and no matter which computer I use, despite the fact that all USB ports work and my Garmin devices have no problem communicating with other sites.  The Help does not contain anything helpful, and none of the on-line information I found was helpful. I tried a number of things that did not work. Microsoft thinks it is the vendor who should inform you whether the GPS device is compatible with Microsoft Street and Trips 2011 and the vendor nearly dies laughing when he hears that. Basically, customer support does not exist and you won't get any help, and it simply does not work. Well, I know that some lucky people get this to work but from reading forums I know this is a common unresolved issue.  Anyway, other things I do not like is that Microsoft Street and Trips 2011 is notorious for freezing up and the route path on the map is way too thick and ugly and I did not find a setting to change it. I also don't think the maps look that nice. Between the online mapping solutions (Google maps, MapQuest, Bing, etc) and my GPS devices Microsoft Street and Trips 2011 adds very little value and with the issues I don't think this product is worth its price. That's my two cents.	-1
I have last year's version and previous years as well. I attempted install on a W7 computer and the install failed. Tried it on another (different model) and the install failed there as well. Checked nonlinear with Microsoft and there are no listed install problems with Windows 7 in general.	-1
Yes, you could sit and prepare your trips like this but it's utterly boring doing it in my opinion. I like the Google maps much better and since that feature is free, I don't see the point of paying for this. It works off and on in my computer (it has some bugs), but it wouldn't install on our laptop at all and since that is what you are taking with you on a trip, it is useless for us. I would recommend a guide book and a street map over this, but I'm sure there are some that would find this of great help (the very patient ones who are willing to work with it). I was disappointed with the whole program.	-1
Was unable to download "Corel VideoStudio Pro X4 to my WinVista laptop, subsequently acquired the "Ultimate" version and truly did wish to have the opportunity to test it, however, no matter how I tried it would not install to my HP Win Vista Laptop; each time an error 1935 window popped up with a suggestion to call help & support for more information. I subsequently made the point to read the EULA and, sure enough, there's an indication the program will not work w/Win Vista. So be it. And I am not happy, as others have noted regarding information obtained by "Corel" through use of the program.	-1
I picked up this package to help edit and combine home videos taken on a DVC HD 1080p recorder and I thought my q9300 quad core 4gb ram intel machine with a ATI 1900XTX would be adequate for movies editing.  I'm running Windows 7 x64 and my system is stable... running a Highpoint 0+1 raidset for fast storage.  After loading the software and attempting to work with 60 minutes of HD video, I found the product sluggish and often delayed in response, even though perfmon wasn't showing disk wait time or high utilization.  Lockups when processing video were common, and somtimes I lost my session detail and had to start over.  I like the menus and ease of use, but either it's my older system or instability running the 32 bit app on a 64bit platform causeing problems..  Perhaps they will improve performance and stability in future patching.	-1
First impressions count - and my first impression of Corel's Video Studio Pro X4 is definitely negative. I have a long history with this product, going back to its days as Ulead's video editor. It was flaky then, stayed flaky in the occasional upgrade I've purchased and remains flaky in this most recent version.    I needed an inexpensive video editor for another computer and I am up to my license limit on the other packages I own and my earlier VideoStudio packages are not Windows 7 compatible. This is certainly cheap enough, but true to its own traditions, it is not ready for prime time.    For example, I tried to open two MP4 files created with the ArcSoft video product. Corel VideoStudio Pro X4 gave me a file mismatch error. However, Apple QuickTime, Avid Studio, Adobe Premiere Pro, Cyberlink PowerDirector 10, Avif Pinnacle 14 HD and Windows Movie Maker opened the MP4 files without difficulty. I noted in Corel's support forum that there are many reported problems identical or closely similar to mine. To me, that means sloppy coding and inadequate beta-testing and quality control, the same problems that have plagued Ulead/Corel problems for years. Oddly enough, Video studio Pro X4 would open other MP4 files created with the ArcSoft product.    Next, I wanted to record from a DV source. Video Studio Pro X4 recognized the source, played the audio but would not display a preview of the video. I finally got it to work, but don't ask me how. The problem occurred on numerous occasion making VideoStudio very difficult to record with.    I don't know what other unpleasant surprises are in store for me with Corel Video studio Pro X4, but based on past experience, there will be no shortage of them. On the other hand, the product is cheap - in more than just price - and this particular need doesn't require much more than the minimal capabilities.    Overall, my initial impressions are negative. Should further experience change my opinion, I will amend my review. My advice though is that unless you absolutely can't afford a better video editing product, avoid Corel Video Studio Pro X4.    I continued working with VideoStudio for another day and my impression has now solidified: it stinks.    Repeated difficulties connecting to a known good DV device. Crashes so severely that the Windows 7 computer it was hosted on required a reboot. Usability is low with basic editing commands buried deep in the manual. Single frame key shortcuts, for example, are buried in the manual instead of in tooltips.    My opinion: Corel VideoStudio Pro X4 is to be avoided.  Jerry	-1
Microsoft continues to behave in a fascist manner by arrogantly assuming it knows better than the user what their needs are than the users (even experienced users) do.  Then as if to add insult to injury when a deficiency is identified, they steadfastly refuse to address the issue.  Arrogant assumption: Windows 7 will, unless you hunt down and change a setting, decide to delete icons on your desk top that it deems are broken links on your desk top WITHOUT ASKING.  There are times when you may be working off line or the link to a network connection may be temporarily unavailable.  Windows 7 will simply disappear the desktop icons to these links.  They are NOT in the recycle bin, they are gone for good.  To prevent this you need to disable a system maintenance setting (that Windows 7 strongly advises against doing).  Failed execution: Windows 7 backup feature does no maintenance of old backup files.  XP would delete the oldest files on your backup drive to make room for new ones (Mac OS does this too).  Not Windows 7.  No sir, the user has to go in and manually delete old files when backups fail due to insufficient disk space.  I have to now go in DAILY and delete backups on my 500 GB storage drive because Microsoft refuses to fix this "feature" (they have had complaints about this since Windows 7 was introduced).  Also, back up scheduling is SEVERELY limited over what it was in XP.  So WHY do I continue to use Microsoft products?  My business environment requires it.  Why did I go to Widows 7? Because XP support is going away and Windows 8 is completely business unfriendly.  RECOMMENDATION:  If possible, go Mac OS.  Its code isn't bloated. It runs quicker. It is more stable. It has user friendly features.  It works.	-1
I am a serious user of desktop computers and have been for a long time. I own a small graphics company, small publishing company and I write for a living. I upgraded recently to a 64-bit 8-core unit that I built with the help of a software tech engineer. I've never purchased a "brand name" computer except years ago when CPM was the hot language of desktops. When DOS came along I started building my own. Each new upgrade is always a challenge since software makers are using more and more space to write less efficient software. That is, they dump the parts of software that are really useful and replace them with "cute" stuff that takes one, two, three or more mouse clicks to get to or uncover or work with than it did before -- and it always takes up much more space. Win 7 is an example of an upgrade that I refer to as a downgrade. I have been using XP Pro Professional 32 bit for a long time. I tried to install XP Pro 64 bit but it was totally chaotic, so I had to move into Win 7. I purchased my copy at Amazon. Frankly, I'd prefer to return it as "broken," since I think it's a piece of junk. Apparently those who design today's working software (OS and other software) don't actually use it to make a living. In other words, they aren't self-employed and they don't find themselves relying upon a software to be efficient (time is money made or lost, depending on the amount of time a project takes). Certainly, those who designed everything after XP aren't using what they design to make a living . . .they just design stuff that looks cutesy. Take the icons in Win7. No more lists without large icons next to them and we can't make them smaller. No more Windows Explorer, either. Oh, they say they have it, but they don't. What  they have in place of WinExp is a piece of junk that probably works on an iPhone but not at all well on a desktop. I have this brand new high speed, 32 gigabyte RAM computer and it's SLOWER than the one I'm writing this review on. Yes, I have reverted to my 4 gigabyte RAM, 2-core, XP Pro computer when writing or cruising the Net or doing low space requirement work with graphics. On top of Win 7 being inefficient, Adobe has decided to change their software as well. I'm using CS6 on the Cloud with Win 7 and it's taking longer to get things done than with my older CS2 in XP. An example: Adobe dumped their extract from Photoshop and replaced with something that's, Yup, "cute." It doesn't extract well at all, though, so I have to keep this CS2 in this computer and do all that work here (Win 7 doesn't like CS2). Win 7 64 bit also demands a high price for replacing all software from the 32 bit, so even though they tell you that you can use the compatibility mode, it's a lie. Yes, you can install into it, but it runs at the same speed as your older computer whether it's 2-core or 4 or 8 core. Compatibility simply means yes, you can install here and using the (86) mode you can run it.  Bottom line is, there's way too much to list here that doesn't prove efficient once Win 7 is installed. I should have written every single major bump in the road down, but I didn't. I just packed up the computer and placed it into my wife's office and said, "You now have the world's fastest email computer." So, we have four computers here. Hers with Win 7 and all the rest with XP. Too many programs would not install and we lost the use of three peripherals including one printer, and two scanners.  So, we'll keep on working with old nuts and bolts on three computers and hope that someday, somebody will design fast, efficient, non touch screen OS software that really works and works with all our software. Microsoft has always been empirical about what they deliver to us, this Win 7 is an insult and of course, Win 8 is not even a suggestion for PCs.	-1
I have been trying for six months to burn Blu-ray DVDs with the most recent version of Toast.  My current burn has taken three days, I have had to start over 3 times because it stops encoding.  I am running the newest version of Toast on a brand new iMac, so there is no problem with lack of memory or processing speed.  The Toast program is just junk.  UPDATE: I recently had to make CD copies of a private music performance.  Toast took 45 minutes PER CD.  I had to burn 100.  I switched to iTunes, which copied the same CDs in 5 minutes.  If possible, I'd like to give this program 1/2 star -- and that would be generous because I can't think of anything positive to say about it.  UPDATE MARCH 2014: Roxio just updated the software.  Hard to believe, but it is now WORSE!  Creating video compilations does not work at all.  Roxio Media Player is gone.  I have had 12...  yes TWELVE... crashes of the program in the past 24 hours.  Looking for another brand of software.  Roxio is treating Mac users the same way Intuit does with Quicken: they don't care.	-1
Tried installing this and it never worked right for us.  Always froze or would not even install.  We don't have trouble with other software on our Mac.	-1
I understand that software is not always released fully bug free. Heck, I come from the whole of IBM PCs so I know that to be a fact. The problem for this software maker--Roxio is that Mac users expect better. They expect that when a program says it is going to do something, that it just works. The sad fact is that every time I used this software, some glitch got in my way of being happy about the outcome. I would always update the software before using it but while the bugs switched, they never fully went away. You are left feeling that you wasted money on an item that will never been truly usable. I used it 5 times before I uninstalled it to never use it again.  So I recommend using Toast version 10 or another product over this Toast 11. This toast is so burnt you never get the taste out of your mouth, no matter if you are a light user or a professional. If you do purchase it, plan to watch it like a hawk, update it and follow their forums.	-1
I really hate giving bad reviews because I know I am only one person out of thousands who have tried a product, so someone somewhere must have something nice to say about the product. Not this one.  This software is pretty much like paying $80 for a feature your computer already does. We're not big Mac users in this hose, preferring to stay with Linux, but we do have friends who like to use Mac and clients who need repairs done who run Mac, so we're familiar enough with it.  What really gave this one star was the fact that in order to record HD, you need a separate purchase. And IT CRASHES, EVERY STINKIN' TIME! We haven't gotten this frisbee to do anything besides mess up the computer enough to have to shut it down.  Great concept, but read read read the reviews before you buy! This product is not good.	-1
My experience with this software is fraught with frustration which ultimately led me to uninstall it. It's doubtful I would ever buy another ROXIO product at this point. In theory, burning DVDs should be relatively easy, after all, the DVD is pretty standard these days, and BY DEFINITION, Apple uses standardized hardware (I'm not starting a flame war, but suffice it to say that there are pros (standardization) and cons (the Apple Tax) to that practice), so Roxio doesn't need to make their software compliant with every single DVD burner out there, just those that come in Apple machines. In theory at least.  Installation completed without a hitch, and upon launching the program, it looked as though the software was going to perform as advertized. Except that every single time I started a DVD burning project it would hang. It didn't matter what media I used (I tried several different disk) or what I was burning (I tried doing just one 2 minute file to see if that would complete) the burn would fail midway through.  A product that fails this miserably at one of it's primary features is hardly worth my time. I don't want to spend hours troubleshooting software that clearly has major bugs. If I were the only one with this issue, I might consider that the problem is with my machine and not the software, but my 12 years of computer experience (including a professional level of aptitude at both hardware repair and software and OS troubleshooting) tells me that it is this software and not my computer. I can burn DVDs through Apple's native software, including picture slideshows, DVD movies, and DATA cds. I can do none of the above with this program.  Read all of the reviews of those with similar issues, and ask yourself if its worth plunking down the money on a product that MIGHT work. Will you be one of the lucky ones? Also ask yourself if you want to do business with a company that is intentionally opaque about whether Toast 11 supports burning HD content to standard DVDs--if you want that feature be prepared to pay even more for something you thought you were getting all along. I give my money willingly to companies that provide a good product at a reasonable price, advertized correctly and detailing what the program will and won't do. ROXIO doesn't fall into that category. Thankfully I received my copy for free from the Vine program, so financially I have lost nothing but my time. Consider the above before you spend your money on this product--I hope to save someone not just time buy money as well.	-1
I had trouble with the installation, but somehow got through it on my own. But when I went to actually use it and came across some questions, the customer support was horrible. They seemed to think that just because it installed (unlike for some other people here, it sounds like) I should be grateful and not bother them. The product itself was buggy, crashed, and generally inferior tom anything else I've tried. Save your money.	-1
I have been a user of PowerDVD since version 5.  It was light years ahead of the competition. I was looking forward to 11 not for all the fluff that Companies that use to sell these days (3D, Control with your iPAD) I was more interested in the 7.1 sound.  The 7.1 option is not normally available in the free versions that come with your Bluray drive.  The interface is crowded with a bunch of other junk.  You need to go through all the settings to get it some what usable. After I got the player working the way wanted to, I have some problems with the software freezing on some Blurays.  My Computer setup is Win7 X64, I7-2600K, 16GB RAM, and a SSD so I know it is not my setup.  The Blurays also play fine in my regular bluray player  I have since stopped using the software because of the frustration and cannot recommend to purchase the program.  When you buy a bluray drive make sure  it comes with software  I gave it two stars because it does play most blurays	-1
If you need to watch Blu-Ray movies or want to watch all your SD/HD movies in 3D then CyberLink PowerDVD might be the product for you. It also has nice slideshow features and a well organized interface. It can play music. I think it tries to be too many things at once. Perhaps that is because I have a routine already established. I use VLC (free) for watching visual media, I use Google's Picasa (free) to organize and view photos and I use Apple's iTunes for my music (free). Nothing about CyberMedia's PowerDVD product is compelling enough to make me want to switch from my routine. If I had an overwhelming desire to consolidate all these activities PowerDVD might be the choice. I don't and I don't understand why it's called PowerDVD. It should be called PowerMediaManager.	-1
Installed on: Win7x64, Radeon HD 5850, 6GB RAM, i7-920 PC  <a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/PowerDVD-9-Standard/dp/B001UP241M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">PowerDVD 9 Standard</a>&nbsp;was included with the Blu-Ray drive in my PC.  800MB of hard drive space, installed desktop gadgets, and six different programs loading at every startup screamed bloatware but it did do a decent job of playing DVD's and Blu-Rays after some tweaking so I decided to see if v. 11 was any better.  It's not, by a long shot.  While installing, I encountered some of the annoyances that should not be in 21st century software.  This includes a requirement that we enter a "Company Name" in addition to our own name, installation of services like "CLHNService" and "Spark Media Server" that run even when you're not using the software, and an insistence on connecting to the Internet immediately after installation.  When I allowed the program to connect it crashed.  I reboot the computer, start the program a second time and it connects to the Internet to download what appears to be commercials and movie trailers.  I turn off all the "connect to Internet" options but it continues to connect anyway.  So basically you're buying a program that bombards you with movie trailers without your permission.  This is unacceptable to me.  I try to play a music CD and it crashes.  Try to play a DVD and a large grey box obscured the screen so you couldn't see the movie. Did anyone at Cyberlink beta test this program?  Download a 100MB patch dated 9/1/11 from Cyberlink.  The patch installed properly, but I was worried it wouldn't because it acted like a regular installation and provided no indication it recognized the previous installation.  Post-patch it still attempts to connect to the Internet every time I start the program; including accessing their "Mooovies" service that I specifically told it not to install.  Here's the laughable part.  I still can't play CD's.  Why?  Because prior to installation of PowerDVD 11 I uninstalled all previous media players and codecs on my system.  I wanted to give it the ability to do a clean install so I even removed Windows Media Player.  Turns out that was a mistake because every time I try to play a CD it says it requires Windows Media Player to function properly.  I tested out their photo slideshow and the picture quality looks nice but their toolbar keeps getting obscured by the Windows toolbar as they fight one another for the top of the page.  Cyberlink throws in a few gimmicky options like a sliding motion as it moves from one photo to the next.  This started to give me motion sickness so I tried turning this option off in the settings. It ignored me and continued to do it anyway.  No editing options whatsoever; I can't even delete a photo.  So that's PowerDVD in a nutshell.  It boasts cool features like 3D, ATI Streaming, Tru Theater Mode and more but it can't get even basic functions to work properly.  Worst of all it takes up resources even when it's not being used and it connects to the Internet without providing a reason why or asking your permission before doing so.  I uninstalled the program and it left garbage in "My Documents" and "Public Documents" and the system registry.  Plus my system started generating errors and crashing uncontrollably to the point where I had to revert to a hard drive backup.	-1
Unfortunately, I must agree with the other reviews. The installation was nightmarish and sloppy. Additionally, I found the program to be invasive ... it consumes too many resources for the very little that it does.  After a few hours of tinkering, not only did I remove the program, but then I used CCleaner out of paranoia. (Something about this program feels frightful unrefined. I wonder if this was properly beta-tested.)  Yes, this product is inexpensive. However, why not invest just a little more and purchase a better program? This one will only leave you with frustration, a headache, and a lighter wallet with nothing to show for it.  Mine is already in the recycle bin. And, maybe if Cyberlink didn't follow every review here with a boilerplate post (or any post at all), it wouldn't feel quite so desperate. (Hint, hint.)	-1
buy this and I assure you three days you will have a virus on your machine. I think it may  come with a virus in it, blossoming upon installation.	-1
I recently upgraded to Kaspersky 2011 on all six of my Windows computers.  Five are running XP and one is Windows 7.  All of them stopped running I until I finally gave up and uninstalled Kaspersky 2011.  "Kaspersky support" is an oxymoron.  There is NONE!  When you try to find Help they take you to a web page that encourages you to upgrade to 2012 (free).  I tried it but it produced the same problem.  The culprit is a program called AVP.EXE.  It takes over 99% of the processor cycles and more than 400 MB of memory (RAM).  That sure keeps the viruses away!?  Nothing else can run in that environment:  no virus and no program either.  The computer becomes worse than useless.  Kaspersky 2011 and 2012 have wasted three days of my valuable time while I diagnosed, tried to repair and finally had to uninstall.  Even the uninstaller had trouble getting enough cycles to complete.  The good news is that there is a happy ending.  I have uninstalled Kaspersky and my computer is working fine again.  Now I will have to waste the rest of the day fixing the other five computers.	-1
THREATS DETECTED!!!!  SYSTEM RESTORE REQUIRED!!!  OK then, I guess I will push the red "Fix It Now" button, right?  Well click away, but NOTHING HAPPENS.  The warning doesn't go away, the infected files are not deleted or quarantined... and it doesn't even give me a failure notice to tell me why it doesn't work.  Kaspersky has a forum post (from last year, apparently they still haven't fixed this), and all they tell you to do is to delete the warning (NOT the infected files) from the scan report.  What about the supposed viruses?  Do we just ignore all supposed infections?  And what about the claim that I need to do a system restore?  suddenly I don't?  I don't understand how they can release a product when the primary function seems to just not work at all.  If you don't want to deal with mysterious software (which is never fixed), definitely don't buy this.	-1
...and back up your system before you install.  I've had a PC since 1986, and anti-virus software since Norton AV v. 1, so I know what I am doing.  I recently installed BitDefender Internet Security 2011, but found it slowed down my system, especially internet activity, to a point it was almost unusable, so I uninstalled it. I reinstalled BDIS 2010 and looked for another AV program. After reading some good reviews of KIS 2011 I went to Kaspersky's Web site and downloaded the 30-day trial version of Kaspersky Internet Security 2011.  Before I installed it I uninstalled BDIS 2010, deleted the folders, and purged the registry. The install went smoothly, and it updated itself. Once running, it seemed to run well. I perused the settings but didn't change anything.  Then I started Firefox. I discovered KIS turned off all my themes and extensions, and wouldn't let me reactivate them. I also run a Task Manager all the time. Almost no running tasks showed up in the Task List. I decided this was unacceptable and I uninstalled KIS 2011.  Even after I uninstalled KIS 2011 and rebooted, the changes it made remained. I still could not run Firefox's themes or extensions, and running tasks were still missing from Task Manager.  I ended up restoring my Acronis image in order to regain control of my computer.  I realize it KIS 2011 works well for some people, but not for me. I'm glad I didn't pay sixty bucks for this.	-1
To start, it bears mentioning that I'm a previous Nuance (Dragon Naturally Speaking) customer, so I had no delusions about the company before selecting OmniPage 18. If you aren't a customer, then you should be aware that: 1) Their customer service is sketchy at best; 2) They'll nickel and dime you six ways from Sunday; and 3) If you give them your email address, they'll send you every Nuance-related marketing e-bumf from here to the end of time. With that said, after months of using OmniPage 18, here are my thoughts:  I have three operating systems across all of my computers: Windows XP, Vista, and 7, each with system requirements exceeding the minimum required for OmniPage. My goal was to try the software across each one, however, after dealing with the headache that was installation on the XP machine, I reconsidered. The autorun refused to automatically run, so I launched the set up file manually. After the software offered me a successful installation message, I launched it only to be greeted by a cryptic error message moments before the program crashed and closed. Rather than quit, I tried my hand at troubleshooting and discovered the problem--and it wasn't pretty. (At this point, I will note that Windows XP users should simply avoid this software, especially the technophobes.)  Once I had the software up and running, I gave the graphic user interface (GUI) a once over. It seemed rather simple and intuitive, but I quickly learned its appearance was deceptive if you intended to do more than a simple OCR conversion. (And by "simple OCR conversion" I mean clean black text on white background without images--usually of the kind originally created in word processing programs.) If you intend to use the extended features--for instance, a picture from your camera, or converting from a scanned book or a scanned document with an other-than-super-bright-white background--the trouble starts.  What's worse is that the help documentation goes so far as to be thoroughly unhelpful, possibly detrimental. One needs a healthy amount of patience, an inquisitive spirit without aversion to experimenting with software settings (which is why I told the technophobes to run away), and a pen and paper with which to create one's own help documentation as one discovers through trial and error how to complete certain tasks. (At this point, if this doesn't sound appealing to you and you need more than basic OCR conversions done on the default settings, then you'll want to rethink this software.)  The range of features this software touts is impressive and I wanted to test as many as I could before writing my review. I started with a PDF document that I originally typed in Microsoft Word. It was a plain document with plain Times New Roman text, no images, or tables--the fanciest it got was a header and a footer. OmniPage 18 converted this document into Word format beautifully, even with the header and footers intact and completely editable. Next was to try out a slightly more complicated PDF document conversion and I have to say, it passed, even where the tables were concerned. The only quibble was with the image positioning. At that point I thought maybe the software would be worth all the headaches to get it up and running. Then I moved on to converting *other* types of documents.  I printed a page on bright white copy paper from my first document and snapped a picture with my iPhone camera. I made sure the area was well-lit and the document was properly positioned in the iPhone screen. (Basically, I made sure I used optimal conditions, which is probably beyond what the average user might do, so bear that in mind.) The resultant document was vastly different from my first experience. About 30% of the converted text had errors and the corrections offered seemed completely random.  Next I worked on converting images I scanned directly from some books. OmniPage had a nice feature which allowed the automatic detection of the divider between two pages and that worked fairly well (that is, of course, if you can find it to use it). However, the book I scanned had slightly discolored pages and the margin of error for OmniPage went up considerably.  With the increased number of errors, the more interaction with the proofreading editor I had. That proofreading editor is not user-friendly or intuitive--at least not beyond the basic corrections. And finding a productive workflow is nearly impossible because many of the features that you'll need require multiple mouse clicks to access and then process. And Heaven forbid you actually make a mistake while doing the proofreading and need to go back because that will open up a whole new can of worms.  Even the files into which you can save your documents are unintuitive, because each one (even the same formats) vary slightly from one another, and there isn't any proper documentation as to the differences in each.  (By the way, the ebook format into which this program exports is completely horrid. Tip: export into HTML, clean it up in a different program, and then convert it using Calibre.)  However, the program does have a few redeeming qualities (hence the 2.5 stars instead of 1). It's clunky, sometimes unintuitive, borderline backwards, but once you get beyond this and find your groove, it has a few nifty features--the key is finding them.  So, to close...  For whom is this software? People who only need to do simple OCR conversions, or people who don't mind getting their hands messy when it comes to technical troubleshooting, people who have the patience of saints, and those who don't mind compiling their own documentation as they go along. Everyone else should probably look for something else.  I hope you found this review helpful and if you have any questions about the software or my experience with it, leave a comment and I'll do my best to answer.  ADDENDUM: When this review was written, the price of this software was significantly higher; while that didn't factor into my star rating, it was a poor cost for value. That said, if you can find this for under fifty, the cost for value greatly improves. (My original review still stands.)	-1
This was my first experience with Anime Studio software. Most of my animation experience with low key - using rudimentary type programming. While I am sure this program had the best of intentions, it is really not for the beginner. To get things to happen takes a lot of effort as things just aren't set up intuitively. Even the tutorial seemed to start in the middle of the program. It didn't start by explaining what terms meant, what was the purpose behind the features, etc. While I understand this software is often used by people who are really good at animation - there is a "beginner mode" and it never really treated me like a beginner. I was also disappointed that you are immediately thrown into needed to "upgrade" to get creations to do the really neat things shown on the package. The start-up page presents you with options to buy additional characters. The developers should maybe take a lesson from Ap developers - first reel your customers in, then hit them with a desire to upgrade. Don't brag upfront about how I am going to need to spend more money to do the really "cool" stuff. I just couldn't in confidence recommend this software to anyone. I definitely wouldn't recommend it for the novice or beginner. And, I am too green with the software to know if it is the right fit for those who are much more advanced in Animation. The software just doesn't seem to know quite who it is targeting. I gave this software a lot of time to see if it would grow on me or if I would have an "a ha" moment and it just never happened. I guess the good things I can say about it was that it installed easily and you can get started within minutes. However, getting started is too strong of a word for my experience. It was more like - look through a tutorial and get stuck at the fourth page. Then, spend a long time try to make something cool happen only to never accomplish anything beyond changing some colors. I also didn't like that the software was constantly pushing me to download more content (free and paid). I was still trying to figure out the home page and I kept getting prodded to do more. Every time I tried to really work with this software I ended up frustrated.	-1
I wanted to give this program a fair shot since it's been in my possession for quite sometime.  Here's my configuration:  Alienware Aurora R2 Intel Quad Core 2.8 GHz Windows 7 64-bit 1 GB ATI HD Radeon 5870 6 GB of RAM  I would figure that's plenty of muscle to run an entry-level software.  However, I've tried in vain for the past month trying to run through the tutorial only to be assaulted with crashes so frequent that it renders the software unusable.  Even the brief patches of tutorial I went through seemed cumbersome; I remember a 20-year old software suite called 3D Studio that had a much better interface.  However, even the best software releases require patches so I waited patiently.  As of of version 8.1--an update of 322 MB which downloaded at an average, abyssmal rate of 180 kb/sec on a 40 Mbit/sec connection...I even paused the download speed-tested myself to make sure that I still had my advertised download speed (I did) because I couldn't believe how slow it was--it still doesn't work for me.  What's even more startling is that this particular update resolves, and I quote:  "30 + major bug fixes and many improvements."  30+ MAJOR bug fixes?!?  Perhaps it's my 64-bit OS?  My video card?  I'm not sure but I can't seem to get anyone who is willing to give me a straight answer.  But here's the good news - you can try a TRIAL version of the software from their website at anime.smithmicro.com.  At least you can try it out and make sure it works.  Sadly, it does not work for me.	-1
I enjoy and love animation, so I was excited for the opportunity to test out Anime Debut 8. All I can say is that I found the software disappointing and needlessly complex. I held off writing the review to test it out and go through the tutorial, but wow... I mean they expect youngsters who love Anime to do all this just to animate a character?  First, the install. It went on my pc great. I'm running a Win 7 laptop 64 Bit. The install was smooth. The software nags you to register which I did. After install, it takes you to a main screen with a generic superhero character. From there on- the program devolves into a needless level of complexity.  I think its pretty incomprehensible that the developers decided to use Adobe Illustrator style toolset to create cartoon characters. The Bezier curve looks great when you are making realistic quality of art work for post print production but if you want to animate and draw a giant eye? Kind of overkill. Plus it is difficult and annoying to draw using points.  I think just the toolset alone will deter youngsters from wanting to use this program.  Second the tutorial. I downloaded it, and spent quite a bit of time with it. For such a large amount of work- the results of this program are amateurish and silly. I had to flip pages back and forth, to locate toolbars mentioned in the tutorial.  It is also pretty shamelessly brief. The end result? Something that looks like a child drew it.  Like the poser product, the software ships with some pre made characters. The creators want you to buy additional characters at cost from the online store.  I think if you are a graphic designer with a lot of experience, you might find this software useful, although I'm not sure for what- the end result looks kind of silly. All but the most harcorde nerd teens and youngsters will find this software to hard  to use.  Verdict:  * Clunky interface * Designed for graphic designers * Not newbie friendly * Poorly documented * Amateurish results * Set up so that users download more content from online store. * Difficult to design your own stuff. * Could've been so much better!	-1
When I first attempted to load this package onto my laptop I met one failure after another.  I tried to install it on my desktop but also failed.  Attempts to secure assistance from Kaspersky met with line-busy and unavailable help.  I finally installed it on my older desktop and used it for a while; however, I sent the old desktop to the local cyber grave yard along with Kaspersky.  I have installed almost every protection package on a plethora of computers and this is the only one that did not operate at any level of satisfaction.  I thought that if I would be able to try again and see positive results; however, after several attempts my level of concern increased and I took it off the other machines so that I did not incur other access while the computers were in potential dangerous areas.  I hate to leave my systems vulnerable especially since hacking has taken place before and I do not like it one bit.	-1
I still don't know if it was a problem with my computer or with the Kapersky anti-virus program but I was unable to ever get it up and running. I contacted the company for support and that did not help either. Somehow it was incompatible with whatever I had on my computer even after I followed directions to remove my old virus protection. I did not have this same problem when I loaded McAfee on my computer, which runs like a charm.	-1
For anyone thinking of getting Kaspersky Internet security, I would recommend getting Norton 360 instead.  I've used this software for a year now and it's given me nothing but problems.  Like any program, it sits on the system tray and monitors computer activity.  The biggest problem is during start-up.  It doesn't start-up.  Even though your network is active, it won't let you use the internet until the tray icon starts.  That often forces me to reboot and waste another 7 minutes.  I know it's not my computer because it's even worse on my laptop.  There have been times that I had to boot into Linux because I wasted more than an hour restarting over and over.  Both my laptop and desktop have 4 gigs of memory a piece, which should be more than enough to run a security program.  The moment I de-installed it and put in Norton 360, the problems completely went away.  This is a direct result of poor programming.  About security...what security??  This software has caught a total of zero viruses.  I have had my browsers hijacked more times than I can count.  The free stuff usually finds and deletes them.  Don't waste your money buying this bloated software.  It'll run OK for a couple of months, but eventually the performance will degrade to the point where it just causes problems.  The software is buggy and ineffective at it's main goal of seeping your computer secure.	-1
Repeatedly failed to find viruses. Support is non-existent. At least it did not slow the computer to a crawl, but its worthless antivirus.	-1
It is very slow to scan incoming e-mail, and very slow to open website I had AVG Internet Security and AVG is much faster incoming e-mail scanning, also much faster openning the websites	-1
I went for years without using PC protection of any sort, because I consider myself computer-savvy enough to know that the most important aspects of computer protection are just being able to recognize when something's not right with the machine, keeping personal data in safe places, and knowing where NOT to go online. However, since I have a dedicated machine just for internet access, I went ahead and started using&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/AVG-Internet-Security-2011-3-User-Old-Version/dp/B003WT1KFA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">AVG Internet Security 2011 (3-User) [Old Version</a>]. I had a great experience with that product, and since Kaspersky is the other 'big name' in internet security, I went with this for the sake of comparison.  The good news is that Kaspersky Internet Security is very low-resource, so it doesn't hog memory or processing power. The interface is very intuitive and easy to use, and all the major tools (Firewall, scanning tools) are user-friendly, easily modifiable, and easy to access. One of the things I appreciate about this software is that even when detecting threats, it doesn't automatically make changes to the system or to problematic files, instead giving the user the option to take action- something EVERY protection program should do, and something that distinguishes Kaspersky (and AVG, which operates the same way) from the 'lesser' security products (Norton, McAfee, etc.).  Unfortunately, my practical experience with Kaspersky left a lot to be desired. Firstly, I had to uninstall and reinstall because on the first take, there were a few modules that didn't operate as they should have. I won't go into technical details, but I encountered other instances of the problems I had on the Kaspersky help forums, and reinstallation was Kaspersky's recommended solution.  Secondly (and more importantly), I found the protection to be weak. My first move after installing was to 'test' the protection by exposing my machine to files and online locations that I knew should trigger responses (daring, yes, but I know what I'm doing enough to be able to trigger protection response without actually putting my machine at risk). I was very disappointed in the performance- several items that should trigger ANY protection program simply did not, and several files with known threats scanned clean. Although none of these things were actually threats, I don't like knowing that POTENTIAL threats are going unnoticed, especially when the same threats were recognized by AVG. I had the same experience with several 'hot' online sites- sites that run suspect scripts weren't flagged, and they should have been.  In no way can I say that this will be every user's experience. Kaspersky has a great reputation as a top-shelf product, and I'm hesitant to say that someone who's looking at a security program shouldn't buy this. All I can do is offer MY experience and compare it to my experience with AVG, which was always 'on the ball' in terms of catching potential threats. In the end, I uninstalled Kapsersky and renewed my AVG subscription.  As always, prospective buyers should take my review into consideration along with the reviews of others and try to make an informed decision, but in light of my experience, I can't recommend this product and would instead recommend the latest version of AVG's internet security, which has continued to serve me well.	-1
The process started with 4 1/2 hours to install this program.  Next came the email issue--which took hours more to set it up.  It essentially took an entire day to install and set up, occupying the computer and rendering it useless for any other tasks.  My husband is STILL complaining about the damage wreaked on the laptop by this security software. For experienced users, this was way over the top in terms of its invasive nature and slowing of the computer.  It undoubtedly prevents any kind of invasion from the outside world, largely because it nearly severed the connection with the internet because of how it slowed the system down.  It cataloged and re-organized his email too--deeming most of it as "spam", regardless of what his original sorting of it really was. It marked every single "safe" sender in Outlook as spam, and completely erased all of his gazillion rules managing the email. It also stopped future downloads of email into Outlook until the software was removed from the computer.  It also eliminated all RSS feeds.  It completely prevented working on websites--it regarded everything as "malicious" or "suspicious."  (For the record, this was a laptop with a dual core processor running Windows 7 Ultimate x64.)  All in all, it lasted a week.  It was a disaster, and two weeks later, he still rants about the havoc.  It was not easy to remove either, leaving traces of itself in many locations, resulting in a lot of "clean up" work being required, in addition to the time fixing Outlook.  On the plus side, for inexperienced users who don't work on websites or manage mega-email, it's easy to use and seems to do the job it is intended to without disrupting their surfing, email, and other typical tasks.  It has to be set on moderate or minimum security level in order to work.  We've used McAfee, Norton, Trend, NOD32, AVG,and BitDefender in the past, in addition to Microsoft's Security Essentials.  We have never had any security suite wreak this much havoc or be this much of a problem, on ours or anyone else's computers.  We've liked some and disliked some, but this has been ranked as the worst software decision we've ever made.  According to my husband, the only thing worse would be Windows 98 running an AOL browser.  There are better products on the market than this one.	-1
Update Jan 4, 2012. I wrote a glowing report for this Kaspersky Internet Security 2012. Unfortunately, I started having a problem with my desktop computer locking up for ten minutes. The hard drives worked like crazy but I had no control over the computer and no way to find out what was causing the problem. Then it would go back to "normal." This hadn't happened before I got this software.  I started working on the various programs, eliminating, re-loading, etc. When I got to Kaspersky, it wouldn't uninstall. I had to use another program to uninstall it and clean up the junk it left. Then I tried to re-install it. It refused to install, since there was some bit of a program missing. However, since it didn't tell me what was missing, I couldn't fix it. In addition, it had evidently changed some of my settings, so even with administrator permission, I could not get into some folders without "administrator approval." It also changed my screen so that my gadgets didn't show up!  A decent program will uninstall and re-install easily and without leaving a lot of junk. And when it uninstalls itself, it returns the settings to the way they were when it arrived. I know this is possible since I have a lot of programs that do it easily. Kasp is too much like the viruses that I am trying to avoid.  I use this on two other computers (notebooks) and it works fine. However, it is finally off of my desktop and has been replaced.	-1
I sent this back to Amazon who has a great return policy.  Unnecessarily hard to use, very complex compared to Quicken, and not supported by many banks.	-1
First off, this will NOT accept information from Quickens Essentials for Mac, the copy that Intuit has been using for the past couple years.  Second, it still will not accept downloaded information from my bank or brokerage and both are among the largest in the nation and they don't charge for downloads.  Say what you will about Quicken Essentials but at least it accepts downloads (albeit through a back door method).	-1
Tried two computers each far exceeding minimum installment requirements for this program.  It starts to install then stops 3/4 of the way through.  The program appears to be running and it states it takes several minutes.  I left it alone for 45 minutes two out of the four times I tried to install it, twice on each machine, and it made no further progress.  Turned off the virus protection.  Didn't help.  Turned off everything there was to turn off.  Didn't help.  It has two options for installation:  (1)  without the serial number which makes one program part expire in 30 days, and (2) with the serial number for the full program installation.  I have no idea if the program is good or not because it doesn't install.  Maybe you'll have better luck.  I'll never buy or recommend this one again.  Waste of time.  Fortunately, Amazon.com took it back.	-1
