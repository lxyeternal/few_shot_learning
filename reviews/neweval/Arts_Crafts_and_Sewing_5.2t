worked as expected.	1
I really like this tool so far. It arrived in new condition and the tip was very sharp. I use it for book binding. I'm a beginner so my projects aren't very heavy duty right now. For my purposes, this tool works well and is comfortable in my hands. It's fairly small and lightweight but I think it's still very sturdy. I would recommend it to anyone who would be using it in a similar fashion.	1
Very sharp and very fine point.  I like the long, thin shaft so I can punch tight holes in leather for stitching.  Because the shaft is very thin, it would be easy to bend and blunt the tip, but if used carefully the awl will hold up well.  The large handle feels nice in my hand and it is comfortable to use.	1
This awl came in handy for my book making class it's nice and sharp as well as comfortable to use.	1
Great item.	1
works great...for bookbinding... ease of going thru lots of pages	1
Great awl. Works great for book binding. Punches thru all paper I've tried. Other cover mediums like leather, felt and book board too.	1
no way to change the blades	-1
sharp and very strong	1
I've starred at thes, tried to make one just right, tried to 'settle' for alternatives.  If you're going to do the right jod, then have the right tool!  Back it properly and get centuries of proper use from the binding you prepare....that's why we're doing this...right?	1
Sturdy and works perfectly. Fits the hand well.	1
Could benefit from a sheath to protect things from the sharp tip when not in use.  Works perfectly for my book binding projects, my only wish would be for a small plastic sheet to prevent the tip from damaging things (people included) when not in use.	1
I like the wooden egg handle. It gives you a good grip. I use it for bookmaking and other crafts.	1
I like that this item is small and the ball handle fit in the palm of my hand making it easier to use. Product was received in the recorded time.	1
Great little tool and I love the look of it.	1
The awl has a smaller point which works great for paper. Unlike other awls used for carpet or course woven cloth this awl leaves a very small profile which is great for handmade books of several hundred pages using thin parchment, tracing or marker papers.	1
This awl is very comfortable to use and arrived very sharp, as promised.  I quickly discovered, however, that the metal is very soft. The tip was damaged when I accidentally hit a piece of hard plastic under my book signature.  Although it was easy enough to restore a point, it was done with an emery board.  Very soft metal - so it only gets four stars from me.	1
Bought this to rebind my Mom's Bible. It was very useful and easy to work with!	1
This is great for repairing the binding of old books. Frequently the bindings break because the fabric that covers the signatures gets weak and rots off. This works really well.	1
I love this vellum paper.  I use it to transfer my sketchbook drawings onto higher quality paper.  Totally superior to tracing paper, which I hate.	1
This is a fine product. It's good for pencil work.  Handier, but more expensive per foot than the rolls I typically buy.	1
Vellum is the secret to making card that are treasures. Each card I make is thoughtful, but more importantly, let's the receiver know I care.  Vellum is an important ingredient of my card making as it gives a quality all of its own whether used as a shadow, or the basis for calligraphy.	1
Great Quality	1
Used this for restoring a 150-year old book I purchased, which had a deteriorating cover that was falling off the spine. Very strong, stiff material for reinforcing book's casing.	1
I'm a novice working with this, but it seems to be fine to me.	1
well made, did good job in rehanging my books	1
I wanted to get back into book binding (I took a class in college) so it was great working with these familiar materials again. I used to buy cheesecloth which can also work pretty well but this stuff is just so much more durable and I trust it to hold my pages together much better than the cheesecloth.	1
It really does the job that you need. I used it for book binding but you will need to buy the glue for it.	1
Worked great.	1
Works great! One sheet will go a long way!	1
It is thinner than most glues but since it's washable I figured it would be good for mosaics and so far so good. I grouted many pieces today and no pieces of glass came off which sometimes happens with other glues I have tried.	1
This glue worked very well for the reattachment of embellishments on a brand new top.  So far, the "jewels" are holding well.  I'm sure that I will find many uses for it in the future.	1
I cannot say this is the best product ever but my daughter loves to use it so it gets her vote.  Im sure there are better stuff for the price out there but this product has seemed to established a name in the crafting world so I would recommend it.	1
Fast shipping.  As described	1
I haven't gotten this glue to work on anything. I fall back on E0006 or hot glue every time. It was a waste of money for me.	-1
Great product and a great price.  Very good quality.  Thanks.	1
Love is stuff it lasts thru several washings. I use this to going bandanas with headset glass rhinestones! I would definitely recommend!	1
Love this stuff! works so well.	1
This is my first time using Jewel-It and I am VERY happy!!  I needed to quickly replace some missing rhinestones on my daughters competition leotard and I'd never done it before so I was a little nervous about trying this on her expensive outfit.  But, this worked like a charm! I put a small dot of the embellishing glue in the place for the rhinestone set the stone and let the glue try. I am so happy with the results and the rhinestones are very secure and we can't tell which rhinestones were replaced!  The glue dried quickly and wasn't runny at all.  I'm very happy with this product!	1
I attempted to use this to bling out some headphones. Doesn't stick to the plastic. (My fault - this product is clearly for fabric only)	1
Holds anything I need it to hold.  Can't do without it.  All glue is not created equal....this is great glue!	1
Works very well.	1
worked well for appling stones to fabric	1
Sometimes I do hotfix iron but I thought I'd give this a try and I breezed through blinging a leotard! I also do my own nails so I have been decorating the nails the night before let the set with Jewel- it. And the glue has a very strong hold to the rhinestones then regular nail glue. Two thumbs up from me!!	1
This glue works great with crafts. I use it to glue tiny rhinestones into paper. It works really great. I think it would work well for a lot of different craft ideas!	1
I like this glue, however, the bottle is too big and that squeezing out the glue made it difficult to determine how much pressure to squeeze without my craft being blotted with glue stains.  It dries pretty fast, but it bothers me that this glue bottle isn't small to have comfort and control over my project.  Ending in a positive not...it may be a big bottle but it lasts a very long time.  I'm a hardcore crafty so I give this glue 4 stars.	1
Works great with Chrystal flatbacks!	1
Cant explain exactly why, but I am not thrilled with it.  It takes too long to hold the embellishment.	1
Love this glue. It holds the rhinestones on the fabric very good.	1
I like this glue, yes it is white when applied but, it DOES dry clear. I don't know why others say it does not, I used it on my black felt hat and though I was scared I had ruined it, it dried, the glue cleared and the glue works!	1
works great so far.	1
Perfect for fish stamping!!	1
Really good	1
nice pencil	1
My favorite lead holder for art. They feel great in the hand and I love that it doesn't have a clip.	1
I have always liked using this type of pencil for drawing, this one is good.	1
feel great in hand. although the sharpener doesn't work very well...	1
Does the job needed as a mechanical pencil.  Had trouble finding a good quality pencil.  This fills the bill.  I recommend	1
I have loved the Stabilo brand since my dad got me some pens when I was a kid years ago. I could not find them here in the States (I'm originally from Southeast Asia) and was looking all over for them until I came across this set from Amazon. I promptly ordered myself a set and when it did arrive, I felt like a kid opening a birthday present!  These Stabilo 88 0.4 fine point pens are wonderful for writing, which is what I use them for. I also love the diverse color palette. There are 25 pens/markers in all. The writing is smooth, the tip feels fine, though I do not exert much pressure when writing, there's no bleed through when writing (I use regular yellow writing pads though I did notice some bleed through when coloring) and the only flaw is that the caps can sometimes require a little more effort when you're taking them off. Other than that, I love this set. For about a dollar a pen, this set may seem pricey but I think it's worth the splurge since they generally seem to last longer than many other brands found in the stores. I would also recommend the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Staedtler-334SB20BK-Triplus-Fineliner-Pens-3mm-Metal-Clad-Tip-20-PK-Assorted/dp/B001CDD1X2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Staedtler 334SB20BK Triplus Fineliner Pens,.3mm,Metal Clad Tip,20/PK,Assorted</a>&nbsp;which have a dry safe feature.	1
These are exactly as discribed... I would like some lighter pastel colors not the neon one's... These are excellent for use on the card collection one's... I like them for small drawings ie: card stock products... They work well with other markers.. Good purchase...	1
Love these pens!	1
Stabilo is my favorite brand of colored pen like markers. I think I have almost all of the colors, I've bought so many different sets.  I first discovered these in high school years ago, and used them for note taking. They are great for writing letters and writing notes, the ink lasts such a long time.  As an adult who doesn't write as many notes (hello note app!), I use these now for coloring. The ink flows so smoothly, it leaves no streaks behind. The ink NEVER skips, I just love this. It also dries quickly, so I don't get color on my hands of it's resting on my coloring page.  The 88 size is the finer tip pen, if you want a larger tip then the 68s are what you need. The great thing about these is that the colors in the 88 set and the 68 set are labeled with their color number, and they match. So you're guaranteed to be using the same color if you need a fine tip and a larger one.  I just wish there were more colors!  I myself rely heavily on reviews when it comes to deciding whether or not Im going to purchase something, so my reviews are completely honest. If my opinion of the quality of this product changes, I will update my review accordingly.  Please let me know if my review was helpful to you by voting yes below, and let me know if you have any questions!	1
Love these pens!  I am a huge fan of felt tip pens (previous flair pens).  These are finer point than flairs and writes exceptionally well.  I kind of wish they sell them in packs of just blue and blacks so I can use them more at work.  Beautiful, solid colors.  I also like the tall, thin structure of the pens - easy to stick into a notebook to carry around :).	1
I love these pens. I tried these and one other top coloring set and this by far is my favorite. Thin enough to color the tiny parts and the colors are beautiful. I also use them for my bullet journal and they do not have a strong ink bleed at all. You cannot see them on the other side of a webbook or other like Moleskin (not my favorite brand for bullet journal)	1
I LOVE my new set of Stabilo pens!! The ultra fine point tips are perfect both for coloring small, detailed areas in adult coloring books, as well as writing my never-ending to-do lists in my planner. AND, this set comes with 25 colors! So many to choose from...	1
Nice pen set but the colors tend to "bleed" and are not easy to shade.  Work better as markers.	1
These are really great. Smooth, even and consistent color with bright ink. At first I was skeptical of the two gray tones, but it turns out they are dark enough and different enough that they show up well. As a professional mixed media artist, I appreciate the quality of these and like them so much I'm ordering more. Very pleased, and even more pleased with the fabulous colors!	1
After getting back into coloring over the past summer; and going several Facebook groups about adult coloring; I have asked a lot of questions on what is a better medium to use in the adult coloring books and of course there is some mixed reviews or preferences; but I am very pleased with my purchase and I haven't had any problems with it. It all depends on the quality of the paper, thickness, and if the coloring book is single sides or double sided if I would trust markers in it. These so far I haven't had any problems on single sided coloring books with these; double sided; I would trust them though; like in Johanna's books the Secret Garden and her other books.	1
Nice markers for small areas.  Recommend to use in conjunction with Point 68 for all your coloring needs. My only complaint, this also should be sold in a metal case like the 68's are!	1
Love stabile happy with the stabili of qualityhighly reccomend	1
These are awesome! I have these and the 68 set for coloring in my adult coloring books, these are perfect for tiny areas! Love the quality and the colors are so vibrant!!!	1
great	1
Would have given a 5 except the tips of the felt had to be trimmed but now they work great. I love them on all my books!	1
This is my second or third set of these pens. I LOVE them.  I'm a leftie, so I need to write with something that dries quickly and these fit the bill.  Now, they will go through a standard-weight notebook page (not onto the next page, but you can't use the back), but they don't bleed through on 20 lb paper, which is what I primarily use them on.  There are only a couple of colors that are too light to show up in my planner, so I really do get a lot of use from this set.	1
really didn't like these at all-they can tear the paper you write or color on	-1
These have the tiniest tips and great colors! I love them for doodling, which is a big hobby of mine. Really good quality.	1
I really like these. I would love to see the same set in a .5 Earl .7, and I'd love to see a larger said of any of them.	1
Used these as a kid, completely forgot how awesome these are. Love the nib, draws a nice line. I use these for line drawing. Love the color selection. Highly recommend. Want to get even more colors!	1
Excellent for pen and ink technical pens, or any type of ink pens or markets.	1
I've used this paper before and keep ordering it because I love it. I use a variety of pens (Micron, Prismacolor, etc.) and the ink glides on beautifully. It can smudge for a few seconds afterwards, but when it's dry it is vibrant and keeps the black line that doesn't fade even after erasing pencil lines. I have a few alcohol based markers that I'm trying to get the hang of and I will say that I don't trust them not to bleed through the paper so put something underneath. It can ruin the next page. Also, I prefer the version with the spiral top because when you fold this one over the previous page comes apart at the glued area so you can't keep all your work together. It is easier to make copies this way so whatever is most important for your needs.	1
I gave this as a Christmas gift to my daughter's boyfriend.  He tells me this paper is wonderful for his drawings. He purchases this brand over and over.  High quality.	1
I know next to nothing about art, but I do know that none of my graphite lays down nicely on this paper, nor does it allow for purposeful smudging of same.  So this is not a great option when both pen and graphite are meant to be used to full effect.  On the plus side, it doesn't chew up fine Micron 1.0nibs the way toothier paper does.	1
It's intimidating! I'm not an artist, just a doodler but I'd heard these papers were really smooth and a dream to work with in pen. I mostly use Micron, Staedtler and Pitt pens and wow.... drawing is smooth and fluid, no bleed. The paper also takes colored pencils pretty well but not heavy duty. I use Prismacolor pencils and paint thinner to blend colors and this paper can handle a few layers decently. Blending chalks look fantastic on this paper as well.	1
my paper of choice for ink and marker work. i've tried several different papers for my marker work, and have settled on paris paper for it's ability to hold ink lines and for how well it takes marker ink. some papers tend to be too absorbent and you end up with a build up of ink and perhaps a modeling effect because of it. borden and rileys lets me saturate the area and blend different values without a heavy buildup of tone.    I wouldn't really recommend it for colored pencils or graphite, as it really has no tooth to speak of, and removing pencil lines completely can be difficult.  it's also not particularly thick like some bristol boards, but for ink and marker work, thinner seems to work best. at least for me.  please keep in mind that this is my personal preference, and it may not be everyone's cup  of tea. some people prefer working with a surface that has some tooth to it, or an off white tone, if that's the case it would be best to perhaps try a different paper.  the only thing i wish it did, was come  in a creme tone	1
Great! Great! Great! Bought it to practice my calligraphy, awesome paper, NO FEATHERING!!!! That is a must for pens! I recommend it.	1
The smoothest paper I've ever played with.  Love using pens on it...just flows so effortlessly!	1
i love this paper so much! I'll be buying this again thank you! ^.^	1
For some reason this paper is my fav. I think it's the brightness and texture. It really holds up too. I've been using it for 15 years now. I do not recommend it for pencil however. It is highly recommended to use it for it's pen use only whereas it is very stiff and flat. But man is it great with ink!	1
Worked better than I thought.  Always saw these and thought it would be a mess.  But decided to give it a go on an old car with cigarette burns and it works great.  i can't tell there were burns or where I fixed them.  Not sure if it will hold up but it is in the Passenger seat so probably will for the long term.	1
not perfect but better looking than a burn	1
it works	1
Worked just as expected. Great product.	1
We used this to fix holes in a velour couch...  works great and you can't even tell where the rip was.	1
THE PERMATEX FABRIC REPAIR KIT DID A PRETTY GOOD JOB FOR THE COST AND EASE OF USE. MATCHING THE FABRIC COLOR WAS EASY AND COVERED THE BURN HOLE WELL.	1
Bought this long ago at our local discount department store many years ago (probably close to 10 years ago). The caddy has served me well through the years and the rake at the bottom does help keep the brushes clean. There is plenty of room for water, and a divider to keep the clean water separate from the dirty water.  This is a very nice caddy.  Recommend.	1
wow i am impressed, how can a brush cleaner come with a huge hole in the bottom? Like I said I am impressed with how completely useless this is!!!!!! Maybe mine was defective but over all its not worth the risk. The hole looks like it was patched up but the patch fell off or something... the whole thing looks used... it came scratched and in bad shape.	-1
Thank You, Very Happy	1
WooooWooooo! Essential for every studio using water based products. Think this is my 8th purchase and I absolutely feel lost if I don't have this while painting!	1
Excellent	1
Love it	1
works	1
This product is great, cleans the brushes very well.  easy to use doesn't take up a lot of space	1
Great tool	1
This is honestly the best brush container you can buy and I have had them all.  The design is amazing.  I got this one for watercolor because the one I have for my oils I love so much.  Excellent product!	1
Nice brush caddy. Bigger than I expected. No leaks. I have the One Stroke palette and I enjoy using that. This item is the same quality I'd expect from that line. Sturdy, easy to use.	1
One of my favorite brush holders!	1
Great design with ribs at bottom to clean paint out of brush.  Matches the green palette which holds foam plates.  Would make a great gift for acrylic artist.	1
Haven't had an opportunity to use this product yet, but it is nice and large and it's very helpful to have the extra brush holders.	1
My son, the artist, has ruined almost all of my coffee cups cleaning brushes, I absolutely love this thing....keeps him organized and away from my cabinet.	1
Really like this set up for watercolour brushes and would work well with acrylic but not for oils, it is too small for oils.  But you need to be careful with watercolour brushes because they are very delicate so do not drag them across the bottom.  Also, a nice size for on the desk or even for working outdoors, which I do not do but I know a lot of artists do like to work in nature.  Different size holes for different size brushes but make sure not to let them stand up like that for too long as the water will erode the area around the metal where the brushes meet the wood.  SIDE NOTE AND A GREAT FIND!!!  Benjabelle Mini Brush Tree:  I know these are made for make up brushes, but the key word here is" brushes".  As Artists we need to keep and dry our brushes tip down, especially watercolour brushes as a size 12 in Pure Kolinsky Sable will cost you up to $400 retail and around $300 on sale!!  When water gets into the brushes' ferrule, it degrades the brush and the brush also CANNOT be left with the tip down or standing in water.  This is the perfect solution.  A Must have!!!  And it comes in different sizes and colours.  I have mine assembled and then I mounted each one on a block of styrofoam to make it even taller.  Just cut in a cross and used glue to keep it there.  I will decorate the styrofoam to make look better LOL  _________________________  Same Day a little later  I actually do really like this.  As a waterolourist, brushes are everything and cost anywhere from $25 for the really little ones to an average of about $35-$55 for other rounds and over $100 for the larger ones.  As we know, NEVER leave it soaking tip down or store tip down, you will ruin this brush made of kolinsky red sable that cost you an arm and a leg.  What they do not show you is that you can actually wash and store your brushes tip down, just make sure you get a good grip and if you are careful your mini's will fit in the small holes point down also.  Another option is:  Buy something not related to painting.  I found this item that lets you store your BRUSHES TIP DOWN!!!  Where???  In the make up section off course LOL  Benjabelle Mini Brush Tree (Black)  AND it comes in different sizes, but would recommend this one first as handles are mostly thinner on our paint brushes, might try the original size next but seems that the handles need to be really thick to work and none of my paint brushes have handles that thick.	1
I ordered this caddy because I misplaced the one I already had,this is the only caddy I will use because of the double water containments. I found my old one now I have two. Love them	1

this is my 1000000000000x i purchased this ... it's so amazing... it's light and gives my art texture.  it even dries relatively fast.  i've tried all the brands and honestly this is the best of the best.  i got the regular molding (texture) paste and it does the same job but is physically heavier, takes longer to dry and is a bit more 'grey' than this one.	1
liked it	1
This works great and I find it the best of this type. Far better than Liquitex	1
Love how easy this is to use with stencils and easy to clean off, plus fast drying and stays white.	1
I can do a lot with this, I like how it holds it shape but still has some flexibility when dry. Great for art journal pages too, because you can still turn the pages with the dry paste on them. Really nice color when mixed with acrylic paint.	1
I cannot say enough about Golden products. I use them exclusively in my various art projects. Seller packaged items very well for shipment and I received them in two days! What more could anyone ask for! Happy with seller...	1
Truthfully, I have not yet had a chance to use this purchase, but Golden is a super A+++ company and I have used their well-designed and dependable products for years. As a demanding artist with archival concerns, I really trust them.  Can't say enough for the company, so I expect superior quality. (posted Sep 2014)  If I am off-base, I will follow-up with a correction.	1
Just learned about this in a workshop. Very useful for adding tissue paper with stamped images to a journal page or a card or canvas.	1
This stuff is great! I use it to coat and seal my completed acrylic paintings on canvas. I mix it in water until it's dissolved. Then I apply 2-4 thin coats with a wide fine-bristle brush to achieve a beautiful streak-free finish. The more coats you apply, the more gloss you get. It's a wonderful way to finish and protect your works of art. Enjoy!	1
on time and as advertised	1
As advertised.  As expected.  Fast, easy transaction.	1
This product works great on photo transfers on canvas. I would recommend this to any one who would like to do transfers on canvas.	1
It is a bit more expensive than some other brands of gel medium I have used, but it doesn't get thick and goopy like some do. I would recommend this anytime you need a slight gloss finish. I do art journaling and like the quality of the Golden brand. I use it like glue and put on the surface and then over the paper I stick down. However, if you plan to write/stamp over it, you would be better served to get the matte finish instead of gloss.	1
Love the consistency! Easy to spread.	1
Great product	1
Another great Golden product.  Fast shipping, great price, and Golden is pure quality.	1
I used this gel to transfer photos on canvas and it did that beautifully. The transfer came out better when I painted/primedmy own canvas rather than a pre-primed canvas you can buy from Michaels.	1
Always a good product	1
on time and as advertised	1
Used for transfers, perfect!	1
Works great!!	1
Works great	1
Makes for a perfect isolation coat when wanting to protect acrylic paintings!	1
Golden rocks.	1
Nice to mix with acrylic paints for painting on fabric	1
I use this product to transfer images and it works great.	1
Beautiful sepia, even tone, flows well.  I'd buy this again but this bottle will last a long time.	1
I use this ink for calligraphy, in a dip nib. Though one can make it very easily, who has time for that? The liquid comes all ready and it is one of my favorites to use, it keeps fine lines very well and shades quite naturally too. The sepia tone brings back a vintage look which cannot be replicated with regular ink. Pros: It is all natural! Great! Cons: It is all natural, therefore is prone to fading. I would keep artworks done with this ink well out of the sun.	1
Love it.	1
nice warm dark...really nice ink!	1
I bought this ink for calligraphy dip pen, but tried it both with calligraphy and with a fountain pen. The ink barely has any color at all, it is very pale. Also, it is very diluted, so it is not good for calligraphy, which needs thicker ink. I bought it because of many positive reviews, but do not use this ink at all.	-1
This watercolor block is very useful and the rough paper is excellent for texturing, either by dry brush, scraping, or applying collage techniques.	1
Wonderful	1
it is nice to have and use for quick sketches and easy to carry with you	1
This is the best stuff if you are a serious watercolor painter, a professional (like myself) or a beginner who would like to save possibly years of frustration.  This may or may not be the best place to buy it depending on your locatoin and shipping preferences, but that's up to you.	1
It definitely makes a difference to use quality paper.	1
Consistent product.	1
The best paper	1
Watercolor paper just doesn't get better than arches. The make THE highest quality paper that I have ever used, and I will need no other brand.  The cold press paper is bumpy in comparison to the hot press and creates more muted tones from the paints. I like to use this for darker subject matter. It is still very easy to draw on with pencils and Micron pens. I also enjoy using water soluble sketch pencils with this paper.  This paper is definitely more expensive that the stuff I started out with on the big pad from the craft store. But it is worth the price if you are looking for professional appearance and presentation in your works. High quality paper like this is labor and time intensive. When you compare how watercolor paint looks on this paper to another brand there is HUGE difference in depth and color. It really feels like the aper does most of the work!	1
Great paper	1
This is my favorite watercolor paper.  I love the block.  I'm spoiled by it.  Its much cheaper to buy it on Amazon than say go to Hobby Lobby or Michaels or the local art store.  But the prices will go up knowing Amazon.  Guess I will have to hint to my family to get it for my special days.	1
Always a good buy.	1
Using markets on it so far and very good	1
Watercolor artists love Arches watercolor blocks. I am so glad Amazon has them. I do watercolor painting a lot and I won't buy any other watercolor paper besides Arches.	1
I always buy Arches for my watercolor painting needs. It's the best!	1
Its no wander why this paper is highly suggested by professionals. It makes your work so vibrant. It is very unforgiving of mistakes so keep that in mind :)	1
What can I say that hasn't been said before?  This brand of paper is the ultimate in quality.	1
The best paper AND the best price. I love this paper but the local stores have the price almost double so this is so much better. No hassel shopping for it and the best price anywhere.	1
This paper is awesome! And in the block even better as I was doubly frustrated with other paper having to be stretch and being substandard. I am staying with this brand! If you are looking for a "white" paper though this isn't	1
GOOOD	1
Great product fast shipping, works awesome!	1
As I expected. Thanks!	1
I wrote many times about the high quality of this paper and my pleasure of using it for my watercolor painting. With the recent discount price it is even more valuable.	1
Arches Sells Itself but I did find some defects in the seal.	1
Great  and quality paper for watercolors.	1
I paint illustration type watercolors. I most often write a poem, saying or verse directly on the paper when it's completely dry.  I need a smooth paper in order to do this and I find Arches HP 140 lb. paper to be exactly what I need.  Why do the prices of this 9x12 block change so much from day to day?  One day $26 and the next $29 or $30 something?	1
Great product!	1
This is a very high quality watercolor block indeed - I am just starting out with watercolor painting and I didn't know if this was worth the cost. It certainly makes the artist take him/herself more seriously, I don't know, high quality and excellence just has a way of being contagious. Excellent product!	1
if you haven't used this paper before, it is already blocked.	1
What can I say,..its arches	1
Love this paper.  My teacher suggested this paper and it is wonderful.	1
ARCHES is my favorite paper.	1
I really love Arches paper and particularly their watercolor blocks. They are truly sealed on all sides (except for small are where you insert your palette knife to separate the pages). I've used other blocks that separate right away and it's annoying; I buy blocks for a reason and if they separate before you even use them, may as well buy loose papers. The paper has consistent, even "tooth" and hold the watercolor beautifully while also providing you time to work the paint as needed for blending/blotting, etc.	1
Wow- my first good paper- what a difference. good price.	1
Great for watercolor!	1
This is fine paper until you notice that it's sized using "natural gelatin" - i.e. animal bones and skins.  I prefer cruelty-free paper products.	-1
This block is an excellent price being sold here on Amazon. In stores they are almost doubled in price. Cutting out the middle man is in dead worth it.  I love blocks for a couple of reasons. First is that the stretching of paper or taping is eliminated. Just flip back the cover and you're ready to go. But the other thing I like is that there is a protective page inside the cover that protects the first piece of paper and this way you won't have to worry about fingerprints and oils from hands ruining that piece by causing a resist of watercolor. I can't tell you how many times I purchased a pad of paper in a store and people handle the pages  ruining it for me. I have stopped buying books in stores because of this. But if you must, then choose from underneath the stack! You may have better luck that way.  The tooth on this paper is perfect. Not too rough but just right allowing fabulous results with dry brushing. I ordinarily use these blocks for paintings, not for exercises. I use my Strathmore 400 series for that. When I can afford to order nothing but arches I will. Beginning with buying full sheets to cut down.  Absorbency on arches is great. Colors that sit on top stay on top and others that absorb and spread, do it well.  In watercolor painting, Arches paper is considered one of the most popular papers used among watercolor artists. There are also other brands out there that are excellent but I haven't tried them yet. I may in the future.  Arches is the only favorite I know.  But if you can't afford it make sure you always buy 140lb 300gsm or higher paper. Cold press is the norm for watercolor. Hot press is used in certain circumstances but if you're starting out, you need to read labels and do not buy 90lb paper for watercolor. You will hate this style of painting and wonder how anyone does it. Artists don't use 90 lb in watercolor.  If you have never used a block, it is very easy. It has the gummy stuff you see on tablets of paper all the way around it except for a little over an inch. You can take a sharp non serrated knife or exacto and cut carefully around to remove that page after it has completely dried. Be careful when cutting. I always am my blade slightly downward into the stack to prevent cutting the edge of my painting.	1
The pad is wrapped tightly with black plastic inside, with instructions to open it with a palette knife. Even if a water colorist has a palette knife, it takes real caution to extract a page without ripping it. I love Arches paper and thought it would be convenient to have pre-cut paper, but it was a bad choice. Very disappointed.	-1
Have not used yet but think it is going to be a very good paper quality  Looks like a very good quality and will not need a board since it is bound together	1
I bought Canson water color paper from the store.  I always prefer Arches that because the paper does not unravel or becomes weaker when use the wet on wet technique to for the starting the painting	1
I ordered this book of paper for my son.  He loves it.  It's the only kind of paper he uses.  He is a tattoo artist and uses it to draw his flash on.	1
This is simply the best watercolor paper I have ever used.  It has weight, and texture.  It is cold press.  It holds a lot of watercolor.  It is medium-sized, and the price on Amazon was right!  Why go to the art store?	1
This product is fun.  It is so luxurious.  The finished painting is ready to be framed after it is completed.  I looked at the block much like an inspector, when it arrived at my door, as I've never seen such fine paper.	1
Quite simply put, Arches Watercolor blocks are the best watercolor paper available anywhere.  I use all the different varieties available - the cold press versions, particularly the rough surface, are a fantastic surface for any kind of drybrush techniques - the rough texture adds all sorts of possibilities for the application of paint.  If you are doing more washwork, you may want to consider the hot press variety.  It has a very smooth, untextured surface, is less absorbent than the cold press and will take marvellously detailed images. Because its less porous, it also extend drying time, so you can do more color manipulation after application.  Buying your paper in blocks is a good way to improve your work flow.  No stretching or taping paper to a board - its all ready to go in the block form - just separate the cover sheet from the rest with a utility knife, and you are free to paint!  When your work dries, any warps or buckling will work itself out as the block stretches the paper back to flat!  When you have finished a painting, simply cut the top sheet away from the block and you have a pristine, fresh sheet of pre-stretched paper. I alway have a few Arches watercolor blocks on hand, small ones for sketching in the field and the largest ones for making full scale drybrush, watercolor, and gouache paintings. I cannot recommend this product highly enough - except that - it not a toy and I have to scratch my head and wonder why it is catagorized as such.  If you are looking for paper to give to a child for watercolor work, I'd go with something less elaborate and expensive - say, one of the many watercolor pads that Strathmore makes.  If your child is gifted, and somewhat accomplished as a watercolorist, they will find Arches paint surfaces to be a pleasant step up. If you are an art teacher on a strict budget, you may want to hold the arches blocks back for your more serious students, or else encourage the students to explore the paper on their own. I got my first block as a contest award in high school in 1974. I've tried other papers but I always come back to my Arches!	1
Arches is so dependable.	1
Arches paper is the best for the watercolorist.  I appreciate I can get it thru Amazon instead of needing to drive to the Art store.	1
This paper is awesome!	1
I never used a pad before. I took an art class and the instructor was using them to demonstrate. Wanted to try it so I wouldn't have to deal with watercolor paper that won't stay flat.  It does work great.  Glad I bought it. Just wish it came in 15x22.	1
Can't beat Arche's. The king of watercolor paper!	1
Great quality as always and good price.  Quick delivery from Blick's!	1
very pricey but good	1
Wonderful paper.	1
VERY GOOD	1
Very cool. Exactly as described.	1
Arches is the best generally affordable watercolor paper.	1
I use this foot most of the time.  It is very easy to read while sewing.  It serves the purpose of most the other feet I have.  Buy it, you'll like it.	1
I like this foot for the fact that I can use it to instruct my children how to sew.  I started using it, and it kinda annoyed me but it made teaching my children a lot easier.	1
I found that this sewing foot is great when sewing the standard 5/8" hem allowance called for when sewing patterns. I took a fine point permanent marker and colored in the engraved line that corresponded to the 5/8" mark and it makes it much easier to keep the seam consistent.	1
Why isn't this a standard item on all sewing machines? GET IT NOW!!! I love it- you can sew 1/8 inch increments up to 1 inch (I think) I usually do 1/8, 1/4 or 1/2 an inch.	1
This is my new standard foot! My only issue is that the stitch guides are in metric, where I would prefer them in imperial so I could easily see 1/4 inch, but I've gotten used to where the 1/4 inch is in relation to the metric marks.	1
very happy.  wonderful for quilting	1
very good thank you	1
does the job	1
works well	1
Nifty!  The stitch guide foot has really helped me keep my stitches straighter.  Because the guide floats just above the moving fabric, it is always clearly in view, unlike the markings on the throat plate.  I did make one 'hack', which was to use different colored sharpie markers to emphasize three width marks I use most commonly.  This way I don't need to count out which mark I need constantly, merely remember I want the red one, for example; and glare on the shiny metal is less of an issue. This addition has made it a breeze to stay on track with the proper seam allowance.  The markings are on top of the guide, while the fabric moves under it, so I don't worry about the marks rubbing off on the fabric, but I also let them dry a full day before even trying it out.  The foot itself is very well made, very sturdy, and the guide does not interfere with the fabric at all, it hovers just above it, and the marked guide itself is quite substantial and I do not believe that it would become bent or twisted with normal use.  If they made this with color markings already in place on the guide, it would have been perfect, I would have given it 5 stars.  It's not so much a flaw in the design as a suggested improvement.	1
I like it	1
THANKS YOU	1
I love this tool. I am getting straight and uniform seams at last.	1
love the stich guide as my vision has gradually gotten worse it is harder to see. this is just what i needed and didn't have to pay the local fabric store (in the next county ) higher prices.	1
I cannot bring myself to remove this from my sewing machine.  I cannot feel comfortable sewing with any other foot - unless I need my cutting foot which this does not do - otherwise, I feel lost without this one, it makes following a straight line so much easier, I love this foot almost as much as I love my Brother sewing machine.	1
High quality, all metal foot that is a standard accessory for any sewing enthusiast. I would highly recommend this for anyone who sews.	1
I bought this as an extra foot for my serger. When you want to sew, you need to have the proper tools to do the job.	1
I thought this foot is a good addition to have among the various accessories that come with the 1034-D Brother Serger. I have not used it yet, but I will soon.	1
Just what I need to sew on elastic.	1
Great accessory for the Brother serger	1
Well worth the money I spent on this one: It made working with elastic so much easier and quicker.	1
I have used this elastic foot three times for making bathing suits.  The stretch of the elastic only works when set on "4".  Anything less does not stretch the elastic for application.  This may be due to the knit elastic that I am using.  Fortunately, the setting "4" seems to be just the right amount of stretch I need.  I see myself just doing it with the regular foot and stretching the fabric and elastic if I need a tighter fit.	1
Hadn't figured this out yet but note that I am a novice (although brilliant) in the Serger world.	-1
Works perfect and so much cheaper than buying from dealer.	1
Another additional tool to my already amazing serger.	1
This is a game-changing sewing tool. I HIGHLY recommend!!!!	1
I haven't tried this yet, but I thought it would be great to have when I'm ready to use it.	1
works very easily.  nice addition to my equipment	1
Thank you so much for a great product and incredibly fast shipping!!!  Would definitely order again!	1
good	1
Took me a couple of tries to get it right.  But it works fine now.	1
PERFECT	1
Great transaction, item as described.  Thank you!!	1
the best products. can't get any better than Arches brand.	1
BEST ON EARTH.	1
Always a great purchase!	1
Pro duct is valid, and at a good price.  I will use this means of purchasing a rt materials again	1
Quality paper.	1
Love Arches brand watercolor paper....always perfect and reliable!	1
I've used a few different brands of watercolor blocks and this is by far my favorite.  I've tried the type that only two sides are attached but those still had waves. Another similar block was very difficult to separate the pages and did not come away clean.  The Arches has a black protective sheet on top and the pages come away with very clean edges and seperate easily but not until I want them to.  The paper itself is wonderful. I tend to do very wet washes and lots of layers. The paper hardly has any waves and the paint flows nicely around the paper. It doesn't soak up the water too fast so I have plenty of time to blend. It is soft but not so much that masking fluid damages the paper when removed.  This paper makes painting enjoyable since I don't feel like I'm working against the paper trying to get it to do what I want. I will do my experimenting on cheaper paper since this is pricey.	1
Love this paper. Its the only brand that I use for my paintings. I own multiple pads of this and have never had issues. This was a good price also.	1
Love the size for small projects!!  I'm learning and east to use!	1
Since I knew so little about watercolor art, I had no appreciation of what the paper differences were. One can buy pads, blocks, and single sheets, both in rolls and flats. The paper can be made of wood pulp and cotton fiber (in part or combined). It can be pressed and then treated to slow down absorption or it can be treated before the paper is pressed.  I wanted to buy the cheapest possible because I reckoned that as a beginner I would have inferior works that weren't worth saving. Au contraire!  Works will not be worth saving if you do not purchase the best you can afford. A person will be frustrated with the outcome on cheap paper as their attempts buckle and wear down in parts. It can discourage the enthusiasm for the whole project.  What's good? Arches Aquarelle (French for "watercolor") Watercolor Block, 140 lb (the weight of 500 sheets/reams of paper) cold press. I would even go so far as to recommend trying the even more costly 300 lb paper.  First, Arches is a very old and reliable paper manufacturer.  Second, the thickness works very well for even cheap paints (but be careful to have at least some of the more highly pigmented "artist grade" paints).  Third, the higher grade papers have the chemical treatment for slower absorption IN the paper fiber rather than ON the surface. If the paper absorbs too fast, it will be difficult to paint quickly enough to make the brush produce what you want.  Fourth, separate sheets and pads (as well as binder style) allow people to touch the paper, if not in the store, then in the factory. The oil from a person's fingers imprint on the surface and when you paint over that basically invisible spot, your paint will fail to absorb correctly leaving you a funny looking splotch on your work. The block form is sealed almost completely. You have to use a knife to slip into a small hole at the top to release the paper from the block. NO ONE has touched THAT paper!  Fifth, the cold press refers to the type of surface you paint on. Hot Press is smooth, Not Press is rough. Like Goldilocks, the middle (Cold Press) is just right (as I think a beginner might have the easiest time).  One can purchase the cheaper paper to play with the ideas that you want to work up but it is going to be supremely superior to go on to paint the final work on the best you can afford. Watercolor is one of the cheapest ways to paint. It takes quite a LONG time to use up your paints.  The actual painting can be a mighty challenge. Oils and acrylics can be pretty much painted over to correct what you don't like. Not so with watercolor art. Don't make it even harder by using cheap crap.	1
One of the most important things you have to get right in quilting is a 1/4 inch seam. I have had problems with this so I was happy to see that my Brother CS6000i had a 1/4 inch piecing foot. It didn't come with the machine so I purchased it and I must say, this is really wonderful. It has this little runner on the side of the foot that helps you make a perfect 1/4 inch seam. I would recommend this foot for anyone who owns a Brother CS6000i. I am so happy with mine.	1
Really is great. Would recommend this is a plus . Worked well.	1
Very good to have an extra foot around. Thanks	1
best foot for quilting	1
really a helpful foot	1
I don't like it as I have to adjust my needle position everytime I turn it on. I broke a needle once as my machine turns on on the left side.	-1
Perfect. Just what I needed. Easy to use.	1
Exceed all expectations	1
Excellent - works great on my Brother machine. Great foot for quilting and maintaining 1/4 inch seam!	1
just fine	1
useful tool when piecing materials together.	1
Great 1/4" quilting foot. No more fabric being pulled down and ruined in machine. I have purchased 3 feet, finally found a good one!!	1
Excellent!	1
Just received this foot and already have it in use.  I'm new to sewing and quilting, so anything that helps me do a better job of maintaining a straight, 1/4 seam is helpful, and this does a great job.  I'm currently working on small 1/4 triangles and the long narrow opening leading up to the needle is perfect for lining up my mark and keeping it straight.	1
Really works great for the 1/4 inch seam!	1
Over all, a helpful foot to have. The only fault I have is the short edge tends to catch on seams where there are several layers, like piecing blocks in quilting.	1
ok	1
works as it should	1
Awesome! Perfect fit to my machine.	1
Works perfectly.  Gives me a very accurate 1/4 inch seam.	1
I tried it for quilt piecing.  It slips all over the fabric.  Could be my machine but I just don't like the way it works.  I ended up relying on needle position to get 1/4" seams.	-1
New to sewing/quilting and this works great with my brother se425.	1
I should have gotten this months ago, soooo much easier to see and whiz through quilt piecing. Speeds you up!	1
I use this for sewing the 1/4 inch seams that most  quilting seams require. I get nice seams every time.	1
This foot does NOT have a shank. Worked great when I found a shank that I could hook it onto.	1
Works as described.	1
This fits my 20 years old Brothers XL-3022 sewing machine. It has really helped with my quilting stitches.	1
Works perfectly!	1
qood quality  very helpful for quilting	1
Wish my Brother CS6000i came with this foot but it didn't.  Its a rather handy one to own especially if you quilt.	1
A little pricey, but it works. I found out that generic brands work just as well. But oh well.	1
I am using this product for 1/4 inch seams for a quilting class.  I could not get a consistent 1/4 inch seam with this on my Brother JX 2517. But this machine was not listed as being compatible with this foot.  The foot does keep the fabric aligned and may work well with the listed Brother models.  This was a genuine Brother product.	1
A must have for quilting.  I'm a beginner and this and the walking foot made a big difference in the quality of my work.  I highly recommend if you quilt or need to sew 1/4" or 1/8" seams accurately.	1
Great Foot.	1
Fits my Brother Project Runway machine.  Works as expected.  Great for doing 1/4" seams or 1/8" top stitching.	1
Purchased for the Brother XR3774.	1
very good	1
A quilting necessity.	1
I like it but it doesn't have a  letter to identify it  like the ones that I have. Just what I need!  Fast shipping. Thank you.	1
Use it everyday.	1
It's fine.	1
Let me first say that i have a thing for pressor feet.  I love this foot because it takes the guesswork out of doing 1/4 inch seams, and as an added bonus if you line up the fabric on the other side, you get a 1/8" seam.  With an all purpose foot this is hard to do because the fabric wants to lift up over the inside of the foot.  The wider part od this foot keeps the fabric in place.  I would highly recommend this foot to anyone who deals with narrow seams.  Besides my overlocking foot (which came with my brother cs6000i), i would have to say this is my favorite.	1
Very handy. Better than trying to guess, makes quilt piecing accurate.	1
This is exactly what it says it is. Works great.	1
I'm not really sure how to rate a presser foot this simple. It either works or it doesn't. It worked perfectly out of the package and was simple to install and remove on the shank. I just finished making a half dozen pillowcases where most of the seam allowances were " and this foot was ideal for that. I also want to learn to quilt and I expect to use it a lot then also.	1
Nice metal attachment that fit my brother machine perfectly.	1
Perfect. It is a real brother foot at a great price.	1
I bought this foot after I bought my new brother machine. I'm new to quilting.  I had been using a regular foot while quilting on my old Kenmore and I was just sort of "fudging" the 1/4 inch seams. They didn't always come out the same. This foot makes each seam a perfect 1/4 in. I wish I had gotten one sooner.	1
I can now do perfect 1/4 inch seams !	1
Easy to use makes accurate perfect 1/4 inch seams	1
I used these feet often, they do a great job on the prescribed use they are intended.  Like it very much...	1
It's wonderful. It makes my quilting so much easier.	1
works great	1
Works great!	1
Works great with my Brother XR1355.	1
I LOVE IT.  Perfect 1/4" seams on my quilt  Great foot. Love it	1
Just what I wanted.  It really helps a lot.	1
Nice quality, easy to use, and convenient to have if you do a lot of quilting.  You just line it up with the edge of the fabric and your quarter inch seem is a snap.	1
Came fast and what my wife wanted for her quilting, she is happy, I am happy.	1
Good	1
This was a great purchase. It's a must-have for every quilter.  I use it constantly.	1
Good Price	1
Just what I needed	1
IT IS GREAT I USE IT ALL THE TIME. THANK YOU SO MUCH.	1
This piecing foot is great--just like most other Brother products!	1
Bought this for my new machine.  This foot will keep my sewing consistant!	1
Perfect fit.  Had one on my other Brother machine and wanted one for my new Brother machine!	1
great product	1
I like this 14 incher better than the one that has the vertical metal guide along the side, because you don't have to worry about the fabric folding up on you and giving you an inaccurate 14/ inch.	1
Delivered very fast and packaged in a Brother case.  Thank you!	1
Sure makes a difference! How did I ever do without this??	1
Just the right size	1
Excellent service and great product!  Thank you!	1
no more guessing where my 1/4 inch mark is	1
A must tool for quilting.  Keeps you sewing your seams at 1/4 inch so much easier. Use it all the time.	1
NOT A GREAT FOOT	-1
Works as expected. Sews a quarter inch seam. Only use on edge of quilt. Does not glide through batting,	1
nice addition to my sewing feet.	1
This is one sewing foot I can't do without.  I do a lot of 1/4" seams and this is perfect.	1
I love the 1/4 inch foot, but since my new Brother machine has broken already,  I not getting to use it.	1
This is a must have tool for the quilter in mind. It will give you always the correct 1/4 inch seam that is required for piecing without much guess work. Wonderful	1
If you are a quilter or are just starting out, you most definitely want this foot. It helps you keep a 1/4 inch seam when making your quilting seams.	1
This is just what I wanted!  It fits my machine great and helps keep me in line on the seams.	1
Perfect.  Exactly what I needed for quilt piecing.  Fits perfectly and easy to put on and off.  Helps with that perfect 1/4 inch seam allowance!	1
I use it constantly when I'm piecing.  It's sturdy, fits on the machine well, and takes the guesswork out of measuring the quarter inch.  I would recommend it.	1
Until the day I can sew an absolute perfectly straight quarter inch seam, this item will always be a welcome addition to my collection of sewing foot attachments.	1
This foot did not come with my quilting machine for some reason.  It makes sewing the necessary 1/4" seam easier.	1
I love using this.  Makes getting the seam the perfect size.  Would certainly recommend it to quilters and oter crafters.	1
Works great - just the right size for my sewing machine.  I was worried it wouldn't fit right or not be the right size but it turned out great - I use it on my sewing machine all the time	1
I have no formal training and I am teaching myself to quilt.  This foot has been so helpful for me.  I always have difficulty keeping the 1/4 inch right.  The hole is center instead of off to the left like my usual foot so I have to remember to program the stitch that moves the needle right so it doesn't hit the foot and break my needle.	1
I wish I had bought this 1/4" piecing foot a long time ago. I am no longer anxious about my piecing seams. They come out so nice and straight - just the right width! Yay!	1
It is nice to have a piecing foot for all the quilting that I am doing putting together  several quilts.	1
This foot fits my machine great and works great.  Can't go wrong with this product.  I will be ordering other feet as well	1
Its a piercing foot and does its job. Nothing really more to say. When you have a sewing machine, you are kind of stuck buying the attachment that the sewing machine company makes for that model.	1
Most feet have a special purpose. This is to keep an even 1/4" seam, essential for piecing quilts. It's easy to clip on, and easy to use.	1
Why didn't I get this sooner?  I love it and has made my sewing so much simpler.  Nice quality, good pricing - buy this for sure!	1
I added this foot because I do lots of quilt piecing.  I have a foot with a guide which is my favorite but this works great when there are times you don't want a guide to pull at your fabric.	1
A sturdy useful sewing machine foot.  This one is used more often than others and has been reliable.  Would purchase again if we ever needed to do so.	1
This is an excellent product. One which every quilter should have. l Now that I have started using it never want to be without it.  I took a chance on purchasing it.  I have a Brother CE4000 Sewing Machine and the CE4000 was not listed as a machine it is to be used with. But it works perfectly.  I am glad I took that chance.  Besides for .01, plush $3.99 S&H  what did I have to loose? I have finished piecing my first quilt, and it turned out perfect.	1
This is a must have! My sewing machine does not have accurate stitch width markings. This foot makes quilt blocks come out the size the pattern says.	1
Even though the Amazon website showed a picture of Brother packaging for this product, it was not a genuine Brother presser foot.  In comparing both the real thing and this fake copy, there were slight differences and so it was returned to the outside vendor.  Very misleading ad on Amazon's website.	-1
Ive been waiting a long time to purchase this foot. EVery time I would think of sewing a zipper on I was intimidated by the fact that I could not sew it on properly. No more worries...the foot works like a charm and I ve used it twice already in the 3 hours since it was received. fast shipping , neat packaging and great customer service as is expected of amazon	1
Okay.	1
Works well with my brother - very happy with this purchase.	1
I love this foot. I hated doing zippers until I tried this foot. This Foot works on my singer machines also.	1
It really does the job! Finally my invisible zippers are invisible	1
Works great with my Brother SE400	1
Came exactly when it said it would, fits beautifully.	1
Have to be careful it doesn't go over zipper	1
great	1
Woo Hoo!!!! I LOVE this Invisible Zipper Foot! It was easy to install and worked beautifully the first time I ever added a zip to a dress.  I don't think the pictures included helped me to figure out how you need to rotate the zipper so that it all works, but (luckily) my pattern did tell me how to rotate the zipper to make this a true "Invisible" zipper.	1
is NOT fit for Pfaff 7550	-1
This little gadget is a super life saver! I am not a big sewer and i could use all the help i can get. this foot was easy to figure out and worked like a charm. very happy with finished products because of this foot	1
Easy and clear instructions.	1
the first time I used this was a sewers dream. It fit my machine perfectly. as always my delivery came as expected.	1
great	1
super, good helper	1
Maybe it's just me, but I cannot get this thing to sew a zipper properly. The left side works perfectly every time, but the right side always, always catches the zipper with the thread and causes me to have to pick the thread out. It's like it's not as wide as the left groove. I've just given up on it after about 12 attempts.	-1
A must if you are sewing invisible zippers.	1
Perfect!	1
Works perfectly on my Brother Dream Creator XE-VM5100. It's nice to find an essential foot like this at such a good price!	1
Just Awesome!	1
No problems... was an excellent buy.	1
Fits well and I will try it with cording	1
These little feet are so nice. I have tried this one, and am pleased. I was used to a slightly heavier clunky foot (which I wish they still made for ALL machines) but this one is fine... Made some pillows with a concealed zipper and it did the job just fine.  I recommend this.	1
This will help with a better finish for invisible zippers, and cost a good bit less than a local purchase would have.	1
This is a great way to upgrade your machine. Get new attachments and your machine does a lot of new tricks.	1
Fits my machine have not used as yet.	1
Does what it's supposed to, proper fit.	1
It arrived as scheduled, and fit my Brother LX-3125E perfectly. It makes attaching the concealed zippers so much easier for me, especially as a beginner. It helps keep them really secure while sewing.	1
This adds to my feet collection.  I will be able to insert an invisible zipper with ease.  It is made by Brother , so I  know it will work perfectly on my machine.	1
I installed my first invisible zipper last night and this little foot worked perfectly!  Note - If you have a sewing machine with multiple needle positions, be sure it is set to Center.  My computerized Brother CS6000i defaults to the left and I'm lucky the needle didn't break...not the foot's fault, but mine.  I installed the zipper using a video instruction from Craftsy and the instructor didn't use an invisible zipper foot but mentioned the foot is handy but not necessary.  I disagree!  I can't sew a straight line to save my life and this little gizmo hugged the zipper teeth without bunching, hanging, or snagging and sewed a perfect seam completely straight down the teeth. Without one, the instructor's regular presser foot hung on the zipper top and initially refused to feed the fabric/zipper tape through the feed dogs.  With this foot that did not happen.  When completed, the zipper was hidden exactly as it should be.  The instructor did have a good hint: make your garment seam allowances 1/2" vs. the standard 5/8".  The zipper tape is 1/2" and the edge of the fabric is a good guide for zipper placement.	1
Most sewing machines these days only come with a few accessory feet. And most zippers are the invisible kind, if you go to the sewing store--that's what you'll find. Plus, invisible zippers look so wonderful when sewn in--they become part of the seam. However, if you struggle with sewing them, the invisible zipper foot is what you need. The foot snaps onto the shank, and it rides over the center part of the invisible zipper, allowing you to sew close to the nylon coils. That's the key--riding over the raised coils so the stitching is right on the tape in the correct position. This is a must-have for any home sewing you do with zippers.	1
Item was exactly as described and worked perfectly on my machine. Installation was extremely easy and no instructions were needed.	1
This works great for quilting on a regular sewing machine.  The clear bottom lets you see where you're heading and where you've been !!!	1
This foot fit my Singer and works very well. A lot of plastic so I can't say how it will hold up, but so far so good.  Very inexpensive compared to the one I ordered from Singer (which didn't work well at all and cost about 4times as much). Arrived in reasonable time.  Overall pleased with this purchase and would recommend.	1
Perfect for art projects	1
great ink	1
Nice quality.	1
This bottle is huge!!! It is worth the price as the smaller bottles run roughly $4-5 for 2.5 - 5 oz. This is a 32oz bottle!!! It will be a long time before I run out of ink.	1
This bottle is huge - 1 quart (32oz) will last me at least a year of regular inking and painting with it. I was happy to find that diluted with water I could get a good gray scale, because I also use india ink as a tonal value (shading) underneath watercolor paintings. It doesn't react to the salt trick as well as watercolor paint does for creating texture, however it is a great ink for sumi-e or chinese brush painting. It does make beautiful wicking dispersion patterns when drawn on to wet watercolor paper. Great for expirimenting with for fine art.  My order placed April 2016 had a black white and red label displaying some intricate calligraphy scrollwork, which was different than the main product photo at the time on amazon. I'm not sure if they have changed the product at all recently with the label change, but this worked very well for me. I almost didn't buy this due to a review that said it wasn't waterproof anymore, but as long as you let it thoroughly dry it is waterproof. I wrote with it using a dip pen on watercolor paper, waited several hours and scrubbed it with a wet paint brush. It smeared, and continued to smear until after 12 hours. After 24 hours there was no more smearing of this black ink - it just required a long dry time. If you live in a humid environment I imagine it might even take a couple days to become waterproof.	1
My standard drawing ink.  Could not live without it.	1
This is a great deal for some pretty good india ink. Unlike other reviewers, I bought this to use in an airbrush. I wanted large quantities of ink to use in practicing freehand airbrush (e.g., figure drawing, experimenting with templates). It is too pricey to use good airbrush paint for this purpose. So far I have nothing but good things to say about this ink. It flows well in my airbrushes without being reduced. I have been using it with a general purpose 0.3mm nozzle/needle combination, but I think it would be fine in a 0.2mm or 0.15mm gun as well. It is consistent, doesn't lead to much tip dry, and has a nice sheen on paper. At the price I bought three bottles. For those of us running 0.5mm or larger guns, you can clear out an ounce of ink pretty quickly. At standard prices that gets expensive, but with these bottles it is affordable.	1
Wow that is a lot of ink!!! I bought this since it was only $2 more than the 16 oz. and I definitely got my money's worth. I don't feel guilty for practicing my calligraphy at all. Will definitely buy again provided it is still in this price range.	1
I love the richness of this black ink, however, it does seem to clog in my nib and it clogs around the opening of my ink well.  Otherwise I feel like the amount of ink you get for your money is definitely an awesome value.	1
I use this to ebonize wood to get a TRUE black.  It soaks right in, shows the grain, and is extremely easy to work with.	1
exactly what i was looking for to use when we wanted something that could carve pumpkins easily.  Just buy these and don't look back.	1
I have a lot of trouble with removing/replacing the blades.  Maybe I'm doing something wrong......?  But I have to wiggle the blades around a lot to get them to seat [and same with removing], and there have been times when I couldn't get a blade to come out at all.  I've double-checked that the parts inside the chuck are installed correctly, but it's still frustrating.	-1
cheap set but works	1
works as described	1
I got these to add to my collection so I could have a handle for each different type of blade. They are not made as well as the old school putty colored handles. They are thinner and not as elegantly weighted. But they still function, just without the pleasant experience of the old style handles. Also the blade quality is cheap cheap cheap... the fine "V" shaped parting blade is pinched tighter than the older ones and the sides of it cut the linoleum leaving a much wider cut mark than it should. This purpose of a fine blade is to cut thin lines...this cuts a wider line than the tool is intended for.	1
I am enjoying the two linoleum knives that I purchased from Speedball.  It makes carving polymer clay so easy.  I always wondered how they did it, and now I know.  I really love the way the handle stores the extra tips.  No more wondering where the other tips went.  They are always in the palm of your hand.	1
Like this cutter so much, I ordered this twin handle set.  Now that I will have three handles, I can put different blades on each handle for easier access.  As I've stated in past reviews of this product, please learn how to properly and safely use these cutting tools.	1
Speedball is know for good quality. Thanks.	1
I ove having these for working in the studio. comfortable, light weight and really esy on my wrists. all the nibs are different so if you're expecting dupicates then this is not the set for you.	1
Great.	1
Although this is my first ever pen/nib set, I am pleased with the results. I didn't realize the baby nib could produce such a fine line. It's definitely a different way for me to draw but I'm enjoying it so far. Today I did my first "real" drawing with it so I'm pretty happy with it so far.	1
Good starter nibs as a introduction to quill pens. The plastic nib holders are comfortable (considering they are plastic).	1
good	1
I have no experience with pen holders and nibs as these are my first but so far - so good and I'm definitely having fun with them!	1
good	1
I like it	1
If you do DYI screen printing, this is essential. Gets the emulsion off quick without the hassel.	1
The only brand that I use for my silk screening projects.	1
great	1
makes it easy to use	1
Hard brayer picks up more fine details. Not so fun to clean, works well and I have made many successful prints with this little thing.	1
I have put this brayer through the wringer doing direct transfers (acrylic on canvas) these past few months.  I was skeptical at first and honestly thought it would have broken by now, but it is in great shape and one of my favourite tools.  The plastic is sturdy, and it rolls smoothly.  The quality of my transfers has definitely improved since purchasing this and I would recommend it to anyone.	1
Our art teacher had us buy this Speedball Hard Rubber Brayer for a Monoprinting class.  We were able to create interesting textures and artwork by using this brayer to spread acrylic paint on a gel plate.  I had other brayers at home, but they were too small to do a good job of spreading the paint.  This Speedball brayer did an excellent job, and was easy to clean by running it over damp paper towels in a tray.	1
Use it to smooth out flat embellishments glued onto cardstock--ideal for a professional finish.  Much easier on me than using my fingers or my bone folder.  Lightweight, but strong and smooth, and perfect size.  Have used it a lot, and sometimes very hard, yet shows no signs of use or abuse.  Heads up product.	1
Nice brayer that helps press papers together for adhesion.  Haven't used with paint yet, but wrote the company to find out how to clean.  Manufacturer suggest mild soap and water.  I asked if I could use diaper wipes if I'm not near water source.  It was suggested that I do not use diaper wipes because the ingredients might break down the rubber roller.  That was a bummer and is why I only gave four stars.	1
Pretty good brayer. Would buy again.	1
I use this brayer almost every day for working on my mixed media art journal. It does an amazing job for application of paints as well as smoothing out decoupage.  I definitely will be purchasing more for my many projects.	1
I have a cricut machine and use a lot of vinyl and iron on vinyl. This thing works perfect to help get all those annoying bubbles out to make sure for a smooth cut. Also, this works perfect for help attach glued items to help smooch them together. I keep this right next to my computer. If you have a cricut or silhouette I highly recommend that you have one of these.	1
Great deal. Thanks	1
very pleased	1
I don't know what my problem is, but I just can't seem to find a brayer that doesn't leave a streak from the edge of the roller. GRRR!	-1
Great width (4") to use crafting. I ink the brayer with my inks and use it on embossing folders. It inks evenly as long as you are careful to cover the surface area thoroughly. I want to learn to use this to make gradient backgrounds. It cleans easily with a paper towel using stamp/ink cleaner. This is exactly what I wanted for my crafts. Perfect size for me.	1
Great product	1
Really like this brayer. Bought to replace another brayer with a metal piece that kept falling apart. This hasn't given me any trouble, and wouldn't hesitate purchasing another one if needed.	1
Awesome	1
Works great with my Gelli plate.	1
Exactly as described. Fast shipping! Works great!	1
Great product ... good price	1
I recently got a Cricut Machine and I love cutting vinyl on it, but was having a problem with air bubbles.  My husband had the idea to buy one of these to see if it would help and it really does!  I have used it numerous times to help flatten out vinyl but now also use it every single time I piece together paper as well.  It smooths everything down and makes it look really neat and crisp.  I'm so glad I got this!	1
It is okay. It works well and has a nice handle. I think it is me as this is the first time using it. I will try again but I can say it is well made.	1
Very nice!	1
Works great for my needs! I use this to flatten out the canvas after I adhere it to masonite panels. They look good enough to sell!	1
It works for what I got it for, seems like it's good quality.	1
Works	1
Good quality brayer.  I like to use it for abstract paintings and other craft projects.	1
As advertised	1
Used this to apply some car molding parts. I can see how this would help with some other uses but so far haven't used it for anything else?	1
This falls short for ink printing sometimes it becomes hard to fully use the brayer even with a little ink it stops rolling.	-1
Love it and also use the spongy soft roller with this handle.	1
Love these, especially the fact that you can pop out the roller.  Probably the pop-out feature is for cleaning, and that does help, but I like to pop out the roller and wrap twine or rubber bands around it to roll in ink/paint and make interesting linear features in artwork.  Works great so I bought a second one because I got the first one kinda icky after neglecting to clean it properly.  Still works for some things (like if I want an irregular surface).  So now I have one for smooth surfaces, too, which, I'm sure, is the original intent.	1
Seems sturdy enough! Haven't used yet but don't think I'll have a problem, especially for the price!	1
Received quickly and works great for adding glitter to paper to color with Copic Markers!	1
Excellent little roller works very well for dollhouse wallpaper jobs.	1
Love this roller,it is so Shmoooth!  Its build to last and has a special design that prevents splater. Recomended.	1
My grandsons loved these they are great.	1
Love it would be lost without it	1
This works awesome for my craft projects!	1
This is my first brayer tool. I had to have one to properly ink my large intricate stamps. What a difference this has made. The stamps I have that just don't ink perfectly, that don't get all-over inking when I stamp them directly on the pad, the brayer solves that problem. I have an inexpensive uneven white stamp pad that I haven't been able to use because it messes up the stamps every time. When I loaded the brayer with white ink and applied it to my stamp with the brayer,  it came out perfect each time. I clean the brayer with baby wipes. Very easy. All the reviews pointed to this brayer brand and they were right. This is the one. Happy Stamping	1
I used it once and worked perfectly, easy clean up too. Ran it through cold water and the water based ink did not stain through the roller. It came with a small how-to-guide, comes in handy for someone who needs different applications or project ideas.	1
very impressed with the quality. it rolls really nicely and smoothly. the rubber itself is really good quality. Will buy this brand again.	1
Good quality, but you must rinse it instantly after using it with acrylic paint or you'll never get it clean.	1
I use a brayer in my art classes but also for crafts and art projects for my grandchildren...this brayer is easy to handle and the clooer is of a sturdy rubber product. The brayer is also an easy cleanup.  It is a small size which fits my needs perfectly. Speedball is a good brand, you can't go wrong if you purchase this.	1
Tried it but still learning,  This will take some getting used to.  Can't wait to get better at card making.	1
This is a good brayer for the cost.is sturdy and withstands daily abuse.  Good for applying ink to various surfaces	1
The first thing you want to do is check that nothing has broken, spilled, or dried. The emulsion with be thick like glue and blue in color. The remover will be thin and clear like medical alcohol or bleach. Both should have cardboard gasketed lids and foil caps on them. The sensatizer (tiny bottle) should be either dry and at the bottom, or thick and at the bottom. If any of the sensatizer is spilled out of the little bottle (along the threads or down the side) send the kit back for a new one immediately. The product is good if you get it undamaged, but Speedball uses incompetant monkey powered robots made from scrap pulled from the Robot Wars set to package everything so check your stuff.  As for operation, when the sensatizer is added to the emulsion it turns a good medium (not quite emerald) green and will turn back to blue after it cooks out when you burn the stencil. Look for a light-medium blue hue and the uncooked parts under the negative image should have a yellow, jaundace like hue to them. When cleaning out the emmulsion make sure to wipe up messes immediately as the emulsion leaves yellow stains on nearly every surface known to man, including porcelin and the steel rim around my sink. Trial and error for new users will happen, just don't leave emulsion in a screen for a long period of time if you don't want a permenant stencil, and clean the screen completely before letting it dry if you don't want a permenant stencil (yes the emulsion remover may make the emulsion impossible to remove. Don't ask me how, I failed mad science 101).	1
Got it to test out doing some silk screen printing for our store. kit was good and explained how to work everything. did exactly what I need, there is a slight learning curve to the whole thing so be prepared to mess up a couple exposures. fortunately that's why you get the kit and use the remover to clear off a screen and do it again without having to toss and screen and frame.  I've moved on to buying this is bigger bulks but I highly recommend this if you're doing a few screens for just family or w.e. (10 or so)  and or starting out.	1
Speedball products never disappoint for our applications	1
Bought for my brother, who makes screenprunt. He said this stuff worked perfectly and has lasted him a good while.	1
Nice starter	1
ok	1
good stuff	1
A favored product due to ease of use.	1
this kind of printing is not for the average crafter. frustrating. you must have a really dark closet with nothing in it. and a strong light.	-1
One of the bottle was empty...	-1
I purchase a lot of silk screening supplies always the Speedball brand. Each time I am very happy with the products that I create. And if I have any leftover photo emulsion - I just put it in the refrigerator until the next time it's needed.	1
Worked Great	1
Makes clear screens	1
Makes silk screening a breeze.	1
Works very well, just follow the instructions provided	1
Item as described.	1
works for what it is intended for. should be more, only enough to do 2 screens.	1
Works great if you follow the instructions.	1
Nice	1
Easy to mix and use.  Make sure that you cover any area you are working in or it will be stained green.  My bathtub is ruined.	1
If anyone is really serious about screen printing, stay away from Speedball. This stuff is for bathtub amateurs, and results show. Nothing like Ulano or Holden's products made for professional results. You are probably looking at this due to the price/or you don't want a 16oz tub~ the cheapness will only frustrate you. Should you discuss with an actual print house or screen tech, Speedball is NEVER a recommended brand.	-1
This stuff works, but the parts unexposed to light took a lot of water to wash off. I tried exposing in light with less time, but still pretty hard. I have a light box too, so it was totally controlled.	1
This is a great product. Easy to use and works excellent. I was using some old product I had and was fighting getting it to wash out,then I used this new stuff whenI received it and what a difference. It washed out so easy and made a perfect screen.	1
I collect nutcrackers. The gold finish on one of my nutcrackers has started to chip off. I asked at the art department at the local college what I could use to repair the gold finish. I was told to use a rub on gold paint. It would repair the finish and give it a professional look.  I searched the Internet for this product and am thoroughly happy with it. It did exactly what it said it would do, and my nutcracker looks brand new. I put a small amount on my finger tip and applied it to the damaged area -- after a light sanding. A gentle buffing when it was dry created the satiny finish I wanted. It was easy to use and cleaned up in a jiffy. No mess, no smell. It can also be applied with a brush in intricate designs or small spaces.  This is an easy product to recommend. Perfect for a crafter or artist.	1
Great for buffing car parts to look like new in classic vette.	1
I've used Rub 'n Buff for years and it's still as good as the first time.	1
I have three tubes of this: a two pack of gold, and a red one. I was disappointed with the red because it was so dark it hardly looked metallic; but I guess color is a matter of taste. The gold is a nice color. My two big issues are that it is hard to control... you can't apply a little bit, or a thin layer. It's there or it's not. My second is the reason I will not buy again. Out of three tubes, with only two uses, two out of three have broken caps.  They were not even in use when they broke. The stuff in the opening dried so hard that I couldn't squeeze or dig it out, and I couldn't access what's lower in the tube unless I cut it open.  This would be fine, if you could use it more than once. But the ridiculous cap spoils the whole thing.	-1
Easy to use and a small amount goes a long way.  Its a bit messy but it cleans up easily and once you buff off any excess, it doesn't rub off and leaves a nice metallic finish.  Seems a bit expensive but a small tube will last a long time.	1
Works well on all sorts of materials.	1
Worked	1
Love it!, it dries really fast, so I had to work faster with this cream	1
If you have ever used these paints before you know they work well. They are a waxy consistency and you typically apply with your fingers to hit the high spots for accenting with a shiny metallic finish. Not a very large tube but they go quite a ways. I have used them on old frames and on some smaller Buddha statues to highlight and accent. They look really nice when done right. Not the best price I have ever seen for the amount of paint you actually get, but Amazon prices still tend to be better than buying in a local craft store so still a good value.	1
Used it for cosplay. This stuff is really easy to apply, and the finish looks like spray-painted metal. I should note that I buffed it on top of something that was already painted a gray color though. It was perfect for the places where spray-painting can't get to for detailing.	1
Excellent product, easy to apply.......perfect !	1
I haven't actually used the product yet but didn't want to hold up the review because my projects been delayed now for probably a few months.  I purchased a beautiful light fixture for a bathroom remodel. The description said it was silver but when it came it looked more gold in color.  A friend of mine who's a decorator recommended this product to use on the fixture to get a more sliver finish.  She uses it on old or homemade picture frames to give the frames an antique coordinated look and very upscale.  When I do use i on the light fixture I'm sure I'll get the look I want but if I don't I will be back here to amend my review.	1
great	1
This is really neat stuff.  I've used it to highlight laser engraving on glass.  The only drawbacks are that some colors aren't as bold as others, some don't seem to be quite as they are shown on color charts, and I've gotten several tubes that had the contents separated, so liquid splurts out before the pastier stuff comes out.	1
I have used this for years and it is the best for touching up and using on antiques.	1
This is so easy to use.  I put some on my finger and just wiped over the decorative carving on my door.  It's so pretty and looks like the real thing...because it is!	1
I love the color. I used another color from this brand and found it easy to use. I look forward to using this on another project.	1
Beautiful finishing touch.	1
Perfect. I've already had two uses for it - reviving old dresser pulls and other hardware. Nice to have.	1
Fun to play with and great price	1
I have a metal wall hanging that needed "something else" to complete the look.  So, I purchased another metal wall item that was supposed to match...but definitely didn't. Not only was the color way off, but it was also very drab looking. However, it wasn't "returnable".  So I purchased AMACO Rub -n Buff in the color I thought might match. Well...not only did it match perfectly, but after spending only a few minutes to "rub and buff" the drab item came alive.  As it turns out I'm happy that the item wasn't returnable, because after the 'makeover" the two of them together now look fantastic on my wall.	1
I used this on old picture frames with gesso.  It is a beautiful color and it goes a long way. It definitely does the job.  I am using it on other crafts such as wax seal and added a little color to it.  Good price.	1
Super nice to add that extra unique touch to any handmade specialty cards.	1
Good stuff.	1
Used to color a pleather jacket.  It rubbed on evenly and stayed well.  The silver color has an excellent shine!  It is a very tiny tube so read the description before purchasing.	1
5 stars	1
I can't believe how little of this metallic paint it requires to get the intended result. I even used it on black duct tape for a very cool effect. It's a great product.	1
Great stuff!	1
Great product	1
Has a bluish cast, but that varies depending on what surface material it is applied to.	1
Love it!	1
I have used these Rub 'n Buff paints for many years on several types of projects. It is very easy to use and you can easily control where and how much it is applied. It is not super shiny but I have used it on frames,on black painted bisque fired bas reliefs to give the look of bronze plaques (see photo) and a resin frog placed outside, painted to look bronze. That one I repaint every 4 years, not because it has flaked or peeled but because rain has worn it away.	1
Maybe I did it wrong but I did not get the desired effect that I had hoped for.	-1
Great stuff!	1
Use this on thrift store finds all the time - a quick and stylish update!	1
Perfect for repairing a chipped plaster statue. Easy to use and the color matches perfectly. Lucky me.	1
Better than expected! I want other colors now! So glad I tried it out, gave a few items so much more character, lovely pewter items seeming so dull and dirty (even after a fantastic cleaning) touched and rubbed and it was amazing. I highly recommend this. Follow the instructions!	1
Many years ago I had successfully used Rub'n Buff to restore an antique mirror frame, and so when I needed something to add a soft gold finish to some raw smooth wood I chose this product again. The result is very smooth, and even, and pretty! I was glad to see that the product is still of such good quality! The Gold Leaf color is just beautiful!	1
Cool stuff	1
Very cool stuff, takes a little while to get the right finesse on how much it too much and such. Cool product though. Enjoying the way it looks on the finished products.	1
It's "gritty" and doesn't apply well.	-1
A tube of this stuff goes on for quite a while. I bought it to repaint some toy guns, but I've used it on three or four other projects so far and I'm maybe halfway through the tube. Washes off my hands pretty easy. As long as you buff it out pretty well on the surface you're covering, it shouldn't rub back off on everything it touches. A little bit will go a long way and the finish on it is great.	1
This product works great has so many uses	1
Good color and nice to work with but be careful they have a strog smell	1
so SO excited to use this on Friday. If it turns out that it's not what I'm expecting I'll update this review but as it stands I'm expecting it to do the highlighting and accenting as promised. The price was better on here and I was unable to find it at AC Moore...	1
Use  very little ...it does not take much ...best put on with a small brush...Move the brush around and it will come off on to your project.	1
I have a concrete Christmas tree stand and also a large composite angel that I keep in my garden. Over the years they have been knocked, bumped and had dings in the finish. I took a chance that Amaco European Gold was the right color. It was. So easy to apply with a rag and you would never even see where a I covered up the dings. Because you can wipe this product on you can easily control how much you use. Hope this review helped someone as I know that working on new projects or old treasures can be challenging. I am adding a few other projects that I did with others colors.	1
Great Product.	1
This stuff is excellent! I have used it on several items that I have refinished. From lamps, to a dresser, and wrought iron mirror. Very easy to use, I actually just use my finger to apply.	1
This stuff gives a great realistic finish and it's very easy to use.	1
The title says it all. The product is fine but this seller didn't bother to ship the item until a WEEK after I had placed the order.	-1
This is NOT transparent. It has a white tint to it that really dulls the color under it. This would only have use if you're gluing two parts of clay that broke apart - and if you do, make sure all the extra glue spilling from the area is cleaned off or it will look terrible!	-1
If you could get the kink out of the plastic cable, these would be a good deal.  As it is, you have to work with the curling of the cable which can be tricky knitting in the round.  I will spend my money on more expensive needles that don't fight me like these do.  Disapointing.	-1
This kit is very cute, however, unfortunately the colors on the mat and the printed diagram do not match up, making it very confusing, frustrating, and impossible to complete accurately. Not at all fun, and a waste of time and money.	-1
Cannot use.	-1
Please stop saying that this will fit Necchi...........IT DOESN'T.	-1
This did not fit my sewing machine at all.  I thought it was a general items that fit most Singers or at least that is how I interpreted this product.  I was disappointed that there was not way to attach to my machine, especially since I purchased it for specific project I had started.  Oh well, back to gathering the old fashioned tried and true way for now.  It did ship well though and it arrived on time.	-1
this LOW SHANK product do not fit my low shank singer.  im very dissapointed as is not worth to pay more in postage returning this item to CHINA.	-1
You may get better results than I did, if you already know how to gild.  Mine came out terrible.  I tried following the directions, and I also tried without using the red basecoat (my surface was already sealed).  I got the same results both ways.  One thing that would have been helpful, and which I had to look up online elsewhere, is if the instructions stated that you're not supposed to try to burnish off the extra leaf until you let the size dry overnight.  If you're using this for something like lettering, it will smear.	-1
Well, I just had the chance to use this clipper.  I am not impressed.  The lock keeps engaging.  The screw that holds it together keeps loosening and the spring keeps popping out.  I had to have a screw driver handy  to keep tightening it after 5 or 6 clips.  I will be sending back.	-1
Not very sharp. I was surprised because I usually like this brand. I quit using & put in back of drawer. Don't waste your money.	-1
It would be much better if you picked these up locally. The ones I got were rusty and shipping them back would have cost more than just keeping and recycling them.	-1
Not very happy. These bent under very little pressure.	-1
I used the Heat It Craft Tool only 3 times before it quit working.  Waste of money.	-1
It puts out A LOT of heat but doesn't blow enough.	-1
I had an old Milwaukee heat embossing tool that I bought in 1994 that just died on me recently. I was devastated, that thing worked amazingly for 23 years! I used it regularly for maybe half of those years.  Anyway, off I go shopping for a new heat gun because I love embossing powder!  Ranger! Of course, they are an awesome company with many, many amazing card making products that I love to use!! So I buy their heat gun.  Worst Ranger purchase ever.  I am so disappointed that they put out a sub par product like this.  It takes FOREVER to melt all the embossing powder, IF AT ALL!  When it does melt the embossing powder, the heat is so indirect and sporadic, I'm aiming it over a section that still needs to melt, but it's actually reheating ANOTHER area thats already melted! Which means the EP is overheated and is flat and scorched and ugly.  I'm returning this junk and shelling out the cash for another Milwaukee heat gun, if I can find one!  I should've known better....	-1
Wow - just quit on me. It won't turn on. I've used it several times since I bought it 15 months ago, but not very often. I expected it to last a lot longer! Until now, I was quite happy with its performance. Sad to lose it. Now what do I buy to replace it? Not the same brand, that's for sure!	-1
I turned it on once, but would work after that. I sent back for a new one and it works fine for now. Think it was just a defect	-1
I know it says half ounce, right?? What it does not say is that the bottle is so tiny it is difficult to hold to apply or guide the glue where you want it to go.  I feel robbed.	-1
This is how it was when I opened if you look it also happened with another brand WHY	-1
Calling these "oil pastels" is a joke.  They don't blend or do anything more than a box of Crayola crayons.	-1
Pretty color, but the yarn seemed to separate easily so it was difficult to work with.	-1
First off, I love the color but I HATE the yarn. Beautiful color that is true to the picture, but the yarn itself is awful. It's constantly unraveling and near impossible to crochet for this reason. This might be good for a children's craft but the effort required to knit or crochet this yarn is not worth it.  It took me almost an hour to crochet two rows because the needle kept going between the strands of yarn (yes it's that loose).	-1
fair quality	-1
I have used this brand yarn before and was okay with it.  But this time I didn't like it.  I don't know if the manufacturer has changed something in the production of the yarn or if I have spent so much time with wool and handspun fibers that I've become a yarn snob.  Anyway, while working with this yarn to make a chemo cap I found the feel of the yarn to be too plastic-y.  It felt stiff.  I hope it will soften after washing.  The color, Neon Pink, was well named.	-1
I have used regular Caron yarn before and been pleased, but the Simply Soft yarn plys come apart very easily when I am crocheting. I would not buy again.	-1
Very disappointed when I received the yarn. The yarn looked old, the yarn that was exposed on the sides of the label was super fuzzy and piling, like it had been sitting on a shelf for years. The color was fine, but it is not useable because of the piling.	-1
The first time I bought this yarn, the color did not match the picture at all and I returned it. But this blue is much better. It's still not the same color as the picture...actual color is not quite so bright. But it made a lovely, easily washed blanket for my son. The best thing is to take a look at the yarn you like in person first before ordering it.	-1
I have been using Simply Soft Yarn for over a year now to crochet baby blankets.  I've found most of the colors I've purchased to be exactly as pictured until I purchased the Dark Country Blue.  It looks nothing like the pictured yarn.  The color is actually Navy Blue.  I checked the labels of all the packages and they are marked Dark Country Blue.  I also went to the manufactures website and the color on their website is not the color pictured here.  The color on the manufactures website is the exact color of yarn I received.  I wanted the yarn to make a soft prayer blanket as a gift.  I was very disappointed in the color.  I've purchased the yarn in several other colors that are true to the colors pictured. Off White Soft Pink Soft Blue Soft Green  I would give the yarn itself 4-Stars as it's easy to work with, soft to touch and has few to no broken/cut yarn in the skeins.  I can't find any yarn brands now that do not have cut, broken or tied yarn in many of the skeins.  I've only found one skein of the many Simply Soft Yarn skeins I've purchased to have broken strands and that was the Soft Pink.  If you have seen the yarn prior to purchase and know what to expect as far as color the 6 oz Skein is a good value.  Just know that some of the colors pictured may not be accurate.  In the future I will order only one skein of a color I've not seen in person before purchasing large quantities for a specific pattern.	-1
I really love the colors offered, however there are always flaws that have to be cut out .  There seems to be inconsistencies of thickness throughout the skein. I find this with every skein I have bought of this brand. Walmart, Micheals,Joanns.	-1
The colors shows bright and its dingy pale yellow. I am not using it.	-1
Nice silky texture initially, but it got rough after a few washes. The price is good, but will not buy again.	-1
Horrible condition.  Knots everywhere, pulls, frays, yarn coming apart, other colors if yarn fuzz intertwined,,,,,.  What a waste of money.   I gave it two stars because it is soft and the color is nice but other than that, its crap.	-1
fair in quality	-1
I ordered this for my sewing notions. It arrived damaged. Upon inspection I noticed that the hinges are not very sturdy and are part of the lid; in other words, they are hinged with very thin plastic. This will not be very durable as the plastic will "fatigue" and bread very quickly. Returned and chose not to re purchase	-1
These are impressive shears. I ordered and paid for two, but received just one. Please send the other one to complete this order.	-1
These are okay but they're hard and hard to put on the hooks. I ended up slitting the side of one and putting it on the hook. I wouldn't buy these again. Arthritis grip aide tubing works better.	-1
HATE, HATE, HATE.... oh did I say hate this product? They are impossible to put on your needles and yes, I followed there EXACT instructions with the "drop" of dish washing soap and they still do not fit.  I would send this horrible things back if I had kept the packaging and one of the cushions was not STILL stuck on the end of my FAVORITE needle.... I hope any and all to avoid these horrendous things!	-1
Had a hard time putting these on my crochet hooks. Would not purchase again.	-1
Not worth buying	-1
useless as they would not fit on my hooks- not even my small ones.	-1
It's soooo small, it won't fit any hook.  I broke one of my hooks trying to get this on :(	-1
It worked fine until I broke it	-1
I did not like the feel of these hooks. They were extremely light and felt very cheap. I also thought the soft touch would mean that the frips were soft to the touch, but they were solid and hard. I sent these back almost immediately.	-1
I was supper excited to get these today and a hook is broken in half and all that was in the packaging was the handle. Very disappointed in this purchase.	-1
Wasn't what was expected	-1
much thinner than advertised and unravels easily	-1
Cheap ribbon	-1
So upset! This ribbon is NOT the same size. Really want my money back for this. The ribbon I received was very very smaller then this picture!	-1
I don't like the way it feels in my hand. Because the handle is sorta flat and not rounded it doesn't turn and manipulate like it should when I crochet with it. Gave me cramps in my hand	-1
I have been crocheting for decades. I use an overhand or "knife" grip. I've always been happy with the Susan Bates metal hooks. Based on the reviews, I decided to try this product. I used acrylic worsted weight yarn. I didn't find it any more comfortable than my other hooks. It was actually a little cumbersome for me. It wasn't especially soft or cushioned.	-1
conflicting reports from the page and the sellers and images about what sizes these needles work for. my package has smaller purple triangles for US sizes 11-15 (8-10mm needles) and larger red triangles for US sizes 17-19 (12.75-15mm needles). even though the article number from clover is the same the text info on the packaging is different, and maybe the sizes have changed and gotten smaller considering my colors are also swapped.  but since i can't use these on my 19mm/US35 needles, which is why i purchased them, they're hardly what i would consider jumbo - especially by CYC standards.	-1
NOTHIN	-1
I did not like this hook as the neck was too short and the handle was awkward for me to hold. I hold my hook like a knife, and I feel this would be better suited for those who hold theirs like a pen. I ended up returning mine and went with the clover hook-which I LOVE!	-1
These are hard plastic and will not "stretch" over my loom pegs like other markers I've gotten. I gave them away to someone who does crochet.	-1
I HOLD A HOOK LIKE A KNIFE, AND WITH THE SHAPE OF THIS HANDLE IT REALLY DOESN'T WORK WELL FOR ME. I WAS SEARCHING FOR A HOOK THAT WOULD ALLOW ME TO CROCHET LONGER WITHOUT DISCOMFORT AND THIS ONE REALLY ISNT IT. I NEED A MUCH MORE SUBSTANTIAL HANDLE TO WRAP MY HAND AROUND TO AVOID PAIN.	-1
This is green and see through. Not the old Chibi look. Not even labeled Chibi. Just says Clover.	-1
Wonerful tool to have but does not turn easly and thin and flimsly, still usable but could be made much better quality	-1
These are not as secure as the long cone shaped options.	-1
They wouldn't stay on my needles.	-1
dont like at all. not long enough hooks, will not buy again	-1
this is not at all what I was looking for.	-1
I will never know how to use this.	-1
I can make these easier with cardboard.	-1
Doesn't cut my yarn easily, takes some work to get it to cut.	-1
Not good...won't let the yarn go through the needles  .it trys to bend when using it .so this product doesn't even deserve 1 star.  It is just a waste of money...big piece of crap!	-1
not what i thought it was.	-1
While they are just fine as markers if you like hard plastic markers.  My preference is for rubbery flexible ones that are easier to handle and tend to not fall off the needles so easily that you have to go looking for them all the time.  They are fine otherwise, just not my preference.	-1
These are completely worthless---they pop right off the needles.  Don't bother!	-1
These are ok but small. The description should have said " for DPN'S"	-1
These popped off any size needle I put them on.  Just didn't work for me, but I use nickel-plated needles.	-1
I'm very disappointed.  Had these on my 9" circular needles size 1 and thought they were snug.  Not so much.  They popped off and I had to frog 20 rounds of lace knitting for my socks.  Not a happy camper.  I'll be putting these in the circular file.	-1
I'm not sure if I got a defective set, or not.  I tried several different size needles with these.  The protectors would not stay put on any of the needles.  I'm really disappointed in these.	-1
These work fairly well, but don't stay on very well.  Should have a deeper hole for the needle to fit into.	-1
Perhaps I will find a use for these for other projects; but although they appear to fit needles for both of my current projects well, I find at least one of the needles has disengaged when I return to pick up the project.  And I'm not talking about putting the project away in my knitting bag for hours or days later.  I'm talking about leaving the project for 10-30 minutes or so.  I use circular needles so perhaps the tension of the needles spurs a release from the close fit. I won't risk using them now because I've already dropped too many stitches because of them.  AND they are large enough to obstruct my small dogs if one of them were to eat one of these.  I'm very careful with my regular point protectors but they don't fall off.  These are simply too unreliable and I fear one will find its way to the floor within easy reach of my dogs.	-1
I really don't like this threader. There is only one circumstance where it is the one that I grab. That is really small needles. The wire is so fine you can hardly see it and that makes it very limp. The weight of a needle alone is enough to bend it and have it fall over, dropping your needle if you don't hold both at same time. The opening is also much smaller than other threaders... and if you look at my history. You will see that I've pretty much bought most of the threader options here on Amazon. This is probably my least favorite.	-1
Ripoff	-1
Kinda useless.  They don't fit well on any size needle.  Save your money and buy regular ones	-1
Looked like a infighting to make room poms until I tried using it while following the so So called Directions.  Wasted enough yarn and time.  Won't mess with it again.  Would give it zero stars if I could.  And yes, I realize it is  probably just my thickheadedness to blame.	-1
I wouldn't recommend this product.  And I paid too much for it.  Not much room for additional needles (although the needles are nice quality), and the lid won't stay on.  plus the "ring " through which you'd thread something to tie the Chibi onto your basket/bag is on the lid, and helps the lid to pop off unexpectedly.  Look for a container in another line.  I found a bigger, tight closing/stay closed container at Walmart yesterday.  Half the price, too.	-1
The case is lovely, the hooks are quality crafted and comfortable....until.....you have been crocheting for 15-20 minutes or more. That's when I noticed that the hook was short enough to be poking into my hand painfully. I have smallish hands, only 5'3" and not heavy-set through the bones, and yet, this set of hooks are all too short.  I don't understand why anyone would pay more money so you can suffer while crochet? Clover makes another set of comfort hooks that are longer. I have two of those. But now I have wasted considerable amount of money on this set. If you crochet fairly seriously, please buy only one of these soft touch hooks before buying the set. Your hand may be small enough to fit the hook comfortably for long periods at a time.  I wish I had done what I am suggesting.  :-( Does anyone have any ideas on how I might extend them a bit? I may try a rubber pencil grip on the end. Hope thus review helps you. Happy crocheting!	-1
This was a big disappointment! The directions are not very good at all. They have different languages that is nice but should be easier to read. Should have made a booklet of the different flowers one can make and how to do it.	-1
Love these, too!  They neef miles of yarn.  Furry & eyelash yarns won't hold upright, in my experience.  But it works as an accent.	-1
Too small. too wobbly.  fall of needle too easily.  they slip through the loops too easily.  bad bad d esign.  glad I didn't pay very much.  think they were part of an add on	-1
Do not buy this ridiculous thing.  At Walmart I bought immune system booster tablets that fizz in water.  When they finished I used the round tube that the tablets came in.  Much sturdier and more volume than this ridiculous thing.	-1
Did not like the clover pom pom maker at all....the winding part is easy enough.....but its difficult to tie it off tight enough to hold it together nicely.  And its difficult to cut it thru if your scissors are not very sharp.	-1
This is the only thing I have purchased thru Amazon that I have ever been disappointed in. It didn't last more than a day before it broke. It doesn't fit on all sizes of needles which I found out the hard way when I switched from a smaller size to a larger size .  Only talking about a size 6! I can see how a much bigger needle would be a problem. But a 6? It only fits on the back end of one needle so when I finished ea. row I was constantly having to remember to manually change the number of row I was on . That's another thing... Having to turn the darn thing and having it roll around on the needle.. ... And forget about using it with circular needles.... For something that was supposed to help me keep track of rows.. I found it cumbersome and actually slowed me down. As I make items to sell this  becomes  a problem when time is money and you are on a deadline . Don't know if there is anything out there like this but what I would like is a counter that fits over your index finger. It would be extremely handy as you wouldnt have to search for the counter at the end of your needle the way you do now. So for now until I find a index finger counter .. Lol. ... I keep use paper and pen to keep track of rows ..very low tech but much faster .	-1
Really did not like it, hard to use and really have not used it since I bought it so gave it to my 11 year old niece	-1
I bought this Clover Small Pom Pom Maker and have tried and tried to make poms. Maybe I am still doing it wrong, but this little thing is not helping me.	-1
The notions contained in the pouch are great, but the zippered pouch broke and will not close now. The products inside the pouch are great.	-1
I have been knitting for 40 years and I bought these bobbins since I was doing an intarsia sweater.  I had never attempted intarsia, so thought the bobbins would be invaluable to keep all the yarns that are necessary for the pattern, in order.  They were not and instead were the cause of much frustration.  The bobbins do not hold the yarn securely...they were always unraveling no matter how many different configurations I tried in my futile attempt to keep them from unwinding.  When they weren't unwinding, they were knocking in to each other because they are rather wide.  I learned that if you are doing intarsia...you can either use the clip clothespins or even better...just cut the yarn to about 18 inches and let it hang behind.  Much easier to just pull the yarn through each time than to deal with bobbins.  Save your money.	-1
If you need this bobbin for yarn, it is way to small.  I don't think you could wrap medium-weight yarn around it 10 times because of the size.	-1
I was disappointed with this flower maker. The directions are pretty vague so I was not able to make a flower. I am planning to see if you tube has any video demos, because I cannot figure out how to sew the center of it. It just says "weave the thread throught the center" Huh? So for now, I have not made a flower, though if I could get it to work I know i would like to make flowers for my knitting. I recommend you pass on this item for now.	-1
These hooks are a pain in my hand!!!  If you don't use the pencil hold (aka the dainty hold) for your hooks, these NEED to be avoided!!  Not only are the "handles" too short, they are also too FLAT!!!  If you have carpal tunnel or hand fatigue, these hooks will offer you no comfort whatsoever.	-1
Sunken in the middle as it was not stretched taughtly like canvas needs to be. This is supposed to be the "professional" grade of Windsor and Newton's canvas options. I would class it as beginning student canvas at best, and that's being generous in my opinion.	-1
UPDATE: The problem continues. Also if you continue to try twice to get the problem resolved Amazon who by the way fills the orders and is AWARE of the problem will ban you from continuing to buy on their site! Great company!  I  have read all of the comments written by this companies previous customers, Some, have received the six canvases that are advertised and many others have not. I just ordered from this company as well. I was hoping against all hope,since I had called prior to placing this order that, as the Amazon representative had told me that the problem had been fixed. and that the remaining negative comments were old and should not concern buyers anymore. I ordered with confidence due to this assurance. Unfortunately, since I received only one canvas in a huge box it has not. This is a shame because the one canvas they did send was of excellent quality. I really want the rest of my six canvases at the price they are continuing to offer to this day.  I am having a hard time believing that Amazon continues to allow this to happen. I thought they would disqualify companies that had such poor business practices. I am waiting to hear what Amazon plans to do regarding this repeated problem. I have been an extremely loyal customer to Amazon for years, and am very anxious to see how they handle this matter.  The two stars are for the five missing canvases. They would have received five stars if all of the canvases had been shipped.	-1
I'm sure this is very high quality canvas and wood. But it's hardly "stretched." And it doesn't come with tightening keys to tighten it yourself. The artist is left to his/her own devices to get this canvas tight. Sometimes wetting with water will do, sometimes product is needed. And the single-thick stretcher frame doesn't really make for a stand-alone piece, like a 1-1/2" frame does. I never thought I'd give a Winsor New2ton product a low review, as I love their other products and give everything else I've used of theirs 5 stars usually. Maybe stick to paint and brushes? And why is this in Office Supplies instead of Art Supplies?	-1

i recieved this item in a smaller package then expected, as it seems there is an error in the labeling it is for only one canvas not 6, other then that the company was good at giving me a quick refund so i am happy, one last thing to add is the canvas is not as tight as i like them but good quality.	-1
As a beginner, I really don't know how to use these.	-1
Nothing but plastic safety pins. They're awkward to close, snag the yarn in the catch (causing unsightly "pulls"), and  - the worst feature for me -- are made of a brittle plastic that doesn't take many openings and closings before it shatters. I was constantly tracking down the sharp broken bits to prevent them from being a hazard to my cat.	-1
I really like using markers that are close to the needle size and just slide along as I knit, to mark each repeat in my pattern. These fit that bill well as they have a few different sizes that work well for different needles, and don't have anything hanging off to get in my way. However, they break FAR too easily for me. I have some other stitch markers that are a harder plastic and none of those have broken, on my current project, I've already lost 3 of these to breakage. And in case you are wondering, I am still using a size that is loose enough to easily slide along my needle, I'm not trying to force them onto a needle that is larger than the marker is, so no excuse for them breaking so frequently. Keep in mind that soft plastic like this does degrade over time so I could have gotten a package that was old, but that still is a risk in buying these again that I would not want to take.	-1
Color and size are nice, but there is only one use: on the knitting needle and off. I cannot use them to mark areas in my knitting or crocheting because there is no way to open and close them. If I realized this, I would not have purchased them.	-1
There are two large creases across the labels where the backing is cut to make it easier to pull off but it interferes with printing.	-1
Not a big fan of this product.  It doesn't print well because of the sheets on the back and seems to crease on the Cricut.  It also seems as though it didn't hold color very great.  I use a Brother printer that prints wonderfully on other products.  I'm new to the vinyl/cutter world and recently purchased my Cricut Explore One.  I've done tons of research on what products are the best and I agree with them on this product.  If you found my review helpful please click "Yes".  Thank you!	-1
Do not buy. They are not clear. I am going to return them.	-1
Wasnt that happy with this.  Wanted to put it on toasting glasses with Mr. and Mrs on it or Bride and Groom.  Looked tacky once on the glass.  Just not the right stuff.	-1
It says it's clear, but it's not. It's like looking through a thin film. I wanted clear, totally.	-1
I should have read the reviews before purchasing this product. Not only does it get stuck in your printer the actual ink rubs off. It is not exactly "clear" more of a frosty color. Very hard to pull apart. Very hard to work with.	-1
Just didn't work for me. Clumsy. Couldn't adjust to be comfortable on my finger. Just another unsatisfactory thimble in my growing pile of misfits.	-1
This would have been a great item to have in your Sewing/Quilting supplies. I am a Crocheter, and I thought this would work for me, needless to say, it didn't work for what I needed it to do.	-1
This was good in theory but when I try to use it my thread always gets caught up in the adjustable band.	-1
I guess you get what you pay for!  This clay was old and hard right out of the package. I tore off a piece and worked with it over an hour.  It did not soften at all and I could not use it to make anything. I just had to throw it away.  Total waste of money.  Good thing it was so cheap!!!	-1
Does not stay closed	-1
I was unable to take the lid off without assistance...I know it's to be airtight, but maybe a 'tab' on the lid would have allowed me to get a good grip so I could have used it.  I returned it.	-1
These needles may work for many projects.  However, they do not work for huck/Swedish weaving on monk's cloth (too pointy) or on aida/huck fabric (too thick).  Quality-wise, they are nice needles.  Update (February 2017): I've begun doing huck embroidery/Swedish weave on huck toweling and thought that these needles would be perfect for that.  I found them to be far less than perfect!  The size is just right for use with this fabric, as is the bend in the tips.  However, the needle has to be constantly rolled in your fingers in order to get the tip in the correct (upright) position.  A size 22 or 24 tapestry needle is still my favorite choice for weaving on huck toweling, huck fabric and aida.	-1
If you are doing Huck or Swedish Weaving, these needles are too thick to pass through the floats in huck fabric.	-1
Sucks don't buy it....	-1
I don't know if it's clay or if it's us. This is the third kind of air clay we've tried to make a big ass solid project but it keeps cracking. we were trying to make a replica of majoras mask from the zelda series, so we start making a huge heart, perfectly molded together, no air pockets, no nothing. and it cracks.	-1
Kids find it Softer & easier to work with, but Breaks easily once dried! Huge disappointment for kids who put a lot of time & effort making their creations.	-1
I thought I was ordering an "air dry clay", meaning one that didn't need to be fired to become hard.  Because it has to be fired, I don't know what to do with it.  So it sits in the cupboard.	-1
First thing first... this is an amazing product! I had no idea how to rate this product because the product itself deserves a 5 star!! I rated it one star because of the actual product I received.  I purchased this one to replace the one I used up. However the one I received looks used or from a defective batch. Its normally supposed to be filled to the brim and cannot be taken out of the container so easily. I did call amazon and they did give me a full refund.	-1
This was used when I had it delivered to my home. It was half way empty. This stuff is usually amazing and is too expensive to be getting half empty containers.	-1
I was using these on thin leather with #277 nylon thread and the eyelets broke on all the needles.  Perhaps my application is more severe than they were designed for, but they did not work for me.	-1
This is made of aluminum or something like it. It does not go through thick layers of fabric. The tips are dull and not sharp enough. I imagine for thin fabrics it may be acceptable, however, with the dullness I think it would tear thin fabric.	-1
The batting was separated into pieces, not even 36" each. I was very disappointed.	-1
Like our money, it seems eight inches isn't really all that much anymore. These scissors are smaller than they seem by description or web picture, and the handle openings are for the smallest hands. More like doll clothing scissors. The quality seemed ok but just unusable except for use in tight places of fabric, or even for general kitchen or desk use. Had to return. Thanks for amazon Prime.	-1
Within 2 uses the gold paint came off, and I'm  allergic to the metal underneath	-1
Point on scissors not plated on one side. They don't cut well. Will be returning for refund	-1
I've had several Hot Glue Guns, and one of the biggest problems is that they break open inside, and fill with glue- which ruins them. That can be prevented if you let them get REALLY HOT prior to using. I plug this one in, then let it sit for 20 minutes. Even waiting that long to 'Pre-Heat' , you sometimes have to probe the tip with a wire, and  g e n t l y  squeeze out the glue. Once it's working, it works normally, but I think it should be more 'user friendly'.	-1
Messiest glue gun I have every used. Leaks horribly. Threw away.	-1
Piece of trash.  Save your money.  I even bought their brand of glue sticks (at extra expense) and it still didn't work. The trigger did not work.  You have to push the glue stick forward with a pencil or screw driver....and then they are ruined.....can't be used anymore as they have glue on them.  Total waste of money.	-1
Third item that I had ordered in a bundle and did not know about a prop 65 warning I will not use this item either but it also came as promised and in good shape.	-1
A fail for me. Using a regular chalk is better than this.	-1
This probably was the most wasteful item I've ever bought. Just buy chalk LOL	-1
It's a wonderful fantastic concept, unfortunately it ONLY works well on heavy very tight knit fabric (where it worked pretty good for the first day), it only worked for a few minutes on fleece and t-shirt material without a ton of swearing and do overs. :( And even then, it only worked so, so. I think it's back to a chalk pencil for me.	-1
I have to roll it over two or three times before anything comes out, and even then it's not consistent.  Will not buy again.	-1
I've had a great deal of trouble finding a decent marking method for sewing. I usually use the fine-tipped purple fabric pens that fade over a few days. There are times, however, when the purple pen isn't appropriate. On formal fabrics, for example, it doesn't always fade quickly enough, and you really can't spritz silk taffeta with water to remove the marks. And for my students, those pens aren't any good, because the marks will have faded by the time they return for their next weekly class. I usually have them use the blue fabric pens instead, which must be rinsed out with water, but they tend to be rather pale, as if the pens are half dried-out. And again, sometimes you want to use fabrics that can't get wet. Chalk pencils would be great, except that these days, most have an oily base, which stains your fabric. The dry chalk pencils that easily brush off are hard to find.  I'm always on the lookout for a better marking solution, so when I saw the Chaco Liner being used in a couture sewing class I took, I ran to order one. The "pen" has a reservoir filled with a fine chalk-like dust (which can be ordered in several different colors) and there's a serrated wheel that distributes the chalk dust when you draw a line. I like how it draws a very thin line, without much effort on your part. It's easy to use, and if you have long sections to mark, like when you're making bias strips, or outlining a pattern, it's great. It's not so good for small things that need to be marked, however, like notches and dots. That's inconsequential, though, because the marks it does make are not easily removable.  I drew a few test lines on some unbleached muslin, then attempted to brush the lines away. It's a fine chalk dust, so it should have easily brushed off. It smudged a bit, but that's about all it did. I tried repeatedly to remove the marks from my fabric, but they wouldn't budge. This is a fail, because I need something that's easily removable, particularly for fabrics that you can't spritz with water.  The Chaco Liner might work great for some people, especially if they have different requirements for their fabric markers. But it doesn't work for me. I'll give it two stars, since I did like how easy it was to draw a straight line with it. Not recommended, unless you're marking something that can be tossed in the washing machine to rinse the marks away. Even then, I would test a scrap of your fabric first, just to be safe.	-1
regret to buy it,,, color/power doesn't come out, jammed all the time	-1
This sounded good from the reviews--I can't get it to work, no matter what I do.  I will just stick to a regular making pen.	-1
Loose powder all over the fabric. Not what I was Looking for. Can not Call it a pen liner, sounds like it Writes fine on fabric.	-1
At $5.63 as an add on item this is not a good buy.  You can buy these books at Walmart for the same price or less.	-1
THE PAD WAS DEFECTIVE. A FOLD INDENTATION ON THE PAGES. REPLACEMENT HAD ABOUT 50% THE SAME DEFECT. I HAVE ORDERED THIS PAD BEFORE AND IT WAS JUST FINE. I REALLY LIKE THE SIZE AND QUALITY. I THINK THIS WAS JUST A BAD BATCH THAT GOT OUT. I HAVE THE SAME PAD IN A LARGER SIZE, IT WAS JUST FINE. I WILL ORDER THIS AGAIN AT ANOTHER TIME. I EXPECT THE PRODUCT WILL BE FREE OF DEFECTS NEXT ORDER. MY MONEY WAS REFUNDED AFTER 2ND SENT WAS ALSO DEFECTIVE. DISAPPOINTED, BUT BELIEVE THIS WAS JUST A FLUKE. HOPE THE COMPANY DOES BETTER QUALITY CONTROL IN THE FUTURE.	-1
I prefer a sturdier sketch book with better quality of paper.	-1
This notebook feels too big and loosely made. I ended up getting Pentalic Traveler Pocket Journal Sketch, 6-Inch by 8-Inch, Royal Blue which is far better made:  <a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Pentalic-Traveler-Pocket-Journal-Sketch/dp/B004MW59XK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Pentalic Traveler Pocket Journal Sketch</a>	-1
I did not read the label fully, I thought I was getting 12 water pencils. Disappointing only 8. My fault for not looking in detail	-1
Not at all what I expected. Sent it back	-1
Not used yet, not sure it is suited to what I needed, the length is not suitable on larger blocks	-1
tried to iron on and it didn't work.  got only the outline of a letter instead of the letters themselves.	-1
Difficult to remove the white letters from the white sheet, causing them to tear, and there were only 2 of each letter.	-1
No good they don't stick.	-1
Whatever	-1
Be careful.  These are 5/32" I needed 1/4" and these came up in my search.  I missed seeing the size on the pakage.  It was not in the description.	-1
Paper backing will not come off the fabric. I needed this today and instead I wasted my time and ink. I have used similar products many times and something is wrong with the adhesive on these sheets.	-1
Terrible!  The paper backing does not come off of the fabric.  I needed these labels TODAY and now I'm stuck--I will have to contact my customers and tell them they're orders will not be ready on time  all because Printed Treasure's Printable Sew-On Labels are defective.  I had heard so many good things about this product so I trusted that they would work without having tried them sooner.  I won't make that mistake again.  I've been trying to contact the company because supposedly they have a one year warranty, but their number keeps ringing busy.  I am so disappointed.	-1
I did not buy this product on Amazon, but I would buy it on Amazon if it worked well. First of all, let me say that if the product is old, it will be difficult to peel the paper off the back. My experience is about getting the product to work with my printer, an Epson PhotoStylus 200. The instructions say that photo ink is not as brilliant as regular ink, but I'm just trying to use it to print labels for quilts, so I don't need really brilliant photo quality printing, however, my printer uses photo ink, so that is what my labels are printed with. The ink works fine for my purpose, but it is nearly impossible to get this paper-backed fabric to go through the printer without getting skewed or folding along the front edge. So I wasted two sheets before getting an acceptable label. Also, my advice is not to try to use the whole 8 1/2"x 11" sheet, keep your printing away from the top edge so that if the top edge folds over, you can still have a chance of the printing coming out ok. I hope these labels last a long time without fading because they are quite expensive sheets.	-1
this thread box was poorly packaged & the lid was crushed.  no protection whatsoever.  i live in the country of panama & would cost a fortune to return....so i will not.	-1
I needed to make a large button for HW vanity stool I have reupholstered. Unfortunately the button need to tuft the stool and it broke from the pressure after only one day. Very disappointing.	-1
So-So.	-1
Ordered by mistake, but kept them for later.	-1
The only thing 'heavy duty' about these are how to get them apart if they're accidentally snapped prior to putting them on cloth. I tried to put them on the edge of a coat and, even after pushing aside any 'stuffing' between the layers of cloth, there still wasn't room for the snap and backing to be hammered together - and I HAD also bought the tool specifically for that purpose. No instructions as to how all the pieces work together (thus the 'accidental' snapping). Worthless for this kind of job.	-1
Cheap and hard to install. Won't buy again.	-1
Cool design but NOT a easy one. Should be leveled up the pattern is not on the screen	-1
I love the colors of this cross stitch but actually I hate the pattern it is really difficult to sew with this kind of material !	-1
I liked the kit was very disappointed that there was not enough thread in a number of colors. I have been doing this type of needlework for years and have never run out of thread like this.	-1
Can't read the pattern as it is too small and blurry.  Tried enlarging it on copy machine but still unable to read the symbols, etc.	-1
I'm going to keep it and try to do it, but wow I underestimated the size of the squares! Not for the faint of heart, for sure!	-1
Just goes to prove the old adage, "You get what you pay for."  This floss is cheap and the various shadings are notr distinct.  Thread tangles & frays and the finished project often needs some repair after washing.  I hand embroider my own sketches for gifts, etc.  Won't buy this again.  FYI, I also saw this product at Hobby Lobby cheaper than Amazon which was a surprise.  I guess it would be OK if you had a beginner stichet and didn't want to spend $.39 per skein of floss.  taeg	-1
None of these colors matched. Waste of time. And money.	-1
more than normal tangles, breaks easily.  Lots of colors means lots of a few colors...shades not really distinct.  Will never buy again	-1
The thread is broken in at least one place in nearly every skein.  The thread does not separate well for cross stitch use.	-1
I was in search of a better hook then the Boyes or Bates and the reviews led me to believe these were considerably better and at least not priced as high as some others.  For me I don't like them.  In comparison to the Boyes and Bates hooks I have used for years I can say I notice absolutely no difference in crocheting; other than the annoying imprint of the size hook hitting my hand.  Glad they weren't a lot of money.	-1
These are not comfortable to use for long periods of time.	-1
I bought this from JoAnn Fabrics because someone said it was one of the best tape runners out there, but it's not.  Every time I use it, I have to double-check to make sure I am holding it right side up and 9 times out of 10 I'm not and have to flip it around before I can begin taping (what a pain!).  Half the time the tape doesn't come out, and I have to roll it and roll it to get it going again.  A third issue is that the tape is too wide for delicate, small projects such cardmaking and gluing thin strips of paper, so I end up using a fine tip bottle of glue instead.  I would not recommend this tape runner at all.	-1
The tape doesn't come of with ease. - keeping using the wrong side - the correct side needs to be more defined.	-1
Not very easy to use with paint! Does not come out like the stencil.	-1
Not a fan of this product.  It's so hard to use for a chalk board, which is what I bought it for.  I guess if it's used in some other medium it might work better...just not "chalk" lol	-1
I thought this was a tapered hook but it is inline. It is sturdy though so if your looking for a inline hook this would be good for you.	-1
Big hook, huge - but could be just a tad longer to help with size.	-1
They are very hard t push through even 2 layers of cotton, I ended up throwing them away	-1
I didn't like them because they were too short.  If they would have been longer they would have won my heart.  After a month or two of not using them, I gave them away.	-1
I didn't realize how small the heads of these pins were even though many reviews posted before mine talked about the size. I decided to post a picture so people could really see the scale. In the picture, the Wright glass head pin is on the left and a regular ball head pin is on the right.  I tried to use the Wright glass head pins for blocking knitted dish cloths; the pieces I blocked were wet and the pins rusted, staining one of my finished objects--which I had intended as a gift but had to keep instead. I would not purchase these again.	-1
Very Dull......Had to throw them out	-1
These pins ended up being too short and I can't return them.	-1
Not Glass Heads, plastic, melt under ironing, and not sharp enough, damaging to fabric.  Like the length and would be okay for felt projects.  But not what it stated for certain.	-1
I am disappointed to suggest you buy another brand.  The glass heads are nice.  However, the pins are exceptionally dull & a number of them just had a blunt cut and were not sharpened.  I purchased 4 packs & all were of  similar quality.  All were disposed of.	-1
I was going to make my daughter a sewing kit for her birthday, I love the glass pins because they don't melt. bought these pins and the package was bent, smashed, and taped because the package was probably opened and stepped on. I feel that any business should send out a quality product. I don't know what I'm going to do now. I don't want to spend money to send them back.	-1
Too tiny	-1
Right length for my needs, but glass heads are way too small for easy grasping.  Threw them away.	-1
These are not very sharp and difficult to place in delicate fabric.	-1
It took forever at least a week and those beads are not visible enough.. I can barely see them. Disappointed.	-1
the thing consists of two parts...i was trying to put it together for few days...then my hubby was making fun of me...I asked him to assemble the thing...he is an Engineer and he spend half of the day truing to figure out how to put this two together...anyways eventually it did not fit my Singer....	-1
Singer has went hell if they let them put the name on it this thing is worst thing ever seen .I found a original singerbonenand you can see the big diff its loosenthe slide on it fit is awful its almost impossible to set it ip and it set sqware on machines	-1
It's so annoying when the manufacturer doesn't provide a list of compatible machines for those of us who are new at this and unfamiliar with the parts. The part looks well made. However, even though the description said it works with Singer models which have a side fastening thumb screw, which my machine has, this can't be installed on my Singer 5050C. Even on the Singer website, the manufacturer provides zero guidance on how it looks when installed or how it's supposed to work. This is the second time I've ordered something online where it wasn't made absolutely clear that this would not work with my machine, and that information would have been so easy to provide to the customer ahead of time. So frustrating.	-1
I bought this at a local JoAnn store, and I will be returning it. It's a cheap piece of metal which is not made to very exacting standards, and in the case of the one I got, the out of tolerance amount made for a major problem. If you end up with one that was made correctly, you will be happy. I have a Kenmore 385.12618890. The slot by which this item attaches to the shank is a hair too wide for the side screw to attach the foot absolutely vertically. As a result, it comes down crooked. This causes 2 major problems: a) hardly any pressure on the item to be sewn, and b) plenty of space on one side of the foot, and not enough on the other. With the crookedness, the foot could not be adjusted to the right far enough for the needle to reliably clear it. As I said, if you get one that is made to within proper specs, you will be happy. If not, it will work badly, at best, or not at all. FYI, this is not my first use of a zipper foot.	-1
Cracks badly, not sure, but I must have bad brick of this clay.	-1
The clay I received is a dark grey color and not WHITE!!	-1
I ordered white but received a different color	-1
Horrible product. Complete waste of money. I'm assuming I may have gotten an old one that has sat on the shelf forever. I would hope they're not all like this.  First, its hard as a rock. I was able to pinch off a bit, but you cannot even roll it into a ball. It just crumbles away. Picture of my attempted ball is attached.  Instructions are printed on the package. But it doesn't really say anything about my case. I pretty much have a lump of useless clay.  I homeschool, and was hoping to use this for art.  Highly disappointed. Lesson learned. Will never buy this product ever again.	-1
Advertised as white and is light gray. I had no use for the gray one, other than that you can work with it but remember it's paper base and the end result will be flimsy.	-1
The tape is not adhering like it should. I've used fusible web many times so iron settings are correct.  Won't buy again.	-1
Never used it, still sitting in my sewing room.	-1
I do a lot of quilting and wanted to do a celtic design which called for bias stripping.  I needed the 1/4" webbing to adhere it to the blocks till they could be sewn down.  IT DID NOT WORK!  The adhesive did not stick to the bias tape and therefore was useless to my project.	-1
These blade cut great . Once . Then they need to be changed , and that is a challage not to cut your fingers off .	-1
The blade does not cut	-1
only was able to use it 3 or 4 times, then somehow it developed a bump in the center (just a little pregnant???) but that bump made it so that it was worthless for what it was designed to do...good Idea, wrong materials to create the item.   I heard somewhere that Fiscars offers lifetime warranty....if so, I could sure use it here, mine completely bubbled up in the middle, cannot use it for cutting AT ALL	-1
Dosen't fit my Fiskar Rotary cutter very well, but is usable.  Would not purchase again.	-1
Not happy with spring loaded. Now, it's tough to open & close the scissors...after a few uses.	-1
This was so well priced many people must have signed up to get it.  I  never received mine very unfortunately, and was quite disappointed.  The moral of the story is if the price is too good to be true you just may not get the item.	-1
horrible, was dull, did not cut well, I tossed it out, I would never buy it again.	-1
I thought this was a blade for a rotary cutter, but it is for scrapbooking.	-1
Does not cut through 2 layers of fabric.  Not what I'd hoped for.	-1
This blade works great, however, when I ordered it as the description states, they are ' 45mm Pinking Rotary BLADES', not a single blade. I was quite upset to pay as much as I did for a single blade. Don't be fooled by the description, as it is not plural, you are paying for ONE blade!  The quality is no better than any others out there as far as rotary blades go, and certainly not worth the extra cost. I would recommend one shop around for a better price and certainly ASK about how many you are buying before you order them!	-1
This is my favorite ruler when cutting fabric for quilts. Along with the June tailor shape cut ruler. This will help to have extra fabric when I need it.	-1
The blades for the cutting tool dull quickly.  The cutting mat IS NOT SELF HEALING!  There are now long gouges in the mat and even strips of it came up when I was cutting my fabric.  The rotary tool left pieces attached. I don't even want to use this product again.  I did not purchase it through Amazon.  I purchased it at a local craft store but threw my receipt away.  I will go back to using scissors and chalk lines.	-1
No better than the regular fiskars for the price	-1
I'm on the search for a new company who can make a quality cutter.  We have used these same cutters for years, only they were dark gray, but this new ones they are selling in light gray to replace the older style, is cheap trash, and only good if you plan to use it a few times.  We use these in our home business so need them to stand up to service daily for years of use as the old ones did.  This new cheaper design lasted just a few months and now the blade nut comes lose every time you use them,and the safety button will no longer hold.  I see someone else said they were sending her a new one.  Not sure why that would be a good thing.  Trash is trash	-1
I purchased this item by mistake, I thought it was the rotary cutting blade, I'm sure its a great product	-1
I've used fiskars products for years and was very happy with them.  When I needed a new pair I bought these.  The safety lock to hold them closed broke within the first 5 minutes of using them and the blades just weren't sharp. I had already started using my old pair of Fiskars spring loaded scissors for paper and they were still sharper than the new pair.	-1
I am so disappointed with this rotary cutter.  I even bought new blades for it, thinking it was the blade that wasn't sharp enough.  I'm only cutting through one layer of t-shirt material and one layer of lightweight interfacing, and it takes several passes, which pretty much shreds and ruins my cuts.	-1
I have only used this rotary cutter a couple times.  It seems to drag on the fabric and not cut.  I changed the blade, and it worked a little better for an hour or so.  I am making a quilt, and it started dragging again, so I tried to change the blade.  And I couldn't get the blade off!  We have a pair of fiskars scissors that have worked perfectly for years.  I'm going to try and get these replaced, and if the next pair works I will change my review.	-1
ok	-1
have used it yet	-1
Didn't work for my purposes. I had a hard time keeping the blade straight while cutting paper. Reverted back to my exacto knife and metal ruler.	-1
doesn't cut material very well ... will not ever purchase again	-1
poor quality and stiff scissors.	-1
I rather have the scissors, not very handy because it took me 3 tries to cut over 1 piece of fabric (muslin).  i will stick to my old time scissors.	-1
I had one of these years ago but I lost it . I was using just fine and it totally fell apart	-1
I'm a huge Fiskars fan, but these scissors stink. The little orange dot that you see on the side in the photo is what you use to hold the blade in place while you cut. Mine keeps retracting into the body of the scissors so the blade retracts into its storage position. When that happens, the fabric jumps and then I have to work to realign everything to keep cutting. It happens every second or so when I try to cut. Very, very frustrating. So I can't use the product anymore.  I contacted Fiskars and they are sending a replacement, which is nice. I have to wait two weeks, which means no sewing for two weeks. Arg.	-1
My recommendation after purchasing them is I do not recommend wasting either your time or money on this.  The blade does an ok job for a short time.  The cutter itself hurts your wrist after about 20 minutes of usage. I gave mine to the Salvos.	-1
Way Too Dull	-1
Ok, I am a new quilter, first time user of a rotary cutter so maybe I am doing something wrong.  After reading reviews, plus the price was right I purchase the Fiskars 45 cutter.  I am disappointed: 1. the release button is easy to hit while pressing down cutting, very frustrating. 2. I could not get a good cut through more then 1 layer of material. I ended up using scissors.  Sorry Fiskars, I know the products you make normally are quality, this one was not.	-1
Did recieve a measure, and it's fine, but it's yellow and it is not Singer.	-1
i love the design but it doesnt hold the paper in it correctly so it punches  a little bit off making a weird shape :/	-1
Doesnt cut well.	-1
Got this for deco mesh, 4 cuts blade dull, not what I was needing it for	-1
I purchased this item and got something else in the mail. I suppose it's my fault for not reading carefully enough. The item pictured in the listing is not what you get. I guess that's a more expensive one with a soft grip. My picture is the one that came. It's an okay cutter. Way better than scissors. But I'm very disappointed as I thought I was getting something else. This is a picture of what I received.	-1
I got this to round the corners after I trimmed my Crystal Visions Tarot deck.  It's pretty simple and easy to use.  Some of the corners didn't turn out as nice as others but the scissors took care of that.  I love my deck so much better now that I have gotten rid of the borders.  I think that although the medium rounder worked fine the smaller one might have worked a little better because a little bit of the wording was trimmed off on the High Priestess card.  No matter I still am happy with the results.  Update:  While trimming my 4th deck the corner puncher has started to jam so badly I'm afraid I will not be able to finish my deck.  Once I get through it I will toss this in the trash where it belongs.	-1
I used this to cut out one dress pattern in a light weight knit.  It didn't cut through any paper, roll over a pin, etc and it's already dulled.  Second project I used it for was very thin quilting cotton.  Even cutting a single layer, it doesn't cut evenly, leaving irregularly spaced pieces that are just nicked on the top surface.  I changed the blade and it didn't last any better. Worst of all, the blade snaps shut while I'm using it ALL the time.  I test the large button to make sure the blade is fully extended and locked in place but it still snaps back sometimes.  At first, I thought I was hitting the release button (which is under my hand when I hold the cutter comfortably) but I changed my hand position and the blade still snaps shut. I have one last replacement blade from the pack I bought, then this is probably getting tossed.	-1
Fantastic golden color.  Used for tie-die, gives shades of pale yellow to gold. --->> Updated review.  These Rit dyes are terrible.  After about 20 washings, in cold water, these still bleed yellow on everything. You don't just have to wash darks with darks - you have to only wash yellow things with yellow-dyed items. Also, the very nice tie-dye patterns I had to start are mostly gone, as the yellow has faded from the bright areas, and bled into the pale areas.	-1
I use a Clover pressure-sensitive rotary cutter.  Fiskars blades do not work well in the Clover cutter, though they appear identical to the ones from Clover.  Perhaps the difference is that the Fiskars blades are made in China and the other blades are made in Japan.  Despite the high price of rotary blades, I simply gave these away and got the good ones (which do work well in the Fiskars cutters!)	-1
I followed the directions perfectly, and it turned out purple. Maybe because the material I was dying was a blend?	-1
The advertising says "60-inch, flexible and durable vinyl tape measure".. which I have purchased before and that was smooth and soft on the skin... BUT THIS, actual package. says "60 in long FIBERGLASS"!! Made in CHINA!  It itches, scratches, and infuriated me!! The worst thing is they look alike from a distance, but this is NOT smooth soft pliable cool to your skin vinyl, it's anything but!! This is not one to buy blindly online!  And to further irritate me, this tiny little tape measure, all rolled up arrived in a heavy padded 14 INCH by 15 INCH Flat plastic mailing envelope!	-1
I tried this on a small piece of nylon I wanted to dye black, and it tinted it purple... This was just a removable strap, so I could get an idea of how it would work. I heated the water up, but it just didn't take well.  There is still enough left to attempt the item I want to do (LBV vest), but I'm not sure if I should bother. I'd rather have an ugly CP pattern, than a tinted purple CP pattern :3  I may try again with hotter water, and with a bunch of vinegar to help it bite into the fabric.  It was 3 bucks, so it's not a total loss.. But i'm still frustrated. It's drying now and I made a bit of a mess.	-1
I replaced a Clover rotary cutter with this one and it is just okay.  The button to open the blade works well.  The problem is the button to close the blade is right where my thumb is when I am using the cutter (I am right handed).  When cutting, it is very easy to push the button to close the blade.  This is very frustrating and may be a fatal flaw for this cutter.	-1
I used this dye on 100% cotton muslin, following directions exactly.  It ended up purple.  Not purplish grey, just purple.  I now have 12 yards of purple fabric instead of grey.	-1
They suck. No straight lines. Useless.	-1
Did nothing to change my closes.	-1
there was something wrong with these blades.  i suspect they were reconditioned and passed off as new.  just a suspicion but i'll purchase these in a store next time and not online.  i'd just say buyer beware	-1
It retracts itself sometimes while in use and it likes to let the blade come loose....defeats the purpose of trying to keep crisp clean edges on fabric. Will keep searching for a better version.	-1
I had really wanted to try these before purchasing however, I'm the only one who sews in my family! I bought this and the first day the blade fell apart! I've put it back together over and over again to no avail. No more Fiskars for me!	-1
I followed the directions to a tee and this dye did absolutely nothing!  Don't waste your time or money on this!	-1
I purchased this particular rotary cutter because I beginning a new hobby and did not want to spend much on "just a rotary cutter" .. BIG MISTAKE The fiskars blade was blunt and I had to go two - three times just to get 2 layers of fabric cut which ended up being uneven cuts with a lot of waste. I was so frustrated at the end of day 3 and decided to ask a friend who lent me her Gingher and needless to say it worked way better! As much as I would have like this quilting set to work for me I decided to return it and buy a Gingher instead. I went beyond making the 3 initial quilts I had planned and enjoy quilting :) My advice would be to test out a variety of rotary cutters if you can before you buy one. If you are serious about your hobby I would suggest you invest in something more worthwhile.	-1
These rotary cutters are terrible!  They hardly cut through one piece of fabric.  While they worked well when I first got them, they dulled quite quickly and I was only using them to cut fabric.  I know that the blade is replaceable, but I figure what's the point....I am sure it will only last as long as the last one.  I should have just spent the money on a decent rotary cutter.  I suppose you get what you pay for!	-1
I've been trying to cut the same Damn piece of fabric and all thus does is fray the sides.  I'm standing and leaning in and still these won't even cut through two flimsy pieces of flannel.  What the hell!	-1
I guess you get what you pay for.. this was definitely a cheapo item, and would have been better paying more for something better.	-1
I am very unhappy with this product, I finally got the material and started to cut the squares for a quilt and the advertisement and packaging stated it can cut through "multiple layers of fabric, paper, felt and vinyl". Well I tried 3 pieces of thin cotton and it would not cut period, checked blade it is in correct, went to one layer and still have to run blade over the cut several times and it still would not cut through the material, had to finish some cuts with scissors. Not impressed with this expensive piece of junk	-1
Fhe color is just awful. Not what I would call apple green. It was muddy green not crisp and spring like I imagined. Made for a barely passable Katerina Kittycat costume	-1
They are very hard to manuver around corners and you have to push very hard to get them to cut.	-1
I bought this for my wife received it very fast just one problem the blade was so dull it wouldn't cut hot butter. Had to go to Wal-Mart and pay $5.99 for a new blade which is not good since the cutter was $ 7.00 so one star it is. Would have been better off just buying one from Wal-Mart she's looking for other sewing accessories but not from Fiskars.  Update, they were were supposed to send my wife a new blade for this cutter on Nov. 20th still haven't seen it, can't take that long to ship a blade so goodbye to Fiskars she'll get her sewing supplies else where. Wasted money for a useless product and people wonder why this country is goung down the crapper. So if i could i'd give this seller no stars stay away from them if the customer sevice is this bad.	-1
Don't know if Olfa's are any better, but I can tell you that unless you buy a blade sharpener, plan on spending boo-coo bucks on blades just to finish your quilt.  And don't drop your rotary cutter on a hard floor, the blades will be totally messed up after that.  I'm sure that's true with any rotary cutter, so be careful.	-1
I used to have a rotary cutter that had a guard that was spring-loaded so the blade only came out when I pressed down to cut. That way I could slide the cutter sideways up to the ruler edge and cut. The blade on this one is always exposed and I have to carefully position it. It takes more time and I nick it on the ruler edge frequently. It has a comfortable handle, but that doesn't outweigh the drawbacks for me.	-1
I have four concrete reasons for not liking this particular tape measure. One's more subjective than the others, so let's get that one out of the way first.  This tape is 9/16" wide (aka one notch less than 5/8"). My previous tape, made by Dritz, is 5/8" wide, which makes subtracting/adding seam allowances a snap, and I'm sad to lose this handy little reference.  Less subjectively:  the metal end of this tape is lose, and it slides around on its rivet quite a bit. So for nice and accurate measurements, I use the 1" mark as the start and subtract an inch from number that I read on the tape. Super annoying. It's an indicator of low quality, and it's frustrating to use.  Next, the tape has inches on one side, centimeters on the other. The numbers on each side of my old Dritz tape start from opposite ends of the tape, so no matter which end I pick up first, it's the "beginning" of the tape, and I can start measuring. But with this Singer tape, the numbers on each side start on the same end -- so I have a 50/50 chance of grabbing the "end" of the tape (noting that there's some blank space at the end of the tape, so I can't even just use that and do the math), and then needing to find the other one to actually start measuring. Which is extra annoying when I'm holding a seam closed with one hand, or when I have it draped around my neck and the "end" of the tape is handy, so I have to pull the other end across my body uncomfortably. If that makes sense.  And finally -- the marks on each face don't match up precisely. Since the numbers start counting from the same end of the tape, when you look at the tape from the side, you'd expect to see inch markings coming from exactly the same spot on the tape. But on this, they're noticeably off -- roughly 1/32". Not a huge deal, as this isn't the tool you'll want for precision but, c'mon! Again, it's just low quality.  I can't believe I care enough to write such a thorough review of such a simple tool, but apparently I do! I'm going to go order another tape from Dritz, and I'll throw this one in the household toolbox.	-1
This dye does not dissolve in hot water well and creates uneven dyed clothes.	-1
This worked just as good as the powder. Not a uniform dye. I would not recommend this to anyone. I followed the instructions and it turned out almost like I was trying to tie dye the 3 onesies that we tried to dye. Next time I will just by the clothes the color I want them to be from the beginning.	-1
worked better than the royal blue but still didn't come out very strong and rinsed out first wash.	-1
Came out peach on plain white tshirts. Followed the directions completely. Terrible.	-1
Better off with a glue of some sort. I'm also not a DIY-er, and this was quite a bit of labor to get it to work properly.	-1
I tightened it and the blocks holding the screw started leaving the ring.  The blocks are merely stapled on.  It's Okay for a kind or beginner to get the feel, but you'll probably be buying another brand soon	-1
I had been looking for a pair of scissors with curved blades for trimming threads on quilts without risking cutting into the fabric.  I'd seen someone online using a pair of scissors that looked just like the photo on Amazon's webpage.  Unfortunately, Amazon's photo doesn't do a good job of showing the size of the scissors in comparison to someone's hand.  My hands are not abnormally large (wear a men's M or L glove) but the finger holes in the scissors were too small to get my thumb into.  The scissors may be OK for someone with small hands but I didn't bother to open them, I just returned them and will resume my search.	-1
Didn't dye the clothes the right color. Turned out to be a light gray and It pretty much ruined the clothes in all. Have to buy more black dye to make this at least wearable. And I followed all the instructions to a T.	-1
I'm not sure how anyone could give this more than one star.  I followed directions exactly and hemmed my uniform pants.  It came undone in the first wash.  I would definitely avoid.	-1
Ugly color	-1
Didn't alter the color of my black fabric, (which I needed more black) at all.	-1
poor quality scorrors for herbal needs. did not like them at all.	-1
Came out light blue on 100% cotton. I hade to re-dye with Azue Ble and turned out a nice jean color!	-1
color doesn't stay. bleeds and stains everything else. had to toss clothes i dyed.	-1
I thought I'd save some money by buying a white dust ruffle and dying it. I have never had a problem with Rit dye before but the bedskirt came out lavender!!!!	-1
Washes out quickly and bleeds	-1
Washes out quickly and bleeds onto other clothing	-1
Nothing changed color. Bleach spots were still there.	-1
Does not work. Tried two times. Maybe it's old.	-1
Color does not transfer well	-1
The color did not take.	-1
Followed instructions, pants aren't black..	-1
This is not brown, there is way too much red in it and it made my cotton products a mauve color instead of brown, it in no way matches the color on the bottle now I have to redye everything with a darker brown hoping that it will actually be brown.	-1
This comes out more of an aqua green rather than emerald. Lots of blue - I was hoping for more of a pure green.	-1
I used this on white cotton and it came out dark blue. It certainly doesn't look like the color on the container.	-1
I used this on white cotton and it came out very dark green. It certainly doesn't look like the color on the container.	-1
I used this on white cotton and it came out orange. It certainly doesn't look like the color on the container. It isn't even close to being yellow.	-1
I used this on white cotton and it came out red. It certainly doesn't look like the color on the container.	-1
If you want the color to be as it appears on the container - Don't buy this! I used it on white cotton and it came out like a brown-maroon color, which is nothing like the color on the container.	-1
This dyed my wool fabric ORANGE.  It was cream, wool shag fabric and I did exactly what the instructions said.  BRIGHT orange!  What in the world?  Wish I could get my money back or get some free rit color remover or something.	-1
this is not brown it dyed our organic cotton white sheets a reddish camel or sand color...now I have to figure out what to do to correct the color as it does not match our room. Very upset!	-1
This thread gave an uneven performance. I had to stop several times to rethread my Bernette 46 machine, because the thread broke and had to be rethreaded.	-1
I didn't order from Amazon, I just bought this along with the black dye from a local Joann's and I thought I would give my two cents and a fair warning. 1) I was lucky to have done countless research on dyeing methods before purchasing so if you want a true navy color I would suggest using a 2:1 ratio of navy to black.  2) The price here is ridiculous. $7.98 for an all purpose dye (not including shipping if you don't have Prime) with dubious results depending on your fabric is NOT worth it. I used this to dye a wonderful cotton twill using the immersion method. After a few tests while following instructions to a T the dye really wasn't as vibrant as I wanted it to be, even with the added salt. I would highly suggest going to Dharma Trading and buying procion dyes for your cotton or plant fiber-based projects which is about $3 cheaper and CONSIDERABLY better. The dye job is much more even, vibrant, and permanent; the latter being an issue even when the fabric was properly rinsed.  3. My biggest issue with RIT dyes is that purple tinted ones (black and navy fall under this), will drastically change color when ironed. My cotton twill which was dyed to the perfect color of blue/black suddenly became ashen (almost a greyed out black w/ minimal hints of blue) after being ironed, even after several hours of cooling.  Honestly, don't bother buying your RIT dyes here. Amazon makes them all more expensive in general and Dharma Trading, a site dedicated to dyes, will sell better quality products for cheaper, even cheaper than finding the same items in your local store.	-1
It was the consistency of mud	-1
sadly. I like Clover Chalk...but this one came in a lot of tiny pieces...making it unusable. Amazon did refund quickly!	-1
Sad -- mine came broken which doesn't really serve it's purpose.  There was one fairly large piece, but the rest were more like crumbs.	-1
The hole in the needle is too small for the automatic threader on my machine and since I planned to use these for embroidery, and need to change colors frequently, hand threading isn't an option.	-1
Hello Company Clover Very impressive and already bought a lot of the products I'm a fan of this company Unfortunately, this product My hope is disappointed Colors does not look clear on the Fabric	-1
ADDED THESE TO THOSE THAT DON'T WORK	-1
I will not recommend this pencil assortment.  The lead repeatedly breaks when I use it - it just falls out.  I have to sharpen again, and again.  I've tried sharpening less, but that does not help.	-1
Doesn't hold a point and tip breaks off when trying to sharpen.	-1
These are useless.  They don't actually mark anything.  I tried lightly marking which didn't work, little more pressure didn't work I pushed so hard I broke the lead and it still didn't do anything but crumble all over the fabric.  I threw them out.	-1
Rot dye did not work well with 10 bottles for 15 lbs of fabric. However, I contacted Rot directly through their customer service number, I was refunded the total amount of my purchase.	-1
I rather use normal chulk.	-1
Hardly left a mark. Needs more clarity	-1
They don't work!!!	-1
I had high hopes for these based on reviews. The color variety is convenient and the caps are nice. However, I find that the "lead" part easily breaks under the necessary pressure to make marks. It will break off about 1/2 inch of the lead, so it takes forever to sharpen back down to where it's usable. I'm losing so much of it from breaking. Very disappointed. I'm switching over to water soluble markers now, because I'm having such a hard time finding decent chalk or pencils.	-1
Hard to use, they don't mark as easily as chalk, therefore making it difficult to mark my lines and cuts without stretching and skewing my fabric. These have ended up in a drawer and I wouldn't purchase again.	-1
The lead is too soft- can't keep it pointed- need to sharpen it frequently.	-1
These are terrible. They break while sharpening, down inside the wood - used a whole pencil marking just a few pieces. When you can get a point on them, the lines are too thick to be accurate. Do not purchase.	-1
I was disappointed in clover water soluble pencils. every time I use them the lead comes out (breaks ) I sharpen it then it breaks and if you are lucky it don't break when you sharpen it, It will when you use it. I will not buy again.	-1
Sadly I received this and it was royal blue. It was a dark color put it in the wash and it was almost navy.....	-1
Tip broke as I was trying to Draw With it. Not for what I wanted it for. To soft to Write on wool.	-1
The chalk in the pencils is very hard. It doesn't mark well enough to see. I wasn't happy with the product and will not purchase more in the future.	-1
I have used these pens for a year now, and frankly, they are quite worthless. Here's a quick sum up:  Pros  - work relatively well on regular cotton fabric  Cons  - break easily when sharpened - they wear very quickly when marking fabric; expect to sharpen them every few pattern pieces that you trace/mark - because of the softness of the tip, they don't stay sharp for long, thus making VERY broad lines - they are not ideal to use with a ruler, see previous point - do not work on stretch fabric as you have to push down fairly hard to mark the fabric, which in turn stretches/distorts the fabric  While the idea is great, I get much better results using a regular pencil on non-stretch fabric and a pencil costs 1/10 of these.	-1
I don't know what I did wrong. The two projects I did with royal blue and cherry red turned out fabulous. I soaked some shirts in soda ash for twenty minutes and attempted to washing machine dye them with two bottles of aquamarine. None of the dye took on any of them. Maybe it was just a bad batch or sat on the shelf too long.	-1
Didn't work with 4 different sizes of thread, 2 different makes of bobbins. I tried switching ends, pressing harder... anything I could try. I really wanted them to work. Spools by Gutermann, Mettler, Coats and Clark, and generic. Bobbins for Elna and a 70s Singer.	-1
I don't know how I missed that it doesn't fit Singer.  Doesn't seem to fit standard bobbins either. its just irritating that I now have this open package of little plastic junk that is useless. I guess I'll pass it on to the thrift store.	-1
They didn't fit any of my thread or bobbins. I felt that the description was not clear enough. I returned them.	-1
Followed instructions inexplicably, clothes did not remain black after the next wash.	-1
After reading a few other reviews about how it came out purple, I tried 2 bottles instead of just 1 to get the navy blue color.  I followed all of the directions on the bottle for machine dying and even used the Rit Color Remover prior to dying the fabrics.  The white hand towels turned out a very weird shade of purple.  It's not even a nice shade of purple, just sort of a washed out used-to-be-purple purple.  At the very least, I expected the white fabric to turn out blue!  The towels turned out a horrible purple brown color.  The washing machine was an AWFUL MESS.  I've used the aquamarine dye before w/ great results and no mess in the machine afterwards, but this dark purple/blue ring remained in the washer and on the agitator.  After a few empty bleach runs and some scrubbing w/ the now ruined towels, the machine is now clean again save for a purple ring right at the top.  Would have been much easier to just go buy some new towels!!  I was trying to save some money by dying old white dingy towels a new blue color, but instead I've wasted money on 2 bottles of dye and 2 bottles of color remover, plus a bunch of purple or ruined towels.	-1
Came broken	-1
poorly made	-1
After following the directions EXACTLY, the velcro came right off in the washing machine after washing.	-1
Unfortunately, this product does not work.  I spent hours making "no sew"  pillows, following the directions carefully.  Every bit of the iron-on Velcro has started to come off, and I haven't even  washed the pillow covers yet. Now I have to redo all of the pillows, and a comforter cover that I  made using this product as well (guess I'm a slow learner :-)  Save your money and time, and just buy a sew-on product!	-1
didnt do it for me I tried to cover the white paint residual left on the sweat shirt  It didn't do a thing	-1
I've used Rit powder dye for years, and my mother did too. I've dyed T-shirts, curtains, towels, and jeans with great success. This is my first time trying the liquid dye, because I could get it in a maroon color I needed. I dyed one cotton hand-towel, and the color came out great. I simmered it in a big pot, added salt as directed, and soaked it for an hour. The problem was when I rinsed the item after dying. I've changed the water probably a dozen times, squeezing and soaking, and still the color is bleeding out. I tried salt in one rinse, and vinegar in another one - I saw a tip on the Internet about that helping set dye. I'll keep rinsing because I have nothing to lose, but I don't have much hope.  Edited 10/7/14:  I'm taking away another star because the first time I washed it in the regular washing machine, it bled so much that it's now a pink color instead of maroon.  I've never had such trouble with powder dye!	-1
I tested the Rit black dye on three garments: (1) one white, all cotton pillowcase (2) one white cotton scarf with nylon lace detail (3) two light green cotton-silk (67% cotton; 33% silk) pillow shams  I wanted to test the result on different fabrics and colors.  The results, in the same order, were:  (1) Slightly uneven color.  Weird medium purple color with gray and brown undertones -- an ugly color!  Stains on the pillowcase still showed. (2) Slightly uneven color.  On the main cotton fabric, I got the same medium purple color with gray and brown.  On the nylon fabric the color was richer, more purple.  Neither was remotely close to black. (3) Slightly uneven color.  I got the darkest purple result on the green, cotton-silk pillow shams, oddly enough.  I read several testimonials before starting and followers instructions to the T.  I used my top-loading washing machine for ease of use, but I did note that some had better luck with a bucket.  My next step (since none of the above results are the least bit satisfactory) is to dye my 3 garments again, but this time with "Dylon velvet black" dye using a bucket and boiling water.  Because I'm starting with a dark color, I may have better luck.  Also, I'll use less water so the color can saturate better.  Dylon's black dye is a blue-black, without purple/red undertones.  I'm hoping this will neutralize the dreadful purple/gray/brown color I got with Rit.  Don't waste your time and resources on Rit!  Huge mistake!	-1
Tulip powder dyes much deeper and true black. This stuff made my items more of a deep blue-purple.	-1
I bought this to go along with the color remover for outdoor patio furniture covers.  As with the color remover that did't work, this left my charcoal grey cushion covers charcoal grey.  Not even the white trim on the inside of the zipper was navy, much less even a light blue.  Still white.  Complete waste of time and money.	-1
I didn't believe the other feedback comments and thought somehow I would be different. It turned my jeans purple. I had to buy black rit dye in order to bring the jeans to a wearable color otherwise I would have tossed them. Instead of Navy Blue it should be changed to dark purple when used on jeans at least.	-1
This color looks great on wet - but once dried it was basically non existent.  I've used rit on other fabrics and it was fine - however canvas doesn't hold this color (and it did with the other brand).	-1
I was disappointed that5 it turned purple when it dried. I was so hoping for a black whis is the color I ordered	-1
I have used Rit liquid dyes for a long time.  The color you get is going to vary widely depending on the fabric you are dyeing.  Often the material will hold the dye but the stitching won't.  You MAY get more reliable results by bleaching the item first (even whites!) to get rid of any coloring or treatment.  But this is still a guess.  The black dye will come out anything from charcoal to gray to a sort of blueish purple tint.  Other dark colors get the same odd results.  I personally don't care because I'm dying old white and gray T-shirts that I wear around the house, so whatever color I end up with is an improvement. Every once in a while I get a color (always different from the stated dye color) that I really like, but then of course it's impossible to duplicate.  But I would NOT recommend using this dye on anything you care about.	-1
awful and terribly weak	-1
I agree with all over reviews...this is a great blue-purple but definitely not navy. Even if you concentrate it and add very little water, you are looking at a purple color.  I don't love it on it's own but it is good to mix with other colors.	-1
I bought this initially for some costuming needs.  After initially testing how strongly it would hold, I threw the whole package in the garbage.  This is pretty wimpy velcro and is not to be trusted if you need something that will take even a moderate amount of stress.	-1
Thank you, Fiskars, for this border punch that I bought with my limited funds for paper crafting.  I was so looking forward to using this and I only started using it today. It sticks, although I checked for bits of paper on the inside. I haven't even been able to get one clean cut from it.  If it wasn't so expensive to return, I would have done so already.  By the way, I didn't receive the one shown, but an orange and cream-ish looking one.	-1
Very sad I cannot see too small cross because too black. White is easy to sew than black.	-1
I've tried numerous ways to use this and so far am NOT impressed.  I can't get the color to be dark enough when mixing with different mediums without using a lot!  I'll stick with lindys magicals.	-1
I've been using Pearl Ex powder pigments for upwards of 20 years or so.  I recently purchased this set, along with several larger bottles of the interference colors.  There has definitely been a change in the quality of these powders.  A tiny bit used to go a very long way.  Now, it takes 3 or 4 times the powder that my old ones took to get the same results when using it as an additive.  Even with dry brush use, the pigmentation isn't nearly as strong.  I even compared it with some of my old jars that I had and it's a very discernible difference.  And since it's evident in both this set's colors and the larger bottles of interference colors I purchased, it's clearly that Jacquard has changed their product.  Disappointed.	-1
Would have gotten 5 stars if the advertised colors in product description were actually packaged. The main reason I got this series was to get my hands on the Pearl EX Duo Green Yellow(682) which cannot be bought separately anymore do to its discontinuance. Also in this series the Pearl EX Sparkling Copper(690) was not present. Instead of the missing colors I received Duo Violet-Brass (693) and Solar Gold (691). The colors are right as indicated on the packaging. Very disappointed.	-1
I got my package in a day with prime, which was amazing. I like the product, but, like other buyers, the bottles were thrown around, and many of them--  more than half of the bottles-- were less than a half or a third full. Others were packed to the rim with product. Since the bottles were sealed with an inner paper lid, this is either a quality control manufacturing issue or the product that has been used and the paper reglued. I was dissapointed there was so little product in so many of the colors. I also didn't receive the duo green-yellow, which was one of my favorites, and I thought that was included.	-1
These pigments are very weak, much weaker than series 1 and are only contrasted on certain color backgrounds (variable). Not nearly as useful as series 1.	-1
The powders are beautiful.  However, I would have given the product 5 stars were it not for 2 of the powder pots (Spring Green and Blue Russet) being only half empty!  I know, I know, "products may have settled during shipment", and all that nonsense.  But I took the pots and shook them to see if they would "fluff" up to the level of the other pots.  No deal.  Then I took a pot that was full and banged it (rather a lot) on my work table to see if it would settle to the level of my short pots.  Again, not so much.  I do not see any way to contact the seller as the item is shipped by Amazon.  I am very disappointed.  However, I will gladly reverse  my position should some solution to the problem be achieved	-1
Okay let me start by stating one very important thing. These are NOT embossing powders that an everyday crafter would use with their stamps and heat tool on paper crafts! Although when searching for 'Embossing Powder' on here, these come up but do NOT buy them as an embossing powder as they don't work at all. They don't heat properly, resulting in smudging and leave an awful pearl residue all over the paper and there is no way to remove it (I tried everything!) After realizing these just weren't going to on my card making, I researched a bit more and discovered they are meant for paint and clay mixes, not paper crafts. The description is very misleading but needless to say, after a lot of frustration in trying to get them to work, these $40 jars of powder are on their way back to Amazon	-1
I thought this product would work like PERFECT PEARLS, but it does NOT.  No matter what I do, the product never dries.  This means that the color rubs off onto everything it comes in contact with.  I subsequently ordered the REAL Perfect Pearls tested it and it dried perfectly with no residue.	-1
They worst threat i have ever used. Difficult to get off the spool, dangles easily  Just a total waste of money.	-1
Will not buy again.	-1
I bought this "kit" for my 8 year old daughter thinking it would be great to do together.  I used to do these when I was her age and loved them.  This is not what I would consider a kit.  It does not include the latch hook tool nor does the canvas have a pattern on it.  The canvas itself is super rough and impossible to lay flat making this the most disappointing buy of the year.  Absolute waste of money.	-1
Way to hard for any child under the age of 10.	-1
Way to hard for any child under the age of 10..	-1
I wanted to give my daughter a latch kit like I use to play with as a child.  This set has a cute picture, but it is not printed on the mesh.  Instead they printed a grid on the mesh and provide a chart like you'd use in cross stitch.  My nine year old could easily follow it, but I think it would have been more fun for her if the image was printed.  Also, the yarn quality is very cheep and scratchy.  It does not resemble the soft plush kits I remember from childhood.  I think if it had a better tactile feel, my daughter would have enjoyed the kit more and we would have ended up purchasing more sets.  If this is the quality, than it really isn't worth the money or time.  Also, as noted in the description, it does not come with a hook so I purchased that separately.	-1

Same Review as with the previous orders. This appeared to be a pattern for a kitty cat pillow. It was not. All it has is the yarn and a picture of a kitty cat. This was not what I wanted and it wasn't what I thought I was ordering. This is major disappointing as I was going to make it for a Christmas present. Won't ever be purchasing anything like this again. Totally bummed !!	-1
Most confusing. Product description and some reviews say the picture is printed on the canvas. IT IS NOT PRINTED ON THE CANVAS. It is a graph whick is not waht the person i purchased it for can do. Very disappointing.	-1

Too difficult for a child of 8.  Purchased for a gift and since it said "Latch Hook Kit" there would be a hook.  You have to purchase that separately!  Also, there is NO guide or template on the canvas grid.  It is too difficult and frustrating for a younger child.  I will have to mark it out in colored marker for the 8 year old child to start/finish.  Very disappointed in this kit and will not purchase this brand again.  A 14 year old said it looked too difficult/time consuming to do without a template to follow.	-1
As with the other Wonderart Latch Hook Kit, this one was disappointing.  There are supposed to be 40 rows across.  As I'm working the rug, I noticed my count of colors was off.  I counted, recounted, took out the yarn & started over.  The actual rug is only 39 rows.  If I had not caught the difference, I would have run out of yarn near the end.  I don't feel Wonderart is very good with their products (counting difficulties).  I probably would not purchase any more products from them	-1
Did not like this at all	-1

Disappointed.  The picture isn't printed on the canvas even though it is sold as "beginner/intermediate."  Of course, after it arrived, I came back to Amazon and read the reviews.  Lesson learned - read reviews BEFORE ordering.  I wanted a few of these kits for my middle children (7, 10, 12) to work on while we do our daily read-alouds.  But without the picture printed on the canvas, I think it would be just too frustrating.  (My 12 year old is developmentally delayed)  So I returned it.	-1

It wasn't what I thought, as a kid I had one of these but the picture was on the rug all you had to do was follow the colors thats why I bought this for my 7 year old but I guess they don't come like that anymore.	-1

received it when promised but the kit not including the tool needed to work it and having to buy it separate was not to my liking. Trying to teach my daughter how to do this and now having to wait longer for another piece to come in, it is called a kit it should have came with the tool.	-1
It didn't come with the hook so we wherent able to make it yet.	-1
Received instructions for the butterfly, I guess I'm on my own with this one, very disappointed	-1
I thought it would cut fabric..Not what I wanted and it will not cut fabric or paper very well.	-1
Being an experienced quilter I really thought this product was going to be a big help. But once I got it and began using it, all it did was slow me down. I find it faster it to draw a circle and cut out 4 at a time instead one. This compass circle cutter is more likely for a hobbyist or someone who doesn't sew constantly.	-1
I bought this for my school bulletin boards and it doesn't hold things on for very long and you have to use lots of it.	-1

Very poor quality for the money. The bobbins are very poor quality, bendy, and with rough edges. The organizer is OK but many of the compartments are twisted so the bobbins to not fit well. Would not buy again. No where near as nice as the one I have had for about 20 years but was getting too small for all my floss.	-1
The 8oz tin arrived with a label covering the entire top, the inside had debris and scratches in it, and the bottom also had signs of wear.  It is a good weight and the lid fits snuggly. This tin is actually a tin used for EncausticsPaints.com custom wax color paints and can be found elsewhere - like (<[...]>) for roughly half the price.  This was purchased as an "add-on" item, but it is clear to me that half of the price I paid was built in shipping costs, despite the fact that as an "add-on" product, it got thrown in with the other items I ordered.  Not pleased that I now have to remove the unwanted "surprise" label inorder to make it functional for my purposes.  Have not contacted the stated seller as I went to the Eucaustics Paints website and they do not sell directly - only through 3rd parties across the U.S. so there is really no way of knowing who is the actual seller.  This can be had for $2.89 at Blicks, item number:  03415-2808 where at least they provide a picture of the actual tin - label and all.	-1
blade was worn upon arrival. Threw it  in the trash.	-1
I don't know if I got a defective cutter but washer came bend and I think its missing a part because its not secure tight. I would not buy this product again. The wheel does not stay steady, it wiggles to much.	-1
This was a waste of money for my paper craft projects. A box cutter doesn't force the ruler to move, but this was awful. Maybe good on fabric?	-1
not what expected. Will not cut through fleece	-1
I returned it. I didn't open the product packaging because there was visible gunk on the blade.	-1
Broke the first time I used it :(	-1
Love Olfa products, and love my 'regular' Olfa cutter, with the push down blade guard.  This one is too thick at the blade end, and if you are being precise in your cutting, such as you have to be when quilting, this cutter is NOT for you.  You can't be precise, particularly if you are left handed.  Buy the original Olfa for less money, and you will be much happier.	-1
Ordered Olfa blades and was sent Fiskars blades. The sticker on the Fiskars package says "Olfa 28mm." Not worth returning.	-1
This stuff really sticks, especially to your fingers and itself. As for anything else: maybe-maybe not. The most frustrating thing about this brand is that it doesn't tear clean and always leaves a stringer that peals back on the roll. This is pretty much for the know-nothings that heard a name so they get this. You are far better off with something like 3M of some other generic at the hardware stores. This junk is just not worth the frustration!	-1
My husband uses the 2oz jars with his airbrush for his model railroad hobby.  These jars are HORRIBLE!!!!!!  First of all, the liner inside the lid is now styrofoam.  It used to be a pulp liner that stood up to all paints.  It you're using a solvent based paint, you MUST remove the styrofoam liner or it will dissolve into your solvent based paint (I use Floquil solvent based paints for weathering along with Testor's Dullcote) and ruin your paint and clog up your airbrush.  The other problem is the lids won't stay tight on most jars.  You'll find one from time to time that's OK.  Most of the jar lids will never really tighten up.  They will tighten to a point and then pop loose and you'll have to tighten them up again.  I've also had some jars actually drop right out of the lid and land on the floor.  I've had glass and paint everywhere.  I also have lots of problems with the jars leaking paint everywhere because I can't tighten them good enough without popping loose or falling right out of the lid.  Badger jars used to be excellent.  Like I said above, they had pulp liners that didn't leak.  They also had metal jar lids and not the cheap flimsy plastic.  Badger makes nice airbrushes but these jars fall way short of being acceptable.	-1
Don't get these unless you want to cut your hands apart.  Went to tighten the top and the glass bottom separated from the whole upper.  Paint everywhere and a cut between my thumb and finger covered in paint.  At least is was water base paint.  What a mess.  Plus the seals are useless.  When they get wet, they dissolve.  Bottles just came out of the box and have never been dropped that I know of.	-1
Do not buy these jars if you plan on storing paints in them. The paint will dry out due to the poor seal in the cap.	-1
the cap liners are foam. will absolutely not work with solvent-based contents. i had to get a refund and instead went to the old standby, the Testor's Model Master bottle and pipette set.	-1
It does NOT dry Clear!!!!  It drys yellow.	-1
{I'm giving this one star, pending the replacement bottle.}  I was excited to try this glue because a friend swore up and down that it was The Stuff ... but my order arrived, although the bottle was sealed, the glue inside was solid.  {see photos}  The date stamp on the bottom appears to indicate 2016, which would explain the dried glue. I've started a return, and will update my review when the replacement bottle arrives.  If I keep getting dried out glue, this is a vendor problem, and I'll have to find another source for this glue.	-1
Tried to use it to attach badges but didn't work.	-1
hard to work with very very watered down ... does not work at all on car leather seats. it was awful. this runny mess came out of the sides of the top not the top so it got everywhere. I was covered in it but luckily it is garbage so it washed off easily. very disappointed in this.	-1
its ok i wouldnt buy it again.  its kind of like using elerms glue.  its white amd doesnt really do much if ur using it on leather	-1
Very white and come right through the material.  On leather underneath if you had a Patch would probably work ok.	-1
Very disappointed.  Making Roman shades, this stuff bleeds through fabric and expensive blackout material.  Didn't say that at Sailrite.  It dries on in a tan, amber hue.  When the sunlight hits, the amber really comes through. The fabric was one of a kind and have not been able to find the same material.  Perhaps I should have tested it on a spot of remnant first. Won't buy again.	-1
not working	-1
Not a very good adhesive, after drying it is just a kinda sticky pile that has no real strength to it	-1
Based on the commercials and everything I've heard about this product I thought it would work. I used it on my car seat to try and repair a tear in the fabric and it did not work and just made a mess of my seat. The reason for the two stars is because that is the only thing I have used it on and have not tried it on anything else.	-1
i gave this one star because it broke on first use.  i just got a replacement one in the mail yesterday and have yet to try it out, but i was underwhelmed with its performance. if this one also busts i will give another brand a try.  basically the glue never came out, the gun would get hot and i would squeeze the handle and no matter how hard i squeezed nothing ever came out...completely defective.	-1
For me personally it sucks. I was advised by my son who is a millwright to purchase this because it's the best and you can fix any tear. I had ripped the knee of my jeans and it was a tear in an "L" shape. I cut a patch and put over it and within an hour it was completely torn off.	-1
No no no.  I was so optimistic about this stuff and I couldn't wait for it to arrive!  I have a white leather sectional couch from Z Gallery.  I have trained my 2 cats (with my screechy mommy voice)  that countertops, tables, and furniture cabinets are OFF limits.  To be fair to them I let them run, play, chase, and lounge on chairs and the couch.  Neither of them have a "scratching" habit on anything except their sisal wool rope covered posts BUT when they get spastic and chase each other, their claws (even trimmed) leave fine little hairline cuts on the couch cushions.  It seemed to me that this product with the addition of white shoe polish would remedy the grid of damage my couch has sustained.  Not so.  Not even remotely.  It looks like elmers glue, acts like elmers glue, and even if it is slightly effective on certain spots, it will sit on top of the surface and dirty up which you can then run your finger over and roll it off just like elmers.  It's also very dull and obvious.  It may be effective for other types of tears but NO WAY on hairline claw damage from kitties.	-1
This product does not work!	-1
Depending on the weave of your fabric, its performance is less than wonderful. Look elsewhere for fabric mending. I used a wonderful product years ago that was in fact instant and performed much better than this. Tried but couldn't find it so I wasted my money on this. Perhaps it's better on leather, but on fabric it leaves so much to be desired.	-1
cant make it any clearer than that. I would actually give it zero stars! It does say to use within 12 months. It wasn't date stamped so mine could have been made 250 years ago? I hate having my time waisted. Please don't buy this or you will have to go through the refund game or trash it and loose your money. Good luck!	-1
This adhesive was very watery and didn't hold anything for me. Thinking I should return.	-1
Crappie glue. I won't buy it again	-1
Please don't waste your money! As a sewer and crafter, I have never seen such an awful product for fabric. It is so thin that it soaks through the fabric, even layers, and after several hours, dries to a sticky yellow mess that can not be removed yet somehow does not bond fabric together. Of course my fabric was ruined. This does not dry in three minutes yet can not be washed out either. There is nothing instant about it except the big mess it makes. Stick to Elieens.	-1
I wanted to use this to mend some tiny areas of clothing. It was not at all washable. It is also NOT tacky at all, so I don't know how the heck you are supposed to get two peices of fabric to stay together when its wet. AND it is very wet & liquidy so the fabric just absorbs a ton of it, leaving gluey wet marks. I think this would only work for non absorbent materials like leather, maybe?	-1
trap works well but the plastic threads at the bottom of the moisture trap are already worn down it's useless now.  This was money NOT well spent.	-1
I had been using this brush for just around 2 weeks before it broke. Basically I kept getting bubbles in my paint cup during extended painting sessions, so after some reading I found out I either had a paint clog in the nozzle, or an improperly sealed nozzle at the place where it screws into the airbrush body. I used Iwata's included wrench to unscrew the nozzle, cleaned it gently, and when I reattached it the nozzle would keep spinning and never come to a stop. Turns out half the nozzle body broke off! I understand it is a gentle piece, but I put absolutely no pressure onto it with the spanner, and wham broken. The bubble issue made spraying unpredictable and messy, and really disappointed me. I have ordered a replacement, and will update this review if my experience improves  UPDATE 1/9/2018 For anyone that cares I did end up getting a 2nd Iwata brush, but instead of repurchasing the HP-CR I went with Iwata's Eclipse HP-CS brush, and the design is lightyears better than this brush. Instead of having an unbelievably fragile nozzle that's held on by three threads, the HP-CS has a drop in nozzle that's held in the nozzle body by friction, meaning if you remove the nozzle body with the spanner, you can gently pull the nozzle out and nothing will break. The nozzle body on the HP-CS is the same strong metal as the airbrush body, so you can feel confident unscrewing and cleaning it time and time again, knowing that the nozzle itself could not be damaged during reassembly. I would recommend that brush over this one in a heartbeat; it's just a better design, and you can't really argue against that sadly	-1
Very disappoint.  What I received was four 8X4" slats and 68  dowels Obvious fraudulent listing. I needed the four larger slats so I am unable to return the item This review is to let other buyers know exactly what you will be receiving	-1
I don't know if they just made a mistake but what I received is just the cheap quick disconnect for the cheap chinese airbrushes/master airbrushes. You don't get what is pictured. What I received is this instead. https://www.amazon.com/Master-Airbrush-Release-Disconnect-Connections/dp/B001MKGOUM/ref=sr_1_1?s=arts-crafts&ie=UTF8&qid=1502382112&sr=1-1&keywords=airbrush+quick+disconnect	-1
Unfortunately it leaks so much through the QDC that the brush won't hold pressure enough to be useful. Guess i'm sending this one back. Should have just bought one from CABS like I knew I should have in the first place.	-1
Basically ok for the quick-disconnect but not perfect as moving the hose leaks the air out ....	-1
works ok, but leaks	-1
Edit 2/14/18: reduced to 2 stars. All the pens have dried out despite their caps being tight & secure. This is only after very light use on two separate occasions in December.  Would not recommend. Left two stars rather than one due to fact that they worked well while they lasted. -----  Nice and inky pens. I tested them out on cardboard boxes and they worked perfectly. The white marker isn't as opaque as I'd prefer...have to go over it a few times to get that bright white look.  For those who are curious about how they will show on black cardstock: the only color that will show is the white (in the primary color pack).	-1
These paint markers were a disappointment.  I thought I couldn't go wrong with Elmer's, but I was mistaken.  I am quite experienced using paint markers, so it is not something I am doing incorrectly.  First, as at least 2 other reviewers have stated, the nibs come out of the marker way too easily.  Overall I've been quite disappointed with all Elmer's Paint Markers I have purchased, including these&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Elmer-s-Painters-Neon-Bright-Opaque-Paint-Markers-Medium-Pack-of-5/dp/B001KZH282/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Elmer's Painters Neon Bright Opaque Paint Markers, Medium (Pack of 5)</a>&nbsp;and these&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/ELMERS-Painters-Acrylic-Medium-Tip-Paint-Markers-Eastern-Empire-Colors-Set-of-5-7528/dp/B00D8RZQ7O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">ELMERS Painters Acrylic Medium Tip Paint Markers, Eastern Empire Colors, Set of 5 (7528)</a>.  I will stick with the best paint markers I have ever owned, these https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ANVDMU/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1  The only reasons I purchased Elmer's were: 1) the Uni-Posca are not available in as many colors or finishes (no opaque or neon); 2) I thought I could trust an Elmer's product.  These were certainly not worth the price, and I wish that I had returned them.  These may have gotten 3 stars from me if they'd been about 1/4 of the price; however, they would never get more than 3 even if they were free.	-1
Not the greatest	-1
Too messy. Never buy again.	-1
Very messy. Too much paint comes out,too hard to control.	-1
Only one cap in package instead of two	-1
Not very good at mixing paints for acrylic pouring art projects. Takes way longer and you have to stir anyway so you might as well just do it by hand.	-1
It's just easier to shake the bottle than to deal with this thing swirling around and spitting paint all over the place.	-1
By the look of it, this little mixer would be good for a gallon of paint. Not So. The entire length of this gadget, put together, is 8 1/2 inches long. This cannot be used to stir a gallon of paint, only a pint, at the most.	-1
We, my wife and I, were expecting much more from this product.  We were unable to load a bobbin!  Despite several tries we were unable to get the machine to function as advertised and without a working bobbin we could not advance to any sewing.  Thanks to Amazon we were able to receive a refund and moove on to a different machine.  The mechanics of the Brother were not as advertised so we do not recommend it but the Singer Futura 350 we ended up with is extraordinary and is recommended.	-1
Very disappointed was extra small never buy again	-1
Colors are kind of muddy when I knit a few inches with it.  Not as attractive in reality as shown on website.  I wouldn't recommend it.	-1
This color "cherry red" does not match other red heart cherry red yarn that I purchased at JoAnns. Don't be like me, purchase your yarn in person so you can properly swatch the color.	-1
I love red heart soft... Never been disappointed until now... This is not soft, it's scratchy and catches on almost everything. I only used a small amount because it kept splitting and irritated my skin.... Wish I used sooner so I could return but will not waste my money again!	-1
Teeny, tiny skein. A rip off!	-1
the yarn color is more earthy  than the vibrant orange in the photo.  probably best to go to an actual store such as joanns to view the colors.	-1
returned  It was the wrong color	-1
returned .  The wrong color	-1
Hard to work with. Splits so you have to mak sure each stitch is picked up whole. Also the texture is all wrong. Would not recommend.	-1
nice and soft but yarn splits really bad	-1
not the navy I was looking for, but I'll use it in something	-1
I have a sweater I knit for my son a long time ago, and I wanted to copy it for one of his daughters.  The old sweater is 17 stitches and 25 rows per 4 inches.  I looked for yarn that was close, and the ball band on this yarn said 17stitches and 23 rows per 4 inches on 5mm needles.  So I started in on the knitting.  It's a baby sweater, so I didn't swatch, since it's already so small that it serves as it's own swatch.  Well, this one is going nowhere, since, on my Addi 5mm needles, the stitches are loose enough that I'd normally go down another size needle to get a more pleasant hand to the fabric and to close up the stitches that would otherwise catch on baby fingers ...  but it's already at 20 stitches and 24 rows per 4 inches, which makes the same number of stitches 2.4 inches narrower than the original, at the same time as being too loose a knit.  This Yarn is MUCH closer to DK weight than worsted weight.  And, unlike some people who thought it didn't split, this yarn was splitting from the cast-on forward.  I am not please with this yarn form Red Heart, a brand I usually trust, and a brand whose other yarns I use frequently.  I will not be buying this "Soft" brand again.  I will start over on the sweater with some other yarn.	-1
Did not work. Tryed to glue polyester trim to a fabric and it didn't work. Very disappointed. Will return	-1
The fumes are really bad and has to be done outside which is tricky for my business.	-1
Although I have never ordered this yarn from this seller. I have bought red heart soft yarn from joanns. And I do have to say is that it's horrible..it splits extremely easy (btw I have clover armour hooks), and it is really limp. Yes the yarn is soft. But it's not worth having it split every stitch.	-1
I purchased the Red Heart Soft Yarn in white to make a crib blanket.  I wish I had read the lower reviews.  This yarn is awful.  It splits easily.  After you have crocheted a bit you can look back and see where the threads have separated.  It's too late  now, but I wish I could get my money back.  I bought 3 skeins here and another skein prior to that and all of it is worthless.  Working with this yarn is a waste of time and effort.  The crochet work that I have completed looks terrible and I am too embarrassed to give this as a gift.  Also, this yarn becomes very fuzzy (I can't imagine how it would wash).  Sorry Red Heart, I will be switching to another brand.  UPDATE:  I contacted Coats & Clarke (the makers of Red Heart Yarn) about the splitting yarn and they requested that I send them samples of the defective yarn.  They sent me a postage paid envelope.  I sent the pieces of yarn back to them and they sent me 4 new skeins of yarn.  Sadly, these new skeins are defective also.  What a waste.	-1
not what I wanted	-1
I mostly got this for the case, the hinge was broken on arrival but taped so as to not be imediately noticeable. The bobins are perfect though.	-1
This arrived with the plastic case cracked on both sides.  ANNOYING as I need a case to store bobbins in	-1
too thin	-1
So hard yarn.	-1
Thought they would be full, but off course since it was brand name it was not.  Glad I did not pay full price for these, so just ok.  Even the thread is CRAPPY, I think I will take off the thread and rewind with my thread.  Better off buying and winding yourself or buy another brand.  <a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Prewound-Bobbins-36-Pieces-of-Polyester-Thread-Perfectly-Match-Brother-Embroidery-Machine-Size-A-156-FREE-Bonuses/dp/B00ROFI5A6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Prewound Bobbins - 36 Pieces of Polyester Thread Perfectly Match Brother Embroidery Machine Size A (156) ++ FREE Bonuses</a>  I also have reviewed these extensively and gave info about bobbins and your machine	-1
Great color and very soft but was completely tangled in the middle. I had to roll into a ball and spent hours untangling the yarn.	-1
I didn't know what "Class 15" meant, but the bobbins are much deeper than the old metal ones that came with my Singer, and will not fit into the bobbin hole at all. It turns out that my machine uses drop-in bobbins, and class 15 bobbins are for machines where the bobbins load from the front.	-1
I realize that monitor colors can vary, but the yarn I got was nothing like the yarn pictured.  In the picture, the colors are vivid and warm.  In reality, the colors are very muted and cool looking.  I'm very disappointed.  I purchased two other types of Red Heart yarn from amazon (mistletoe and variegated greens) and they were spot on with the on screen depiction.  Unfortunately, this is a big miss.  I LOVE the yarn as it's pictured here, but had I seen it in person, I wouldn't have given it a second thought or bought it.  So please, beware.	-1
Just like the other yarn I received with this order, the color is vastly different than what appeared online. I was perfectly okay with a little difference in color as may be expected ordering yarn online, but this lovely looking teal is very, very green despite being labeled as "teal." Completely disappointed and I'm stuck with several balls of this stuff with nothing that matches it.	-1
This stuff has yet to glue any of my paper together.  It seems to stay tacky.  I live in GA so not sure if this is my issue with this glue.  I do like the original one though.	-1
It is too messy to work with it. It stick well but leave a sticky residue that is not nice in my paper collages.	-1
This is a complete waste of money if you have thick nails.	-1
When I opened the package I noticed that the blades only made contact with each other at the very tip.  When holding them up to a light I could see a gap between the blades which made me suspect they would not work very well.  They didn't work at all, as it turned out.  Even on my little toe's fairly thin nail, the blades slipped off and didn't cut anything.  After a couple of minutes I gave up, as my fingers were sore from the small holes that you put them into to cut with.  The model's hand in the picture must be of a very small woman or child.  My hands are not that large but I could only get two fingertips in the larger, bottom part of the handles.  I've sent these back for a refund and will search for another option.  Don't waste your time or money on these!	-1
These are terrible! They don't work and I am very disappointed in this product. It is cheaply made and useless!	-1
generally this brand is excellent but the cutting or scoring edge on this one was not up to pare - had to dress quite a bit	-1
what junk. does not work at all. others say the same thing. don't waste you money on this item. it does not work even 1%.	-1
Not sharp enough to cut through soft butter with it's beveled (or broken) point. (And I do know how to use a plastic cutter.)  Nice ergonomic handle though.  The Hyde cutter is much better for actually scoring plastic.	-1
