I work with PDF all the time, even though I really dislike the file format, because its behavior is unpredictable even when you work with the same source file, for example, a Word document with a few graphics embedded. PDF Fusion is a very versatile PDF editor and creator and convertor. It's powerful, although the learning curve beyond the very basic is steep. Upon installation, it ran smoothless on my i7 laptop,	1
There are may other players out there in the lower cost PDF solution,  Nitro and Nuance are two of the bigger ones.  Adobe Acrobat is too expensive but most users do not require Acrobat.  Many people could also get by with free solutions.  However,I like to have a little more power. so I can batch process and form design. Corel PDF did allow the form design and putting files to together for one PDF file,  Corel did design a nice UI but having nice UI does not always translate into an easy to use product.  If you are Adobe Acrobat user there is a learning curve with the interface.  Getting multiple file types to work as one has been a challenge and had resulted in multiple crashes.  Reaching out to Corel support proves nothing more than frustrating.  When you finally get a hold os some they have to go through the basic troubleshooting, which you most likely have done.  One nice feature is the plugin for Word allows you to edit XPS files within Word.  Microsoft provided the ability to save as XPS in Word 2010 but not edit.  I doubt they will also because third party program creators would file a complaint.  My recommendation is download a trial and see if you have any stability issues.	-1
This software allows you to convert all Microsoft format documents into a single PDF. There are already some free PDF converters available such as PrimoPDF that support converting a regular document to PDF. This software lets you combine pages from various files in Word, Excel, Powerpoint etc. to create one PDF. The user interface is easy as you just have to drag and drop pages from multiple source documents. It allows you to rotate the view and delete pages after you have compiled your master PDF document.  You can also export your PDF files as Word documents, then edit them and reconvert to PDF. This process is pretty fast. It also offers some basic PDF editing which allows you to type over a word but does not support text wrap so you have to write over your original.  There is a find and redact feature in this software which is useful to make changes to your PDFs. You can also add bookmarks to your PDFs.  However this software does not offer some advanced PDF features such as creation of fillable forms, allowing searches in scanned PDF documents, or advanced editing features.  It is titled appropriately - it is primarily meant for collating different file formats into one PDF document, and it does that pretty well. For some unsupported file formats you can first print them to PDF and then use them as source to combine in your master document.	1
Creating PDF files is very new to us. Yes, we read them, but we have never created one. Mainly because of the huge expense for the PDF software. Plus, we just couldn't justify the cost vs. use factor.  Corel PDF Fusion is absolutely perfect for our business needs and the price is actually very justifiable. I really don't know how much use it will actually get, however, it is a resource we have started to use in our mainsteam operation.  We have been converting some of our ebooks into a single PDF document. It has been very nice to be able to do that, and to be able to include weblinks and pictures too.  I do believe that this software will be keeping us busy for a while, since we have over 10 years of ebooks to convert. However, starting anything from scratch has yet to be done.  Overall, I am very satisfied with the software, it is perfect for our basic need of conversion.	1
Overall I've found this to be a very handy program.  I just like to use it to enable me to fill out PDF forms rather than printing them out.  That's pretty much all I use it for, so that's all I can comment on.  It does replace Adobe reader as the default way to view PDFs, something that I changed.  I only occasionally want to use this and it takes longer to load and does not have as clean an interface for reading.	1
PDF Fusion is one of those pieces of software that you may, or may not, have much use for.  On the surface it seems like a great idea.  Create PDF files, from popular file formats (even if you don't own the original software).  Do many of the functions of Adobe Reader (set watermarks, set passwords, etc.). Assemble PDFs by combining multiple files from different formats. All these functions work well once you get use to the interface.  I was able to combine a Word doc, an Excel spreadsheet, a Powerpoint slide and some images into one PDF file.  The quality of the images and documents seemed fine (mind you I am not a professional photographer).  I really like the concept because in the past I have had to try to figure out how to import data from different sources into Powerpoint so I could print it all out together.  This made things much simpler.  My question, like others, is whether it is worth the price.  That really depends on how often you would use the program.  I'm sure if I thought about it I could find uses around the house, but I am not sure that would justify the price for me.  However, if you the idea of a simpler way to assemble PDFs is something you value, I think this is a valuable program.	1
Corel PDF Fusion is a remarkably simple piece of software that solves a problem that many people encounter in the world of business: How to easily and quickly create a PDF from multiple documents. Not only does PDF Fusion let you import Word or PowerPoint slides into a PDF, but the simple point-and-click interface lets you add a variety of image formats or combine multiple PDFs into a single PDF.  That being said, if all you want to do is combine existing PDFs there are several free websites that allow you to upload multiple PDFs and combine them into a single PDF if that is all you want to do. Still, the beauty of PDF Fusion is that it doesn't just combine PDFs but it allows you to import just about any file and turn it into a PDF without having to use any other software to convert files prior to the creation of the final PDF.  The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is the full MSRP of $69.99 seems way too expensive. Granted, most places (including Amazon) sell this software for less than the MSRP.	1
I was excited with the Black Friday sale price of $29.95, but this is no bargain if you want to include graphics/pictures in your PDF files.  Corel PDF Fusion uses very heavy compression with no user control over the image quality.  This is particularly obvious if you have an image that includes high contrast text, such as black text on white background.  You will get lots of compression artifacts and the text will be color tinges along the edges.  I use Adobe Pro at work and was not expecting this product to compare to that, but I thought I could at least include pictures in my created PDF without the image quality being reduced so greatly. Don't every try to fill in a PDF blank form with this product because it IS NOT WYSIWYG.  Forms that appear fine on the screen will print with text fields chopped of or print as blank fields.  Attempting to edit the text field to reposition it on the form is like working in the dark.  You have no clue if your positioning/sizing has been done correctly until you print it again.  Maybe the worst piece of commercial software I have used in over 40 years in the business.	-1
I really like this software.  So far, it hasn't eaten any of my PDFs alive, and it has worked well. The installation was a bit irritating, as it needed to install more things than it should have, it took a really long time, and it required me to reboot my computer several times.  After that, though, pretty useful. The software allows you to open multiple PDFs, drag and drop certain pages amongst them, and then recombine them. There might be some more advanced features that I haven't figured out yet (probably), but this was pretty much the purpose that I wanted it for, so... I might never discover them and I will still be happy with the software.	1
I've used Adobe Acrobat and PDFDocs.  Corel's PDF Fusion is easier to use than either of those programs and, while not as powerful as Acrobat, can do quite a bit in terms of manipulating and creating .pdf files.  The interface is fairly simple.  You can drag and drop files, change their order, and publish them to .pdf files.  You can split .pdf files apart, stitch multiple files together, etc., all in a fairly intuitive graphical interface.  It even provides a .pdf printer that lets you print any document (e.g., a Word document from within Word or a webpage in Chrome or Firefox) to a .pdf file.  It's an incredibly useful feature.  Given the ubiquity of .pdf files, it's helpful to have a program like this one on your computer.  This one is stable, plays nice with other software, and gets the job done.  And it doesn't cost an arm and a leg.  Check it out.	1
GUEST REVIEWER - ! MRS. KNOW IT ALL ;-b  Have you ever clicked on a file and had the error message, "can not open file, choose software to open file"??  Well, this software should take that error message away.  I love that it can open over 100 different file formats, even if you don't have the software used to create the file.  Well, that is the one plus for this software, the other is the ability to create and edit PDF files.  It is so easy with drag n' drop abilities, I think even a computer novice could use this with no help.  You will be able to handle just about all of your document needs with this one.  So, glad I won't we getting the "error" message anymore!!!!	1
This review is for Corel PDF Fusion. Having used both this product and Adobe Acrobat, here is what you need to know. Acrobat is for power users who need tons and tons of complex features for "power users" as another reviewer put it. Corel PDF Fusion, on the other hand, is streamlined to serve one major purpose beyond a simple PDF viewer: it is good at printing high quality PDF files from other programs (e.g. Word). Other than the simplified list of features, the two major advantages of Corel over Acrobat are (1) less clutter on your hard drive in terms of megabytes of the installed program files and (2) cost. I hope that this overview of the differences helps you in making a decision of whether to opt for this simpler, lighter Acrobat alternative.	1
I've used a good variety of PDF editing software, from the high-end Adobe Acrobat product, down to free annotating tools. Previously my favorite for personal use was PDFFill, a very low-cost tool with the ability to do some text editing and create PDF forms. I'm also familiar with PDF XChange, a range of PDF tools from basic to very advanced with very competitive pricing. Through Amazon Vine, I have had the opportunity to try another product,&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Nuance-PDF-Converter-PRO/dp/B003WVJ1KO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Nuance PDF Converter PRO</a>. I was fairly impressed with that product and its capabilities, less thrilled with its horrible DRM scheme. So was hoping this Corel software might make up for Nuance's weaknesses.  Unfortunately, that was not to be. Yes, it doesn't have the crappy DRM to deal with. And it's got one of the nicest interfaces I've seen so far. But the feature set and implementation on this software is not even close. I think I'd be more inclined to go with the cheapo and not very user-friendly PDFFill over this, it's very overpriced for what you get, and just doesn't work all that well. No OCR? No PDF forms?? Are you kidding me?? Even its conversion from Word to PDF was rather hit or miss. I just can't recommend this when there so many other products for PDF creation and editing that include so much more for the price.	-1
Prior to getting this software, my pdf file processing solution was to use acrobat reader, CutePDF writer (installs as a printer to print documents to a pdf file), and my regular word processing and drawing tools.  This works pretty well except that I can't combine pdf files into a single document or add mark-up to an existing pdf file.  So, I decided to test out this Corel product.  Quite simply, it has saved my butt a few times when my only other option was to print things out and go the old scissors and tape route.  Anyways, this is not a pdf authoring software but is instead a pdf manipulation package.  Limited, but OK for what I need.  The installation of this package seemed fairly clunky though.  I put it on a windows XP system with all the latest patches - or so I thought.  This package required some installers, one after another with reboots etc.  I was really worried that I'd picked up a virus at first because of the strangeness.  Well, the virus scanners haven't found anything yet so I think I'm OK.  So, the big summary is that there is some clunkiness here and there but is super handy if you lack PDF authoring tools and have to manipulate PDF files	1
I have had McAfee installed on my 5 computers for several years.  Seems to work well. My biggest complaint is that I get short notice when the license will expire (after a year),  and to keep protected McAfee wants me to renew online for 3 times the cost of buying through Amazon.  So try to remember to buy the new version a month before the old one expires.  Also,  getting last years version seems to work as well (but cheaper) than getting this years version.	1
McAfee Internet Security is a quality product. It installs and updates easily. I installed the software on two different computers. A $250 laptop with an AMD E-processor, and an expensive desktop with an AMD Quad-core processor. The time difference to install was 12 minutes for the laptop and 2 minutes for the desktop. The protection is quite good, and the simplicity of the program makes it easy to use for most general users to have control of their anitivirus/internet security program. Options are easy to find and use. I didn't have any problems installing or with the program while I used it. Most internet security programs are similar and offer quality protection against viruses. I've used Trend Micro and Kaspersky as well and I like all three.	1
This is the same virus protection I've bought for so many years, so I guess the fact that I don't switch means I find no fault with it.  In fact, with the 2011 version, I had a problem where all of a sudden it said my subscription was running out and I knew I still had months left on it.  I first used McAfee's Virtual Technician online to determine and fix the problem if it could.  If I remember correctly, it then gave me a link to click for a "live person" to chat with online, or it advised me to go to the live chat link.  I couldn't believe the care and service I received.  It was fantastic.  With my permission, the McAfee tech guy "took control" of my computer just for the purpose of repairing the problem that I had with the McAfee Internet Security program.  I stayed at my computer and watched in awe as my cursor, without my assistance, clicked this and that and new things popped up and screens changed and more clicks and then I'd be prompted to enter information.  They totally fixed the problem with no complaints from me as to the time it took or the knowledge of the tech.  In fact, I then received a phone call asking me to check "this and that" under certain categories, especially the subscription expiration date to be sure all was as it should be.  I found the CD of this new 2012 version installed easily and without any problems.  I find the program works perfectly.  I do notice a slight slow down when it is scanning while I'm using the computer but nothing of any great significance.  All in all, I have no complaints about this product so that means this definitely deserves the 5 stars I gave it.  I'm not at all computer savvy so anything concerning installs on my computer that turn out to be easy and without any hitches and, anything that can be fixed relatively easy by the manufacturer IF there is a problem, is the best thing in the world in my book.  One of the features, the "Quick Clean" tool that cleans up unnecessary files, etc. on your computer, is something I really find useful.  I'm sure I'll be buying this same McAfee virus protection product next year from Amazon.	1
We've been using this software on all our home's computers for several months and we haven't had a single problem. Not viruses or other malware, nothing. And it's pretty unnoticeable working in our system -- we have slightly older computers running Windows 7. Highly recommended!	1
....but on my little HP Vivienne Tam Mini, boy does it slow her down. I installed this on an HP Touchsmart and a Mini. I used only the online instructions, because it is recommended to install in that manner, and the Mini doesn't take a disc anyway. Installation was fast and easy on both machines, and starts with a sweep of each machine. No problems with the Touch, but the Mini can barely load a page if a scan is in progress, and it's slower in general. If you like great big alerts when something is caught, you will not like the subtlety of this Mcafee product, but personally I like it. UPDATE: My little mini's hard-drive blew, so perhaps it was that which was slowing her down. Also, on the HP Touch, I love that it pops up when portions of a site are blocked.	1
I've used McAfee products before to good end so I was glad to install this program.  It was simple and straightforward which is always a good thing.  The first thing it runs is a check for existing problems which is another good thing as I had not locked our network after changing routers recently and I have been running my wireless network open again.  It took a few minutes to download and set-up.  McAfee found one incompatible software program, my last network security, and offered to delete it for me.  So thoughtful!  I did do speed tests before and after to see if it had effected my connection speed and it was not a meaningful difference.  The funny thing about it is the pulsing shield in the toolbar.  At first it was annoying but the couple of times it wasn't on, I went looking for it.  It is always nice to know something has your back.	1
So I got a new PC and it came with a few weeks free of McAfee AntiVirus Plus at a discount price.  I am a Norton guy on all my personal PCs.  Most of my work environments in the past have been McAfee because it is cheaper.  It was dog slow in the past, but I figured they would have got it right by now.  WRONG.  I was constantly turning off the active scan to speed up compiling and transferring files.  The product touted - This version of McAfee Internet Security was developed specifically to work with your Dell PC for maximum security, speed and seamless operation.  What a load of crap that turned out to be.  After my third virus, the happili re-director being the last, I uninstalled McAfee, Bought and downloaded Norton.  Virus gone and PC is running fast again.  NEVER AGAIN WILL I GET SUCKERED INTO McAfee!!!	-1
I loaded this on our Velocity Micro gaming computer that runs on Windows 7.  I guess others have had problems loading, but this program loaded without a hitch.  No frustration getting it to work at all.  Notably, I have been VERY frustrated loading other brands on another computer of mine.  The software does not slow down the system at all, and it checks downloads quickly and is effective at scanning downloads for actual and possible threats. It gives me a very clear message as to whether there is a virus or potential virus and gives a red, yellow or green safety ratng that is very easy for my son to understand. The computer is being used mostly for gaming and so we download alot from the internet and so far so good - McAfee has successfully kept our computer free of viruses.  At the same time, the computer runs efficiently and is not being slowed down by the security program at all.  McAfee has a great reputation and this lives up to that reputation in my opinion and compares favorably to experiences I have had with Kapersky (which I couldn't get to load on one of my computers) and Bit Defender (which somehow didn't keep one of my computers from getting infected with a virus). I highly recommend McAfee internet security.	1
Have used this software and the others (Norton, AVG, Trend Micro) and they have all worked as expected.  I am not one that has a problem with viruses (hardware firewall and stay away from places that get you in trouble) so I would not expect to have a problem.  Software was easy to install and sits back and does it job.	1
I liked the Internet Security 2012 Suite from McAfee. The installation of the software was more thorough than others I've tried (like Trend Micro). I appreciated that before the software is installed, it runs a security check to see if viruses or other threats are on your system BEFORE the McAffee is installed on your computer. It also provides a site advisor and red, yellow or green lights (while surfing or visiting sites online) to let you know if a site is safe to visit, or poses a security threats. Much easier to use compared to Trend Micro, too.	1
Mcafee is superior to Norton in my opinion. I had Norton and it was like not having any anti-virus on your computer. Maybe they have improved now. It is amazing as at one point the biggest name was Norton but they didn't live upto the expectations. Mcafee does the job. Recommended.	1
Mcafee Internet Security 2012 is a very good antivirus, Internet security package that works well once installed. The main issue with the package is the cumbersome install process that ranges from cumbersome to very difficult based on the configuration of the PC. On a clean PC, without any antivirus software, it is fairly straight forward process, but on an older PC with existing products, it took a very long time and three attempts.  Once the software is installed, it runs fairly quietly in the background and does catch suspicious activity with regularity on my son's PC. The settings can be adjusted to accommodate your level of desired protection and notifications. The programs also update antivirus signatures without user intervention.  This is good software that works well, but would like to see the install process greatly improved.  CFH	1
I don't like two aspects of this McAfee security software: that I had to try three times to install it and that, once the year-long subscription runs out, I'll get constant messages asking to renew until I uninstall it or pay for a new version.  Otherwise, this program works well in the background of my PC without noticeable slow-down.  McAfee's Internet Security adds two upgraded features to its AntiVirus Plus program:  parental controls and automatic online backup.  Of course, the second your subscription runs out, you'll no longer have access to those backed up files, but still, it provides some peace of mind.  Because I use this on a laptop, I've had some issues when I've interrupted the backup and then I get error messages the next time I use it.  Mostly, though, it has worked seamlessly.  Although this program comes with a CD for installation, you can opt to do an online download that is guaranteed to be up-to-date.  This is great news for netbooks and laptops without CD-ROM drives.  Here's where I ran into installation problems, though.  My internet connection must have had a hiccup because the online installation stalled despite the program's continued "running."  I couldn't get the download to resume, so I aborted, opting instead for the CD download.  As I learned later, the clicks to stop the online installation and to go to the CD instead did NOT stop the online attempts.  My laptop froze.  McAfee didn't recognize the CD spinning in the drive.  I had to reboot.  I decided to try the online download again -- and that worked.  Still, it took me forty-five minutes to install the darn program.  Once there, though, it has worked well, although I cannot tell you if it has really stopped any attacks.  I have to trust that it will.  Installation of this program automatically turns off any antivirus programs you already have installed on your computer.  When I was trying to install the McAfee and failing, I was also getting error-messages from the Symantec program already installed on the computer.  After successful installation, these messages from Symantec disappeared, probably because the McAfee totally disabled the program.  You do need to set up an online account at McAfee whether you install online or via CD to access your computer backups.  To finish activation, you need to enter the product key found in the box.  Unlike All-Access which runs from a single account, this three-user version can support three different accounts.  For PCs, this provides solid protection for a year.  -- Debbie Lee Wesselmann	1
Installation: = For a trouble-free installation, completely un-install any competing products first = Also, un-install any other Mcafee products you have installed, it will not remove them as promised but it will choke on them. = Shut all other programs down during install, you will need to restart your PC upon completion. = Mcafee will check your computer for viruses = We installed on Win 7 and XP with no issues  What Works: + Doesn't noticeably slow down computer + Lots of features: Anti-virus, anti-spy, anti-phishing, website safety ratings, etc + Catches viruses in email before you open it + Intuitive interface + 3 users - everyone in the family can use the same product  What Could Be Better: - I didn't have to call tech support but I have friends who use this product also and say that it is awful. - Mcafee will verify your Windows license (my license is valid, but I don't see how this is any of Mcafee's business...)  Good things to know: = If you give Mcafee your credit card number, it will auto renew the license every year unless you can figure out how to cancel - 30 days before your subscription expires. = If Mcafee seems to be slow, you can go into settings and turn off some of the RAM-hogging features.	1
Easy install.  Worked as expected, a little on the slow side.	1
There isn't much to say about this product that hasn't already been said about it or others in this category.  It installed easily and quickly.  Ran through a full scan and found items the old Symantec product didn't (which is expected) and continues to monitor the 2 pc's we put it on.  So far, we haven't had any trouble.  No noticeable slowing in the computer functions, no virus activity, nothing.  I would say this is a win over Symantec but as always, it could be better.	1
Used TM for several years.  Since installing this version I experienced long boot times and disk churning.  Went so far as to replace the hard drive and reinstall windows 7.  Finally dug deeper and found "coreservices.dll" was using almost 100% of my CPU time.  Searched it and found it was Titanium's main/core background service.  Searched TM site and found two patches and neither fixed it.  Nuked Titanium and all is now well.  TM later got back to me for a round of "blame the customer" support. Been there, done that. Too late.  Plus they wanted to remotely logon to my PC from the Philippines to diagnose it.  NO WAY!  Now using BitDefender Family Pack.  Supports all my family and all our devices for $69.99/year.  That's two PC's, two notebooks, one tablet and two phones.  Best feature is that it is totally out of my face.  A truly silent sentry.  Can't believe I put up with TM's malware for so long.  I let a wolf into the hen house.  Stupid me.	-1
This Internet Security has worked great!  It was very easy to install.  At times, other anti-virus programs have been difficult to use because they make you uninstall the previous security service before you can use their program.  With this Titanium product, it uninstalled the old program itself once I gave it permission.  That was very convenient and quick.  I have also been very impressed with the monthly reports that are given to me.  I don't have to be reminded to go to the program to see what's going on, a small window pops up and allows me to stay abreast of any threats or security concerns that were presented within the past month.  Again, I have been very happy with this product.	1
I have used this software for the past four years and just purchased the most recent version 2013. It stops all viruses, spyware and threats.  The installation is simple and no real maintenance is required to keep your system running fast and safe. Other products have slowed our systems down which is why I always return to Titanium!	1
At $13 who can argue with this?!?!?  This Titanium Internet Security is the mid-level software from Trend Micro.  In addition to the basic internet surfing protection, it has offline PC protections tools - like full system scanning, 2 GB online data backup, and secure file erasing.  These options are a great upgrade - more than what is usually offered in upgraded versions by other companies.  I'm very happy with Trend Micro's security software.  It installs fast, has a great user interface, and doesn't slow down my PC as much as other brands.  Highly recommended.  And for only $5 more you can upgrade to the highest level of protection and get enhanced password protection folders, wi-fi hotspot security, and 10 GB of online data backup.&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Trend-Micro-Titanium-Maximum-Security-2012-3-Users-3-PC-1-Mac/dp/B005AAWOT0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Trend Micro Titanium Maximum Security 2012 - 3 Users (3 PC, 1 Mac)</a>&nbsp;This is a great deal considering that most online data storage companies (Google, dropbox and Adrive) charge the same or more for their services.	1
I am impressed with this the Trend Micro Internet Security, it seems vigilant in keeping bad things off of my computer  It has even blocked me from going to sites that I have misspelled.  I can always click to go their anyway, but it blocks the initial contact with that site.  I am bad about misspelling certain sites on occasion and I have come to rely on this program so that I am not redirected to a malicious site.  I highly recommend this program, although it takes some getting used to, I have grown to love the protection.  If you choose to run spybot search and destroy, or malware bytes or other free software to clean your computer, you will need to turn Trend Micro off during the process.	1
I tried this version of Trend Micro after using the 2010 version.  I installed it on a PC I built in 2008 which is using an Intel Core 2 Duo E8500 Wolfdale running at 3.16 Ghz on an Asus Rampage Formula motherboard, and 4GB of DDR2-1066.  The PC is currently running Windows 7 x64.  Installation of the software was easy.  The user interface seems to have been refined over the years, and it is very straightforward and intuitive.  Instead of replacing the Windows firewall, the 2012 version enhances the Windows firewall configuration.  They call it the "Windows Firewall Booster."  The AV component of this SW suite seems fairly robust.  They added a "Fake AV Cleaner" protection which targets malware that poses as antivirus software (shamefully, I have fallen victim to that in the past).  Scan times are about typical for a modern AV product, and a full scan always takes longer that you might expect.  My only complaint with this is the power saving scheme kicked in and put my PC top sleep during a full scan, so upon resuming the scan was sort of "frozen" and I had to restart it.  I don't use parental controls, so I can't comment on that aspect of the software.  I am happy with the fact that TM doesn't constantly pop annoying alerts and warnings - for the most part it runs silently until there is a danger requiring user intervention to solve.  I also don't use the backup feature - I have my own backup scheme.  I did try the System Tuner feature, and it basically does the same thing that something like CCleaner would do.  Actually, I prefer CCleaner.  I also run Spybot (another product) periodically and it finds things that TM does not.  Overall, I like TM over something like Norton - TM seemed to install cleaner and seems to have greater performance, though I have seen some reviews that question both of these aspects.  For my installation, I did not have these issues.  I think this version improves many of the things in the 2010 version, and seems to be stable and unobtrusive.  The real bottom line is "would I buy the next version"...and I think I would.	1
Having tried 5 different Internet Security programs in the last 3 years I feel like I have a handle on what is good about each one.  I tried Zonealarm, Norton, MacAfee, Trend and another.  This one was my second favorite (I stuck with Norton), but it did have some features that were nicer than Norton.  My main concern is that it doesn't slow my computer down. This program is pretty good in this regard, but not as perfect as Norton (which is why I ultimately went with Norton).  Trend has some better features and choices of how to set things up, so it is stronger in that regard. But if you want a program that does its work without bugging you, I would opt for Norton.  If you don't like Norton's features, I would recommend Trend.	1
I have been using Trend Micro for the last 7 or 8 years. I know the last Consumer Reports I received for May 2012 only rates Trend at about 10th place on their list, with Bitdefender, Norton, Kapersky ahead of Trend. I've used these and other internet security software programs, but I personally have had great success with Trend Micro. I also like the fact that I can call them if an issue arises. If I find something that works and protects me, I stay with it, and Trend Micro is my go to security software. Plus Amazon has some great prices on Trend at times.	1
I figured I would try out Trend Micro Titanium for my computer after reading the reviews here. I noticed that they were mixed, but had an overall good rating. My gut instinct said to do more research, but I ordered it despite the uneasiness. I should have listened to my initial feelings.  I use a hp computer running with Windows Vista. The setup became just as much of a headache for me as other reviewers mentioned. After a few hopeless attempts, I threw the disc away and purchased Norton. Please save your money.	-1
I have held off from writing this review so that I could be absolutely sure that Trend Micro Titanium is the software for me and my little computing center.  It is.  I have used it several months now and no matter what I throw at it it keeps me secure and I could not ask for more protection.  The one element about Trend that I like above all is that is works pretty much in the background and does not slow my processor that much.  All security programs will slow the processor some and some create quite a burden on the temper of the user.  Its footprint is small and its abilities are significant.  Of the several packages that I have used I like this one best.	1
I have used Trend Micro on a number of Windows PC's for years.  I have always been happy with their products and the small footprint of the installation.  I am not one to turn on all the features of these full fledge security products, such as parental controls.  What I do use them for is anti-virus and malicious downloads from web sites.  At those levels of protection, Trend Micro does a very good job.  The product is not intrusive and does not slow down your computer.  This product offers 3 licenses which is very nice for todays households who often have multiple pc's running.  I have a Windows 7, Windows 7 virtual, and an older Vista laptop that I have this running on.  Installation was straight forward except on one computer, the physical win 7 laptop.  I was running another virus product on that laptop and removed it before installing Trend Micro.  When I installed Trend Micro it gave an install error and wouldn't let me move forward.  The error had a link to it and the instructions stated that I needed to remove the product and reinstall.  This had to be performed by a temp folder that the software installed on the laptop.  Problem was that the temp folder was never created.  I was able to find the folder and uninstall program on the install disk but average user may not look or find it there.  Once i ran the uninstall utility and reinstalled everything ran fine  Not sure why I got the error, the error message did not give much detail.  The other pc's installed fine so might have been something left over from the other virus product that caused issues but not sure.  Outside of that issue everything has been working as expected.  Overall this is another good product from Trend Micro.  It offers good protection from typical security threats.  I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a security suite for the whole family.	1
I've enjoyed using this product for safer surfing.  Installation was easy and straight-forward.  It did ask to uninstall SpyBot S&D, which I obliged, though not convinced it mattered.  In the past, I have not had any problem with Spybot S&D running with different antivirus programs.  Coming off of Bit Defender, I found the Trend Micro interface to be much simpler to navigate and use.  Of course, somewhat less options are available to make that interface more user friendly.  Scans were quick and overall my web surfing is not laggy.  If you want to turn off the Trend Micro, you have to do it from the system tray (right lower screen, click on the icon, and click on EXIT).  I could not find a way to disable it from the control panel itself.	1
I've used Trend Micro's Housecall a lot in the past for my online scans or to remove any malware.  Up until now I hadn't ever used their Internet Security software in the past.  I found that it is just as accessible as Housecall.  The windows are sleek and easy to you use.  The scan itself isn't to labor intensive and you can actually use other programs while it is running a full system scan, which I've found is usually my biggest gripe about other Internet Security software.  All in all I would recommend along side other comparable big name Internet Security programs.	1
I highly recommend Trend Micro Titanium Internet Security 2012.  For most users who don't want to work with advanced features or settings beyond the recommended settings, Trend Micro Titanium has been slightly simplified over the previous Internet Security version from past years. It's fast in scanning, it doesn't slow down my computer while I work, and the way it communicates reports to me is clear and clean.  I love it.  I'm using an AMD Phenom triple-core PC with 8 GB of RAM, and Windows 7 64-bit version. Installation was simple and quick, lasting about 5 minutes.  Even for the advanced users who like to tweak the settings, there are a good number of settings you can tweak.  You can choose if you want security software drivers to load as soon as the computer starts (for Extra Security), only have main drivers load at startup, or have drivers load after the OS has completed loading (for Extra Performance).  You can also set a password to prevent any changes to the Trend Micro software settings.  There are two tools: Parental Controls and Data Theft Prevention.  Both easy to get to, setup, and turn on/off.  There are four main menus: Virus & Spyware Controls: containing "Scan Preferences" and "Scheduled Scans" Internet & Email Controls: containing "Web Threats", "Spam & Emailed Files", and "Network" Exception Lists: containing "Programs/folders" and "Websites" Other Settings: containing "System Startup", "Proxy Settings", "Password", and "UI Skinning"  The Web Threats above seems to work with Microsoft Internet Explorer and Mozilla Firefox. No mention of any other browser. UI Skinning allows you to change the look of the main console.  I've been using Trend Micro for about 4 years now.  I've tried Kaspersky Internet Security, McAfee, Norton 360, and Computer Associates before I started Trend Micro.  I prefer Trend Micro over all of the others because of the speed of installation, the ease of using the software, and the ease of uninstalling, if necessary. For me, it runs quicker than the other internet security/total security packages.  But I don't use Trend Micro exclusively. I like to sample different security packages to see improvements companies make in their products.  Kaspersky works second best for me. I used McAfee recently and that worked quite well, but I still prefer Trend Micro. 5 stars.	1
My computer runs faster with Titanium than with my old internet security (IS) system.  My computer was running so slow, I thought I needed a new computer until I removed my old IS software.  My computer started to run faster immediately afterwards, and didn't slow down when I installed Trend Micro Titanium.  All my software opens quicker, especially the internet.  It's more than twice as fast as with my old IS software.  All software opens on one click instead of three or four.  I can't believe I spent two years sloshing through mud with the old IS software.  Titanium has three settings:  1) Upload in full at start up (slows down start up); 2) Upload in part (start up is quicker - default).  Start up takes me only 3 minutes instead of 10; 3) Uploads only after start up is completed (fastest start up).  It takes up 259 MB of space, but says you need at least 500 MB for installation.  It allows for a Quick Scan which takes only 4 minutes.  This was a feature I missed with my old IS software.  With Titanium, you can choose to do a Quick scan, a Full scan or a Custom scan of specific drives.  The Full scan took 90 minutes.  Scanning slows the computer down...way down (which is why I took a star away).  That has not changed from my last system to this one.  I have yet to find an IS security software that I can use while surfing the net.  The software does not pop up with a reminder that I need to scan every time I turn on my computer.  Nor does it suddenly start scanning when I'm watching a video, causing the video to sputter.  Both were issues with my last IS software.  It allows the user to determine when to scan so you can wait until you are finished for the day to run one.	1
I have used Trend Micro for several years. Have also used Norton, Kaspersky, and McAfee all with good results. We have multiple computers in our home and in recent years have been converting to Linux Ubuntu Distro which necissitates not having this type of anti virus control. On Windows 7 and Vista computers that we have all of these programs are running well and tough to pick one over another. Each have their characteristics on updates and excluding various programs. Some are limited in storage and require additional purchases. Was glad to get the Trend Micro Titanium and can reccomend it as a good solid anti virus program. Catches most Malware consistently.	1
Being someone who has a basic knowledge of computers and how they work I was skeptical on whether I could install this myself or if I would need help. I gave it a go alone and was surprised to see how easy it is to install. Once I was able to get it installed using it was even easier. I would recommend this to anyone who has a basic knowledge of the computer and can follow directions.	1
Picked up this protection for my mother's PC.  Some features were usuable on my Mac, which I thought was a cool bonus.  It's a user friendly security set up.  I don't think I'm truly qualified to comment on the security it provides, but so far, so good.  :)	1
I had been using Trend Micro TITANIUM 2011 internet security software for an entire year without a single problem.  No viruses got through, no problems that I'm aware of.  It's been the same so far with TITANIUM 2012.  I use an old computer running Windows XP.  It took about 10 -15 minutes to install including the re-boot.  What I like about this particular program over several others that I have used in past years is that this program runs silently in the background never ever bothering me to answer questions about what I would like done with a virus or problem it has detected.  It takes care of it by itself.  It updates silently, I can continue doing whatever it is I'm doing without being interrupted.  It does a periodic full scan and will let me know that it's doing that but I can minimize it and continue working. It's got the option of site restrictions for kids but I don't use that because it's more trouble than I like to go through.  My kids know the rules for using my computer anyway and there will be hell to pay if they break them. But others might find them useful.  Overall, this has been my favorite anti-virus software over the many other brands that I have used in the past.	1
I read their claims that the cloud technology keeps your computer from slowing down. I guess that they must mean that it keeps your computer from getting VIRUSES that slow it down. Because the updates (daily and large) certainly drain my system resources. As do the scans, which tend to take a couple hours for a thorough scan of less than 1 million files (most of them are system files...you'd be surprised how many files are really on your computer).  That said, it is still better than Kaspersky. Or the Awful Twins (McAfee and Bit Defender), neither of which I will ever voluntarily allow near my system again. I hope to get Norton soon for comparison. I've heard that the latter most is something like the Lexus of antivirus, so I am intrigued. For those on more a Toyota budget, however, this certainly seems to be reliable and effective on my machine...it stopped a threat that was from a jump drive in the autorun boot sector, which could have been really hard on my system, so I am a fan of TrendMicro, even if it is a bit slow and unwieldy.	1
This may be Trend's best security product yet! Installation was a breeze and progressed without a problem upgrading from Trend Internet Secuirty 2010. The new cloud based Trend Protect network solution is light on system resources and seems to run great. The interface is simplified and very clean although advanced users may be a bit underwelmed. All in all I am very happy to be sticking with Trend and for the price it is hard to beat.	1
I have a lot of computers/devices on my home network (including a server). Although Trend's home products don't work on a server, it was vital for me to keep each PC/Mac protected at every point possible to protect every possible entry into the network. With Trend, it's easy! Trend's Smart Protection Network has protected me more than once from spam, malicious URLs in Facebook/Twitter, and more. The threat detection also seems pretty good.	1
I have been using Maximum Security '12 for almost a year now, and I have to say that I prefer Trend Micro products.  It is undeniable that Trend Micro catches some flak from industry critics, which concerned me at first. I utilized Trend Micro in '10, saw some of the reviews for the company, and subsequently tried a few of the critically acclaimed heavy hitters for my PC protection in 2011. The fact is, almost every other program I tried annihilated my computer's performance in comparison to Trend's light load. What's more, because of the rather typical use of my machine, Trend seems to do just as good of a job protecting my PC as the big gun programs that bring it to a grinding halt.  All in all, I don't seem to require more security than what Trend provides, and I definitely require more performance out of my computer than what many other programs permit. This being the case, Trend Micro's PC security options will be my go-to preference moving forward.	1
Being first on the market with a brilliant idea does not guarantee you'll get rich.  But it almost certainly guarantees your competitors will do whatever they can copy your idea.  Trend Microsystems accomplished two such brilliant ideas in 2011 with&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Titanium-Maximum-Security-Premium-2012-3-Users/dp/B005AAWP1W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Titanium Maximum Security Premium 2012 - 3 Users</a>.  One: The first security suite that protects all of your multiple devices ... desktop, laptop, tablet, smart phone ... and coordinates security between them.  TWO: First security program to install and operate mostly on a Cloud. Cloud-based functions and features serve two purposes: Your devices interact and share data anytime on an always-on Cloud; and with much of the program's footprint based on the Cloud, you've freed memory and resources for the devices themselves.  Put it all together, and you're making real news: A first-of-its-kind security suite that coordinates protection between your desktop, laptop and smart phone simultaneously, while freeing resources to make them run more efficiently.  That's the good news.  The bad news, kinda bad for Trend Microsystems at least, is that 17 months after introducing their brilliant idea, the biggest names in security software each offer suites with these same or similar advancements.  "McAfee All Access" was rolled out in Summer 2012, and Symantec introduced  "NORTON 360 - Multi-Device" October, 2012.  From me though, I salute the innovator - 5 stars, more if I could, to the trail-blazer.	1
Good security software.  Used for the last year without any problems.  Does not slow down system to an extent that it is noticed.  Works as advertised	1
Titanium Maximum Security is another great addition by TM and this set protects not 1, not 2, but THREE computers!!  What is there to say about Trend Micro products?  They get the job done, they are inexpensive, and they are rock solid.  ***** RECOMMENDED	1
I have been using titanium since it came out and have been very satisfied. The latest version is no exception. It runs well in the background and has stopped all threats. Also bundled in the package was titanium for android devices. So for one low price I protected three computers and android devices. What a great value. As usual Amazon is a great place to shop. I have always had fast shipping and no problems.	1
Complete computer and internet protection for 3 users for under $25 - I'm sold!  I got tired of all the pop-up ads on free anti-virus programs.  The hassle wasn't worth the few dollars I was saving.  Not only is this internet anti-virus, it has so much more.  I use the 10 GB of online file backup to store my irreplaceables (family photos, insurance documents, contracts, etc).  I have the full system scan to keep my computer running faster and to keep my junk files to the minimum.  I have a Trend Micro securely locked folder with my financial information in it.  The secure delete program is my favorite.  Instead of just emptying my desktop trash (which doesn't really delete anything, it just hides it), I delete all my file with the secure delete feature.  This truly erases them so that they can never be hacked.  Window's can't do that!  Overall I'm very pleased with this software.  It was a breeze to install.  Runs great without any system crashes.  And gives me much more than anti-virus.  I'll be looking to upgrade when the 2013 edition is released.	1
I've tried many AV suites and always come back to Trend Micro products.  If you want comprehensive protection without a lot of interference and bloat; if you want to be safe but don't care to sacrifice speed, Titanium Maximum Security Premium 2012 is an excellent choice.  The program is licensed for three computers and I installed it on two laptops running Windows 7.  One computer has very little on it; the other is overloaded with data.  The program installed with equal ease on both, and did an excellent job of scanning and vetting both hard drives.  Trend Micro's AV will not eat up your resources like so many other programs will, and it runs in the background without slowing you down.  Not only that, but you can configure it easily to do only what you want.  I recently switched to a Mac and it actually includes a disk for Mac.  Until recently, AVs for Mac have been unnecessary, but new exploits like the current Java one are happening every day, so I just may try it out.  After I do, I'll report back.	1
What else is there to say? Trend Micro continues to make me happy as my antivirus of choice. It does just what I need, and doesn't force itself on me if I don't want it. It doesn't invade my system like other AVs out there, and it works perfectly without being bloated and huge.  If you're looking for a low-cost, high-end antivirus you can't go wrong with Trend Micro.	1
My criteria for security suites is pretty simple - install seamlessly (I run Windows 7 64bit), I want no problems, hicoughs or gliches - I want a small footprint, not a system resource hog - I want the product to run in the background the vast majority of the time and be relatively unnoticed unless I want to interact with the product - the suite needs to be configurable, in other words I want to be able to set the level of security, white and black lists, schedules, disable on command if I find it necessary, etc., I am a veteran software engineer and fully capable of crossing the street without a security suite holding my hand (for those less sure of themselves, the default setup is not that far from my customized settings and fuly workable)  Overall, this product excells in all of these categories, though it does use a little more in the area of system resources than I find to be perfect in my perception (I like the Viper product more in this respect, with that product I could easily forget that I even had a system security suite, and just to validate it's capability the update to this product and accompanying full system scan did not find any viruses, cookies, etc to complain about). P-)	1
I installed this on my main laptop and on my netbook about 6 months ago. The installation itself was very simple and so far I haven't had any issues with viruses or even too many scan pop-ups. So, so far, so good.	1
Good seller and ok item.	1
No problems	1
This was a great price & we use this protection on both our desktop computer as well as our laptop computer.  Had bought the same software last year, the 2011 version.	1
Antivirus Plus 2012 is another great offering from McAfee. I'm familiar with their products, and have always been happy. I've tried many antivirus and antispyware programs,including Avast, CyberDefender, and Trend Micro. McAfee is, to me, the most intuitive and effective tool. Highly recommended.	1
McAfee uses an outdated download filter which scans every packet before it is transferred to the browser.  The side effect is slower download speeds.  Well...their own live update program caused the install to crash three times.  The live update was averaging about 20 kbps.  For those of you unfamiliar with technology, this is half the speed of normal dial-up.  I watched the register go from 20...10...5...2...1...0 kbps.  Finally at 0 kbph, McAfee told me that I don't have enough bandwidth to do a live update and the install cannot complete.  Why is it that the biggest software brands are the worst ones to install?	-1
I always get my virus protection from Amazon, the price is so much better.  McAfee offers excellent virus protection and is easy to install/uninstall. Although installation does take a few minutes, it is well worth it. I have it do the scans and updates when I'm not using my computer so it doesn't slow me down.	1
McAfee Total Protection 2012 is a great piece of software that I have had running on my desktop for many, many months.  Installation was easy and fast and I have not had any problems with viruses since installing.  Performance has been good as well and I have no issues.  Like with old versions of McAfee, easy to recommend!!  **** RECOMMENDED	1
I have always had good luck with McAfee products, and although the founder of the company is now being sought as a murder suspect, it doesn't mean his software is not solid.  This was easy to install, ran well, and did the job.  As one of the standard-bearers of the anti-virus software franchises, you can't go wrong with McAfee.  I have two home computers, and the multi-user feature worked well.  I was able to install and run auto-updates no problem.  I am currently running this version on my home machines, and have not had a problem with either viruses or system performance.  I can recommend this or other McAfee products without hesitation.	1
I can't really review this for how it works, it would not load onto our computer at all! I don't know what else to say, hopefully it works for you.	-1
Like pretty much every PC owner, you need to protect your system from the ever-increasing number of threats on the Internet.  I typically like to stick with the big names when it comes to security products and I've been using McAfee for years.  Installation was exceedingly easy and well thought out. I already had a different McAfee A/V package installed but it had expired a week or so previous, so I was a bit worried how complicated removing the old one and installing the new one was going to be. As it turns out, it was virtually painless.  I dropped in the new CD, launched the installer and the new software recognized my old software, uninstalled it, then installed itself in its place. After the obligatory restart, it downloaded the newest definitions and I was good to go.  Operation of this software is similar to many others. You can change the scanning schedule and how intrusive it is. It periodically downloads new updates and prompts you to restart the system to activate the changes. While I dislike having to restart, that's kind of the way things work on WIndows systems and go with the flow.  The built in firewall doesn't see much in the way of incoming attacks since I'm behind a hardware firewall, but the outgoing firewall keeps a pretty good eye on things.  Overall, I'm pretty impressed with this software and will continue to use McAfee to protect my PCs.	1
McAfree goes far beyond stinking up the place. This is their worst attempt at software butchery.  They are a damn disgrace. They have a lot of balls selling this garbage.  Don't buy this crap. Amazon should not allow this kind of thing from this vendor who surely knows the product Total Protection is a total rip-off.  McAfree would not install on one computer. Thank god. Was lucky. And the one it did install on it screwed up my WWW/Internet so badly I thought I had a McAfree virus. Had to experiment with deletions this and that. Experimented with ToolBars. Firewalled this and that. Uninstalled McAfree. The problem went away.  McAfree stinks. Historically, this is about par for the course for McAfree.  Man, was I ripped off.  Amazon is getting like eBay nowadays.  Don't buy this.  Windows 7 Ultimate, quad processor, 2.8 Ghz, 16 Gbs of RAM, 3 Gbs graphic engine that is discreet.	-1
Antivirus is an important component of any operating system and its criticalness continues to grow in importance as more and more individuals find ways to infect computers, deliver spam, and otherwise do harm to the computers of others. I have used many antivirus software products and one that I continue to return to is McAfee. This latest version, McAfee Antivirus 2012 for 3 Users, is as good as ever, and I feel very confident that it will protect my information from harm.  McAfee Antivirus 2012 allows for loading on up to three different pc's for a single price and this makes it very useful for those who have pc's scattered around the house and do not want to invest in a separate antivirus purchase for each. Loading is easy and I like that McAfee Antivirus 2012 operates in the background, keeping your computer safe and without slowing down your processes. If you load a CD or anything else, it automatically scans and lets you know the coast is clear and when you schedule a nightly scan, it will tell you later if the scan didn't complete. These protections give me a safe, secure feeling and I can go about my day using my pc without worry.  McAfee Antivirus 2012 is great for fighting internet battles against viruses, spyware, and the like. If I had to find one small fault, it would be with the limitation with the three installations. If you don't install on three computers, you cannot install the remaining ones and expect it to last a full year. The countdown begins with the first install. So, if I install one on May 1, another on June 1, and a third pc on July 1, all three will reach their expiration on May 1. This is a small annoyance, but it really doesn't matter too much for me because I tend to load the antivirus on all three pc's at once anyway.  Virus protection is very important and McAfee Antivirus 2012 is one of the better products available for this purpose. It is much more intuitive than other antivirus products- so much so that a grade school age child could figure it out. It works the way an antivirus product should without slowing down your computer or causing any problems and it earns an enthusiastic recommendation.	1
I've been using McAfee security software for 3 years now.  They are one of the most trusted brands and work good enough for my needs.  Good basic protection at a decent price.	1
I really like McAfee Antivirus.  It doesn't slug down my computer like Norton does.  It does a good job of keeping my computer safe.  I will continue buying this product! It's easy to install and use, as well.	1
I've used a lot of anti-virus through the years but I keep coming back to McAfee.  Honestly no virus protection is perfect, they each have their advantages, but the depth of McAfee's product just outstrips the others in the end.  At the end of the day being able to afford the biggest anti-virus teams gives them a leg up on the competition.  You simply get your alerts faster, and if you get into trouble, they can get you out.  My Dad once fell for a Malware site and a McAfee tech spent three hours on the phone with him undoing the damage.  You can't beat that kind of support.  It used to be you could say a lot about interfaces, but frankly all the major vendors have done a good job of improving their interface and I don't have any complaints about any of them.  McAfee is no exception: the interface is easy to use for a novice but there are lots of nobs in there for experts to play with.  One future selling point: now that Intel owns McAfee they will be enabling special security features that use Intel hardware.  This is something that was never possible before, because hardware vendors didn't want to give software that low-level control, and software vendors didn't want to share their code.  Now that it's all under one roof, the capabilities look to be amazing.	1
I have used McAfee (and Norton) for several years now.  This version seemed to install much more quickly than previous versions, and it installed on multiple pc's, as advertised with no problem.  In the past, my computer has been protected, the software caught trojan and other viruses before they were able to do any damage.  McAfee is consistently among the top security software for pc's.  I recommend purchasing cd's to install the software as opposed to buying online from McAfee, though.  McAfee defaults your setting to have the software automatically renew, and they already have your credit card number from your purchase.  You can't change the setting yourself, you have to make a phone call.  Very inconvenient and annoying, and the reason for only four stars.  This new version also creates a folder called the mcafee vault.  It is supposed to offer extra protection for files you direct there.  I chose not to use this, and was disappointed that the file cannot be removed, even if you don't use it, another small annoyance.  Overall recommended product.	1
The tech specs say that this program is easy to install, but I found the process to be long and more involving than that.  Even so, once installed it has been easy to use and offers comprehensive protection, without significantly impacting processor performance.  And I love the addition of the Mac filters - a definite plus, pushing this program over some of the competitors.	1
This Trend Micro Titanium Antivirus+ worked very well. Trend Micro has been one of our go too internet security providers for years and they are still pretty good. It dosent slow down any of our Pc's we have Trend on Tablets as well. I can think of no viruses/spy ware issues even with some of th systems being used on not the safest avenues. This is good basic starter software.	1
Trend Mico Titanium Antivirus 2012 is another solid addition to the TM lineup of virus and computer protection.  I have used TM's stuff for many, many years and find their products to be easy to use and gets the job done.  Easy to recommend!  **** RECOMMENDED	1
Installed fast with no problems.  Gives me better protection than the free anti-virus programs with no pop-up advertising.  For only $7, it's a great deal!  And it doesn't slow down my PC as much as McAfee and some other big name brands.  I'm very happy with this software.  For only $5 more you can upgrade to the next level of protection.&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Trend-Micro-Titanium-Internet-Security-2012-3-Users/dp/B005AAWNBE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Trend Micro Titanium Internet Security 2012 - 3 Users</a>&nbsp;The 2nd level gives you more protection for your offline PC as well as more settings, computer scanner, child surfing blocks, and 2 GB of online back-up.  And for only $5 on top of that you can get Trend Micro's top security software.&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Trend-Micro-Titanium-Maximum-Security-2012-3-Users-3-PC-1-Mac/dp/B005AAWOT0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Trend Micro Titanium Maximum Security 2012 - 3 Users (3 PC, 1 Mac)</a>.  Top security for under $20 is a great deal.  But for anyone wanting just the basic internet surfing protection, then this $7 Titanium Antivirus + is all that is needed.  Highly recommended.	1
Even though Antivirus+ is the "low end" Trend Micro version, at $7.39 currently for one computer, that is a bargain, especially since it even includes cloud technology; it is a huge step up from relying on shareware or other free software which may or may not offer the kind of protection that this brand has been known for for years.  Personally, I do not need most of the bells and whistles offered by the Internet and Maximum Security versions. This is because I already have a utility program that provides PC performance tools, do not care about shredding my files, utilize a separate password program, do not want to spend the time to "sync" my computer with my phone or tablet, care about WiFi only at home, and am not a social networker.  However, if these activities are of concern, then Antivirus+ is too basic, and you should consider the other two versions.  It is imperative to uninstall any other antivirus program you are running before attempting to install Antivirus+.  I installed it on a computer running Windows 7 with Internet Explorer 9; the entire process took me less than 10 minutes.  All of the settings, as well as access, are very intuitive; there is an icon in the lower right-hand side that will control everything from a drop-down menu.  It is very easy to set the program to automatically update and run scans.  Note that when you set up an account with Trend Micro, of course you also have to enter a password, but as additional security, all of your program settings are separately password protected as well, so for simplicity's sake, you may wish to make the passwords the same.	1
I'm more of a Norton user but when this item came up on the vine list I thought I would give it a try. I find it works well and keeps my computer free of viruses thus far. It was easy to install and easy to use.	1
Easy to install.  Seems to keep my network safe, but I have not been attacked, so I cannot say for sure.  Much less intrusive than past McAfee suites (no McAfee warnings asking for permission)  Doesn't slow the system down much.  Recognizes other computers with McAfee on the network and allows easier file sharing.  I think it's better than Microsoft's Security Essentials (which is free and adequate) and worth the tendollar price.	1
No matter what you have heard about this product it is still HORRIBLE! The main issues remain the same as always with McAfee: It makes your computer crash, slows down the system and does not really offer "Total Protection" Couple of comments: I have a blazing fast Dell computer (Intel i7 processor, 8GB RAM and a 500GB 7200rpm hard drive) This machine was running great UNTIL I dared to install Total Protection 2012. Although the speed does not sink to the bottom it is very noticeable the lack of speed when McAfee is updating or scanning. So I decide to get rid of this program and I find that my system was infected with some bug that Total Protection did not protect against! So I had to remove the virus and it was not really a big deal using the right software. The nightmare was to remove McAfee! Now everything is better, my computer is protected by Kasperki PURE and it is fast as ever while MaAfee is resting in my local landfill.	-1
Bought this on sale.  I have been using McAfee for years.  My current subscription had lapsed and found this at a decent price.  When I went to install it, it would not allow me to register.  Nothing that McAfee CS would (could??) do fixed it.  I have an i7 with 12 GB ram and 2 TB HD running a current Win7, so it's not the hardware or OS.  Found a competitor's product on sale that installed without a problem and even offers some upgrades that this version of McAfee doesn't so will stick with them until they have a Customer Service department that can't get the job done.	-1
I have been a loyal user of McAfee Total Protection for years. Instead of renewing my 2011 version, I installed the 2012 version. One would think it would be the same thing, but it's not. 2012 is easier on my system. I immediately noticed how much faster Internet Explorer runs. I've been using Firefox because Internet Explorer was so sluggish. I thought it was all the browser's fault. Apparently, the 2011 version causes Internet Explorer to slow down. My IE is still not as fast as Firefox, but much better than before.  As for the virus protection, I'm quite satisfied with the performance of Total Protection, which is why I continue to use McAfee. For many years, my husband did not use McAfee, and he was constantly being infected while mine was virus-free. I finally installed Total Protection on his computer. We haven't had much problems since, except for the interval last year when he went without protection for a few days after the subscription expired and he immediately picked up a virus.  If you are wondering whether to install McAfee Total Protection or Mcafee All Access For Pc Mac and Mobile, I'd go with McAfee Total Protection if you are only protecting home computers. It's less expensive, and you'll ultimately get the same software on your computer. If you are also protecting tablets and cell phones, then All Access is better. All Access will protect tablets, cell phones, netbooks, notebooks and PCs. All Access will also enable a user to remotely wipe out date from cell phones and tablets.  This McAfee version can only be used on 3 PC's. They do keep track of how many PC's it's been downloaded onto. Look for sales. It can be bought for quite a bargain.	1
After a few issues getting McAfee to install with Firefox, things went smoothly. This is the fastest-running, least noticeable protective software I've had in years, and it's working better than most as well.  If I have one criticism, it's that it's less than ideal at preventing malware and adware. Several times I've had my system bog down and had to run this program to catch it. I would much rather have a program that can protect my system right up front.	1
Mcafee is superior to Norton in my opinion. I had Norton and it was like not having any anti-virus on your computer. Maybe they have improved now. It is amazing as at one point the biggest name was Norton but they didn't live upto the expectations. Mcafee does the job. Recommended.	1
When Comcast began bundling complementary malware protection with their internet service, I installed the Comcast version of McAfee and was very happy - until Comcast switched to Norton a few years ago. Compared to the old McAfee, Norton tasks system resources much more than it should. So when I was offered a copy of McAfee Total Protection 2012 for review, it seemed like a no-brainer for me and I jumped at the chance.  Three months later, I am uninstalling it on each of the three computers I installed it on and moving back to Comcast's Norton, forfeiting the remaining nine months of the McAfee subscription.  I installed it on a desktop PC running Windows Vista x86, a laptop running Windows Vista x64, and a netbook running Windows XP. I was able to install McAfee on the two Windows Vista machines without issue, but I believe I have only had Norton on them since the last time I reformatted each of those machines. The Windows XP Netbook installed OK, but McAfee wouldn't activate properly. It seems that the old Comcast-branded version of McAfee I had removed a few years ago left some remnants in the registry that made it extremely difficult to activate that PC. McAfee thought I was still using that old Comcast version and said the subscription had expired. It took numerous uninstalls and reinstalls to finally get it activated properly, deactivating and reactivating the license at the McAfee site each time, and switching the order of those tasks each time until I stumbled onto the right combination.  Any satisfaction I felt at finally getting McAfee successfully activated was shortlived, however. The Windows XP machine began producing nightly errors on the McAfee program, and for a good hour before the error, the computer became extremely unresponsive.  Not only that, but all three computers frequently reported that McAfee real-time scanning had been disabled. Although I was able to enable real-time scanning again, it would only last a day or so, making any protection McAfee might offer extremely unreliable.  I am sorry to say that McAfee is no longer a product I would recommend to anyone - especially anyone not very computer savvy. I work in IT, and I found it cumbersome and frustrating. Your malware protection should be something that, while still needing periodic checks, just works without constant manipulation. That is not true of this iteration of McAfee. For now, I'm installing Comcast's Norton again. It may use more system resources than I like, but at least it works. I will be trying Kaspersky or another competitor in the near future, though.	-1
I have used just about all of the anti-viral/anti-spam software from Norton to Titanium to PCillian and others.  McAfee Total Protection 2012 is as good as the well known programs and far exceeds the low cost ones.  The Software was easy to installon the three computers in my home network and has kept them virus free.  The anti Spam/Antiphishing software seems adequate.  It asks if I'm sure I want to load most of the games I play requiring access to my system before it allows the access.  I have found it to be a safe and secure alternative to its bigger Brandnamed Compeitition.	1
I have used McAfee on and off for over 10 years now. This was great for me as we have exactly 3 computers in the house and at 20 to cover all three, that is a good deal in my eyes. I like that that there is an option to have it run and update in the background instead of being "right in your face" I have no complaints at all.	1
Have always had good results with McAfee. It seems to not occupy as much of your system reforces as Norton. Recommend McAfee and Kaspersky as good anti virus programs. Having Total Protection for 3 users is great when as we do there are multiple computers in a household. Like McAfee because it affords good protection and my computers still continue to run fast.	1
WAY TO PURCHASE MULTIPLE LICESES	1
This security software is good, maybe to good.  It seems to want to take over your computer and uses allot of hard drive.  I do feel safe when banking or shopping online.  Never had a problem with hackers or idenity theft.	1
Mcafee is very similar to other security software makers like Kasperky and Trend Micro. The main difference is that Mcafee's total protection runs in the background with low resource consumption. I'm able to play games and do other computing tasks without any slowdown. It's very quiet and non-intrusive.  I liked...  * That the protection is comprehensive - real time shield, virus scanner, firewall, anti-spam, computer cleaner, and parental controls. * How quiet it is. Not very intrusive and won't bug you constantly about updates (I have auto-update off). * That I'm able to play games with this on. When I was using&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Trend-Micro-Titanium-Internet-Security-2012-3-Users/dp/B005AAWNBE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Trend Micro Titanium Internet Security 2012 - 3 Users</a>&nbsp;and the free Avira, I was absolutely not able to play games with the software in the background. McAfee has low enough resource consumption so it doesn't hog up a computer's memory and processing power.  Still, this McAfee protection doesn't stand out of the pack of security brands. It performs fine and has features that can be found in free software, as well as brands like Trend Micro and Kaspersky. Definitely take a look at other companies. But, if you've narrowed down your options and would like to pay for a low-resource software that has a good real time shield and constantly updated virus databse, Mcafee is a good choice.	1
I have used Bit Defender for quite a while but wanted to try this out and am sticking with it. It offers a high level of protection as does Bit Defender but does it much smoother and is not as intrusive. I also noticed my laptop (a Dell) runs faster and I have had fewer firewall issues to deal with. It offers anti-virus which also quickly scans incoming and outgoing emails and frequently scans my laptop for problems and takes care of them efficiently, plus must have Spyware and Malware protection. One note, when installing, it asked me to uninstall spybot but did not force me to as Bit Defender did however I left it in place and it cause no harm. ( I use spybot on occasions) It offer full internet protection plus scans any other media inserted into your computer. Most others do the same....this does it a little bit better! JULY 2012. I got a virus while trusting this software, I ended up having to reinstall everything on my laptop! I have since switched to Bit Defender.....	1
This review is for McAfee Total Protection 2012. Not much has changed with this product since 2011, which is a good thing! Once again, I was extremely pleased with the quality of this antivirus software product. Not only was the installation a breeze, I was delighted to see that no "bloat-ware" or undesirable software was installed at the same time as the main antivirus program. McAfee has protected my computer from threats for several weeks now. Furthermore, my computer seems to run just as quickly as it did before installation, which is an important criterion in selecting a "total protection" anti-virus program.	1
I've been using Mcafee for about 6 years now without any instances on my laptop. It does bog down the cumputer slightly, but since I have enough free memory, it doesn't pose an issue with me. available for 3 different computer downloads, it features a varity of protective software including anti-virus, anti-theft, parental controls, anti spam/phishing, and a two way firewall. My favorite features are the shred option. Instead of just deleting a document and sending it to the recyle bin, it allows me to choose shred, which permentley deletes and doesn't end up in the recyle bin. Another feature I enjoy, is the security from the folder/ file encryption for senstive documents. I have not have a software program give me so many options and recommend this for all newer computers.	1
This will be quick and to the point, because I've reviewed other Trend Micro products, and my experience is always the same:  Trend Micro makes a very nice antivirus and security suite. It's not as bulky and bloated as some of the bigger names, but it is competent, complete, and does the job well.  I have been using TM for many years now, and I've never been disappointed with their products or their service. I highly recommend them if you're looking to step away from Norton, Mcaffee or the others.	1
This my 2nd purchase copy. It works pretty well. Its one of the best ant-virus coftware with page rating. would strongly recommend to all.	1
I love Trend Micro, and I love this new Titanium Maximum Security. I have it on 3 computers at home, and it is reliable and has protected me many times from opening a site or an e-mail that is potentially dangerous. I think Trend Micro is a top quality security software that does an excellent job of keeping unwanted viruses, spyware, and other junk of my computer. My experience for the last 7 or 8 years with Trend Micro has been excellent. I highly recommend this product.	1
So far I have been using Trend Titanium for a couple of months.  Since I have started using it, I have not seen any major problems with any of the 3 computers in my house.  Even my mother-in-laws computer has been running fine and that is no easy task keeping it running good.  My problem with the product is that it noticably slowed my computer down.  Since I only use it for personal use, it doesn't matter much, but if I were using this product at work, it could cause me to fall behind in my work. All in all, it is a good product.  I had no problems installing it, no problems figuring out how to use it, and so far, no problems with bugs in my computer.	1
We have been using Trend Micro for four years and have been pleased with it.  I installed this on my new laptop with no problems, and I am not a computer geek.  When I tried to install it on my desktop, I had problems.  I couldn't install it using the software, but went to Trend Mirco's site and was able to install it from my account there.  This product is a great deal since it can be used on three PC's.	1
I haven't had any significant issues since installing Trend on our computers.  And the price for this when we bought it was fantastic.	1
I have no major loyalty to any of the "protection suites" currently available. I have used them all and they are so similar as to be virtually identical other than the user interface.  Trend Micro tends to cover all of the same features.  Of the brands I have used lately McAfee, Norton, BitDefender and Kaspersky I feel Norton is by far the most intrusive and resource heavy followed closely by McAfee.  I used to like Kaspersky but their license renewal actually cost more than buying a new product, and at that they are one of the higher priced suites.  My favorite for "set and forget" is BitDefender, it had saved me several times but otherwise it just leaves me alone and doesn't bog down my system resources.  Titanium has the major advantage as of when I am writing this in that a 3-user license is under $20.  That all this type of software should cost, so kudos to Trend Micro.  Now that I have gone back to BitDefender for my PC I will be trying Titanium on my Mac and will write an update after I live with it for a while.	1
Since I got my first computer I have used so many types Security packages, including the free ones.  This is simple to install and runs in the background I have not noticed it slowing down the computer and I have  installed it on Vista and Windows 7.  It found some minor infections other programs failed to percieve, so this made me glad I used it.  This is so much better than ones I have used in the past--especially on Vista, which is a bloared system and has no trouble getting hung up w/o the help of an added security system	1
I have always liked Trend Micro's security software and this is no exception.  If you have used Housecall online, you know that Trend Micro has a very capable antivirus package.  This is very unobtrusive, and has a really low CUP draw.  I ran it on a 7 year old clean laptop running Windows XP, and there was no major difference when it was scanning in computer performance.  My only complaint, really, is the 3 PC per year limit.  That will keep me with Vipre and my lifetime home site license, but otherwise, I would consider a switch for Trend Micro Titanium.	1
I installed this software on 3 netbooks and activated the parental controls on a couple of the netbooks.  Installation is easy & doesn't take too long.  Setting up & modifying parental controls are easy (password) & you can set the program to send a log to your email on a monthly basis. You can also set a fixed number of hours your child can surf the net or you can custom set times when the child's computer cannot access the internet.  I saw no change in my netbook speed on start up, surfing or uploads/downloads.  One child claims her computer is slower to start up, but the other one says he sees no difference.  My children are sure to put this software to the test.  With the multiple protections that Trend Micro claims to have, we shall see if it does its job.  I have already heard a complaint about the software blocking a site because of "Web Advertising", so something is working.  As a parent who has dealt with various viruses on childrens' computers, I feel more comfortable with my childrens' web use now that Trend Micro is on their computers.	1
We've been running Trend Micro for the last 10+ years, and thought it was pretty good. Then we started having serious problems with our computers, specifically slowing down, failing to recognize hyperlinks, failing to transmit passwords properly (e.g., the New York Times), interference with websites (e.g., amazon failing to operate properly) and the security software itself turning off spontaneously. Yet this software failed to recognize the problem.  So, I loaded the free security software that comes with Windows 7 (Microsoft Security Essentials), and in short order it identified two notorious pieces of malware (VCQ.exe and DropInSavings) plus seven lesser ones. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to reach the conclusion to replace Trend Micro with Microsoft Security Essentials or some other security software that actually works.	-1
this is the third trend micro we have used. came early from amazon.com, and of course the price was very good. our 2011 was running out and time to renew. we use it for our desktop and netbook. loaded easily and was up and running in record time! may just be me- but 2012 max seems to scan faster than our 2011 max version. any who- very happy with amazon and this product-- it works very well for our computers. it will provide 3 computers with coverage. iam shopping for a new laptop, will add micro trend max for sure!	1
I really liked this one as it is far better than McAfee or Norton. It doesn't slow down the computer and is very user friendly as far as installation and usage is concerned. However, it did ask me to uninstall spybot which Kaspersky didn't do.	1
Just like other popular protection suites, it has your general features such as real-time monitoring, firewall and virus protection.  One feature that I find somewhat unique is that SafeSync, which constantly uploads your folders(you pick) to the cloud drive, so if your PC ever needs a reformat, you know that some of your chosen files are in the Trend Micro online storage.  You can also download their FREE iPhone App, which I tried and share files that way(upload a file from your PC and then download it using SafeSync on your iPhone.)  Keep in mind that the SafeSync is available for the life of your Trend Micro license only!  While this suite will protect most users, it may not protect the more inexperienced users at times.  On one PC, Trend Micro let a "fake anti-virus" program install, which was a downer.  I know that fake program viruses are tricky, but this day and age they should be able to stop those.	1
This software installed easily but made me remove some other malware software from my computer. It has a much less annoying interface than Kaspersky and does not slow your system down like Norton Antivirus.  I am using it mainly for the parental controls. It allows you to set parental controls for selected Windows user accounts. You can set different levels of controls or choose from a pre-selected menu example, for Teens. Parental controls allow you to put a - Maximum hours of use per day, - Select by the weekday which hour you want to allow access, -Block certain sites like youtube etc., -Block specific content like explicit songs, adult materials - Set restrictions on Games and movies, PG13  etc. - Block IM/Chat - Block Social Media sites like Facebook, Twitter, - Block certain Windows programs from being used. It also generates an admin report to see which sites your children have gone to, and if they tried to go to any blocked sites.  Other than parental protection it also offers safe shredding of files, a vault for sensitive files for which the password can be changed remotely in case of theft, 10GB of online storage for free. It also offers some protection features for smartphones and tablets including iPhones and iPads but from the messages I saw it seems there is an extra charge for that feature.  Overall a good security suite which serves multiple purposes. The user interface is an improvement over some others but could be friendlier, and make it easy to turn on/ turn off it's multiple features.	1
I'm not the biggest fan of security suites that try to nanny you whenever you open a browser, and in that regard, Trend hasn't really won me over. Like AVG and Norton, Trend splatters iconography all over the place to let you know what it thinks is safe, and what's not. Personally, I think it's a bit gimmicky.  Similarly, the "tune up" functionality seems like it serves more purpose making customers feel like they don't need to fall for those TV ads that make ridiculous promises. Taken in that light, it's a fine way to stop Grandma from wasting a bunch of money on making her computer 400% faster than when she bought it, or some such nonsense.  As for the underlying virus scanner... It's fast, accurate, and efficient. Where Norton wants to slowly rob your system of resources, and Kaspersky wants to spend as much time as tolerable launching its console, Trend seems to get everything right. I'm hesitant to call it the best AV solution out there, but it's definitely in the running.	1
A very good product especially when you use it to scan papers and file them into your folders.	1
Nuance Paperport  I have used since version 3 came with a combo printer I purchased years ago. A very good product easy to use.	1
Downloaded just fine. The program works great. Nothing else to say.	1
I have been buying Brother Multi Function printers for years and Paperport has always worked fine as a scanning software. I probably don't use half the features, but it gets the job done for me.	1
I've Used this program before and I'll use it again and again....fantasic program.	1
I am again sourly disappointed with the installation process, tech support and licensing hassles of PaperPort 14.  This install was an upgrade from PP12 because it had been reinstalled too many times, causing blockage by Nuance.  I could have called them again but it was time to get the latest version.  I am a home user, who started with PagesPro then a Xerox product.  I like the product, particularly the image printing to PDF and the PDF editing features.  I use them regularly.  Unfortunately, with this edition, after a clean re-install of WIN7 Pro 64-bit the image printer driver refused to install -- the main program installed fine.  I called Nuance support, no 800 number available, was on hold forever and the best they could do was say try reinstalling with the firewall and anti-virus disabled.  That made no sense, the main program was installed and registered.  My  problem was with the printer driver install only.  There are a lot of us with that problem.  I read their posts.  I tried many workarounds with no meaningful help from Nuance.  Finally, I found a utility in the image printer driver's program folder for reinstalling the printer driver after an OS upgrade -  WORKED LIKE A CHAMP. To bad Nuance did not know enough to tell me to try it.  ALSO, there is a known bug in the standard version of PP14's update program.  It does not report any update!  There are many workarounds on the web for that as well, however, none worked for me.  I am yet to call Nuance for their "help" with this known bug.  I do not hold out much hope for that.	1
I upgraded from Paperport 9 (having used versions 5 and 7 previously). Unlike those who experienced difficulty with installation, or who complained of problems once the program was up and running, I had no such difficulties. Of all versions I have used in the past 15 years, this was the easiest to install and most glitch free. I have only used this version a few days, so I am just getting used to the changes which have taken place since version 9 (which I also found quite problem free). My only reason for upgrading was I messed up doing some long overdue system maintenance which resulted in corrupting essential program files. I misplaced my version 9 installation disk and was unable to find a replacement at Amazon.com or Ebay, otherwise I would have continued to use the older program.  There are some changes in the latest one, requiring study and experimentation. All in all, however, I don't believe any of the new stuff will present much of a challenge. The current program is running much faster than the earlier rendition on my now antiquated XP computer. I am fairly certain PP14.5 (to which the program updated with the first automatic maintenance update) will be at least as useful, if not more so than all the previous versions. To my surprise and delight it even works as well with my Windows 98 scanner (a Visioneer OneTouch 8600), which was packaged with my first copy of Paperport. I am loathe to part company with the Visioneer, as I consider my several newer Canon scanners inferior and less convenient for daily use. But, then, I heartily subscribe to the old saw, "If it works, don't fix it!"	1
This loaded right up on my Windows 10 computer. The program works and I was able to scan needed documents.  My older version Paperport 9.0 would work on my new Toshiba Windows 10 laptop.	1
Awesome and powerful and flexible program.  Has lots of features, very intuitive and works as stated. I've tried several programs and this by far the most powerful and feature rich.	1
Stay away from network storage devices and you'll be ok.  This does not work well at all with the simple plug and play network drives that are out there.  If you have shared folders on a regular server or workstation however it will work fine.	1
Had Paperport 12 Pro on Win XP/sp3 Forced to move to Paperport 14 Pro when installing into Windows 8/64. Earlier versions of Paperport will not work in Win 8/64. Most off the shelf laptops and desktops will have 64 bit Windows 8 installed.  Users of PP12 will see a familiar interface in PP14 but will definitely have problems in Win 8/64 getting your scanner/printers to work. Win 8 requires printer/scanner manufacturers to rewrite their USB and LAN drivers.  Your Brother printer/scanner must have the latest firmware BEFORE installing Brother USB drivers for Windows 8. My Brother MFC-7860DW scanner/printer will handshake and scan to PP14 only over the LAN connection, but PP14 will print a hard copy over the USB or LAN connection to the Brother printer. Go figure. Brother really has problems posting the correct sequence to update their drivers to work in Win 8.  PP14 is great for organizing your scanned images whether they be done in tiff or pdf. That is why I have been using Paperport since they became the default big dog when they bought out Pagis Pro some years ago. Yes, there are other document scanning/sorting/filing programs but Paperport allowed you cut/delete and paste from one document to another. Whether it was pdf/pdf, tiff/pdf, or pdf/tiff. This is a tool I use extensively.  UNFORTUNATELY, Paperport 14 Pro has broken the RESIZE tool.  In PP12 you could resize a document or image larger or smaller.  Important if you scan a business card and want to enlarge it a bit for easier reading or shrinking something down to fit better on a size of paper.  The Resize tool is there, but no longer works, no matter if you want to increase or decrease the size in inch/cm/mm or DPI you now get a what the heck "The requested size is too large. Please use smaller values or reduce the image DPI values."  You have to cancel and "be happy" with the what you get is what you get. So that business card you have with 100 lines of mouse type is still going to be 100 lines of mouse type printed business card size on a 8.5 x 11 sheet of paper.  This "BUG" has been noted at Nuance help forums since early 2012, it is now September 2013.  Nuance has been consistent on their product updates and support, zippo, zero, nada. Their update notices are merely upsell notices to upgrade.  If you have Windows 7 or earlier keep your Paperport 12 or look for Paperport 12 if you do not have it. If you have Windows 8/64 you should look to alternatives.  Try FileCenter trial version first.  If you really want to try Paperport 14 Pro then download the 15 day trial/demo version of Paperport 14 Pro.  If you find something that worked in PP12 but is broken in PP14 do not expect it to be fixed at all by Nuance.  I am currently stuck with a reduced feature Paperport 14 Pro because I have Windows 8. I think I will increase my loses and quit Windows 8 which I have had for 2 weeks and buy Windows 7 for a Windows "upgrade".  Tech/Phone support is MON-FRI. HUH! Online chat support with off shore reps work more days. They are OK but the language syntax may throw you once in a while. Free Tech Phone/Web support for 90 days, after that you pay $9.95 for help. No support for trial versions.  UPDATE 008/11/2016 downrated to one star Paperport 14 Pro has been working in Windows 7 Pro/64. Tried PP14 in Windows 10 64bit and program does not close in Windows 10.  Must close using task manager and force close.  Will continue to use in Windows 7 but not on Windows 10 machines.  Noticed price drop so maybe a new version of Paperport is coming out that actually works in Windows 8 and Windows 10.  The cut and paste feature in PP14Pro is the only thing keeping me using this ancient software.	-1
Having been a satisfied user of PaperPort 9 for many years, and after hearing continued horror stories about every subsequent release, it was with great trepidation that I finally decided to upgrade to a newer version.  The upgrade to PP Pro 14.0 went smoothly, and I have used the product daily since then, and despite some quirks and bugs, I am happy that I finally upgraded.  I have used PaperPort 9 extensively since it came out years ago for scanning and organizing virtually all paperwork that comes through my home and office, and it has long been one of the "must-have" applications that I use every day.  When I upgraded from Windows XP to Windows 7 Pro 64 bit, I was dismayed to discover that PP 9 would not run on Windows 7 (nor would my Canon scanner), so I installed VirtualBox and used it to host a virtual Windows XP machine in which I could continue running both PP 9 and my scanner, which actually has worked pretty well.  (I tried the "XP mode" in Win 7 but it did not have good USB support that I needed for the scanner.) But PP 9 and my old scanner were aging and becoming more difficult to use for reasons described below, so it was time for an upgrade.  So I finally decided to take a chance and modernize with PP 14 and a new scanner.  Mindful of all the problems some people have reported, before doing the upgrade I took precautions.  To make sure that I could roll everything back if PP 14 messed up my system, I forced an immediate full backup to my Windows Home Server (I HIGHLY recommend anyone who uses Windows to get one of these), and then also set a system restore point in Windows 7 (via Control Panel/System).  This turned out to be unnecessary insurance because the upgrade completed without any problems.  The biggest problem I have had with PP 14 has been just figuring out all of the changes since version 9, which are extensive (and most of which I don't need), and also figuring out how to mate it up with the software for the new Canon scanner that I got to work with it.  Both PP and the scanner have a lot of options - everything seems to get more complicated, not less - and it took me a while to discover the best set of options for each.  Good things: - The user interface is much more modern looking, and is visually similar to the Microsoft Office 2007 ribbon bar - love it or hate it. - It is noticeably faster than PP 9, especially when it comes to displaying document thumbnails.  My collection of scanned items is very large, so PP 9 was taking a long time to display any new folder full of documents.  PP 14 is much faster, which alone almost makes the upgrade worthwhile for me. - It creates and views PDF version 1.7 (the latest version), while PP 9 would only create and view PDF 1.4 (the version used by Acrobat 5).  That limitation in PP 9 was also another major motivator for my upgrade. - It, together with my new scanner, produces better images, faster than before, and also automatically applies some fixes such as auto-straighten which works very well. - And it runs natively under Windows 7, allowing me to get rid of the need to start a virtual machine in which to run Windows XP - this was taking a lot of memory, as well as extra time.  Not-so-good things: - The user interface and workflow are more complicated than PP 9.  I don't need a lot of that stuff, which adds clutter and complexity. - I have experienced several non-critical (but nevertheless annoying) program crashes. - It apparently just won't work with the TWAIN driver for my scanner - only the WIA driver.  Neither PP nor my scanner was able to shed any light on this - I just had to muddle through by experimentation. - After installing PP 14, which comes with a bunch of auxiliary applications such as "PDF Viewer Plus" (which is made by DocuCom), I was unable to display most PDF files from Google Chrome - downloading important things like financial statements would result in an error box titled "PDF Viewer Plus 7.1 - A file error has occurred."  This was a serious problem for me, but I was finally able to solve it by a non-obvious Chrome fix:  Type "chrome://plugins" in the Chrome input line to bring up a list of plugins, find "DocuCom PDF Plus" and disable it.  Overall, two weeks after upgrading from PP 9 to 14, I am satisfied with the product and my decision to upgrade.	1
WillMaker Plus provides a decent way to create a will without having a costly and complicated legal consultation.  The software was easy to use and most of the terms were explained well and had more detailed references available.  One section which I found to be really useful for most people is the advanced directive.  Many people do not realize how important it is to make their decisions about life support known to their family, this software makes that process easy. The software does have some hiccups and the constant attempts to get one to upgrade are rather annoying considering this is paid software and not a free trial.  Overall,  at this price point everyone can afford to have a "will" to prevent their loved ones from going through the complex probate process in the event of death.	1
Other reviews for WillMaker 2012 have gone into some seriously good detail. My situation is pretty standard (I need a will to protect my family/our stuff if something happens to me) and I'm going to assume that most of the people searching this software out are in the same situation, so here goes (my 2011 review is basically the same; this new version has a few new features such as PDF output, a new interface, and best of all, digital asset tracking. But basically the content of the software is updated to support any new or changed laws):  Willmaker has been around for a long time, I did toy with a version several years ago. Since then they've really tightened up the interface to make it EASY to go through the will-making process. I really like that I can start the process, do a few steps, then save it and come back another night. For most of us who own or rent a home, own stuff, and have loved ones, Willmaker is going to deliver exactly what you need without the long process and major expense of sitting with a lawyer. Plus, you can have a will TONIGHT to protect your family. Even if you wanted to go that route of a laywer which is always a good idea if you have the money, I highly suggest you do the process with Willmaker first. Here's why: there are a lot of little things you need, especially inventory of goods, etc. Willmaker makes those needs clear in order to produce a will or trust. Therefore you'll know what's expected if you do go forth with a lawyer... imagine showing up and not having all you need.  For the money it seems crazy not to use this software and get a will set in stone. The interface is easy to use and is quite intuitive... it asked things I wouldn't have thought of. PLUS, you really want the latest version if you proceed with this! The 2012 version is set up with 2011 laws, so you'll want the laytest available version if you are seriously planning to create your will.  Side note: I run 64-bit Windows 7 and everything installed and ran fine, FWIW. Thanks!	1
WOW..... when I started to do a simple Will for myself and my wife I found there are so many things to think about in creating your Will and other associated documents.  This software brings up things you just don't think about.  In the end we decided to go to a local Attorney to set up a trust that was inclusive of our Will, our Health Directives and everything else. Even so, we found the WillMaker Plus software to be very helpful and a great tool.  It saved us hundreds of dollars in Attorney fees as we had the total basis for our final documents right there.  I think a family with regular circumstances and no glitches could use this software, end up with a great legal document and never have to visit an Attorney.  Our circumstances were somewhat challenging due to owning property in a dozen states, having adopted children as well as birth children and wanting to establish final instructions and care for our pets and horses.  Overall I found this software to be very good and very appropriate for creating these legal documents.  I think 90% of families will be able to create legal end-use documents without any Attorney assistance.  The software is informative, accurate and easy to use.	1
My wife and I had always talked about getting a will done, but never got around to seeing a lawyer. Just seemed like a lot of work and money for something that naturally would go to the other person should something happen (or so I thought).  Then we had a child and our priorities changed. What would happen to her if we both should die? Who would take care of her? Would she automatically acquire our assets? These, and many other questions, flooded my mind.  So I did some research, and what I found surprised me (quoted from BabyCenter):  1) "If you die without a valid will, state laws require that your property be divided according to a fairly inflexible formula. In most states your spouse, if you have one, would receive only about one-third to one-half of your estate. The rest would be earmarked for your children."  2) "In some states a state-appointed administrator (who charges fees for the service) would control your children's money until each child turned 18. And even if the courts decided that your spouse could hold the funds earmarked for your children in trust, he or she would have to supply the court with an accounting of how the money is used each year."  3) "If you and your partner both died without a will, the state courts and social services department would appoint someone to raise your children. And that person might have very different ideas about parenting than you do."  This more than gave me pause for concern. I couldn't wait any longer. I needed a will. But did I really want to talk to a lawyer?  That's when I came across Quicken WillMaker Plus 2012. As a TurboTax user, I found that WillMaker Plus worked similarly, with a wizard prompting one question at a time while offering advice. It wasn't too painful, but it did beg some questions I never thought about: such as who's going to take care of our pets? Do I want an executor? Who do I want to pull my plug should I become a vegetable? For that matter, do I want the plug pulled? Where do I want to be buried? Cremated?  After more positively motivating questions and thoughts, I finally finished. Next I created one for my wife (you can combine your assets with your spouse, but not your medical, so I just made two fully separate Wills). She had named different individuals in some cases for decision making anyway.  From there you print it out, have two witness or a notary sign them, and then make sure your executor (or lawyer or whoever) has access to it.  I can't attest to this being 100% binding because I have yet to die and see what happens. But one thing's for sure, I feel a whole lot better having something in place.	1
I actually have had this will maker for a few months. I wanted to play with it and see how it works. Right the start, getting it loaded onto my computer was simple. No large "updates" that is common with software. It's pretty simple to understand and walks you through each step and questions you if you skip something.  You can't go wrong using the Quicken Willmaker Plus 2012.  In addition you'll receive other forms, such as Power of Attorney, Final Arrangements to your survivors, forms for house-sitting, requests for birth/death certificates and many, many more forms.  Too much to list. You also get a book called The Legal Answer Book for Families. Have a legal question? It will answer them for you!  I wasn't too sure whether this was the software for me, but now I am sold. If you need a will or other legal forms, then I highly recommend the Quicken WIllMaker Plus 2012.	1
I used this to upgrade from an earlier version of this software and find it helpful to get my thoughts together before going to see my lawyer. Because of issues like step-kids, which weren't really explained very well, I can't say this is perfect, but it does help do simple things like living wills, etc.	1
In addition to writing many reviews on Amazon of entertainment products, I am also a CPA (and have reviewed some business books here). As such I have clients who come to me to prepare their taxes after they have used tax prep software, because the software asks questions in the interviews but sometimes overlooks their personal situation. Software is great for calculating and works well in simple situations. It's also (reasonably inexpensive).  Willmaking software and other legal software is similar. If you want to leave all your estate to one or two places, it's quick and simple. If you want to divide things based on certain "Circumstances" it isn't. BUT, if it gets you to at least make a will and - just as important - a Medical power of attorney, then it will serve its purpose. I've used both software (early versions of Will Maker when Nolo Press first started in the 1970s) and an attorney. Both had distinct advantages. I did find that if I spent the time with the software deciding what I thought I wanted in the Will and then gave the printed version to an attorney (knowledgeable in Estates) it cut down the attorney's fee as they didn't have to take the time to talk out my intentions. I had the best of both worlds.  This new version is user friendly and an improvement over past versions. And it is nice to have other legal forms included.  So, in my opinion, I would recommend it as a TOOL, but if you have even a moderately complicated estate, use it for the first pass and then consult an estate attorney.  I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.  Steve Ramm "Anything Phonographic"	1
Once again Quicken & NOLO put forth a superior product. Save some serious cash by doing certain legal documents on your own. Wills aren't all you can do; Power of attorney,Bill of sale, final arrangements, etc. And you don't need to be an attorney. Like "TurboTax, another intuit product, you just follow the wizard & voilla......your own legal document.	1
Quicken WillMaker Plus 2012 was easy to use right from the start.  It installed without a problem on my Windows 7 computer and took us through the steps of putting together a simple will.  If you've ever used tax software, you'll be reminded of it as you go through the steps in this program.  It takes a job that can seem overwhelming at first and walks you through the steps in an easy to understand manner.  And it has all the forms that you'll need.  There's even an introductory video to get you started and make the process less daunting. It included Health Care Directive, a living will and power of attorney, durable power of attorney for finances, final arrangement instructions, and information for your survivors and caregivers.  Our will was fairly simple and easy to do.  I imagine if you had a lot of complicated investments and such that you might need to upgrade to a more powerful program, or to consult with an attorney, but for our purposes this software probably saved in the neighborhood of $1000 as opposed to having an attorney handle it.  I think this is a great way to produce a will or if your situation is very complicated, at least a good way to start.	1
First, this is from the makers of Quicken, a software company that for years has turned out really nice products.  Second, this is paired up with Nolo,com, people that I've looked to for years to get legal advice.  Nothing will replace all lawyers and accountants, but if you have some straight forward will, power of attorney, final arrangements, or need info about caregivers and survivors, this looks to be a well written computer program.  I have it running Windows 7 (64bit) with no issues.  It's got the tax-software wizard type approach, interviewing you and asking questions, you answer them and at the end, it has created for your forms that can be printed and filed with those that need to have these.  This packaging came with a small book from Nolo.com, "The Legal Answer Book for Families" - and I skimmed that, and it talked about many many topics, well beyond wills and such, but not very deep into any one topic.  It's enough to get a general education, informed, but probably not enough to solve all your legal questions.  Still, it's in there, take a look at it.  Bottom line: about 25 years ago we paid a lawyer to create the will that we still have in place today.  Our will is not complicated.  This program will allow me to re-create that and bring it up to date, without any lawyer fees.  It's possible I will want a notary to stamp it as official, but I'll get to that point in the software and I'm sure they will tell me the pros and cons to doing that.  So, if you do your own taxes with either of the popular tax programs, then this program, Willmaker 2012, for less than fifty dollars makes this a good deal!	1
I really hope that it's a long, long, long time before I might really need the benefits that this product offers me (or my family), I know this is a vitally important task/area of life that I want to have well handled.  Just a little personal history.  Back in July 2009 my first wife was killed in a car wreck (not her fault, someone in a much bigger vehicle literaly ran over her vehicle as she tried to make a left turn across the road).  After that tragic accident I was inspired to do some estate planning of my own and I've been on a quest ever since to try to be as prepared as possible for my family's sake.  I snagged an earlier version of this product and went through the process of answering the interview type questions as to what I wanted for my family, who should handle what roles after my death, who should get specific bequeaths, etc.  A very simple and fairly painless process.  Really the worst of it was having to think through in advance who would need the most support and who should handle the important roles if you pass away.  A few short years later, just a few weeks ago, my youngest brother met his own end thanks to another tragic accident.  (Fell off a roof/ladder, into a large wooden object he was working on, fractured his skull.)  Thankfully, he was a man of deep faith, as was his wife and family, and given the fact that his last project was one of trying to put a steeple on a church, it's a safe assumption that he died doing something that he could truly feel good about.  Because of prior service (military and police) he had the foresight to have made up a will that his widow was able to use to handle his arrangements after his death, so even though it's been an emotionally trying time for her, she has had the comfort of her faith and the benefit of his good planning to help get her through it all with a roadmap he had made up well in advance.  Wills and estate planning aren't fun topics, at least not for most people, and yet they are vitally important things to do in life.  Quicken WillMaker Plus helps to make the process easier, which in turn helps to get users to GET IT DONE.  The software is very reasonably priced and for *most* potential users, it is really all they would need.  Even if you may have a more complex estate to deal with, by using WillMaker Plus you can get a good start on everything you should do and think of doing to handle your estate planning.  VERY highly recommended.	1
This installed flawlessly on my Windows 7 computer. After it ran an update I was good to go. I liked the video in the beginning. it outlined every section that will be covered and was a great overview. This program works just like TurboTax. The process is broken up into sections that check themselves off as you complete them and there are several help options throughout the process. I found myself perusing the index often. I was flying through this. Our needs are quite simple. We have no additional properties beyond our primary nor do we have any additional investments beyond typical 401K's and simple bonds. The worksheets available as a PDF were great.  The whole process was smooth and simple to do. Willmaker 2012 fills a need for an average person to get the process started and you may discover that you need additional consultation. We were surprised to see in a list form of what we own.  Obviously If you have great wealth and many properties and funds to deal with this would not be the way to go.  I received this product free of charge to try through the vine program. Would I spend my own money on this? Yes.	1
The idea behind this is fantastic, one product to protect all your stuff.  The execution, however, is not perfect.  Good: Was easy to install.  Easy to set parental controls. I really  like the Family Protection, which unlike the other one I used, can not simply be worked around by being uninstalled or using another browser. I also like the little green check that shows up next to URLs, especially tinyurls, this has made it much easier for me as I now can tell my kids that if it has a green check, they can go there.  I had banned them from tinyurls since they can hid bad stuff.  Tracking device is really neat, now I know who swiped my netbook!  Only one product to mess with rather than the multiple versions of stuff we have now. You can find a data sheet on the website with all the information about what you can do with each device (search Macafee All Acccess Datasheet) , for example you can mobile lock a smartphone or tablet but not a laptop.  You also cannot monitor IM on a tablet but you can on a laptop...  Bad: Does not play well with all of Apple.  I really wish it would, finding the missing Ipod or Ipad in the house alone would be worth it.  Unknown: No cd, just an install code.  Not sure what happened if you need to reinstall.  Annoying: Don't call yourself green because you did not print a manual and printed the code on recycled paper.  You put that little piece of paper in a box, then it goes in another box to be shipped when it could easily been provided via email.  After all, you are making us download it!  Suggestions: How about a locator for my keys too?  Like a fob I could attach?	1
I installed this on my Asus netbook, and my Android tablet running Froyo. Both less than 12 months old, and neither one used much on a regular basis.  The Netbook:  This software, during the installation process, tries to make you think it's found threats on your computer, when I know for a fact my netbook had nothing wrong with it.  It's a scare tactic to make you think you NEED McAfee (and no other brand) to make your PC-life better and stress-free.  I didn't care for this.  The installation was smooth and problem-free, but seemed to slow the Atom processor down just enough to be annoying.  I uninstalled it, and went back to Free AVAST. I also wish a CD would have been included but I can see where that would only be useful for PC's with a CD drive and that's not the market-share McAfee is seeking with this security suite.  The Tablet:  The one thing it did was cause my tablet to lock up. I didn't want to bother trying to figure out the cause so I restored the tablet back to the default. IMHO tablets don't need an anti-virus.	-1
Having owned a PC years and years ago, I remembered needing antivirus and anti-malware products, and when I scanned my PC, a million things always popped up. I installed this in a few short minutes, scanned my MacBook Pro (took a long time, as these things often do), and nothing came up. That made me think this whole process was a little unnecessary. Then I noticed my computer appeared to slow down when using the internet. I'm still not sure if I'm imagining it, but I can't help but wonder if I should un-install it after a few pages that used to work fine have been acting odd lately. Also, I noticed there doesn't appear to be an anti spyware or malware scan available. Maybe the comprehensive scan covers this? If so, I find it hard to believe I haven't picked up a single thing after almost 3 years with this Mac. Either way, it makes this product superfluous: either Macs really are quite resistant to this stuff, or this software isn't finding anything.  Perhaps this is better for other platforms and products, but if you have a Mac laptop of any kind, I can tell you I've gone without this sort of thing since 2005 without issues, and I can also say this only appears to be slowing down my Internet. Not a lot, but enough to make me wonder why I still have this installed. I'll keep it running and update, if needed. Thanks for reading!	-1
McAfee All Access for PC, Mac and Mobile 2012 is a program that you can download (after purchase) from the McAfree website without a disk.  Inside the box is a card with a code that allows you to download the software.  All Access allows you to not only protect your PC from virus and malware, but you can also protect your Mac and Mobile devices.  Now, you don't have to worry about viruses whether you either at home or on the go.  My only problem with this product was trying to download it initially.  I went around chasing my own tail for several minutes until I was able to find the software page.  But once you find it, its all smooth sailing.  So, if you're looking for virus protection for either you Mac, PC or mobile devices then look no further than McAfee All Access 2012.	1
I can't honestly say if this thing is protecting me from viruses - but I can say that after a week of use we began the wrestling to remove it from the computer.  The number of popup warnings and "update me again" and "pay for more protection" things was driving me insane.  Every time the little box wanted to pop up in the lower right hand corner, whatever I was doing or typing would freeze up, Then the stupid box would pop up, and there was never an option to just make it go away for good.  Now I'm sure I could wrestle with the settings but really - I can get AVG for free and not have to fight with something that wants to update itself in the middle of my typing a proposal.	-1
So far, so good with the McAfee All Access virus protection...  Installation was very simple on my PC.  You don't need a CD-ROM, just the code that comes with this product.  You simply go to the McAfee website and enter the code and you're ready to start downloading.  Installation should be easy on a phone or tablet, but it isn't that simple.  McAfee asks for an email address for the tablet or a phone number for the phone.  It then emails you a link with a code to install the software on a tablet or sends a text link to your phone.  The issue is that neither of these links work.  I kept getting errors when using the links provided by McAfee.  I was able to get around this problem by logging in to McAfee and then downloading the software to my Android tablet from there.  I wasn't able to install the software on my phone since the operating system (Meego) is not supported. However, I wasn't upset about this since the software doesn't claim to work with Meego.  On my Android tablet (running ICS), the protection software seems to run quietly.  I haven't noticed any hang ups due to the software.  On my PC, I get a fair number of warnings about ads on certain sites, which end up slowing down my computer.  So far, it hasn't been too frustrating and I feel more comfortable knowing that I have software protecting my computer.  I had been using Norton, but that expired.  McAfee seems to work about the same, with a plus being I could tell McAfee not to install the idiot parental controls.  Overall, I am satisfied with this software.  I am glad to have software for my tablet and knowing my PC is protected.	1
I have never had a great experience with Virus protection until now. The concept of this "All Access" product is fantastic. All machines are covered with whatever protection is required. Simple awesome! There is very little that is required in the way of the user's time, energy or expertise in computers or settings. The only time it slows down my machines is when it is engaged in a deep scan (which can be scheduled), otherwise, there have been no conflicts with other software (a first for me), components, systems, etc. I have been using it for several months now. It works and its easy. Finally!  Update 8.22.2012 From five stars to one!  My computer was infected with a very nasty Trojan banking virus while "protected" with Mcafee All Access. My banking information and sensitive identity information was completely compromised. When i was told that i may have a virus (by a bank of america website tech support person), I ran a complete deep scan with Mcafee and it was not able to locate or remove the virus. After much Internet research, the most recommended solution was to run microsofts free antivirus software (there are two different free products and I installed and ran both). The free microsoft antivirus found the Trojan and one other virus and removed them. A little more research comparing the Microsoft anti-virus and Mcafee all access revealed that this Mcafee product does not handle Trojans or malware!  Was this review helpful?	-1
Even though I have a remote CD drive I can connect to my Dell Mini netbook, it was nice not having to haul it out and hook it up. The box comes with instructions and an authorization code to get you to the McAfee website where you can download the latest version of the software. My main concerns were protecting a laptop and netbook running Windows 7, and for that application this is an ideal solution.  I found the packaging to be pretty effective, although there are times when we find ourselves needing to install anti-virus software as a remedial measure because a virus has already prevented us from accessing the web; if that's your situation, this package isn't for you. When you arrive at McAfee's website you register yourself - one user - and you can download the software on up to five devices, including PC, laptop, netbook, tablet or mobile. Total download and installation time, including download, took me approximately 20 minutes and was straightforward on both a laptop and a netbook running Windows OS.  McAfee recommends a high speed internet connection for this.  Having used other companies' protection software in the past, I come back to McAfee because I find them effective and unobtrusive.  A lot of what this does runs in the background, which is fine with me, I don't want to know it's there.  I switched from Norton years ago because my employer McAfee for their mobile workforce and I found I preferred the McAfee product.  This version of software comes with anti-virus, anti-spyware, anti-phishing, anti-spam, content filtering, firewall, and website safety ratings available for any and all devices being used PC, MAC, tablet or smartphone.  Additional features available for PC only include data encryption, home network defense, online back up, file shredder, instant message monitoring and program blocking.  Monitor Online Activities is available for PC and MAC. Available only for mobile devices and tablets are mobile device lock, remote wipe data from mobile device, back up and restore mobile data, locate and track mobile devices, and uninstall protection.  Supported OS include Windows XP SP3+ (32 bit), Windows Vista SP1 (32 / 64 bit), Windows 7 (32 / 64 bit), Mac OS X 10.5+, Google Android 2.1+ (smartphones and tablets), Mac iOS (iPhone software sold separately at the Apple App store), Blackberry 4.5, 4.6, 4.7, 5.0, 6.0, Symbian S60 3rd & 5th edition,  Supported browsers for anti-phishing include Internet Explorer 7.0+, Firefox 3.5+, Safari 3.0+ and Chrome 6.0+.  Required for anti-spam toolbar Windows Mail or Outlook Express 6.0+. Outlook XP+, Eudora 6.0+, Thunderbird 1.5+, McAfee anti-spam also supports other POP3 email clients (without SSL) and web accounts.	1
I get the chance to review a lot of security software suites thanks to the Amazon Vine program, and have my personal favorites, all of which are not McAfee branded software.  That being said, I was pleasantly surprised with this one.  INSTALLATION: It takes a long time.  Five installations for 1-user is how this software is set up.  This means that one user registers on McAfee's site and that license starts the minute you register, but you can use it to give comprehensive protection to up to 5 devices.  Those can include PC's, laptops, netbooks, tablets, and smartphones.  I installed this product on two laptops (both running Windows 7), my&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/LG-Optimus-Prepaid-Android-Phone-Virgin-Mobile/dp/B004LJ8N78/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">LG Optimus Prepaid Android Phone (Virgin Mobile)</a>&nbsp;smartphone, a desktop PC (running Windows 7) and a netbook (running Windows XP).  Tip:  It doesn't matter which device gets the first install, but it's probably easiest to do it on a PC or tablet first versus your phone.  You will find a Quick Start Guide in the McAfee All Access 2012 box.  There is an individual license card with simple instructions and a licensing code with the web address to go to to register and get started.  Then you are ready to download and install the software on each device.  Each device takes about 15-20 minutes (start to finish) depending upon how quickly you move through the steps, your processor speed on your device and your Internet connection speed.  You select what to install on each device, given options for mid-range PC's, high-end PC's, netbooks, tablets, phones, etc..., all of which is fairly clear once you register and are in 'My Account' on the McAfee site.  Tip: Be sure to uninstall any other antivirus software prior to installing McAfee.  During installation McAfee will search for it, but if you know it's there, doing it prior to installing McAfee saves you time.  No real glitches occurred on any of the devices, but installation went the smoothest on Windows 7 products.  PRODUCT PERFORMANCE: Much to my surprise, McAfee seems speedier than the Kaspersky, Trend Micro and AVG products I uninstalled.  Is it working as well?  Tough to say, but it's certainly feature rich and it's great to have one product cover all those devices!  Because it doesn't require a CD installation, it's great for netbooks and tablets.  The ability to have the software lock a tablet or smartphone is great.  The ability to remotely locate and track, and/or wipe data off those devices should they become stolen is superb!  I also like the ability to use Parental Controls to block programs, monitor instant messaging and other online activities for PC's and laptops.  Data encryption, home networking defense, and a file shredder for PC laptops, desktops and netbooks is a nice feature, but they could have beefed up the online back-up storage.  It's very small at only 2GB.  The product states it's for MAC too, but I can't speak to that as I don't own a MAC.  It does state on the box that software for the iPhone is sold separately, and MAC OS X 10.5 or higher is supported.  Supported browsers for anti-phising protection include: Chrome, Safari (3.0 or later), Firefox (3.5 or later), and Internet Explorer (7.0 or later).  You also get a 30-Day MONEY BACK GUARANTEE with this product. "If you're not 100% Satisfied you will receive a full refund" according to the info on the box.  CONCLUSION: It's good protection for PC's running Windows 7 or XP (32-bit or 64-bit) , and for tablets and smartphones running Android 2.1 or higher.  It may or may not be good for MAC users (see other reviewers who have MACS for their impressions of this product).  It offers many security features for 5 different devices with one license - 1 year of protection for all devices on one user's account.  Easy to install, but it takes awhile to get it done.  Seems to be heavy on features without bogging down device's systems.  Directions on how to use each feature are not as good as they should be, and certainly not for the novice user.  By clicking 'Navigation' in the upper right hand corner of the McAfee All Access program, you will find Features, Settings, Logs and McAfee Resources to help you.  The ability to go to one place online and manage 5 devices is a great draw, and for most users - those with Windows PC's and Android devices, I'd recommend it.	1
I have had Mcafee installed on my computer for a month now, and what I like best is that I don't notice it is there - it doesn't slow my machine down, does its job to protect it (no viruses, malware) and doesn't intrude on my PC experience.	1
No complaints here. I'm new to Mac, and yet I don't believe all the lies from Apple about their being no virii for their OS (I guess they've never heard of DEFCON or something). It installed nice. The GUI was a little bit confusing, but thats because I don't have a RMB and kept clicking on the right side. Wasnt a terribly large install, but seems to "wait" a few seconds before doing anything.	1
It has a lot of conflicts with Apple products to the point that I had to uninstall it. Then I installed it in my Android and it works OK. I am not satisfied because Kaspersky offers a FREE anti-virus (through the Android Market) that does exactly the same as McAfee All Access.	-1
You put the call-in line of your local rock station on speed dial on your office phone, cell, and your vacationing cube-mate.  Every time you hear the magic tone, you jump and try, try to be the 95th caller.  Finally, it happens-and you have an "All Access" pass to see Springstein!  You arrive at the concert, and find out that "All Access" means third row, far, far right, obstructed view...no jamming with the Boss tonight!  That's how you'll feel if you buy McAfee's All Access protection.  All Access, except for iPads, Macs, and all but one of your computers (most virus programs are licensed for three computers).  Incidentally the program works fine, although (like other McAfee products) there is too much in the way of pop-ups reminding me that the virus definitions have been updated.  I give it two stars because of the high pricing and that the "All Access" is basically an empty phrase.	-1
This is an awful product.  When I needed it most, it failed me.  It would not resize automatically the hard drive as the one that I put in to replace the one that busted, was larger.  It would not work.  Problem after problem after problem.  The only way I could get a restore done was through windows.  And then... my machine would drop off of the domain.  Anyone who has a domain knows that when you "join" a domain, Windows resets your profiles... and it takes as much time to set everything back up as it would to just reinstall windows and everything else from scratch.  Acronis support, though, didn't seem to understand this until 4 or 5 emails into the email request for support.  You know, I really love the boot disk that Acronis makes.  I really love that it's easy to use.  But I hate that it's one issue after another and tech support is just not that great.  What I hate most though... is that this software failed me when I needed it most.  It was eventually recommended I use Acronis Workstation... and so we gave that a shot too only because my workstation is technically connected to a domain (even though it's just my own server) but even that did not work well at all.  I really gave Acronis a lot of grief and I do commend them... they maintained their customer service the entire time, over multiple months of trying to work things out.  I would not touch Acronis 2012 with a 10 foot pole!  That is just my opinion though.	-1
UPDATE, 7/19/2012:  see the comments to this review from Acronis.  They claim the latest update to their installer was July 12, the day after my review below.  Well, they just sent me that latest installer, and it failed just as described below.  So a company which doesn't test its own installer, is not a company which pays close enough attention to the all-important issue of backups.  I won't do business with them.  Three times, same failure: with the initial CD bought here at Amazon, with the installer at Acronis on July 11 2012, and the one they just sent me today, allegedly dated from July 12, 2012.  Someone isn't paying attention to quality control.  Not good.  Important:  when you have a program like Norton GoBack, you can scroll back your drive to an earlier time.  You also get to see all the computer activity.  So this program never registered with Windows, and never installed icons on the hard drive before rebooting.  So it is not an OS or permissions problem -- I am the sole user of my machines and of course have full privileges -- but instead the programmer didn't write the program correctly.  And no one tested the installer prior to putting it on the internet for download.  Shouldn't have to require a customer like me complaining, for the correction to be made.  It should have been TESTED prior to release.  Again, not good.  UPDATE, 8/2/12 -- Acronis kept trying to blame Norton GoBack for the installation problem, again wanting to remotely connect to my computer.  This, despite the fact that I told them REPEATEDLY that I'd UNINSTALLED Acronis, a process which took 90 minutes, since only via Norton GoBack, could I uninstall it.  Now, here's the rub: GoBack records all computer activity.  So prior to rolling back the computer to uninstall Acronis, I VIEWED the activity of the installation.  Every file copied to temp files, then to the final directory, etc.  It never went through the function of REGISTERING with Windows.  It just rebooted the computer PRIOR TO registration, and of course didn't install any icons for Start Menu or desktop, nor offer the user the option to install icons.  All that activity and lack of activity, was IN the GoBack log.  So I KNOW what's wrong, and told Acronis.  Repeatedly.  They still kept writing me, until I finally refused to talk to them anymore about it.  So this kind of response, tells you much:  avoid Acronis.  Their Customer Service including two supervisors, don't even know computer basics.  So if your experience with Acronis has been good, fine.  Hope it stays that way.  My experience above and below, demonstrates a company which doesn't know its own programming.  So what is a good backup and OS/disc recovery program?  Macrium Reflect 5.  Works like a charm.  Just learned of it on cnet, and installed it, July 10, 2012.  Below, between the === 's, is the original review of Acronis.  ================= original review of July 11, 2012 ==============  I made the mistake of buying this product some months back without using it, so of course now I can't get my money back.  WARNING: if you do as I did, you'll get a message on install telling you there is a later version, and recommending you select it.  DON'T DO THAT.  The later version depends on the program already being installed on your machine.  So it will seemingly install -- meaning copy files -- but will NOT register with Windows, and will NOT log itself into your Start Menu (on XP Pro, here), and will NOT create launch icons.  Adding insult to injury, this software has the longest product key I've ever typed, 71 characters.  Truly a pain to install.  So, if you're lucky to have GoBack as I am, you spend the next hour after the first half-hour's installation, uninstalling the program that way.  Since it didn't register itself in Windows, you can't uninstall it from Windows.  If you go to its Program files section and you click on its uninstall.exe, that program tells you Acronis is not on the system -- though it's IN the Acronis file under Program Files!  Okay, so if you instead install from the CD after rolling back your machine to before the 'later version' suggested as installation instead -- thus installing the earlier CD version -- what happens?  THE SAME THING.  So again you need a restoration program like Norton GoBack, to roll back your machine to pre-installation, else you can't uninstall a program which itself, doesn't know it is installed.  So you waste another 90 minutes.  Now, given the nature of this program, which claims to protect your files and computer, to copy sectors and partitions -- such a defective installation does not bode well for the competence of the program itself.  It claims to be able to do great things, yet can't even do a simple installation, or detect its own presence in a file folder?  Look: mistakes happen.  Programmer typos have big results and are hard to detect.  No problem.  But a massive oversight like this implies a systemic problem with the software.  Given owner complaints in the Acronis forum (at least they have one), it seems as though the systemic problem isn't getting the attention it needs.  These are life-or-death programs.  They need more professional service.  And, they should charge more.  Here, you waste $20 and three or four hours' time (so it ends up costing you $420, because anyone's time these days is worth $100 per hour).  My guess is that the url for registration is not included in the installer, or is defective, so it just aborted the install without telling you that's what happened.  So you think it finished installation, since it says it successfully installed, even when you ABORT the installation, lol.  So I'm sending this review link to Acronis, hoping they will respond and this can be fixed.  =============================  So don't make my mistake, and buy this program.  Closest thing to Norton GoBack (no longer sold, not good for Win7), is MagiCure  -- which can only be installed on Windows-alone systems, has an 8GB NTFS limit for storage, which translates into a one-day rollback. For a good DISK CLONING and backup program, get Macrium Reflect 5 Pro.  PS: Disk cloning of your root drive, is the only way to get back into operation 15 minutes after Windows crashes or your registry dies.  Basically, you CLONE your root drive to an external drive of the same size, and Macrium literally replaces the entire destination drive byte-for-byte, so it's an exact duplicate of your root drive.  If your target drive is SMALLER than your root drive, but the USED space is smaller than your target drive, the clone still works.  Macrium's disc cloning is swift, easy to use, and works well; but it is not automated.  I do it 1x per week, while watching TV; with automated disc-image backups on the other days.  Cloning 35-70GB takes an hour.	-1
If a review is totally positive, reads like advertising copy, and the reviewer has no other Amazon reviews, it is likely that it is a fake review, written by an employee of the company or one of his friends.  I wanted to clone my old hard drive to my new, larger hard drive.  I downloaded the free version of True Image, found that it didn't do clones, and went to Amazon to buy the full version.  When I saw the many negative reviews and many fake positive reviews I uninstalled it, using the secret uninstaller referenced in one of the reviews.  Then I tried to clone with Clonezilla, Easeusa, and Roadkil rawcopy.  I was unsuccessful with all of them.  I considered Macrium but it is more expensive and isn't sold on Amazon so the sample size of users was small.  The average rating for Norton Ghost and True Image 2009 wasn't any better than for this program, although there weren't so many fake reviews.  Out of desperation I ended up ordering this.  I installed it, created a boot diskette which both boots and contains the entire True Image program, and turned off the laptop.  Then I put the old hard drive in a USB enclosure, the new hard drive in the laptop, and booted from the boot CD.  I followed directions for a manual clone, expanding my C partition as much as possible and minimizing the sizes of my D partition and some other partition.  The program initially suggests proportional cloning.  When you change the size of a partition to smaller than what is suggested, that space becomes unallocated.  It does not become available to the partition that you want to maximize the size of.  The clone operation for an 80 GB old drive to a 325 GB new hard drive finished in about half an hour and I proceeded to boot up the computer.  I then ejected the boot CD and turned the system off.  Then I disconnected the USB drive and rebooted.  The system works and the C partition is much bigger, although 80 GB of unallocated space is missing.  My next step will be to use a partition program to try to add that to the C partition.  I will also try to delete the backup partition since I don't use it.  I do not plan to use this program for backups.  My data is backed up daily on-line and if my hard drive crashes I will just have to reinstall my programs.  In summary, this is a 5 star rating for cloning only, from a boot disc only.  I know nothing about the other capabilities of the program and don't plan to find out.  The operation was done on a 2006 Dell Inspiron E1505 Media Center edition Windows XP SP3.	1
Let's face it, one doesn't need backup software to chew up memory cycles or processor.  One only needs it to restore from a critical situation with their computer.  I "lost" my SSD system disk and found that I had to restore a backup off of a NAS server to recover.  After a full day of "working with Acronis", I just gave up.  I actually went back to a Windows backup and a recovery disk to restore the OS, programs, etc. which save what would have been another day of recovery steps.  Only then, could I restore some incremental backups from Acronis to get my data files.  This product is very, VERY unstable in a Win 7/64 bit environment.  Even the backups will not operate on occasion.  Try them another day and they seem to work.  I wish I saved my old versions of Acronis so I could back to them.  Acronis should pull this from the home user market and try all over again, with a DESIGN that works.  I find I worry about it each time the backus run - "Will this one be recoverable if I need it".  Backup and Restore should be reliable, not questionable and erratic.  Acronis should really consider pulling this version from the market, before their reputation gets compromised more.	-1
This program should be banned. It often creates more problems than it is supposed to fix. It will make changes to your computer that will make it unuseable and you will need to be an expert to fix them. I have given up on Acronis, they have no tech support, at least none that answers questions. I suspect they know their software is buggy and not very good so they ignore those users with problems.  I need to make images of my main drive so I was going to try Acronis one more time to make a clone image (exact copy). Now it cannot even find any hard drives on my computer and it has 3! I reinstalled the program and still doesn't work. I tried uninstalling it and cannot even do that! Absolutely no answers from Acronis either. You would be better off throwing your computer out the window before using anything from Acronis.  It is interesting that after I posted this review, there was a reply supposedly from Acronis Customer Support. I believe the response is not really from Acronis. Why? Because I made repeated efforts to contact Acronis in different ways and the only response I ever received was about a month later asking if the support ticket could be closed!  There is so much better software out there and some is free! Try EASEUS backup software, I have used it repeatedly to clone drives and partitions and have never had a problem.	-1
Good purchase	1
I now wish I simply went with Boot Camp.  This product has some issues and one constantly gets urgent notifications to pay up for a download of a more recent release.	-1
I installed Parallels 7 on a Mac Mini using an ISO file on our business network.  This is the third install I have done of P7 (the others were at home using a Win 7 DVD).  With this latest install, I was getting a key error in an unattended answer file,  finally fixed this by deleting the floppy drive from the list of boot options during the install.  You have to check the "configure paralles now" checkbox during the first couple of screens of the install.  Once P7 is installed, it is a pleasure to use.  Windows applications can work along side Mac apps, or you can have a full scrree. widows desktop accessible with your Mac swipe.  Program run fast, although the Mi I'd fan will really crank if I'm using Windows heavily.  Printing through the Mac is seamless, network drives are all there, and I can share files between the two systems.  I have not come across any bugs yet. Very stable performance.	1
I have been a Parallels user for years.  Initially I bought it as I needed to run Quicken for Windows as the Mac version of Quicken was , and still is, so poorly designed.  Since then I have chosen to add other PC programs that are not available for Mac's. I am pleased with the performance understanding that I am asking my computer to support 2 operating systems running at the same time.  I have a Macbook Pro and 8 Meg of RAM	1
running on an iMAC i7 - when running windows programs in VM, the speed is indiscernible from when the same software is run on a win PC. Resource intense so the smaller the memory or processor speed, the less speed you will see.	1
I have one little program that I need to run, one day a month, each month every year. I have messed around with Bootcamp and every time I try to load windows I feel like strangling my kat. Sorry Santa "Claws".  But Parallels Desktop 7 for Mac, is wonderful. Not only does it work, but the instructions are easy, the loading is easy and not having to reboot from Snow Leopard into windows is a dream. And I never use that word to describe software. Just click on the windows program you want, windows loads and runs the program. And when you done windows shuts down and as far as I can tell, there is no memory or cpu cycles wasted once windows logged off. I have not found any problems with this way of using windows, all my Mac hardware is compatible.  What a perfect solution to the Bootcamp grief.	1
Works good but Quicken retires their software too quickly and forces you to buy newer products.	1
Love the Quicken products.  Wish they would do a decent one for iMac.	1
Used	1
I am a quicken fan and this upgrade was a nice update.  It has since been replaced with a newer one.	1
This was my first time using Quicken. I mainly use it to track spending in my checking account, as well as my retirement accounts. It does have the capability for tracking investments, mortgages, etc., but I was mainly looking for a way to track my spending.  It was easy to install and for the most part, is intuitive to use. I use a password to update my accounts which only takes about a minute or so to do. Initial imports required a lot of manual categorizing, but Quicken adjusts to how you want things categorized and all following imports required little manipulation. Of course, sometimes I have to go back and re-categorize transactions, but it doesn't take up too much time.  To me, the spending reports are invaluable. I can see exactly where my money goes - last month, last 3 months, etc. It's a great way to start some budget planning and beats tracking expenses manually. Like I said, there is a slew of other capabilities, but for me, even using it for my limited purpose is worth while.	1
Every year Intuit makes me more angry.  Every upgrade Intuit makes me more angry.  This takes the cake:  Quicken 2012 actually has popup ads that must be clicked to close so I can continue!  This is unacceptable for financial software I paid for.  I put up with the crap Intuit always installs on my desktop.  But this is too far.	-1
I've been involved with a couple of businesses using QuickBooks, one on Windows for many years, one on Mac for about 4 years. We upgraded the Mac users to QuickBooks for Mac 2012.  The good news: QuickBooks for Mac 2012 is a substantial upgrade, with great new features like incremental project invoicing, project timesheets that autofill like checks do, and cool new customer summaries for when you have a lot of projects and invoices with one customer. These are the types of enhancements expected from a mature product.  The other news: The Mac users, including one who moved from an earlier version of QuickBooks for Windows, are starting to get jealous of features available in the Windows version. Although this is not a review of Quicken for Mac, I've been unhappy about how Intuit has effectively dropped the ball with that product. So we're asking ourselves, will Intuit continue to enhance QuickBooks for Mac?  In the end, the enhancements in this version made us feel pretty good about it. It almost seems like Quicken designed the ones I mentioned above specifically for us. We want more, but we're already more productive.  Buy it, use it, there's nothing better on the Mac. But let's hope Intuit adds even more enhancements to the next version. And if they cut some of the annoying in-product ads, that would be great too.	1
I thought Quicken 2011 was great, and they didn't change much. So 2012 is also great, if your a new user buy it. If you're using 2011 I don't think it's worth the upgrade.	1
Well, I hate to be a rare one of the bunch.  It was time to finally seriously use, on a regular basis from the beginning of the year bookkeeping software.  QuickBooks was a tremendous opportunity.  I love that Intuit has kept up the Mac development.  This 2012 software feels fresh and update to date.  I love having the powerful suite right on my Mac, ready to go.  I jumped right in and began using it for invoice creation, tracking sales, etc.  Wow.  It's fun to see all those numbers come up rather than sit there with the calculator and paper ledger.  I really love the gorgeous graphs that you can create from reports.  "See," your performance.  It has an impact.  Overall, if you need business bookkeeping software for your Mac, what else would you choose?  QuickBooks 2012 seems to be the answer despite some issues that others are so willing to explain in detail.	1
Intuit is far from one of my favorite companies. I've written extensively about the issues with their&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/QuickBooks-Premier-Nonprofit/dp/B005FIWU28/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">QuickBooks Premier Nonprofit</a>&nbsp;software which STILL cannot print meaningful donor letters (pretty much an essential function of every non-profit that I know of). Intuit seems to follow a 90/10 principle with 90% of their budget going to graphic designers endlessly rehashing the aesthetics of the software and 10% for making meaningful improvements.  Another major complaint I have with Intuit is that they leverage ads into their software. Quicken will encourage you to bank with Chase, open mortgages through QuickenLoans, etc. I pay full price for software so that I DON'T HAVE TO LOOK AT ADS. Intuit force feeds them to you. Simply unacceptable in my opinion when paying full price for a piece of software.  If you are coming to Quicken fresh, don't hesitate to purchase a copy. It is a viable financial management software that despite its quirks and frustrations, largely does a find job of managing MOST people's money. If you've already got a copy of Quicken that you're happy with KEEP IT. Upgrade only when absolutely necessary (when the ability to automatically download transactions from your bank expires).  The bottom line is that every year Quicken messes about with the layout of the GUI (Graphic User Interface). Some changes you may like, others you may not. I've found they do about much harm as good. They have done a few things to make the software a bit more user friendly and customizable, but there are still glaring gaps that haven't been addressed for many years. If you check the Intuit user forums you can see what I'm talking about.  A few examples:  1) Quicken cannot track 401k loans, even if you have direct update set up with your brokerage. It creates a constant cash balance issue that is impossible to sort out.  2) Mortgage balance tracking is cumbersome at best.  3) Partial ownership of assets is virtually impossible (for example if you are part owner of a rental property and want to track your cost basis--you must manually adjust everything to your ownership percentage and then enter it)  Admittedly these examples will not apply to most users. However, when product as the word PREMIER in it's title, and costs nearly a hundred bucks, I think it's fair to expect it to have accommodate sophisticated financial situations.  Another issue I have with Quicken is that it REGULARLY crashes after completing a one-step update. I have to go into task manager and manually kill the QB.exe program and then restart to get things working again. The error report that QBs generates is meaningless, and no one at Intuit is capable of diagnosing it. They blame the error on my computer (laughable considering I run a host of other far more demanding programs flawlessly) and suggest re-installing, something I've tried multiple times with no success. Their customer support is terrible. Be prepared to be told it is your computer at issue or run in circles through their e-maul support. As a person with a high level of tech experience, I can tell you these guys really are clueless.  In summary:  Skip this purchase unless you don't already own a financial management software. If you have a copy of Quicken that works for you, SKIP THE UPGRADE until you absolutely must. Understand that the software is buggy, and that support is useless. Also understand that the software comes with a healthy dose of ads.	-1
I owned Q2008, Q2005 & Q2002 and I used them daily. during that decade, I observed no significant product improvements, just a huge increase in software bugs.  Look up the Q2010 and/or Q2008 products, where I posted detailed logs/diaries of the endless bugs, errors and frustrations I endured as a Quicken user.  In August, 2010, I finally migrated to the Moneydance product and--after the migration and learning curve issues--I find it swims slick as an eel. I wish I'd done it years sooner.  Since at least 2002, Intuit has been using Quicken as a pure 'cash cow' - a product to milk revenue out of, but making no investment in it - while it continues to toy around with other new product developments toward future revenue streams ... ... Quicken Loans, Quicken Credit Cards, etc.  The history of the Quicken product doesn't suggest a bright future for Quicken users. Don't get suckered into starting up with Quicken. Go with Moneydance.	-1
I am a long time Quicken user. I heavily rely on the budget feature. I was happy with the 2010 version but know Intuit forced an update every three years. After reading through dozens of these reviews I bought the 2011 version.  Quicken now has three years to fix this mess . After that if the budgeting isn't fixed and Imtuit won't download institution data I guess I'll stick with 2011 and manually enter quotes and other data.	-1
This version of Quicken has several Fatal Flaws - avoid at all costs.  The budget randomly adds or subtracts monthly totals - the yearly totals are usually completely wrong. Therefore the budget is not only wrong, but DANGEROUS to USE.  The reports also randomly add or subtract monthly totals. Again, reports are incorrect and useless.  Assuming you even try to use the budget, the new software will lock you out from past months. There is no way to update or correct January's budget in February for example.  The people at Intuit are either so incompetent they cannot program and did not test their software before release, or they have criminal intent.  AVOID AVOID AVOID	-1
I had heard stories that the Mac version would be difficult but that's not the case. Worked well even for a Quick Books Level 1 operator.  Although it comes with some risk I am looking at migrating my personal accounting from the company computer to my Mac.	1
I've been using Quicken for over 10yrs. While I haven't fully used 2012, it still is very impressive but not much different than 2011.	1
Very good, seems to take slightly less resources than 2011. Nothing major changed that I have discovered in 2 weeks of use.	1
I have been a Quicken user for at least 20 years and I use it daily to enter each and every expense or bank transaction.  I would feel lost without Quicken.  I use it mainly to know how much money I have in the bank, how much my charges are on my credit cards and to know when upcoming bills are arriving.  I have used the budget feature, but I prefer to use it as a tool to control elective expenses and for historical purposes. I like to know where the money went. And the money does get spent ever so quickly.  And without some means of knowing and understanding where the money gets spent, you will not be able to feel like you know where your life's savings went - or lack of savings.  I have used Quicken extensively for stock and investment transactions including brokerage fees and other expenses.  And this has been one area where I have not been confident Quicken does an accurate job. I have found that you cannot trust Quicken for stock transaction accuracy.  Always trust your brokerage company first and not Quicken.  I have been using different versions of Quicken for years and I have to say that the new versions have little new to offer. The upgrades and new annual editions are mainly cosmetic or may have some new tax features.  But I use Turbo Tax for that purpose.  I have been using the 2010 version of Quicken since it first became available. And I can see very little difference between the 2012 version and the 2010 version - cosmetic at most. I'm sure there are some new features, but I doubt that I will ever use them. So far I haven't discovered anything new worth mentioning.  But if you don't have Quicken already, I am a strong believer in home financial management to build your future retirement account and to determine if you are on track. I am currently technically recently retired, but now that I don't have an income, I think Quicken is more essential than ever.  I must make my savings last the rest of my life, however long that may be.  And even though I am alone now, it seems the monthy expenses are still high - much too high to sustain. So now that yet another year has passed, I need to analyze where the money went and what to do to dramatically lower expenses next year. And without disciplined daily financial recording into specific categories, there is no way to know where to start unless you are able to review history  - accurate history.  So I strongly recommend Quicken as a household financial management tool.	1
I have been using Quicken for ten-plus years and have seen it slowing decline in quality and customer service over that time, but with no viable choice out there, I keep purchasing the forced upgrades every few years as Intuit requires (for those who don't already know--Intuit puts a kill bit in your software so that after three years many of the features stop working, so you have to buy a new version).  The best thing I can say about Quicken 2012 is that it is not much worse than Quicken 2011.  In fact, there is little apparent difference at all in terms of functionality, other than two annoyances:  1. If you leave Quicken running overnight, as soon as you focus on the Quicken window the next day, it announces that it needs to restart itself and immediately does so (whether you like it or not).  It has apparently lost its ability to refresh various dates while the application is running.  2. It is even slower than 2011.  All in all, you get no noticable new features and two annoyances, so I don't know why anyone using Quicken 2011 should bother upgrading.  Ah--one improvement:  Intuit has reduced the unwanted icons it drops on your desktop advertising its various services and partners from dozens to only one!	-1
Quicken (and its Quickbooks sibling) are the packages that pretty much single-handedly eliminated the accounting application software business for small to medium sized businesses, and brought easy management of financials into the realm of the personal computer.  If you're not a Quicken user then this is a great place to start.  If you are a quicken user, then as others have said this version is incremental rather than revolutionary, and sometimes it feels like the furniture is just being re-arranged to make it feel like a new house even though there's not really that much that's new.  Quicken makes it easy to do all those record keeping, tax planning, budgeting, and other tasks that you know you need to do, and you keep telling yourself you're going to get around to. It pretty much takes your hand and leads you thought the process, even if you don't know anything about accounting.  G.	1
QB is a good product, just that the connotation of "Quickbooks" goes along with "windows version" when hear the product name.  I would skip the Mac version and instead go with a Windows version.  This isn't hard to do these days with Windows systems or an emulator easily being affordable.  This Mac version simply is not at the same level.  It's at least several generations behind the cheapest Windows version, and debatable perhaps being a decade or more behind in features overall. The other issue is that if you're not already familiar with QB's and want training, all the training will be for Windows versions.  You'll get funny puzzled looks if you even mention a Mac version to a QB trainer.  In this 2012 version, they only improved very little over the 2011 version (see my old review) and frankly I'm surprised the 2012 version wasn't just released for free for 2011 owners (it isn't) since it's such a small 'enhancement'.	-1
I used to use Quickbooks for several years in my small  business, then switched to Peachtree when Quickbooks began to start throwing in all kinds of unnecessary software and bloating out their product, and then switched back to Quickbooks with the 2011 release, which I found much more manageable and efficient. I upgraded to 2012 last month, and have been using it daily to evaluate it against the previous year's release.  Since I am familiar with the Quickbooks software, I tried out some of the new features first.  I have several different accounts in my file, and 2012 includes the option to assign different accounts different functions.  I have found this extremely useful for integrating aspects of my personal account with my business account, and I think it will make things easier at tax time as well.  If you have multiple accounts, I think you will definitely enjoy this feature. Unfortunately, that is the only new feature I really could see a use for.  I found the others appeared to be thrown in for the sole purpose of being able to release a new version.  It seems like all companies are doing that now, and just trying to add in more and more bloat to force users to upgrade. I can pretty much guarantee you there will be a Quickbooks 2013, 2014, 2015, etc.  Why not just wait until you have something substantial to add before developing an upgrade?  Intuit briefly got away from this several years ago and now it seems like they're back.  The main problem I had with Quickbooks For Mac 2012 is the difference between it and the 2011 version that I previously used for Windows.  I expected the 2012 Mac version to be a mirror image of the Windows version, however there are noticeable differences and features missing. The most important to me, is that my financial institution for my personal accounts does not support it. While this would seemingly be a problem on behalf of the financial institution, when I compared the lists of support for the two systems, I noticed it is fairly significant.  Why not have an option for converting the file formats like my genealogy software has?  If there is such a thing, I could not find it anywhere.  The second thing I noticed is that several of the reports I frequently used in 2011 for Windows are completely missing in the Mac version.  I realize that there are many more X86 systems than Mac, but the lack of some of these features make Quickbooks for Mac 2012 seem more like an afterthought than a quality piece of software.  While I do feel that 2012 is a worthy buy if you are using Quickbooks 2010 and prior, I don't feel it is significant enough to warrant an upgrade, and I definitely won't be replacing my Windows version with the Mac release.	1
Anybody who uses Quickbooks knows that if you want to continue using features, you are forced to upgrade after 3 or 4 years.  What's more, the software is full of spam because many features you'd expect in an accounting program that costs nearly $200, are not included and are extra.  This includes the lack of a payroll - even do it yourself will cost you about $150 a year in addition to what you pay.  In short, Intuit has no shame. Avoid if you can. Once you're linked in, there is not an easy way to get out.	-1
One of the best things about QuickBooks is the fact that you don't have to be an accountant to successfully use and navigate the program. There is a GuideMe feature that will walk you through the setup so you'll feel more confident when you set up your small business account. I had a friend who had more than one of those grrrrr moments with QuickBooks 2010, so for the neophyte to the program this is a real plus. If you've been working with the program for years it will be of no consequence. If you are satisfied with the last couple of QuickBooks versions, I wouldn't recommend upgrading, but otherwise you might want to consider the 2012.  Two other things, in addition to the actual content, sold me on the viability of the program. One was the access to instant online assistance. I wanted to check out a question I had and when I went to the QuickBooks site there was instant access to a tech. The program is easy to use, but if you do have more complicated FAQs, you can get up to an hour's worth of time with a QuickBooks expert during your first month of use (888-222-7276) . These aspects are perfect for the "beginner." You may also wish to take a look at QuickBooks Pro 2012 to see which program best fits your needs.  I wouldn't say this program is perfect, but there are several new features that are helpful to the average QuickBooks user.  * The calendar feature. You can see invoices that are due on any particular day and and information that was entered. For example, you can see what needs to be done or what has to be done including emails, faxes, and appointments. You can select what you want to see from a drop-down menu from one thing to all transaction. These are details in a panel below the calendar.  * The document center. It's now much easier to attach documents than in the last version of QuickBooks and at no cost (it came out in 2010). You can add a document from your computer, scan one, or drag one in. For example you can drag in a picture copy of a check to go with your invoice. These do need a separate backup that is not provided.  * The Lead Center (under customers in the drop-down menu). You can add your lead information (lead name, status, company name, main phone). You can add many things such as Facebook, Twitter, Skype, phone numbers, etc. When you want to contact them you can put them in your calendar. There is also a place you can make notes on the lead. If they become a customer, you can just click in the corner and the information will go into your customer base. You can also import your other leads.  * Batch Timesheet Entry Function. Timetracking must be enabled, time data needs to be turned on for all employees you want included, and you need to use the Weekly Timesheet Function. This function is a bit tricky because of the prerequisites and necessary similarities in pay. For example, the employees need to be working on the same job and be putting in the same number of hours. There are online tutorials that are very helpful when you wish to implement this extremely useful feature.  * A list of memorized transactions. There is a detailed list of what you may or many not choose to be entered into your program. You can choose when you want to enter them.  * To Do List. These can be arranged by type (calling, faxing, emailing, appointment). They can also be prioritized and there is a notes section to use.  * The ability to export reports to Excel so that they can be formatted is a very nice feature. You can update an existing spreadsheet. The information can be pull from QuickBooks into Excel.  * Wildcard Search. When you go into the customer center you can narrow down and select certain customers. For example, if you want to find a list of active customers, but don't know a particular name you can do a keyword search. If you know the customer's name is Joe just enter it in and his information will come up. You don't even need an exact match to get a hit.  Like anything, it depends on what you are looking for and the reason you need it. If you want a place where you can centrally organize your records and have them ready come tax time this is probably a program that will do just that. If you want online billpay included, don't bother because it isn't here. I love many of the new features and so do many of my friends. If you have a small business, I think you might wish to add this one to your list. The learning curve is not steep, the program is fun to play around with, and there are many online tutorials in addition to the expert help from QuickBooks. If what you need is in the program, I'd highly recommend it.	1
As someone who has used quickbooks on PC for a while, I agree with the other reviews that its still a lot better for the PC for said reasons already stated.  For new users who run side businesses (like bloggers, etsy sellers, etc).  Quickbooks is a pretty robust program that can help out in many of your accounting duties.  The product description pretty much covers all the relevant features.  My experience is that the program is a bit hard to use for those who haven't adopted many software applications outside of the Microsoft Office apps, but relatively easy for those used to learning new applications.	1
I'm one of those folks who has used QuickBooks on PC for a dozen years or so. Yes, as you can read in other reviews here, this new Mac version can't touch the PC version on a feature-for-feature basis. The PC version is so much more mature, has so many more options and value-added services (not to mention complete payroll management, if you need that), whereas the Mac version is just coming out of the starting gate.  BUT, if you're running a Mac and don't want to bother with a PC, or with running Windows on your Mac just to run QuickBooks, and if you don't need to manage payroll or use some of the other advanced features, then you can feel comfortable with buying QuickBooks as an entry-level solution for a small business. Really, it's not that bad! It's just simple, and contains only a small subset of the features you get on the Windows version.  You can set up income and expense accounts, you can set up invoices and sales receipts, you can track your various bank and credit accounts, and much more. The Amazon product description gives you lots of detail, as does the Intuit website for QuickBooks, so I'm not going to repeat all the features here.  Bottom line: yes, Mac users can do simple accounting for small business with this version, and it's not as full-featured as the Windows version. Let's hope Intuit takes this software seriously, realizes more and more small business owners are using Macs (they must realize it or they wouldn't have backed out of their non-Mac mindset after all these years), and then adds more of the features that make this software a mainstay of small businesses who like running Windows PCs.	1
I've used different copies of Quicken in the past.  Premiere 2004 and 2007 and Starter 2010.  So I am fairly experienced with Quicken and have always enjoyed their software.  Premiere 2012 delivers and I love the ease of use, even more easy that the previous 2007 that I had (although I haven't used it for quite a long time).  I love the ease of getting a look at all my credit cards, bank accounts and investment account at a glance, knowing right away where I stand financially.  Additionally it is extremely easy to see where you are spending all your money and where you can save by minimizing your spending in that problem area (alas, mine are books and games.  I really need to reduce this area).  I haven't used the Bills or Planning yet, and probably won't as I don't really use this for those purposes.  Also, I've seen a lot of reviewers complaining about ads and the fact that the software is only good for 3 years before Intuit shuts that version off.  In regards to the ads I can't say that I have found a single one, except for the Wells Fargo logo that appears when I run an update.  As for Intuit shutting down the software support I kind of agree to a certain extent.  If I buy something I want to be able to use it until I am done with it, not be forced out of using it in order to have to buy the current copy.  That being said after three years I am sure there are improvements that I wouldn't mind obtaining as well as design, both visually and mechanically, that would make the software easier to use.  Buying the software once every 3 years isn't so bad and I don't mind it.  The only con I have found, and this was a lot in the Starter edition and has only happened once so far in this edition, is that randomly the update won't update certain accounts.  Sometimes it goes for a few days to a week before it will finally update.  This is a little annoying to say the least, but it always seems to correct itself and go back live.  Besides the fact that this is essentially the only financial software available I would definitely recommend it.  4 stars.	1
I agree with a lot of the reviews that say there is not a lot new if you are already using 2011 and maybe even 2010 but I highly recommend upgrading from anything older than that. I've used Quicken since it came out in the late 1980s. I've tried other products along the way and always come back to Quicken. I don't know what I'd do without my quicken. When you first get started with the program, to take full advantage of it, it takes some setting up. How detailed you want to keep track of your expenses and bills is really up to you. For example. I have every transaction from every credit card and I've attached the receipts to each transaction. If I pay a bill with several areas of charges, like DWP, I actually separate my charges for water, power, sewer etc, all attached to the single credit card transaction. I can go back over years and tell you exactly how much I paid my kids doctors and for what. I also attach key codes for software I purchase so I always have them and manuals for my appliances. I even download copies of all my insurance policies and attach them to the payments so I can always go back and review my coverage; the pink slip to my car attached to the payment, contracts for work I have done. I can also keep track of all my bills, when the closing dates are on my accounts and the due dates on all my bills. I don't need to get a bill in the mail to know when it should have arrived and when it's due. I can set links to the web sites of all the accounts I setup so that I can go to each web site and see just want the charges are and download them into the account. One of the best things is, I can back up all this information onto one flash drive and have everything I might need in an emergency.	1
I currently use the 2010 version, but I didn't buy it. Why? Because I bought the 2011 version to update 2007, but the 2011 version makes mistakes in calculating a budget, so Intuit's solution was to "allow" me to revert to a 2010 version, which they supplied. They said they'd contact me when the problem was fixed so I could go back to the version I paid for, but they never contacted me; now I know why. They moved the faulty 2011 engine to 2012! If I had paid for this 2012 version, I'd be returning it.  It's tough to trust Intuit with budget and money tracking. I have a 2010 version that calculates properly so I will stick with that even though there are other problems I've had to work around. I hope that someday Intuit will change management and once again create new and innovative products that function well. Here is what I found so far:  Pros *Automatically updated via Internet during installation from CD. *Kept my interface and report customizations. *Runs faster than 2010. *Lots of great tools and features that do function properly. *60-day money back guarantee.  Cons *Installer required uninstalling 2010 version. Makes it tough to compare two versions or revert to previous version. *Automatic update took 15 minutes on a 2.8 GHz computer with broadband connection. Hmmm! *My old file had to be converted to the new format. Good thing I kept a backup. *Requires Windows. PC version has multiple problems but Mac version sucks banshee farts. *Budgeting tool still has calculation problems that originated in the 2011 version. If a money program cannot calculate accurately, what good is it? *Transaction download issues still abound. Intuit usually blames their server, the bank's server, or recommends deleting the connection and re-establishing it (a lengthy, somewhat complex process). *Still has trouble dealing with time and suggests restarting the program to fix it. *Auto-fill is still a nightmare. *Support is still lame. They may answer the phone better (sometimes) but the solutions they provide do not fix the problem, they tell you how to work around the problem. They have been doing this for years!!!  UPDATE Jan 2013  Intuit has just notified me that they will no longer support 2010 as of April 2013. No more downloading transactions. No more customer "support." Not that support was ever really there, but no more downloading transactions? They already have numerous problems with downloading so I must download a file from my bank and import it into Quicken, but two of my accounts work OK. So they are pushing me from a version that calculates properly to one that doesn't. And I've heard nothing good about the 2013 version.  Poor service and support never ends with Intuit, so expect this to happen in a couple of years for the 2012 version, so I dropped the rating to one star.  Time to explore other options. Lots of them out there.	-1
QuickBooks 2012 for Mac is a really useful tool for keeping your finances in check. I added this to my new Macbook Pro and am very happy with how easy and simple this is to use. It has a plethora of features that come in handy for creating fast, convenient ways to monitor all of your bills and accounts.   It allows you to search by keyword for customer or vendor names, transaction types, amounts, dates, and more. The incredibly powerful filters allow you to refine your results and you can even access recent searches and save searches for future accounting sessions. This feature comes in very handy for high-maintenance users who are constantly going in and out of the program.  In addition to the new features I mentioned above, QuickBooks 2012 for Mac also simplifies multi-step tasks like Progress Invoicing, creating multiple invoices from a single estimate over time. As a small-business owner I've been using QuickBooks for over 6 years and 2012 is easily the most compelling Mac version to date. Intuit assures me that the company is committed to QuickBooks for Mac and that it plans to update it for future versions. I highly recommend.	1
First off this software looks great on the Mac!  When I got it, I was thinking it would be just like the Windows edition, just with the traffic light buttons at the top.  I love how everything is floating (not constrained in a Windows; you have toolbar at top, tasks in the middle, and any other items float on the desktop), this is great for when you need to open other files and still view QuickBooks, since you can put the windows side by side and still see both documents (for example copying a contact from the address book to Customer List is simple since the two small windows can sit right by each other and you can just copy and paste each item).  The next great thing is the installation, like many Mac apps it was simply a drag and drop to the application folder and it was installed.  I then was able to activate with the License and Product number and register online, super simple (took about 2 minutes).  The software was easy to set up (I have used QuickBooks for Windows in the past and am familiar with the software), my only flaw is that the first time I used it closed (red exit) on the Company Home Page and the toolbar trying to close QB, but then found I had to Quit from the Dock (or Menu), when I reopened QB, nothing was their and I had to go to Company >> Company Home, and Show Company Toolbar to get it -- Just FYI, I learned that I need to Quit from the Dock or the Menu.  The program opens very quick on my computer (I am using Mac OS X Lion [10.7.2]) and I love the number indicator lights on my items to show me what I have out their at a glance (for example a red number on Invoice to show how many open invoices I have [like on the Mail App for New Mail]).  I was able to set up my accounts with just the Default settings for my industry and was able to create my item list and Customer list very easily, the Help >> Search section is great since if you are looking for a list or setting you can type it in and it will find it for you (and show you where in the menu it is, and you can open it from their).  In the box their was a paper to show you how to import Windows based QuickBooks files, however, since I used to use Simple Start (Free for Windows), I created a new company, since I wanted the full settings from the start.  Another point I want to show, is how much of an improvement the look and feel of the software is.  I love how I can view my invoices or payments or estimates just by using the info on the left and then I can scroll through them flawlessly and view live information on the invoice or go into Preview Mode and scroll through each invoice without having to open Print Preview, as well as see quick info on the customer (like Customer Info and recent transactions!).  This software has such a genuine feel to it, which just makes it perfect!  I can see everything of my business in a quick glance without having to go through lists of information and then opening and closing widows till I find the one, this is an amazing edition of QuickBooks and is just perfect for me as a freelancer!  I also want to add how great support for QuickBooks programs are!  I use QuickBooks POS at work and had the best experience setting it up with the help of our representative and the online community.  Just as I am seeing on this product with the number of Manufacture Replies, I am seeing great customer service who is trying to help customers at every point of the experience.  I have used phone support and online support for my Intuit products in the past and have never had a bad experience.  I am glad to see the Manufacture comments on other reviewers, as that shows me that Intuit is ensuring that their products are working properly and are listening to customer feedback!  And just like our POS system I know if I need help their is entire community of Intuit product users who can help me just by me posting a question or finding others with the same inquiry.  In the end this is great software for keeping up with your business, it allows me to keep track of my freelancing and easily manage my money flow, and all from my Mac!  The software works perfectly on my Mac and looks great!  I highly recommend this for anyone who wants the amazing power of QuickBooks on their Mac!	1
I installed the product on a 10.7.2 system. The product installed easily and worked without issues. The feature set is somewhat different than Quickbooks on Windows.  I installed the R3 update prior to testing.  I consistently have better luck with the Mac versions on initial release than the Windows versions.  Smooth operation, useful features, and a just plain good user experience.	1
First thing I noticed when I upgraded from Quicken Rental Property 2009 to 2012 was that the program slows down when itemizing splits.  Thus my "SLOWER" comment.  Everything else seems to work fine.  I do like some of the upgrades - easier to get around; however, I use the split when itemizing a lot!  Hope they fix this soon.  If I could do it over, I would have stuck with the 2009 version.	1
I've been using Quicken for twenty years now, and usually upgrade only when the program really changes for the better. Thus, having purchased Quicken Deluxe 2011, I would not normally have expected to upgrade this year, and would have settled for the Deluxe version rather than Premier. However, I was happy to do so as a Vine reviewer.  Thus far, all I'm noticing is that the new version is a bit smoother in operation, and a bit less objectionable on the eyes. However, that is already an improvement over last year's upgrade to 2011, which required a lot of effort on my part just to find everything and get everything working again afterwards.  This time the upgrade went smoothly. A few things to note: 1) the EULA (End User License Agreement) is as objectionable as ever. You have to agree in advance to whatever terms Intuit chooses to post on its Web site in future. On the bright side, you are now permitted to install the program on up to three computers in the same household. 2) The upgrade required a reboot afterwards. 3) The data format has changed again, so be sure to do a backup before upgrading. 4) On first use after upgrading, the old data is archived and upgraded. Likely best to get that out of the way before letting One Step Update do anything after the upgrade. 5) Afterwards, having been alerted a One Step Update had previously been missed, I did a One Step Update, and it now works on one bank with which it had trouble before. 6) In the lower right corner of the One Step Update window there was an alert about a further upgrade to release 3 being available, so I then installed that. Overall, a lengthy but not painful process.  I may update later after further investigating the new 2012 features, and those specific to Premier (most of which I don't personally need much), but wanted to post this much now so folks will know the upgrade seems safe but perhaps not essential for those who already have the 2011 version.	1
Nothing new here. Bought mine from Quicken, but same software as 2011. I don't see anything new worth upgrading and sorry that I did. They need improvements, however, but just don't listen to their users.	-1
Every time I get a new Quicken program, it is worse than before. Literally. I would go back to the 1990's versions if I could! I honestly don't understand what those Quicken programmers are up to. I think they just need to tinker with it constantly to justify getting more money for forced upgrades. But they are really downgrades. There are many features I miss from 15 years ago! I was forced to "up" grade to this version so I could get downloaded quotes and transactions from my broker. That is the ONLY reason I bought this. Intuit is a rip off company. Why no one competes with them is beyond me. They could get a heck of a lot of customers switching from Intuit. Maybe Intuit bumps them off before they can develop anything.  Quicken 2012 "downgrades": 1. The "find" function in the register no longer automatically chooses the field that the cursor is in, but does "all fields" as the default, creating the need for more mouse clicks than before.  2. No longer can do a simple report based on the vendor in the field the cursor is in but have to go to a long menu instead, again necessitating more mouse clicks than before.  3. Got rid of the choice to automatically edit the split of a transaction to the same percentage as the last transaction of that vendor. So now you have to use a calculator to figure it out yourself. More time wasted.  4. Tax report to Turbo Tax closes Quicken  5. Much slower quote downloads. MUCH SLOWER.  Also, there is no W2 report. So why bother letting us track W2's with all the various deductions, taxes, etc? This has never existed that I know of.  I wish Intuit would read this: get a real job! Quit making Quicken worse every year. Stop your monopolizing practices. You used to be a good company when you were small in your basement when you first started. Now you are just greedy jerks.	-1
Why I was charged so much for this upgrade is beyond me.  The features and functions were merely patches and updates to things that didn't work in the 2011 version.  This is very, VERY disappointing.  If you think you should upgrade, DON'T - this upgrade isn't worth the money, not even CLOSE.	-1
I was fortunate enough to be a Beta tester this year for the Quicken Home and Business 2012 product. I was very pleased with the performance improvements in Quicken. There are improvements in click point access that make using the program easier and more convenient in areas ranging from reconciling my checkbook to downloading transactions.	1
We run an online business that needs minimal book keeping - we do checks, payables and expenses - we do not have any employees since we run it ourselves.  This has been a great software to maintain the books for our business.	1
I installed the program on a Windows 7 64 bit machine .  I ran the update process prior to doing more testing and the R3 update was installed.  I tested the various features and everything seemed to work OK.  This Premier version allows the user on initial install to select from one industry type to get a solution more tailored than the Quickbooks Pro version provides.  The next morning I booted the machine up and then clicked on the Quickbooks icon on the Desktop.  Quickbooks started to open and then an error message comes up " Quickbooks is already running".  The program failed to open.  I typed the error message into a search engine and found a link to an Intuit support article for the previous Quickbooks 2011 version. It detailed a procedure for correction.  It had me bring up the Windows task manager and kill the Quickbooks process.  After doing that I was then able to open Quickbooks and gain access to Preferences.  I unchecked "Start Quickbooks at Startup".  After that the program has worked fine. I have deducted one star for this problem because it is something Intuit knew about from the last Quickbooks version and it is still a problem.  It seems every version of Quickbooks I install I run into some kind of problem.  The reliability has improved significantly during the last few years but it still seems Intuit releases software with significant problems.	1
I was given the chance to review this item.  As a first time user, I was quite impressed with the ability of this product to aid in running a small business.  However, the use should be aware that some time will need to be taken to learn the program.  It is not an instant use for the first time user.  1.  What's in the box?: The program on a single CD, plus some other offers.  There is apparently the ability to have the program on more than one computer (linked to the same account), which makes it easy to have access to accounting on both a desktop and a mobile system.  2.  Use:    As a first time user, this program too some time to learn.  There is a quick start guide and tutorials available, and these were very helpful. After a bit of effort, the program became much more accessible and easier to use. For a small business, this is a very powerful program that I am still becoming familiar with,  The home screen, with the flowchart of different tools is a great visual aid to utilize this program.  3.  Impressions:  I am impressed by this product.  I have been aware of this product for some time, but had not been inspired to try it.  Now I see that this is a powerful product to be able to understand the inflows and outflows of the business.  There is alot here that I do not require or will use, but I have messed around with some of the features and they are probably useful for certain users.  Overall, I like this product, and can easily understand why Quickbooks is so popular.	1
Back about a million years ago, when I operated businesses with around 50 employees and hundreds of products. I would have drooled over a product as capable as QuickBooks at this low a price. I bought an IBM System 36 for more than a hundred thousand 1980s dollars and spent tens of thousands more on accounting software that didn't hold a candle to QuickBooks Premier. Heck, my super-expensive software wouldn't even do payroll: had to use an outside service for that.   Today I operate as a one-man consultancy. I have no products to inventory, no employees to account for: I have none of the problems and challenges QuickBooks was made to address.   Frankly, I'm sorry that I don't. I'm a data junky and I love all the reports QuickBooks can produce. But for my little business, the simple Schedule C produced by Intuit's junior product, Quicken Home & Business does just fine.   Because my work as a forensics expert requires that I know about many, many aspects of technology, I do a lot of product testing, including in this instance, QuickBooks. Installation  is straight-forward. But the learning curve is steep. Fortunately there are many books, videos, trainers, articles and consultants to help you find your way.   Overall, QuickBooks has developed a massive franchise because it works. It may not be without problems, but it works and is a far better value than the software that coast me tens of thousands of dollars to do less years back.  Jerry	1
I went from QuickBooks 2010 to 2012, so for me this is quite a nice upgrade. So many things have been added, one of the best being the Calendar view for Invoices, etc. The user interface is definitely improved also, now I can hop back and forth between Customers and Invoices and Payments, and it's pretty much flawless, you don't seem to hit the "where on earth am I in this program" any longer! 2012's method of handling Sales Tax is one of the highlights for me, especially being I have to track State and City sales tax, and also deal with a small accounting credit when calculating State tax. Basically I click a button and my tax-due amounts for the month are waiting for me (of course I did have to set up which services are taxable in advance, most of which are in my photography business). The last and best thing I've noticed with 2012 is stability and speed, the thing just runs and runs well. 2010 seemed to take forever to load, especially annoying when you have to pop QB open to take a quick look before rushing off to do whatever. 2012 opens noticably faster. Great upgrade IMO.	1
I am not a Quickbooks "pro" if you will.  I see most people who review have been using the product for years and review from that comparative perspective.  As a new user, I will say this is a fantastic software that is very user friendly and is invaluable for a small business.  This best thing about it is how it integrates each part of your business and allows you to quickly create forms while simultaneously keeping track of finances and inventory.  It's just so quick and easy.  There have been a few times where I had little quirks that took a little while to figure out how to fix, but it was not enough to take away a star. I just consider it part of my learning curve for the product (hint...change the settings and try again if you hit a roadblock).  Great product...time saver...small business must have....definite recommend.	1
After an audit in 2006, we really needed to keep our records in order. It is one of the biggest business chores you need to stay on top of. Especially for solo small business owners.  Although everything was in order, keeping track of all those receipts, invoices, vendor records, ect... was absolutely overwhelming. Especially when you are trying to run the daily operations of your business.  Trust me when I say, "being audited is no fun and is a scary thing to go thru". We were lucky to have gotten a a good agent to deal with and was enough patient with us. This is definitely not the case with most.  I do like this software very much, but the software is only as good as the one who is inputting the data.  Installation was simple without any issues. We upgraded from the 2009 Pro version. However, we are still running older versions of other software because we trust them and they work for us... so far.  Windows XP Pro SP3 Microsoft Office 2007  The file attachment feature is great, mainly because we can attach receipts and invoices to individual accounts and helps pinpoint our expenditures and operational costs, i.e. fuel, motel, food, vehichle repair and maintenance, etc...  Although this is a new install, only 2 months, thoroughly, we have not put it through the ringer yet. As we are progressive in using more of the features, we will update our review.  Overall, I am completely satified with this software and hope that it will be a functional tool for our record keeping. Because an audit is a huge distraction, causes much mental anguish, and is terrible waste of valuable time.	1
I have tried numerous different accounting packages over the years and really feel that once you set up QuickBooks, it's really the best at what it does.  That said, I did have an issued when I upgraded to this version and I encountered a number of software gremlins that kept popping up when I tried to access QuickBooks ("Another instance of this program is running.  Please close the program and restart.") to freezes in entering in transactions.  HOWEVER, and that said, I did go to Intuit and download a patch and its been running smooth ever since.  I did find a couple of the "add-on" features seemed to guide the lily (Business planning, for one) because QuickBooks usual array of reports tells me what I need to know.  However for young businesses I can see great value in the feature.  If your business has good Internet access and you rely on an outside accounting firm, I would recommend that you use the on-line version (which doesn't have the fluff features) because both you and the accountant can access the file (and that saves travel time billing).  But if you do your accounting in house, save for audits, this is a good and solid platform.	1

Works Great I would buy this again	1
I decided to try this to see why so many schools use this to teach and why so many people use it.  I was not happy.  I'm used to Quicken.  I couldn't get things to balance or match up transactions, and trying to get help was useless.  And I'm not afraid of using 'Help' with software.  I uninstalled it as soon as I could & re-installed my former software.	-1

Using this product for years to track finances, easy to convert each year when new product comes out, recommend this product!	1
There is nothing easy about organizing your finances, hence the software that helps you do what is often done by manual entry to Excel spreadsheets and sometimes Access databases. I had used Excel Spreadsheets and Word Documents linked to Spreadsheets in the 90's, but gradually the goals and management software  that helps you make and create solutions for your particular situation is a superb way of preparing in part for tax time, but more importantly it sets you up to organize in a week to week and month month survival, possibly organized survival method of looking after your finances. The way of entering the data, showing the bills, and helping set priorities, is an amazingly clear path to a better financial structure.	1
This lets me and my wife track all of our bills, spending, and budget for the future.  More people should use this to track their finances and be more aware of where their money is going.  Just an FYI the 2013 version is coming with smart phone compatibility and I've been wanting that for a long time so be sure to check that out.	1
I have used quicked for years and I don't know what I did without it. This is the best program	1
I have used Quicken for over a decade, all the way from the DOS version of it. This is by far the worst version that I have purchased. Half the time the downloaded updates do not work and I have to do them one at a time instead of as a "One Step Update" (HA!). Then, usually the first time I start the program up each day, it moves as slow as a rock until I close it and re-open it again, and even then it is no speed demon. It has locked up on several occasions. Intuit seems to love to make simple things very difficult and bug it up in the process. This is a horrible version and I really wish I had not upgraded to it, but now I am stuck with it. I hope when I upgrade again, it will be much, much better. I don't see how it could be much worse.	-1
For years I have asked for simple little fixes. Each year they leave the same issues untouched. I have sent many requests to Intuit and never once even received an acknowledgement. Now, I cannot even find a way to communicate to Intuit! I can speak up in the "community" of other lost and unhappy users, but no more can I just click a link and communicate to Intuit. You try it. I don't know what happened to Intuit, but if I could stop using Quicken I would. Someone needs to make a better Quicken because it seems like every improvement is just more shuffling of menu items and bloat. How about some simple little usability fixes:  1) Allow the resize of the download pane and add some tools to it to select and catagorize and sort. Not even a sort on this window! 2) Renaming is a chore. How about a little help there. 3) Search and replace windows are just too narrow to see the text and yet will not resize. Why? Is this a big probem to create resizable windows. I don't think so. 4) Undo: How about an undo for the simple register mistake? Too much to ask? 5) Pull-down menu items that don't take two or more keystrokes to get a change from. 6) Inappropriate messages that do not relate to the task at hand. Such as asking me if I now want to add the account that I am actually updating. 7) How about not forcing us to upgrade to an even worse implementation by stopping our ability to download transations. 8) Respond to customers or at least let them know with an auto script that you got their email. Something! 9) Just put it back to the way it was in 2000 and before. 10) Fire the suits and hire a new programming and project management team to do all the above. 11) No simple way to request a fix or suggest a feature request. Oh yes, there is a link to click on but it's where that link takes you that is useless.  What do I do for a living? I design software and manage software teams. I was a programmer for over 3 decades. During that 30 years I used extensive feedback from users to design and develop.  Using Quicken is a frustrating experience each time I fire it up and Intuit does not seem to give a hoot about the user experience. HOWEVER, you will see all sorts of promotion for how easy and great their software is and how neat all the new features are. What a laugh...if I could.	-1
** UPDATED** After about two decades of using Quicken and regularly upgrading, I am kicking Intuit to the curb. I upgrade when I want. Period. The last time was June 2012 for Quicken. There has been nothing in newer versions to make it worthwhile to pay for an upgrade. Intuit / Quicken doesn't like that and tried to strong arm me into purchasing version 2015. Unless it's free, I don't want version 2015. It has nothing for me, but I received notice today that if I don't open my wallet and give them $20, they will take away features from my 2012 version. I have to upgrade or lose the ability to download transactions. In order to continue using that feature, I have to buy it again? Business must be bad to resort to bullying. I'm jumping from Intuit's sinking ship and looking at other options. If I find nothing, I'll rather use a spreadsheet than go back to Quicken. I know that if you give a bully your lunch money today, he'll try to force you again tomorrow and every following day. Nope, I'm standing up now and saying: Hey Intuit / Quicken, get the * out of here and go pick on someone your own size! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- About 15 years ago a friend recommended Quicken to help me manage my finances. I haven't been one to jump on the new releases. Quicken Deluxe 2012 is my 3rd upgrade and I am once again not disappointed.  My finances are nothing spectacular. I have a checking and savings accounts with two brick and mortar banks, plus another of each with ING Direct. There are loan accounts for my house and one car. 9 credit cards and 3 brokerage accounts complete my financial picture.  While the capability has been available in previous versions, this is the first time I've used the automatic update feature. I love not having to sign in to each institution's website to get transaction info to enter. Quicken pulls the info for me and presents it in an manner that allows me to accept or edit each individual transaction.  The calendar is one feature I've used and relied on for many years. I credit it for having helped me not miss even one payment in over a decade.  I can't help you compare Quicken to any other finance software, because Quicken is all I've ever used. That said, I can't think of one thing or function that I would like that Quicken doesn't provide.  The one thing that irks me is how dramatically the price has gone up since my last version. 2012 cost me more than double what I paid in 2006. With the exception of the price of the software, I am 100% satisfied.	-1
I have been using Quicken for decades.  Really.  Decades.  I have been using this since the mid-90s.  I'm not a fan or a power-user, but I just have found it a decent way to keep track of my finances.  The installation took forever - had to let it run about 45 minutes while it seemed stuck getting an update (Win7 64 bit).  Eventually, it self-healed and the update went as planned.  The new interface is graphically a tiny bit nicer, but not really any different from what I am used to seeing in the last version.  I have no real complaints.	1
I owned Q2008, Q2005 & Q2002 and I used them daily. during that decade, I observed no significant product improvements, just a huge increase in software bugs.  Look up the Q2010 and/or Q2008 products, where I posted detailed logs/diaries of the endless bugs, errors and frustrations I endured as a Quicken user.  In August, 2010, I finally migrated to the Moneydance product and--after the migration and learning curve issues--I find it swims slick as an eel. I wish I'd done it years sooner.  Since at least 2002, Intuit has been using Quicken as a pure 'cash cow' - a product to milk revenue out of, but making no investment in it - while it continues to toy around with other new product developments toward future revenue streams ... ... Quicken Loans, Quicken Credit Cards, etc.  The history of the Quicken product doesn't suggest a bright future for Quicken users. Don't get suckered into starting up with Quicken. Go with Moneydance.	-1

Only one star given because I couldn't give it zero.  I've been a simple Quicken user for more than 10 years, upgrading along the way as Quicken updates yearly.  Updates are clearly just a way to "milk" users for more money but we're used to this, like Norton antivirus subscriptions.  But, when I update Norton, my computer still works okay.  I usually kept updating Quicken even though I didn't really need it.  If you get too far behind, the risks and learning curves just get higher.  I only use Quicken as a checkbook and for Bill Pay.  It has been flawless in paying bills so I'm happy about that.  What Quicken does is to release a new and buggy version every year, just before the end of the year.  After about 9 months, the bugs are worked and on the 10th month, they release a new version and here we go again.  I've learned over the years not to upgrade at the earliest opportunity because of bugs and because the upgrade gets cheaper later.  I saw the 2012 upgrade offered in 2011 but I waited. Then, in February 2012, I downloaded TurboTax from Amazon.  This went smoothly.  Amazon then sent me a killer low price Quicken 2012 offer.  Due to stupidity and greed on my part, I took the bait.  I have downloaded a number of s/w programs from Amazon and they have gone smoothly and installed without problems, including Quicken 2012 (not all prior Quicken versions installed without errors).  But, when I ran Q12, I found that I could no longer update my Wells Fargo checking account transactions.  Even though I am a simple (and now studid) user, I need the downloads to help me determine when I will run out of money in my checking account.  I try to not keep any more money there than I have to because very little interest is paid.  I had read about problems with downloads earlier but thought maybe they had been fixed or would not affect me.  So, here I am, what do I do?  I couldn't just "restore" my Q2011 version because the download and install didn't save the configuration before the new install (the TurboTax download and install DID save the current configuration).  So, I can't go back to my tried and true Q11 without some risk of losing my data.  I did research on the internet and via help but no solutions.  This is like buying a new car, driving it home, and then having to change the timing belt (by yourself) before you can drive it again.  Wells Fargo, and other banks, offer Bill Pay and it's free or at a nominal charge (6.95 for me versus 9.95 for Quicken).  So, I'm just a little ways away from dumping Quicken for good.  I can understand that new s/w features may have problems but I can't understand how simple things, like downloading transactions, can get broken.  Fortunately, Bill Pay seems to still be working.  It you're smarter than me, at least save your current configuration before installing Q12.  Re-edited 2/13/12 to add the following:  Received a comment on this post from a Quicken support person that I could always "go back to Q11".  So, I uninstalled Q12 and re-installed Q11. But YOU CAN'T GO BACKWARDS this way because Q12 REFORMATS your data file.  When I tried to restore the data file in the re-installed Q11, an error message says "QUICKEN can't read this file"!!!  So, I had to uninstall Q11 and re-install Q12 so I could at least read my data and pay bills.  If Quicken had simply created a Windows Backup file before installing Q12, I would hope that a reversion via Windows Restore would work.  I just don't like taking chances with my data and auto pays and financial records by doing multiple installs and uninstalls.  My solution is to "eat" my copy of Q12 and switch to Wells Fargo Bill Pay.  It's free for me ($6.95/mo for some)and I don't have to pay for yearly Quicken bombs and $9.95/mo for Bill Pay.  I wish Amazon would allow "negative" stars because I would surely give Q12 one or more of them.	-1
I'm very happy with Quicken 2012. The layout is good and easy to understand. Tips and tutorials are helpful. Downloading transactions from my bank is easy. I like the reports, the way the pie charts and other charts are so helpful in seeing where your money is going. This is my first update in several years. There have definitely been a lot of improvements and enhanced features.	1
I've been using Quicken for twenty years now, and usually upgrade only when the program really changes for the better. Thus, having purchased Quicken Deluxe 2011, I would not normally have expected to upgrade this year. However, I was happy to do so as a Vine reviewer.  Thus far, after a month of use, all I'm noticing is that the new version is a bit smoother in operation, and a bit less objectionable on the eyes. However, that is already an improvement over last year's upgrade to 2011, which required a lot of effort on my part just to find everything and get everything working again afterwards.  This time the upgrade went smoothly. A few things to note: 1) the EULA (End User License Agreement) is as objectionable as ever. You have to agree in advance to whatever terms Intuit chooses to post on its Web site in future. On the bright side, you are now permitted to install the program on up to three computers in the same household. 2) The upgrade required a reboot afterwards. 3) The data format has changed again, so be sure to do a backup before upgrading. 4) On first use after upgrading, the old data is archived and upgraded. Likely best to get that out of the way before letting One Step Update do anything after the upgrade. 5) Afterwards, having been alerted a One Step Update had previously been missed, I did a One Step Update, and it now works on one bank with which it had trouble before. 6) In the lower right corner of the One Step Update window there was an alert about a further upgrade to release 3 being available, so I then installed that. Overall, a lengthy but not painful process.  The upgrade is safe but not essential for those who already have the 2011 version.  Update: I have become aware of one annoying behavior (bug?) that was also in the 2011 version. If I manually mark a transaction as Cleared while reviewing my account info on an account's Web site, then later do a 1 Step Update of that same account, such a transaction will both not be recognized as a match and also not show up as an option for manually matching. At that point, even changing the transaction's status to Uncleared does not allow it to be automatically or manually matched. The only solution I have found is to delete the downloaded transaction every time one step update is run.	1
I've had Quicken 2012 for couple of months now and I'm really pleased with it. Previous to this issue. I had Quicken 2011. Normally I do not upgrade unless there are significant improvements to the next years model. However, I was offered this edition on Amazon Vine to review so I thought I would give it a try.  Now, before I go any further, let me state that I am not a Quicken power user. Unlike some that use the extensive range of features that Quicken offers, such as investment tracking, multiple accounts, tax matters, etc., I only use a few functions such as checking account, bill scheduling and online bill pay, and Quicken 2012 does all that and more. But in all honesty I haven't noticed that much difference between the 2011 and the 2012 version. But one big difference I did notice in this new version is the bill pay and online update feature is so much faster than my previous versions of Quicken. When I hit the update button it accomplishes the job in a fraction of the time of the previous versions. In my 2011 addition it would take several minutes to do an online update, with this version it's just a matter of a few short seconds and the job is done.  All in all, for my purposes, I am very pleased with this addition. As I've stated not much difference from the 2011 version, but the speed of the online update and bill pay is well worth the upgrade.	1
I've been using Quicken for many years, probably at least ten, and have upgraded the product each year. This year is as good and solid as other versions. You can't go wrong with Quicken. The install is easy and it reads older data with no problem. Much is similar to older versions, but the budgeting feature is much improved. It is easier to plan spending and to reconcile accounts with Quicken 2012. If you are looking for a software to track your expenses, get Quicken. It is great !	1
I've been using Quicken for decades and just upgraded from Quicken 2010 to 2012 (birthday gift). Now I cannot change my budget for past months?! Is this a bad joke? On top of that, several categories in the Budget screen don't tally expenditures any more even though I through reports expenditures are in those categories. What a mess!  The produce is basically the same as 2010 except the budget is a useless mess.  I may have to go back to using a spreadsheet. I wouldn't buy this except as a joke gift.  Make sure you back up your files before the upgrade changes them. Otherwise there is no way to go back to a useful product.	-1
I am a long-time Quicken user, and just upgraded to Quicken 2012 from the 2011 version.  The upgrade went smoothly, took about 5 minutes, and was a non-event for me.  This has been my experience with all previous upgrades.  I have not tested every nook and cranny of the application, but that shouldn't be necessary.  There have been some quirks or things I would consider minor bugs in previous versions, but up to the 2011 version these had not been fixed, so I will dig into this more as time permits and post back here as necessary.  Observations: * As usual, installing this version does a "conversion" on your previous data files, presumably to a new format.  This took only a few seconds even for 100,000 items in my data file. * I actually have 2 data files that I use by going back and forth between them (for my finances and a trust that I manage).  The first time I opened the 2nd data file, Quicken automatically converted it as well. * Subjectively, this version feels faster to me, especially when opening attachments - that operation was nearly instantaneous.  Nice! * I have yet to determine whether any of the "new features" in this version have any value to me or not.  So why did I upgrade?  One driving factor is that Intuit clearly states that they only support (and provide the ability to get stock quotes) for the current version and 2 years back.  So installing this version resets the clock. The box even says (in microscopic print on the front) "Download your data from participating banks until April 2015."  No big deal, but I keep hearing rumblings that Intuit is shifting more towards an "online" product (software as a service?), which I don't care for, thus this buys me another year of insurance against that, which is especially important to me now that Quicken has a monopoly on this type of product since Microsoft abandoned the market.  Although I had a very smooth upgrade experience, I did take steps to protect myself against the possibility of any loss due to a bad upgrade: 1. Back up your existing data files.  In my case, I copied everything in c:\users\[myname]\documents\Quicken to another folder that I called Quicken2011. 2. Set a system restore point (always a great idea when making any change to a Windows system):  Control Panel > System > Advanced System Settings > System Protection.  Make sure that your c: drive is listed as having "Protection On" and then click Create to create a restore point.  If anything goes badly wrong and you want to revert to your previous version of Quicken, you can return to this same place and select System Restore to have all of the changes effected by the Quicken2012 installation rolled back.  This won't roll back your data, which you will have to restore manually.  Yes I know that Quicken promises to do some of this for you, but I don't like to take any chances.  In case it matters, my system configuration is Windows 7 Professional with SP1, 64-bit version.  Quicken installs as a 32-bit application.  I remain a satisfied Quicken user.  UPDATE 1/7/2012  After using the 2012 version for a few months, I have had no major problems with it, but have encountered a growing number of little issues and annoyances.  I have used Quicken for a very long time over many versions (usually upgrading every 2nd version), and would say that the 2012 version is the quirkiest version yet - maybe it should be called "Quirken 2012".  The good news is that I have experienced no major bugs, i.e. no crashes, data losses, data corruption, wrong results, etc.  But those quirks are most annoying.  Here are just a few: - In a number of places (such as on a form with many fields), if you fill in one field, Quirken thoughtfully auto-fills several other fields - except with wrong info.  The wrong info sometimes gets updated to the correct info when you tab out, but seeing wrong data in a field is never good.  This is a really obvious product QA failure. - A number of label fields are truncated because they don't fit anymore (compared to previous version).  Very minor detail, but it is a quality issue a little like the door on your new car that didn't quite line up. - Major annoyance:  When I download daily quotes for my investments, there have been a few isolated instances where one or more quotes was missing - which would not be a big deal, except that Quirken 2012 now treats these values as 0 (instead of "no new info"), which suddenly causes your net worth value to plunge alarmingly!  Even worse, it is not obvious (the new price value field remains blank, making you think that it was not updated), and once this "fake 0" value is inserted, I can't find any way to tell Quirken to refresh the quote - So I have to go look it up manually - and enter it manually).  Another major escape from QA.  Quirken is one of those products that I both love - and hate - because I use it a lot and rely upon it, but it also frustrates me.  Until the 2012 version, I was very happy.  (The other product that falls into this category for me is PaperPort.)  Several other reviewers have given positive reports on Mint as an alternative.  I have not tried it myself.  But there seems to be strong indication that Intuit, like many other software companies these days, would like to shift their business model towards online products that generate recurring revenue, away from products like Quicken that generate no further revenue unless users can somehow be convinced to pony up for a new version - something that there is less and less reason to do.  This is just speculation, but I thus imagine that Intuit has reduced the amount of people they have working on Quicken, and it shows in the resultant quality.  I can't change my original star rating, which I would now lower to ***  FURTHER UPDATE 2/17/2012  I've now run into problems with the quote history updates several times, and it *IS* really annoying, and even alarming when it shows the value of a security go to ZERO and the value of your portfolio nosediving.  Today it would not even let me *manually* enter a few prices on the price update screen.  Apparently corruption in price history is a known problem that Intuit blithely ignores; here is a direct quote from  their support document GEN82156:  "The Quicken Price history file contains records for your security prices over time.  Occasionally this data becomes corrupted and needs to be rebuilt.  You can rebuild the price history file using the steps below.  Some data may be lost when doing this process."  This is NOT confidence-inspiring in a financial software product!	1
I always use Norton now. Got a good deal here on Amazon.	1
Works great and great price!	1
I have been using Norton Internet Security for years now, and I have never had a problem with viruses, intrusions, or hackers. I have not even had problems with their software. Very reliable!!	1
I've been heavily into PC's since 1993 and have tried most of the major Security Product.  I've come to think Norton is the All Around Better on Average Security product you can buy.  They have Good Tech Support and if a new version comes out you get upgraded for free. I subscribe to 4 of the major PC magazines and most have a once a year review of the main Security Suites and the majority of the time Norton comes out either on top or very close to the top. Year after year. Were talking overall averages of performance now and not one particular test within the tests that the reviewers do.	1
Having used Peter Nortons products since their inception, I have come to rely on his security software as part of my standard security set up.  The other software tools they have are also very handy if you have a need.  The multi packs are great, as I have a number of computers at home that I have to maintain.  getting the 1 user 3 PC is a inexpensive way of protecting my home network of masheens! its got what computers need!	1
I have been using Norton Internet Security for years and have not had any problems. I would recommend this product.	1
I use this on Windows 7 and Windows XP boxes at home. Works well on both multi-core i7 processors and Netbook Atom processors. I usually buy on-line versions just to get a new product key each year. I can leave the existing software installed and just enter a new product key. The only minor annoyance is Norton is sensitive to Firefox version changes. Norton is usually about a week or two behind Firefox upgrades, so for that time, the Norton integration in Firefox is disabled if I upgrade Firefox the day a new version is available. But I suppose Symantec (the maker of Norton products) is testing their software in the new version of Firefox before allowing their software to be enabled for the browser.	1
Thanks Symantec...you've officially change my attitude (for the better) about running security software!  I have to admit that when it comes to running security software, I have never practiced what I preach.  For example, I installed antivirus software on my parents' computer years ago, but I almost never run it on mine.  Why?  Because I've grown tired of software that slows down my system, but my parents care less about performance, so it's not a big deal for them.  Without exception, over the past several years, every time I've attempted to put security software on my own computer (antivirus, firewall), the impact on system resources has been frustrating.  I think it's dangerous to be without such software, but every time I try, my system comes to a screeching halt.  So, after roughly another year of "living on the edge", I found a good price on Norton Internet Security 2012 and decided to give it another shot.  I was absolutely amazed at how unobtrusive their software has become!  NIS 2012 has actually changed my attitude about Symantec (a major culprit in the past in my battle to protect my computer's CPU and RAM).  Here's what I noticed: + Installation went very quickly!  I didn't time it, but I'm pretty sure the process took less than a minute. + Updates went very quickly!  It turns out that event though I bought this 2012 version, I was eligible to update to the 2013 version for free.  This process was simple and quick. + Though I know it is running in the background (and as an add-in for my Google Chrome browser), NIS 2012 (and 2013) has been barely noticeable.  I am able to go about my business-as-usual with no apparent issues from Norton.  About the only time I observe Norton doing its work is when I download a file over the internet.  Norton politely pops up, checks the file to see if its safe, and then disappears moments later when it is done checking.  So, as long as NIS continues to quietly protect my computer in the background, I plan to stick with it!	1
Grate buy as it was time to renew. When I clicked the renew button much to my surprise the price was $65 (3 computers) for a year. This deal was perfect at $22 & it was an instant download. Kudos to Amazon for the deal.	1
Norton product that does what it should.  Quickly, easily, no fuss.  Different O/S (Win7, XP and well, Vista - if you can call Vista an O/S) on different platforms (netbook, desktop, laptop).	1
Have used Norton Internet security products for many years and this product continues giving excellent service like those in the past.  Most computers users have more than one so you need this 3 PC product to cover all your machines.  My internet service provided has a global spam filter as part of its service and this Norton security filter serves as a critically necessary backup, a just-in-case backup.  Get it, you need it and it works.	1
I tried N.I.S. on my late model notebook PC, and over a 1.5 year period, full system scans were never completed because it took too long!  Even with the newest 2012 version update. I always had to stop the scan because it would be 18 hours, or 21 hours in, and the scan would STILL be in process!  Just yesterday, after 21 hours of initiating a full system scan, I stopped the scan.  N.I.S. scanned about 1,410,000 files, and was STILL GOING!  Quick scans take about 10 minutes, so at least that seems to be working.  I made sure screen savers and sleep modes were in fact turned off for the full system scans, but it still took almost a full day after I ran out of patience! For the record, my PC is a Toshiba running Win 7, 4 gigs RAM, and an AMD Phenom triple core processor. Not exactly a slow machine. Without being able to complete a full system scan, within reasonable time, to give me 'peace of mind' that ALL files are checked and secure, I cannot recommend this product. In addition, my browser slows to a crawl, and at times even stops working completely, when N.I.S. is automatically downloading current updates! RIDICULOUS!	-1
Here's a sample of the horrible interface:  1. A full scan is simultaneously marked as COMPLETE and NEVER RUN.  2. To schedule a scan to run later, you have to click the "SCAN NOW" button.  3. The "quick scan" runs every day, which is annoying and interrupts work, so I find the schedule setting, and... IT IS ALREADY SET TO "DO NOT SCHEDULE THIS SCAN".  So it presents contradictory information, settings are hard to find, and even when you find settings they don't work.  Non-functional settings have been a problem with almost every version of Norton I have tried, and not always with the same feature.  I think one previous version would try to backup my entire hard drive automatically, despite that being turned off according to the UI.	-1
I've been using Norton Internet Security since the Netbook edition, I believe, starting 2008. I have been very happy with its interface, user controls and scanning abilities. Its been effective to detect a couple of Trojans and even the many (low risk) tracking cookies. Its scheduled scans are thorough and unobtrusive; It will automatically pause while I am using my computer.  Basically, for about 20 bucks a year, I am happy with Norton Internet Security although there are many very good free antivirus programs. Microsoft Security Essentials is one of the best as well as AVG. I just like the Norton interface and user controls which I have already configured and continue to use.  Overall, not perfect (none are), Norton Internet Security is among the best antivirus programs, easy to use with adequate out-of-the-box security settings.	1
Now, Norton Internet Security leads again in PC's secure industry. NIS 2012 uses less PC's resources, active, strong, and smart. High recommend to buy this one.	1
Seems to work fine.  Like most Norton secuity products, it gets a little "bossy" but it's OK.  In the past, I've bought Norton's 360 and System Works, more bells and whistles, not a lot more function.  The "free" backup storage is minimal, and they want too much to buy more.  I've used MacAfee and Norton, prefer Norton.  Both keep most of the bad guys out, unless YOU do too many overrides...	1
Great price and fast shippment. Quick Scan seems to be a bit slower than last year, but more and more virus are out too so that doesnt worry me! Would recommend 100%.	1
Symantec's,  Norton Internet Security, aka NIS, has been around for a while. I have been using Norton Anti-Virus since it was invented, I think. It hasn't caught every virus, or every malware, or all the other junk that comes my way, but it gets better and better, and in my opinion, I believe it is better overall than any other single program out there.  To be fair, I do use the free programs, Ad-Aware and Spybot Search and Destroy, when I believe I have been to a suspicious site, or that I have been compromised, and NIS hasn't caught anything. I don't believe any one program can catch it all as NIS, Ad-Aware, and Spybot, can all catch something that each of the others don't.  Symantec can be a pain for customer support sometimes, but I guess I've gotten so used to using their FAQ that I can solve most problems myself. The most common in the past several years, is the program not recognizing that you've just bought the latest edition of the software and it tells you your subscription (free upgrades during the year) is about to expire.  You have to go in and monkey around to get it to reset and each year I cannot remember how I did it the year before so I have to look it up again.	1
I have always used Norton but the 2012 edition messed up my system from the start.  Then Internet Explorer started running very slowly and links would not work.  After nearly 2 weeks of email tech support and 7 hours on the phone with Norton, their final solution was that since the problem was with Internet Explorer, I had to contact Microsoft.  I called Microsoft and they downloaded a program called SuperSpyWare Professional trial version and it immediately found that the computer was infected by 2 trojans.  These infected my system while Norton was running and supposedly protecting it.  Also, Norton scans had just come up fine.  As soon as these 2 trojans were removed, all the problems with the computer were gone.  I now know I CAN NO LONGER TRUST NORTON TO PROTECT MY COMPUTER.  Microsoft recommended Kaspersky which is what I intend to replace Norton with.  I will never use a Norton product again as it does not do what it is supposed to do.	-1
Using Win7x64. I know it's fashionable to hate on Norton and they were making really awful products for a while.  Since a revamp around 2009 their software has become very lightweight and fast.  I wouldn't full scan while on the computer but it won't slow down the system as it monitors your files.  One caveat, though.  I find Norton is too permissive compared to other software.  To combat this I change a few settings so it prompts me whether to accept new or unfamiliar files.  There is just one MAJOR problem when doing this ...  As of the date of my review, there is no way to accept or deny Norton when it prompts you.  Let me be clear.  When Norton prompts you whether to accept new or unfamiliar program files, there is no button to click to either accept or deny the file.  They forgot to put the buttons in the prompt. (!) Since Norton freezes your computer while waiting for a response and protects itself against attacks like "End Process", the only way to get rid of the prompt is to restart the computer.  People who use the default settings probably won't notice this for a while.  People who want control over what Norton accepts and denies will find this program unusable.  I realize these are non-standard settings but it should not have gone out the door like this.  I have tried to contact Norton about this issue but navigating support is like making your way through a maze.  The best I could do was fill out a feedback form.  I'm not optimistic they will see this complaint, much less fix the problem.  Support was one of the reasons I stayed with Norton but it has taken a nosedive lately.  Edit 4/14: Attempted an upgrade twice and a complete uninstall/reinstall twice including completely deleting all of my user data.  Now the current version of NIS 2012 will either completely lock up my Internet connection or the program grinds to a halt at random times.  If I try to open Norton it will lock up and give me an error 8504,104 (which helps a lot).  Of course I can't end the process (access denied) so I must restart the computer to get my connection back.  Funny thing is Norton will provide a toll-free telephone number for you to call if it cannot access the Internet.  However, in spite of going through two levels of "support", including having them take control of my computer and call me back two hours late, they cannot figure out the problem.  I had no troubles with NIS 2011 on this same computer.  My rating stands.  Edit 7/20: If all the above isn't bad enough, consider that you will be inundated with spammy emails on an almost daily basis if you let your subscription run out.  They don't even provide an unsubscribe link in their emails.	-1
Norton Internet Security 2012 is a good all around package for those that like to "set it and forget it".  Norton really has made great strides in recent years in reducing the heft of the program and the resources used while it is running in the background.  It runs virutally unnoticed, and seems to do a thourogh job of keeping out bad guys.  I would recommend it for those that don't want to manage their firewall intrusions, virus threats, network allowed devices/services through the firewall, and other such items.  Lastly Amazon's software download was flawless.	1
I used Norton on and off for 10 years now. Lately, I was mostly happy with the program until today.  I have a computer that I do not use very often. Today I needed to start it to do something. After 10 minutes I got 2 programs to pop up asking to be updated. Knowing that I blocked these annoying programs from accessing the internet through the Norton firewall, I started the Internet Security to check the settings. I was perplexed to see that the Norton Internet Security was completely off (firewall and antivirus) and the message was that the subscription could not be verified because I was not connected to the internet for a while (to be more exact it was 39 days since the last LiveUpdate). I pressed the Verify button and the message changes to: Subscription Status: 249 Days Remaining.  UNBELIVABLE !!!! This thing turned itself off with no warning and apparently, it was designed to do so! A product that I paid for and activated it as they require, decides not to do its job. More than that, although I was connected to the internet, 10 minutes after starting the machine, the program still did not verify the subscription or notified me about the issue. I had to verify it manually.  Good product turned to be GARBAGE by design. It may work well, but if it does this, it serves no purpose and only gives people a false sense of security. I just can't believe they did this.....	-1
I installed this item with ease. Works very very well. My son does a lot of surfing from youtube to Dragonball Z to iTunes. This product caught over 12 suspicious items and removed them quickly. Has three scan settings: quick scan, full, scan, and an option to target what you want to scan.	1
I've been using Norton Internet Security now for at least 10-years and have never had a problem.  I've watched this product evolve over the years to it's present form.  It does background scans so you can continue doing what you're doing.  It warns you of threats.  It even provides a map of your home network, complete with IP and MAC addresses.  I tried McAfee once, and I'll never go back!  I've also tried CA (Computer Associates), but nothing beats Norton Internet Security for ease of installation and use.	1
Im running 2012 on a number of systems. Its fast and runs glitch free. Since 2009 norton has been getting better and better. Rated number one in PCMAG. Interface could be improved though but it excels in speed and malware detection - most important areas.	1
I bought an hp laptop from a local retailer a month ago and the computer came pre-installed with a 60 day trail of norton. I've always used their products so I knew that I would be getting this new version of norton soon. I had 29 days left on the trail version when I bought the full version. Very easy to install and didn't take long at all and it dosen't slow my computer down at all. HP computers work better with norton.	1
I had The Printshop 20, which is no longer supported by the manufacturer, and I liked it so well that I decided to purchase the newest version. The format is a little bit different than previous versions, so it takes a little getting use to, but its not that difficult to navigate your way through it	1
This is the newest version of print shop deluxe.  It looks nothing like print shop 23.  If you have used older versions of print shop and were hoping to upgrade to the newest version with ease, this version will disappoint you.  They have designed it to look like the pro version.  They need to go back to the 23 design with upgrade.  This program crashes and the best PDF I could get was a 150 dpi.  No good for printing.	-1
I have printshop 20.  It spoiled me.  It had no bugs that I ever found.  Printshop 3.0 on the hand has more bugs than I can count.  It seems that they cut a lot of corners in testing this software.  When typing, the marker where you are, it disapears. I am thinking of going back to 20.  Since I 1st wrote this review I have been trying to print envelopes.  I have never had more problems. The print instructions call out landscape mode but the program prints in partially in the potrait mode and most of it not at alll. When trying to contact Broderbund I go in circles.  They won't answer their phone.  They support center says I can send an email, but that part does not work.  One star rating is too much. Continued efforts have gotten answers.  But not to my questions.  They answer the question, but not to the question I asked.  I have upgraded to 3.0.5 and still no solutions to the problems.  I think they are having great financial problems  How would you like to make a card with lots of stuff and it won't let you print.  Instead it crashes and you lose everything.  I keep looking for and update that makes it more useable but so far no luck.	-1
Fool me twice, shame on me!  Like the other people who reviewed this product it keeps crashing.  And crashing.  And crashing.  I didn't buy it from here.  Instead I bought it from the company itself as a download and have asked for a letter of destruction.  Twice.  So far...nothing.  However, I'm here to critique the product and not the manufacturer's LOUSY customer service, aren't I?  They tried to make it look like Office 2007/2010.  It does but it won't stop crashing.  I tried it on a 2 week old machine and an 8 month old machine.  Both run Windows 7 premium home, 64 bit.  Both handle other creation software without a problem.  When it didn't crash one time I did create a project.  There was a slight problem:  it only saved PART of my project.  That was rather irritating.  I also don't care for their search methods.  It isn't specific enough.  As my title says I keep wondering who their developers are.  I wrote a review on another product that also had issues.  It's almost as if they don't beta test their software enough or just ignore feedback.  If I had the money, ability, back-up and resources I'd create my own product and shut their business down because instead of getting better, they're getting worse.  Wake up Encore/Broderbund!  Your reputation stinks!	-1
HAPPY WITH ORDER, ARRIVED ON TIME AND PROGRAM WORKS GREAT. I HAVE USED THIS PROGRAM FOR YEARS THE QUALITY JUST IMPROVES WITH TIME	1
I haven't even used the full capacity of the Corel PaintShop Pro X4 Ultimate software and consider it to be fantastic.  My mother took thousands of photos over the years as a hobby.  Those photos captured the lives of our entire family, our vacations, our home, all the fun times and some of the hard times.  All those pictures were stored on 35 mm slides and photo paper.  There were boxes of pictures.  When she passed away one of my brothers undertook the job of converting all those photos to digital and placing them on DVD disks. When I got my copy of the first disk I was happy but disappointed in the quality of the converted pictures.  They were not sorted in any way, so there were pictures of a summer vacation mixed in with snowstorm pictures.  I used the Corel software to clean up the pictures and sorted them into catagories.  I was surprised at how nice they were after the Corel Paintshop application.  There are also some nice free things included with the software and I intend to take advantage of them.  Especially, they offer a free Blurb(R) photo book and a copy of WinZip (R) Pro.  This software does so much I know I will be learning and enjoying it for some time.  I think everyone will enjoy working with it too.	1
I upgraded to this version for the HDR feature;  It works well at combining multiple exposures (over and under exposed, to create one photo where all parts are nicely exposed).  Like any new big photo program,  It takes a few days (not hours) to get used to the different features, and become productive again (I've used a half dozen different programs in the past 20 years, each does similar things a bit differently).	1
I've been a PaintShop Pro user for quite some times and have been through several prior version of PaintShot Pro releases. The version X4 comes with quite some pleasant new features. Specifically, I love the new Manage Adjust Edit tabs that make handling multiple photos more easier. Also, the program is much more stable now. The included tools are quite competitive compared with the higher-priced photoshop elements. In general, PaintShot pro is more intuitive to use than photoshop elements.    All in all, paintshot offers a wide range of post processing capabilities at a very low price. I would recommend it to my friends.	1
I've used Photoshop for a long time, mostly for enhancing photos and adding graphics, lettering etc. for websites. Adobe's pricing has put it out of reach for me personally, but this Corel product goes a long way to giving me the features I use most often. The interface is distinctly different but it's fairly easy to learn and I've grown to like it. I still prefer to organize with Elements, but use PSP as a side processor for effects and I'm really pleased with it.	1
PaintShop Pro has long been considered the cheaper (and sometimes lighter duty) alternative to Adobe PhotoShop.  Each product has it strengths and weaknesses, but those considering a purchase of PaintShop Pro are usually broken into two groups:  (1) you want a powerful suite to edit photos but do not want to learn PhotoShop or (2) cannot afford PhotoShop and want the best bang for your buck.  Previous owners of PaintShop will likely love or hate this version.  They have made positive improvements and add many features.  Nike Color Efex Pro 3, and HDR (high dynamic range) module, and selective focus are among the additions.  There are other changes, but those are some of the most desired new features that people want to see in photo software today.  If you are looking for a powerful photo editing suite that is fairly quick and easy to learn, then try PaintShop Pro.  The learning curve isn't as bad as with PhotoShop and you still get a software suite that is packed with features that can handle everything from amateur home to use to many professional tasks.  You will have to take time to learn every feature, but you can start doing basic tasks very quickly.  The same goes for people who would love to have PhotoShop, but would like to stay on a budget.  PaintShop Pro offers one of the best bangs for your buck on the market.  The user interface is great.  You see all the necessary photo information without having to go to multiple windows.  Previews are excellent with thumbnail layouts that work.  I found that the workflow of editing, managing, and sharing images in PaintShop Pro was quick and simple.	1
I have gone thru so many of these that you'd think I could be satisfied with at least one of them, but it is like they always have to have a little flaw in them that makes your work harder. With this one, it is the cutting tool. The product insists on doing most of the work itself and sometimes it takes me forever to get it right because I have to keep going back and redoing the cropping. Is it to much to ask to let us draw our own line and crop from it. Another annoying thing is that when you close out the program it tries to sell you a version of another program (that probably also has flaws). I like the old Coral and Draw program best but guess what stopped working on it...the cropping tool. I reinstalled it twice and it still wouldn't work right. I gave up on it and was determined this one was going to be "it" but it's annoying as well. It does have it's good points though. It's fairly easy to use (if you've went thru as many as I have), but it probably wouldn't be that easy for a newbie. They should include a disc with someone illustrating the different things you can do with it since there is a lot to learn and the guide with it isn't that easy to understand. Also with one program you could clear up the rough spots by using a circular motion which covered more ground. This one has an oblong shape and to me it doesn't work as well and if you have a big area, it's a pain to do. One good thing is that they all have the one step thing where you can click it and it automatically makes everything better on an old picture. For some pictures that is enough. Others need a major touch up and that little oblong thingie just doesn't cut it. I guess I should have written this when I wasn't so aggravated after struggling with it today.	1
Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary:  Highly recommended with warm fuzzies!   Design & Features:  Excellent 5-fuzzies rating  Ergonomics, Usability & Ease of Use:  Average not-good not-bad 3-fuzzies rating  Performance, Stability, Reliability:  Excellent 5-fuzzies rating  Competitive Pricing & Value:  Excellent 5-fuzzies rating   Positives:   Many stability and performance issues from the previous X3 version were resolved in this X4 version.  It runs noticeably quicker, even on slower 5-year old laptops and small netbooks, with good stability.  A very wide range of tools for both photo editing and graphic design, ranging from serious photography-specific tools to fun graphics manipulation.  It combines photo editing, photo retouching, painting, drawing, graphics design, and image management in a single package.  There are a great selection of photo enhancement tools, both to fix common photography issues and also more esoteric image manipulation tools.  It also includes Web graphics tools for image mapping and slicing, and for coding image rollovers and Web button creation.  Very affordable, yet very powerful; currently selling on Amazon at a heavily discounted pricing of less than $50.  A very useful "Learning Center" and video tutorials help photo-editing newbies learn the software and accomplish common tasks.  The user interface is divided into three tabs, "Manage", "Adjust", "Edit", providing a usable workflow from initial photo review to final editing, and allowing you to configure, customize, and save how you use each workspace.  You can also customize each toolbar individually.   Negatives:   Even though the new HDR "Exposure Merge" tool is a great start, the tool is not always precise at aligning objects between bracketed shots and it is especially lacking in deghosting; both problems can arise from either camera movement or movement of objects in the scene.  It has limited RAW file processing capabilities and compatibilities compared to Adobe Lightroom, but Corel now intends for RAW handling to be better addressed in their new AfterShot Pro software.  As with some of Corel's other recent products, accessing the help documentation requires access to Corel's online Web site for information, instead of being able to access all help documentation locally on my computer directly from within the application.  Despite being more uncluttered and streamlined than the previous X3 version's user interface, the "Edit" tab of this new user interface, which serves as the main workhorse for serious image editing, is still somewhat cluttered and disorganized, with overlapping functions and ambiguous groupings of tools, and this impacts the ergonomics and usability of the software, especially for new users.  For the graphics newbie who has no previous experience using graphics software, there is a medium-to-high learning curve effort required to learn how to proficiently use the software.  This software is not specifically designed for simple image manipulation by novices.  If you are initially learning this software, you should start off just using the "Adjust" tab and not use the "Edit" tab; the "Adjust" tab is simplified and suitable to novices whereas the "Edit" tab is meant for power users.  I have always been a fan of PaintShop Pro throughout the 1990s and I have often kept updating PSP versions after Corel acquired its original developer, JASC Software, in 2004, even though I also have been updating versions of CorelDRAW Graphics Suite starting from CorelDRAW 5.  Along with recently releasing the new&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Corel-AfterShot-Pro/dp/B006WVR9GY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Corel AfterShot Pro</a>&nbsp;this year (after Corel acquired Bibble Labs and repackaged their "Bibble Pro" as "AfterShot Pro") and also the newly updated&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/CorelDRAW-Graphics-Suite-X6/dp/B007IWCQ8W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">CorelDRAW Graphics Suite X6</a>, which includes Corel's original photo-editor called "Photo-Paint", Corel now has three photo applications which have some overlapping functions and also unique abilities of their own.  As a photo management application, AfterShot Pro is meant to complement PaintShop Pro and compete against Adobe Photoshop Lightroom.  I previously used both of Corel's PaintShop Pro and Corel's Photo-Paint software for photo editing, and even though recent versions of PaintShop Pro run slower than Photo-Paint due to code bloat from an ever-increasing set of features, PaintShop Pro remains my favorite "Photoshop for the non-professional-graphics masses" application, being more feature-packed and capable like Photoshop CS than Adobe's own&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Adobe-Photoshop-Elements-10/dp/B005MMMT6E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Adobe Photoshop Elements 10</a>.  What is in the box package of this PaintShop Pro X4 Ultimate edition?   Software CD (for Windows 7/Vista/XP)  Leaflet with WinZip Pro download instructions and activation code.  Leaflet with Blurb.com coupon code for a $33.95 discount off a photo book that you create from the Blurb.com Web site.  Leaflet with Fotolia coupon code that may be used to download 21 photos from that site.  186-page User Guide  The PaintShop Pro X4 product features are described and rated below:   Design & Features:  Excellent 5-fuzzies rating:   After Corel acquired JASC Software, they have been adding new features with each release, and even though this version runs and feels slower than earlier versions of PSP, I feel that it is a fair trade-off to allow the code bloat due to the number and complexity of features to slow the software down.  With this latest X4 version, I get a powerful set of photo and graphics editing tools that is more useful than Photoshop Elements 10.  PaintShop Pro X4 pales in comparison to the power of the full-blown Photoshop CS, but with its significantly lower pricing and learning curve compared to Photoshop CS, it is obviously meant to compete against software like Photoshop Elements, which it handily outperforms.  The rich set of tools included in PaintShop Pro range from very specific goal-oriented adjustments like the new "Selective Focus" tool that simulates the effect of tilt-shift lenses to tools that are very friendly to use by newbies such as 'One Step Photo Fix', 'Smart Photo Fix', and 'One Step Noise Removal'.  This "Ultimate" version of PaintShop Pro X4 adds even more power and value by including the award-winning Nik Color Efex Pro 3.0 photographic filters, which includes 52 photographic filters that can be applied to images to give them special effects.  Also included in this Ultimate version is a collection of "Picture Tubes", which are thematic collections of graphics that can be painted onto an image to add more bling to your images, frames, and borders.  To help you navigate through the plethora of tools and effects, a very useful 'Effect Browser' lets you try out the various effects, instead of accessing each effect one by one.  One thing that I noticed was that the dialog box window for the 'Effect Browser' has not been updated to match the stylish new user interface, and it still has the old Windows-expanding-folder-tree appearance of old PaintShop Pro versions.   The new HDR (High Dynamic Range) "Exposure Merge" tool is Corel's foray into HDR software, which Adobe and other graphics software vendors are also incorporating into their tools.  HDR processing involves combining multiple exposures of the exact same shot (which is easier if your camera has an Automatic Exposure Bracketing (AEB) function) to create a high dynamic range photo which can display a higher tonal range than what the camera is capable of capturing in a single exposure.  There are various software specifically dedicated to HDR processing.  For the past four years, since version 3 in 2008, I have been using the excellent&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Photomatix-Pro-4/dp/B002CIP12U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Photomatix Pro 4</a>&nbsp;software for HDR processing.  On a relative scale specifically rating its HDR functions, I would rate Photomatix 5 fuzzy stars while this PaintShop Pro X4's new HDR "Exposure Merge" tool only gets 3 fuzzy stars rating.  Both Corel and Adobe still have a long way to catch up with the powerful and flexible offerings in Photomatix.  In particular, I found the "Exposure Merge" tool in this version of PaintShop Pro X4 to be lacking in its ability to precisely align bracketed photos and thoroughly and flexibly remove ghosting artifacts, which is something that Photomatix does a very good job at.  If you use a tripod-mounted camera to shoot bracketed photos where nothing in the scene moves the least bit, then the "Exposure Merge" tool consistently outputs good HDR results.  But when shooting portraits or landscapes, or shooting hand-held, bracketed photos often have misaligned objects and/or moving objects in the shots.  Even bracketed portrait shots of a person using a tripod can result in tiny movements by the person that require excellent alignment and deghosting by HDR software, and Photomatix currently beats PaintShop Pro's "Exposure Merge" tool in this area.  PaintShop Pro's "Exposure Merge" tool frequently has ghosting artifacts leftover either from movement of the camera by the photographer or movement of objects in the scene.  This ghosting is especially evident in scenes such as landscapes where various plants may be moving in the breeze or portraits where the subject has slightly moved in between each bracketed shot.  Photomatix also includes a plethora of other tone mapping, image stacking, and on-the-fly editing adjustments, including being able to define specific areas of photos to deghost and specific areas of photos where I can use the original image instead of the HDR output.  I use these Photomatix functions a lot because I always aim for very natural-looking HDR images, instead of the surreal psychedelic HDR images that are, all too often, output by people.  HDR software can be abused to create unnatural over-saturated photos that become tiresome to look at.  Using Photomatix on an image of people set against a beautiful background landscape, I can tell the software to use an original un-HDR'ed exposure of a photo for the people's faces while letting the software HDR-process the rest of the landscape, and this is very useful to me because HDR-processed skin tones can sometimes look unnatural.  PaintShop Pro's "Exposure Merge" tool cannot perform these functions that I described.  So a good HDR workflow would be to HDR-process your bracketed photos first using Photomatix, and then further edit the HDR output in PaintShop Pro, perhaps performing some sharpening as the last step before saving the files.   The new "Photo Blend" tool lets you merge the best aspects of multiple photos into one photo by removing, swapping, or adding details to the final combined photo.  This is often used for group shots when you have some people with eyes open and some with eyes closed, or to remove distracting objects from a static scene such as cars and other strangers in the background, but this can also be used for fun creative purposes as well.  As with the new "Exposure Merge" HDR tool, this is ideally used with identically composed photos that were all shot from a tripod or a very steady hand.  When I mentioned above that Photomatix lets me specifically define and select the original un-HDR'ed exposure of a photo for people's faces, I can simulate this function in PaintShop Pro by using this new "Photo Blend" tool on the saved file output after using the "Exposure Merge" tool, but this workflow is very cumbersome and tedious.   The new "Selective Focus" tool is pretty fun to work with, letting you simulate the effect of tilt-shift lenses (e.g. Lensbaby) by selectively blurring areas.  This is also somewhat similar to simulating a shallow depth of field when using a large aperture setting on a camera lens to get a blurry bokeh background surrounding your main subject of focus.   Although adding a vignette effect was present in previous PaintShop Pro versions, this has now been expanded into a separate tool with more flexible options.   A new "Fill Light" filter lets your brighten shadow areas in photos and a separate "Clarity" filter lets you sharpen or soften subtle details in a photo.  These two filters, presented together as a single tool, can be used, for example, on a portrait to brighten a dark shadowed region of the face while selectively softening the wrinkles on the person's face for portraits shot in the harsh bright glare of mid-day sun.   Although Corel hopes that users perform RAW conversion using their new AfterShot Pro software (which was formerly "Bibble Pro" before Corel acquired Bibble Labs), PaintShop Pro still includes its "Camera RAW Lab" for RAW conversion, and this X4 version adds new highlight recovery options to recover details in overexposed regions of a photo.   More than 20 tools have been upgraded to support 16-bit images.   There is built-in one-click photo sharing that lets you upload photos to either Facebook or Flickr, or send via email.   Ergonomics, Usability & Ease of Use:  Average not-good not-bad 3-fuzzies rating   The user interface now features three separate, yet integrated, workflow interfaces, designated by tabs across the top of the program window: "Manage", "Adjust", "Edit".  The "Photo Organizer" in previous versions is now replaced by an "Organizer" palette which is available from all three workflow tabs.   The "Manage" tab is where you browse, review, and rate images, edit metadata, and create collections of photos.  This workspace lets you review and organize your photo files.  Using the navigation palette, you can select an entire photo folder on your computer, narrow the selection according to one or more tags that you have assigned to photos, or narrow the selection according to the ratings that you have assigned to photos.  The palette also shows basic EXIF information about a photo.   The "Adjust" tab is where you can make photo adjustments using a subset of the most common tools such as sharpening, color balance, brightness/contrast, fill light, clarity, tone mapping, noise removal, cropping, straightening, red-eye removal, or using its various built-in touch-up tools.  Edits can also be applied to batches of files.  This tab only offers a portion of the tools that are all available from the "Edit" tab.  Its interface is cleaner and far less busy than the "Edit" tab, and because of its simpler layout, it makes an ideal interface for beginning users who are just starting to learn the software.   The "Edit" tab includes all of the entire sets of tools for photo editing, drawing, painting, and graphic design work.  By contrast, the "Adjust" tab offers only a subset of what can be accessed from the "Edit" tab.  I think of the "Adjust" tab as being designed for novice newbies and beginning-intermediate levels of users, who often are not exactly sure what is wrong with their photo and how specifically to correct/adjust it, and the "Edit" tab is designed for advanced power users like me who want to have direct access to all the tools.  If you are just starting out with graphics software, I recommend that you begin your photo editing from the "Adjust" tab, and then later as you become more proficient with the software, you can ignore this tab and always proceed directly to the "Edit" tab.  The "Adjust" tab is much cleaner with its presentation of tools grouped into a handful of categories on the left side of the user interface and four menu options along the top, whereas the "Edit" tab lets you access every possible tool in its comprehensive tool chest and eleven menu options along the top.  Overall, I think that this three-tab design strikes a happy balance that addresses the needs of both new users and power users.   While the "Manage" and "Adjust" tabs are more simpler, clean, and organized in their user interface layouts, the "Edit" tab feels very busy and crowded, and it can be hard to find tools, especially when you are initially familiarizing yourself with all of the software's dozens of tools.  And to add to this ergonomics and usability issue, the main menu on the "Edit" tab divides the tools into two menu options: 'Adjust' and 'Effects'.  The "Adjust" tab includes a subset of options that are listed under the 'Adjust' menu option on the "Edit" tab.  One ambiguous example is that under the 'Adjust' main menu option of the "Edit" tab, there is a 'Brightness and Contrast' option that then opens up a submenu containing the new 'Fill Light/Clarity' tool.  But the 'Adjust' menu also lists a similar tool called 'Fill Flash'.  Both the 'Fill Light/Clarity' and 'Fill Flash' tools have a similar function, but neither the printed User Manual nor the online "Help Topics" documentation explain what the differences between both tools are.  At a minimum, the 'Fill Flash' tool also needs to be moved into the submenu below the 'Brightness and Contrast' option.  Ideally, both 'Fill Flash', which has 'Strength' and 'Saturation' slider settings, and 'Fill Light/Clarity', which has 'Fill Light' and 'Clarity' slider settings, should be combined into a single tool window containing three or four sliders, instead of confusing users as to which of these two tools to use.   The software links to a variety of searchable online help and built-in tutorials.  As with some of their other recent software releases, Corel has the help documentation in this PaintShop Pro X4 set up so that clicking on the 'Help' option from the menu and then selecting 'Help Topics' starts up your browser and takes you to Corel's Web site where all of the help topics are accessible online and can also be searched.  I really wished that Corel gave the user the option, during the initial software CD installation process, to either install the entire help documentation locally on the computer or to link the software to Corel's online Web site.  After all, being dependent upon online access in order to access help information can be problematic if the user needs to search the 'Help Topics' from a place where there is no Internet access.  On September 2011, Corel released a 125-MB 'Corel_PSPX4_LocalHelp.exe' patch that does install all of the help files locally on my computer, but after I installed this patch, clicking the 'Help Topics' still always brings up my browser and opens up a new tab to display Corel's online help content.  And there does not seem to be a way to configure PaintShop Pro X4 to default to offline mode and use the locally-installed help files even when no Internet connection is available.  But you can still manually access the locally-installed help files by directly pointing your browser at the directory path where all of the help files are installed.  The main Web page for the help files is located in the directory path below:  32-bit C:\Program Files\Corel\Corel PaintShop Pro X4\Languages\EN\Help\wwhelp\wwhimpl\js\html\wwhelp.htm 64-bit: C:\Program Files (x86)\Corel\Corel PaintShop Pro X4\Languages\EN\Help\wwhelp\wwhimpl\js\html\wwhelp.htm  If, like me, your PaintShop pro install also constantly redirects you to Corel's Web site, you can point your Web browser to this location to access the locally-installed help files.  This locally-installed help documentation page, complete with a search function, works well using either Internet Explorer or Safari browsers, but Firefox just displays a blank two-framed page.   Performance, Stability, Reliability:  Excellent 5-fuzzies rating   Compared to previous versions of PaintShop Pro, this X4 version has pretty good stability.  During almost one year of weekly usage before writing this review, I have had the software crash or hang about 6 times total, and this includes running the software on an old underpowered Windows Vista laptop and a tiny Windows 7 Dell Mini 10 netbook.  Corel has obviously worked on adding stability with this version, along with GPU optimizations.   Speed has been noticeably improved, the performance is considerably faster than previous versions, start-up time to launch the program for the first time has been improved, and these improvements are especially apparent when running PaintShop Pro X4 on an older slower computer.  When used on my 5-year old Windows Vista laptop with 2GB memory, applying most effects happens in real-time, and for some operations such as adjusting sharpening parameters on 100-MB TIFF image files, the pop-up preview window will still display a progress meter, but these progress meters only last for a few seconds on this older laptop of mine.   This new X4 version of PaintShop Pro now requires only 1GB of disk space.  The previous PaintShop Pro X3 version required 3GB of disk space, which tells me that prior to X4, PaintShop Pro had become very bloated and disorganized.  So this redesign both increased performance and reduced the disk space required.  By comparison, Adobe's latest Photoshop Elements 10 requires a whopping 3GB to 4GB of disk space, even though it has less features and effects than PaintShop Pro X4.   Competitive Pricing & Value:  Excellent 5-fuzzies rating   At the time of this review's writing, PaintShop Pro X4 Ultimate is being discounted on Amazon at a price less than $50, and its price is less than Amazon's price for Photoshop Elements 10, even though PSPX4 is a more capable and better program!   Fuzzy Wuzzy's Conclusion:  For overall bang-for-the-buck combination of very affordable value and feature-packed power in a commercial photo-editing software package, this PaintShop Pro X4 currently reigns supreme, beating out Adobe Photoshop Elements 10 and all other photo-editing software that I can think of.  If you want something even less expensive, look into a freeware graphics software called "GIMP" which offers a ton of graphics editing power for free.  And if you have no experience with graphics software or if you do not want to spend time learning its complexities, look into the free and easy-to-use software called "Paint. NET".  Despite the significant performance improvements in version X4 (I think that it is roughly 50% to 100% faster than X3 and also more stable), it still does have its slow areas of laggardly performance.  In particular, this is not a good software for processing RAW files, both due to its slow RAW converter and due to its limited RAW compatibility.  But now that Corel has repackaged Bibble Lab's "Bibble Pro" as their "AfterShot Pro" software, you should consider "AfterShot Pro" for your RAW file processing; Bibble had one of the fastest RAW converters and Corel acquired Bibble Labs to compete with Adobe's Lightroom.  If you want the deluxe photo management and editing solution, deluxe in capability, cost, and complexity, using Adobe's Lightroom and Photoshop CS are the way to go.  Otherwise, this PaintShop Pro X4 is an excellent "Photoshop for the masses" alternative.  If you primarily shoot in RAW, adding Corel's new AfterShot Pro allows for great RAW handling followed by photo editing in PaintShop Pro X4.  And if Corel's HDR feature in PaintShop Pro X4 has whetted your appetite for HDR processing, you should seriously consider getting Photomatix Pro (currently at version 4) since its capabilities exceed anything that Corel or Adobe has to offer.  If you are using a previous version of PaintShop Pro, is this PaintShop Pro X4 worth the upgrade?  Most definitely!  As previously mentioned, if version X4's one main new feature was the addition of HDR tools, I would say to just keep your existing X3 version and purchase Photomatix for your HDR needs since Photomatix is far better at HDR processing than what Corel, or Adobe, has as their HDR offering.  But there are at least 75 new and enhanced features with version X4, and if you can purchase it aggressively discounted on Amazon, this is a must-buy upgrade.  Even if you ignore all of its new features and enhancements, just the fact that X4 runs a lot faster and more stable than X3 is a compelling enough reason to upgrade.  If you are just starting out with photo-editing, should you buy this PaintShop Pro X4 or&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Adobe-Photoshop-Elements-10/dp/B005MMMT6E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Adobe Photoshop Elements 10</a>?  I feel that PaintShop Pro X4 is a far more capable and feature-rich program than Adobe Photoshop Elements 10.  PSPX4 is more like the full-blown Photoshop CS version than APE10.  APE10 includes more built-in layer styles that PSPX4 does not have, although if you are just starting out, you will not miss this.  Once you become proficient in PSPX4, you can create your own styles and record them as scripts to repeatedly reuse.  Photoshop Elements has a much larger user base than PaintShop Pro, and there are numerous sites to download brushes and textures from, but it is easy to convert Photoshop brushes to use in PSP, so that is not really a problem.  APE10 has more adjustment brushes than PSPX4 when it comes to brushing on effects like dodge, burn, and saturation.  But PSPX4 has more artistic tools than APE10, useful for painting, drawing, scrapbooking, and graphic design, and PSPX4 is more useful and flexible for manipulating images other than photos than APE10.  PSPX4 requires less than half the disk space to install than APE10, and at the time of this review's writing, Amazon has it priced lower than APE10, even though PSPX4 is far more packed with features.  But... if you think that you will eventually migrate up to Photoshop CS, which is far more complex, powerful, and expensive, then starting out with APE10 will give you skills that are more transferable to Photoshop CS than becoming proficient with PSPX4.  One final note:  Two of the extras that are included in this "Ultimate" bundle are couple codes that allow you to download 21 photos from Fotolia and receive a $33.95 discount off a photo book that you create from the Blurb.com Web site.  However, these coupon codes have expiration dates on them, and on the package that I received, the offers are only valid through December 31 2012.  I do not know if this expiration date applies to the coupon codes of all "Ultimate" packages that are shipped throughout 2012 or if Corel adjusts the expiration dates for packages that are shipped out later, but that is something to consider if you are deciding to purchase this near the end of 2012.  Also, during the past 8 months, Corel has released two important service pack patch updates for this PaintShop Pro X4.  After installing PaintShop Pro on your computer, you can either download these large 235-MB executables from Corel's Web site, or from the user interface, click 'Help' and "Check for Updates" to download and install the service packs that way.	1
Look, I'm supposed to review this stuff, despite the fact that I'm a relative goof when it comes to more complex software, but when I selected this, it was described as being not very complicated for new users. I'm sure that many of you who are looking to order this are in the market for something that does a little bit of everything when it comes to photo editing software.  Right now, this is just taking up space on my hard drive because it's just too complex for me and I don't have the time or energy to learn how to use it. I've just been using the more basic photo editing freeware from around the internet which have much more of a "point, drag, and click" sensiblility about them.  Basically I know that I'm not the ideal person they could have chosen to give this to, and I'm sure that for the more experienced users, this might be something ideal, but for me and other n00bs, PaintShop Pro X4 Ultimate will pwn you.	-1
It really took a great deal for Corel to pry my fingernails off my old version of PSP (PSP 7, when it was still being produced by JASC).  PSP has long been regarded as the poor man's photoshop and back in the mid 90's, the program was free. Registered copies where you could purchase plug-ins that were also inexpensive. Because I never liked Corel Draw, I had some very serious reservations about how well Corel would do after acquiring the product from JASC.  I have to confess, I was pleasantly surprised - mostly.  Corel's PSP 10  Ultimate is an affordable program. You can draw with it, retouch photos, and it includes tools that aid you in making your photos look like paintings with a minimum of time and effort. This was probably the main feature I did not want to part with.  The tabs for layers assist in the editing process.  The fact that there are so many tools and features can be a bit overwhelming.  Installation was fast and easy, and because I installed it to another HD, it did not destroy my ability to still use 7 if I wish.  I probably will never quite bring myself to stop using it from time to time.  Corel's new version of PSP be a bit slow, even on my Windows 7 machine with over a GB of RAM.  Still, Corel has managed to create a very affordable option as a graphics and photo enhancement program with a minimum of glitches from the last release.	1
If you have used PaintShop in the past, you will not be disappointed with this version. It has all of the standard features for picture editing that the product is famous for, plus many more for both the amateur and the professional. My personal needs in photo editing are small (resizing, lighting adjustment, red eye removal, etc.), and Corel does a great job with these basic editing tasks. Since I haven't used any of the advanced features, I don't feel qualified to comment on them at this time. For myself, I am glad to know that they are there if I need them, and will continue to look towards PaintShop as my photo editor of choice.	1
Corel PaintShop Pro has grown up along with the "gold standard" software programs, and at a significant savings.  For the amateur photographer who wants to manipulate, filter, crop and otherwise improve the appearance of their digital images - PaintShop Pro does the job with an easy and intuitive user interface.  Although I have the most current version of&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Adobe-Photoshop-Elements-10/dp/B005MMMT6E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Adobe Photoshop Elements 10</a>&nbsp;installed - most of the time I'm more likely to start up PaintShop Pro - it is not only as easy to use and contains many of the same features of it's twice-as-expensive cousin, the software doesn't take up a cumbersome amount of RAM - so the use is also usually much faster.	1
Dear Corel:  As a user of Paint Shop Pro since version 4.14 in the 1990s, I have long endorsed PSP as a great, alternative program to Photoshop for graphic artists on a budget. As of this version, I can no longer endorse this product.  Words cannot express how much I hate Paint Shop Pro X4. As I stare into the screen with multiple confusing tabs and screen-hogging image indexes, please know that only one thing remains certain: that I hate PSPX4 with every tired muscle in my graphic artist body. Until X3, the changes they made were minimal, and contributed to more and advanced features.  However, Corel has now ruined it by trying to simplify it for amateur photographers when they should be developing it for professional artists. It's impossible to tell if this is meant for photographers, graphic artists, scrapbookers or for coloring books. It's like all these multi-function "smart" devices-- they do a lot of things, but they don't do anything really well, and you have to become an expert on the device to get anything out of it. PSPX4 tries to be all things to all people and fails miserably.  Corel is also trying to pull one over by claiming to have new features that have been available in the program for years. Moving a feature around and calling attention to it does not make it new--it makes the company irritating, as well as making the program difficult to for long time users to find, and difficult for new users to learn in the first place. What was once a contender to compete against the mighty Photoshop is now a glorified app for removing red eye and endless tabs and indexes. X4 is finally showing the strain of executive meddling and has jumped the shark. I have spent more hours than I care to count trying to make X4 functional and have only emerged frustrated beyond all reason.  I would advise others to stick with X3 as well as earlier versions. If you must try this program, download the demo before making a financial commitment. Better yet, I would recommend users invest their time, money and effort in Photoshop, since Corel shows no interest in making a better graphics program and only wants to make a buck from an uninformed amateur photography base.  I will not stop using Photoshop until Corel comes to its senses and stops trying to overtake the plumbing. As it is, with PSPX4 it's too easy to stop up the drain. I have never given any version of PSP a bad review, which makes me hate PSPX4 that much more. PSPX4 is ultimately penny wise and pound foolish, but mostly I won't use it because I hate it so very, very much.  Yours, The Taminator	-1
I'm a Photoshop professional- I use Photoshop daily and have for many years. Most of what you can do here you can do in Photoshop, of course, but it's a lot harder to learn and the cost difference is phenomenal-- $40 vs $6-700! So my review will have some bias. That said, CPSPX4U is a delight. I won't run down the individual features as many others have done a great job describing them.  I can imagine a bit of a learning curve for someone who hasn't used any image editing software, but it's worth taking the time to learn. My advice to beginners is to explore. Open a copy of whichever photo you want to manipulate (ALWAYS work on copies- whichever program you're using!) and start trying each section. Within a section, explore the tools and within each tool, explore the variations you can use.  For the intermediate user, someone who has used other photo-editing software, I think you'll enjoy the different approaches you'll find in this application. Let yourself go wild and play. Work using a succession of copies, then toss the ones that don't work out and save the good variations.  For professionals who create digital art - I find using another program - even if you work primarily in Photoshop or Illustrator, is particularly helpful from a creative perspective. Sure, you can pretty much do everything in your main app, but I'm willing to bet you didn't think of many of these ideas- so having them in front of you is wonderful. We ALL get set in our ways -- working in a different application forces us to create with a different tool - and I believe you can't have enough tools at your disposal. I don't use secondary apps for the primary things I do in Photoshop as much as for the filters, layer effects, etc, available in another app. PaintshopProX4 Ultimate has a delightful range of filters and plugins. I find switching between Photoshop and Paintshop Pro (or Corel Paint) offers me the widest range of inspiration within my work. I recommend this app for all levels of users- you simply can't go wrong for the price.	1
I was forced to order Corel PaintShop Pro X4 when I reinstalled X2, and found out that Corel would not support it with necessary updates. A strike against Corel, as far as I am concerned.  I had a little difficulty with the new layout using tabs, but once I sorted through that and got used to it, I was able to do photo editing much as I had done on X2.  X4 does seem to load more quickly, but it sometimes freezes up on my HP 64 bit laptop running Windows 7 SP1, with 4 GB RAM and an Intel Core 2 Duo T6600 2.20 GHz. This is disappointing to me, as other programs run with no problem. I might add that X2 was also freezing up, and that was why that I had tried to reinstall it.  So far, I am satisfied with the overall performance of X4 for the things that I do. I have not tried any of the new features as of 02-22-2012.	1
Corel has trod a long and rocky road. Way back when, Corel was a pacesetter, its CorelDraw product at the head of the pack. The company was led by a flamboyant entrepreneur who, with his glamorous wife, were regulars on the local high society scene. They are long-gone from the company. Since the high-flying days, the company has lost its dominant position and sometimes struggled for survival. Product quality and customer service deteriorated and I, along with many others,  stopped buying or updating Corel products.   Along the way it acquired other brands, such as WordPerfect that had been managed even more poorly. Among them was a one-time shareware program called JASC PaintShop. At one time, PaintShop was actually a challenger to Adobe PhotoShop.  Corel also acquired a wonderfully innovative line of PhotoShop plug-ins known collectively as the KPT Collection.    Once sold independently, Corel has not updated KPT products to run with Windows 7 and current versions of PhotoShop.    They are offering the complete collection, however, as a part of PaintShop Pro X4 Ultimate. For the few dollars, because I wanted some of the KPT plug-ins, I ordered PaintShop Pro X4 Ultimate.    Nasty surprise #1: the KPT Collection is not included on the installation discs. You have to register the product after it is installed to get a link to download the KPT product. In my install, the registration page didn't appear, so I went to Corel's site and registered the product. The registration site is brain dead. There is a single field for the serial number, so I entered the 28 character code. Then they tell me I must use dashes. There is a word for web design like this: stupid. Tell me before hand to use dashes or give me fields for each 7 digit string.   No mention of KPT. So I go to tech support where I learn Corel generously provides me one tech support call for during my 90 day warranty period, before charging me $19 a question. There seems to be no provision on this page for email support. Uh, this kind of support is essentially worthless.    I did find a page to email them a question. After filling out a dozen or so fields, I hit the Submit button and it tells me the product must be registered in order for me to submit a question. I registered the product already! I try registering the product again and it tells me I have already registered the product.    Duh.    I check my account summary page and - surprise - the product is registered.    In other words, Corel has led me in a circle. I cannot get the KPT Collection without spending still more time with their brain dead website and support function.    Lemme see: what takes less time? Printing out an Amazon return label? Or going through this futile process again?    Guess which option I'm taking. With customer service like this, Corel is on the road to oblivion, regardless of how good a product like PaintShop Pro X4 Ultimate might be.  Jerry	-1
I gave this 4 stars because I haven't had a chance to learn most of the features yet, but as I said, so far so good. I wish there was an easy way to learn how to work the program... ie, a video course that comes with it. But alas, I guess I will have to sit down with the book and slog my way through. That's the other reason I only give it 4 stars. I'm sure the program itself is great; I just wish I could learn it quickly.	1
I am a 15-year Photoshop user, I love it and consider it second to none, and I will continue to use it as my primary photo editing software.  Having said that, I also have to admit that this is an incredibly rich program for the price. I was in a rush trying to get one of a limited number available during a cyber Monday promotion and I clicked to purchase before they were all gone. I thought I was getting Painter (which I've wanted to try for a while). I almost was going to return it when I started carefully reading what the program contains and what it can do. Curiosity got the best of me, and I'm glad.  While I don't find the interface especially intuitive--even if I wasn't used to a different workspace--I think that it can't be that difficult to learn. I'm impressed that it handles RAW files, that it had an HDR module, that it not only performs the basic image editing and color correction functions but it also does photo blending, skin smoothing, and noise removal, that it has text functions, works with layers and 16-bit images--really does a lot for the money!  Is it capable of doing everything at a top professional level? I don't think so. But it has enough power so that the average person's normal photograph with typical problems will very well processed with minimal effort.  Since I'm not familiar with Photoshop Elements, I'm not sure how these two programs would compare in either functionality, interface, or quality of output. I don't think that it can be said to compete with full Photoshop--but then it costs less than 1/10th what Photoshop costs! I'm also a bit of a control freak and I didn't find the level of control and fine tuning I'm used to. But I'm impressed with the number of functions and features that Corel has packed into this program.  Additionally, I've always wanted to get Nik Color Effects Pro plugin, and it comes included with this program. That, alone, is worth the purchase price. I can bring in any file saved in Photoshop and try any of the Nik effects or other effects that might be similar but different from what I have in my "serious" program. Then it has some fun frame process that creates a clip-art like embellishment for photos, cards, scrapbooking, or invitations (for some reason, they are called Picture Tubes). Not high art, but fun things you don't find in Photoshop. For the hobbyist, this is the better program.  All in all, it's a LOT of program for comparatively little money.	1
My use of the Corel VideoStudio product if fairly limited to just simple home movies, editing, and stitching video clips together. I never had the time to get to the more advanced capabilities. For those features that I used, I found the software quite easy to get started without having to resort to long reading of the instructions. Basically, I was able to finish the projects I started in a very satisfactory manner without investment of large amounts of time. The combination of good results and easy usage is important to me. The availability of advanced features is also important, if I ever get around to using them. Bottom line: Corel VideoStudio is a good product at a reasonable price.	1
This is the third software title we've purchased from Corel over the past couple years, and I'm very pleased with all of them.  To me, video production and editing are the most time consuming, the premium for me is ease of use.  No surprise that&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Corel-VideoStudio-Pro-X4-Ultimate-OLD-VERSION/dp/B005HTIWJ0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Corel VideoStudio Pro X4 Ultimate [OLD VERSION</a>] is simpler to use than its more complicated (and more advanced) Adobe counterparts. Some cool features: you can edit and assemble a Hi-Def production in Lo-Def format to avoid the lags Hi-Def can cause .... edit and preview in lo-def, when finished render a Hi-Def version.  Lots of 3-D features in this program,too ... it's conversion of 2D videos to 3D is better than you'd guess.  Easy to install and use, that's true.  And for me that makes it a winner.	1
I truly did wish to have the opportunity to test "Corel VideoStudio Pro X4 Ultimate", however, no matter how I tried it would not install to my HP Win Vista Laptop; each time an error 1935 window pops up and a suggestion to call help & support for more information. I subsequently made the point to read the EULA and, sure enough, there's an indication the program will not work w/Win Vista. So be it. And I am not happy, as others have noted regarding information obtained by "Corel" through use of the program.	-1
I thought VideoStudio Pro X4 was a pretty powerful video editor for the amateur video editor. It included features like playback speed adjustments, time lapse capabilities, stop motion animation, special effects, Mercalli video stabilization, conversion from 2D to 3D, music tracks, burning DVD & Blu-ray discs, easy exporting to Youtube, exporting to tablets and cell phone file formats, etc.  If you have used other video editors you may be able to jump right in without reading the manual, but in some cases I found that VideoStudio is not the most user friendly software. There is a 15 page Getting Started Guide as well as a 175 page User Guide included. There are 15 short tutorial videos included. I would note that if you do not like rap music you won't like watching the help videos because they all have rap music played in the background for the entire length of the video.  And I found the User Guide to be difficult at times too. The index is not very good. And as an example, I was wanting to work with titles. The index indicates shows that there is info on the title track on page 24--which just says that there is a title track. I found that there is a titles section on page 73, but that is not in the index. I skipped over to page 78 and read the information on applying title effects. It states that to apply title filters "click Filter and choose Title Effects in the Gallery drop-down menu."  However I didn't couldn't find how to click "Filter".  There was nothing on my screen or in the menus that had the word Filter. I had clicked on the "T" (Titles) and saw all the title choices in the top right corner, and I clicked on "Option" in the corner and saw more choices, but there not a Filter option visible. I had to go find a Youtube video that showed that you have to click on the Attribute tab in the Options in order to see the Filter option. If you want to learn how to go beyond the basics you may have to go watch a number of Youtube videos to see if you can find what you're looking for.  Another problem I had was that when I first got Video Studio Pro X4 I was using an Intel 2.6 ghz dual core CPU (which was faster than the "recommended system requirements").  One of the things I wanted to do was to make some splits in an mp4 video so that I could cut certain parts out.  But as I was playing the video, the video and sound would sometimes breakup, making it impossible to find the exact point to make the split. I was also unable to view the help videos, even though I had the latest version of Flash. Later I upgraded to an AMD quad-core 3.3 ghz CPU and have not had those problems again. I later found out (by watching one of the tutorial files that would not play earlier) that if you have a slower computer you can go to Settings and choose SmartProxy (which is not in the User Manual index).  In summary, there are a lot of powerful features and if you have used other video editors you may be able to jump right in.  If you're new to video editing you may find the learning curve a bit steep.	1
The software was easy to install and I got right to using it. I didn't have as much of an easy time ramping up my skill level to using it well, and I'm happy for the included manual which you don't see too often these days. The online help system is excellent, and Corel does a great job as usual of laying it out well.  Importing video is easy and the filters and other tools are intuitive to use. The only problem is you've got to have a bit of imagination to put all of these together but that's my problem not the software's. Export is the usual in any video app worth its salt: Youtube, etc. is supported. Needless to say, you're going to need a lot of memory, way more than what is recommended. Also, space. What I've done is edit on the PC and do the processing on it as well, but store the finished product on an external disk. I tried editing and processing with video files on an attached USB and it took forever. Good product, read the manual and experiment. Great HD capability, too. 4 stars.	1
I have some miserable software for moving video from the camcorder to computer and simple editing. This brings a lot more to the table. It took me awhile to master the editing concept (video is so much different from stills!) but now I enjoy putting things together. The OEM provided suites are so minimal and for me, hard to deal with. This is a lot more than stock and is helpful to put things together and add sounds, effects, transitions and so on. I'm definitely not an expert but it does do the job well for a novice like me. I guess it's time to upgrade the camcorder now!	1
My Significant other's review  "Product has a very limited number of editing features. It is even more limited in the number of video formats that it is capable of recognizing, rendering and editing. The user interface of the software is very confusing, non-user friendly and ultimately makes minimal sense as to its functional design and structure core. I rate this software as quite worthless. It is unworthy of the disc it is stored on. I would give this software a zero star rating if it were possible, but lucky for them the lowest I can give is a one star. However, I am going to surrender a fantastic one star rating. I am surrendering one star for the following reasons: The product gets zero stars for functionality, user interface etc. I give the product one star because the name is cool (VideoStudio Pro X4) and because the box is pretty"  My Review:  I did not recognize the formats we wanted, it was a pain in the rear to install, and it was quite frustrating to work your way around.  We also had freezing issues and problems with it locking up all three computers we had it installed on.  In the end we went back to our previous video software.  There are far better options available for all price ranges.	-1
I'm not a video expert, and certainly not a pro.  I am a grandmother, and I do have multiple digital video cameras though.  This program lets me do basic editing, accomplishing what I want to with videos.  I'll admit--it's pretty simple stuff, since we're simply using candid video footage for assembling family videos.  I'm sure the software can accomplish a lot more than I'll ever use it for, but it does what I want it to, without a lot of problems figuring out how to make it perform the way I want it to.  I also can't compare it to other software, as this is the only program I have used to edit videos.  I like it.  It works.	1
I have problems with some of Corel's software. Some of their programs freeze up and I have to shut down the whole computer to get going again. So far, I haven't had any problems with this version. I did delete out all other versions of any programs like this one so that may have solved the freezing part. I only do the basics with this at the moment. They have good instructions with it and I could probably learn to do better things but I don't have the patience. I wish I did because I feel like this program could be a lot of fun. It's certainly something that could keep you entertained for hours at a time. I do believe they have improved on their programs lately because I haven't come across any "bugs" which I sometimes do in these programs. I am well pleased with this version.	1
. I've spent about 30 hours with it and have made several amazon review videos. It can do lots of advanced things when you want. I found the interface confusing and non-standard. It took me 10 minutes to find "Help." My dislike of Corel was reinforced during the initial learning curve.  PROs:   - Very Affordable (at 30 bucks)  - Very few bugs so far  - Tons of capability for advanced editing  OKs:   - It sometimes freezes until you reposition the timeline window (Infrequent and easily worked around).  - The online help system usually solves your questions. Sometimes not.  - Lots of effects, but mostly cheesy. Not enough tasteful transitions, for example.  CONs:   - Interface does not follow Windows conventions. Quite frustrating at first.  ~~~ Comments & questions welcome ~~~	1
I'm the cameraman/videographer in the family, and after family vacations and holidays I get a real kick out of organizing the photos and video clips shot along the way into DVDs that can be shared.  My PC is several years old and large files slow it down to a snail's pace, but Corel VideoStudio lets me do everything I want to editing, formatting and recombining my clips.  If someone will remind me, I intend to write an addendum after I try the software out on the NEXT computer, which I hope will have the processing power to do all of the above at more than a snail's pace.	1
Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary:  Highly recommended with warm fuzzies!  I originally started using Corel's VideoStudio software beginning with version X2.  With this X4 version, Corel continues to add new features and useful enhancements, important bug fixes and crucial improvements to software stability, along with performance and speed boosts by taking advantage of Intel's and AMD's new CPUs and also GPU acceleration provided by specific Nvidia graphics processors.  One really cool performance feature offered by VideoStudio is that it has a "Smart Proxy" editing mode, where you can edit high-definition video in a low-resolution mode, thereby allowing you to use a slower computer without necessarily slowing down to a sluggish crawl.  These performance enhancements offer a huge advantage because many of us do not upgrade our computers frequently with the latest fastest CPU processors.  So some of the other brands of video editing software may be unbearably slow on these slower computers (even to the point of completely freezing up) while VideoStudio X4 can still zip along with a decent amount of responsiveness on slower computers.  Even though I do not like how Corel has organized the user interface layout for their PaintShop Pro X4 photo-editing software, I continue to like the changes and improvements that they have made to this VideoStudio X4.  I can resize, drag, dock, and undock various windows and UI elements to suit my workspace preferences and everything seems to behave intuitively.  But as with how Corel has designed their help system for PaintShop Pro X4 software, the one aspect of the VideoStudio X4 user interface that I really dislike is that to access the help menus, I am forced to hop through intermediate menus before it launches the online help from Corel's Web site using my browser.  With both PaintShop Pro X4 and VideoStudio X4, I now just bookmark the help information URLs and access them directly from my browser instead of clicking the cumbersome help button from within the application.  Even though the latest and most up-to-date online help information can be dynamically accessed directly from Corel's Web site when using this browser approach, I would still really prefer the previous approach of at least being given the option during the installation of the software to load the full help documentation on my computer's local hard drive since that also gives me the freedom to access the user manuals and help guides when I use the software without having Internet access.  I had fun using the new time-lapse photography feature.  I used a Canon Timer Remote Controller TC-80N3 to shoot a series of timer-delayed photos of the sun setting behind the mountains and another cool every-two-minutes photo series that I made last summer of a morning glory vine slowly opening up its blooms, and then I used the VideoStudio X4's time-lapse photography feature to create a video from both of these photo series that look like a sped-up time-lapse movie.  If both videos had been recorded as real-time videos, they would have been mind-numbingly boring to watch, but when sped up using the time-lapse feature, they allow everyday people like me to showcase the wonders of nature just like how the professional movies and television nature programs use time-lapse photography.  The software lets me use both standard definition and HD videos, and editing, authoring, and burning of both video types is easy.  The software is very flexible in importing videos from your hard drive or capturing them directly from your video recorders.  There are flexible options for viewing your files in different ways such as timeline or storyboard modes, which are useful for adding videos, pictures, text, audio and music tracks.  You can also trim or split your video into sections for better continuity, adding transitions and enhancing with many kinds of built-in effects.  Once you upload your video, you can trim and divide the video into clips.  Trimming is marking the beginning and ending of an entire clip, while multi-trimming is useful to divide one segment into multiple clips.  Multi-trimming is very useful for editing out various parts of a recorded video to exclude sections that are boring or extraneous.  This software's trimming functions are powerful and very easy to use, allowing me to feel like a Hollywood film director while I edit my videos to make them flow seamlessly between different scenes.  As with previous versions of VideoStudio, you can import photos to create a photo slideshow along with adding text and music accompaniment.  The software is very flexible for adding music or audio voiceovers to your video projects from a variety of sources.  You can add audio to your projects in Corel VideoStudio X4 using various methods such as adding audio files to the library from your hard drive, ripping music from a CD, or recording a voiceover clip.  You can edit the audio clips using a built-in sound mixer to adjust the volume, length and duration, fade-in/fade-out, and apply various mixing and sound filter effects to the audio tracks.  The video editor does limit you to six overlay video tracks along with your main video track, combined with up to two title tracks, a voice track, and three music tracks.  While this is less than some video-editing software that lets you incorporate many dozens of tracks, it is more than sufficient for the vast majority of everyday users (like me) who mainly work with personal videos and it is sufficient even for editing important events like videos of weddings and vacations.  After you have finished editing your video masterpiece, you can export in a variety of common formats including FLV files for YouTube, MPG (MPEG-1/MPEG-2), AVCHD, WMV HD, Windows Media, RealMedia, AVI, and QuickTime.  You also have the option to upload your work to Vimeo, Facebook, Flickr, and YouTube.  The software can create menus for DVD, Blu-ray, AVCHD, and it offers eight Blu-ray and twelve DVD menu choices.  This X4 version also adds new 3D video capabilities.  Even though I admit that I am a 3D video editing newbie, this feature seems limited and fairly rudimentary in its 3D rendering options, but it can create some pretty cool eye-popping 3D effects and is easy to use.  This will NOT get you the kind of 3D video that Hollywood can create, but it does add another dimension of "eye candy Wow factor" to your videos...  Just don't expect to create your own version of an "Avatar 3D" movie.  3D glasses are included with the software.  The "Ultimate" extras that are included in this software consist of proDAD Mercalli SE video correction/stabilization software and Boris Graffiti 5.3 for text/title/graphics animation and 3D effects.  The proDAD Mercalli SE video correction/stabilization software really makes a noticeable difference to stabilize and remove the shake from my videos, which I mostly shoot hand-held.  This is a big complex software application that really requires some patience for you to slowly become more familiar with all of its features and power.  But its user interface is cleanly designed so that newbie first-timers can start editing their videos with ease without fully mastering all of its powerful features.  Fortunately, Corel also provides plenty of online help along with easy-to-use templates and more than 60 really cool special effects and more than 150 transition effects to let you experiment and try out many of its flexible options so even video-editing newbies can create a polished slick video with ease.  The software uses a nondestructive editing approach so that your original video file is not being directly modified along the way.  This also allows you to experiment, even trying out wacky ideas and special effects, turning a tedious chore into a fun playtime of creating video eye candy.  Back when I was using VideoStudio X2, the software had various erratic and quirky bugs and serious stability issues; it can be disheartening to have the software freeze up after you have spent more than an hour editing a video.  Many of these problems have thankfully been resolved in this version X4; not once did I encounter a freeze-up or crash during my edits using X4.  When used on an older slower Windows Vista laptop of mine, the software can be sluggishly slow sometimes, but I prefer dealing with slower performance on a slower computer than having to deal with annoying software bugs and applications that freeze up or crash on me, so I accept the fact that I have to wait longer when using VideoStudio X4 on a slower laptop that is more than four years old.  As with any video editing software, especially when editing HD videos, your best experience will result from using a fast computer with lots of memory.  While this VideoStudio X4 lacks some of the features and has more track-editing limitations when compared to both CyberLink PowerDirector and Adobe Premiere, I think that it beats those two when it comes to multi-trim clip editing, key framing, and its best-in-class stop-motion and time-lapse animation capabilities.  And VideoStudio X4 is far easier and more intuitive to learn for a newbie compared to Adobe Premiere's dense complexity.  If this software was priced at $300, I would rate it 4 stars or maybe 3.5 stars, but with its inexpensive list price and Corel's frequent heavy pricing discounts, I rate it 5 stars because you really do get a lot of video editing bang for the buck here.  And if you are not technically adept, have some patience as you familiarize yourself with the software.  Also, Corel has released two important service pack patch updates for VideoStudio Pro X4.  After installing VideoStudio Pro on your computer, you can either download these large executable files from Corel's Web site, or from the user interface, click 'Help' and "Check for Updates" to download and install the service packs that way.	1
This video software is a good starter, but I have used better software for video editing. I think this software is very user friendly, so if you have used windows movie maker, then you can use this with no problem. I don't think this software has any special features like other software does, so it's not confusing at all. I think this is good for your basic home movie maker that wants to throw in some titles and picture in with the video editing, so this software is pretty good for the money.	1
It's a great deal for what you get. The product itself can make any video look more professional. It's also a better deal for someone who is more into the amateur video editing and production rather than someone who needs it professionally. It comes with plenty of preloaded templates and effects that can be edited to suit your needs. Like the pixilization feature. You can set to pixel size and the size of what you need to block. Then there aren't any alpha channels or track mat to mess with like in Adobe's software. It makes things easy for the beginner to mid range user. You just have to key frame the effect set the size and just make sure its moving in conjunction with your video the way you want it to. This goes with almost any effect. It has two video layers for potential video overlay along with a Text track for text effects and two audio tracks one for music and one for speech. It's really the perfect little piece of software for the average user. It comes with 3D simulation software which I had not had the opportunity to test since I have no need for it so I cannot vouch for the quality. Either way, it does everything I'd expect for editing my videos and then some. Perfect.	1
I am really pleased with this video editing package from Corel. I have used it to create great "home movies" of my family (especially the grandchildren), and I like that I can add professional touches (or, at least, my version of professional, which is still very amateur!) My favorite is adding soundtracks using my favorite music.  My granddaughter has also used the software to create a short, stop-motion movie. We all thought it was great! It is a good product that allows young people to be creative, with just enough bells and whistles to be effective, without being overly complicated and too technical!  VideoStudio installed easily, and, so far, has not given me any system problems. Its a very, very good product at a great price. I was not happy to read the information about the Protexis spyware, though, so I am going to follow the instructions in the comments which detail how to remove that.  (Shame on you, Corel, for going too far and not respecting your customers' privacy. It will definitely make me think twice before buying another Corel product.) This review is about the video editing product, not Corel's business ethics, so the 4 stars reflects what I think of this software. They get zero stars for their ethics!	1
Corel has some serious privacy issues.  As in, if you use their products, they invade your privacy.  I can understand them wanting to prevent software piracy, but I don't like the way they go about it.  1) In their EULA (the license you have to agree to in order to install) they tell you straight up that they will audit your usage of the software.  They will send back data about how you use the software, your IP address, etc.  If you don't agree, you can't install the software.  I don't really agree, but I wanted to see what they had to offer, so I installed it on a virtual machine that I gave no Internet access to.  This means I can't get updates, but it also means my computer won't be sending them information about what I'm doing (does this not sound like a minor version of spyware to you?)  2) The EULA also says that Corel is not responsible for any damages to your computer that may occur by using this software.  It's good (for them) that they put that in there, because in order to accomplish #1 (above) they install "Protexis Licensing V2" software which seems to destabilize my computer.  Not horribly, but enough to notice and that's still too much.  3) The EULA also states that some features are not fully compatible with Windows Vista and they don't intend to fix those issues.  If you have Vista and (for whatever reason) don't want to go to Windows 7, you may have issues (I'm assuming Win7 is not a problem since they only mention Vista...)  Gee, it would have been nice to have told us that up front, rather than burying it in the EULA, don't you think?  If Corel would get rid of their system-destabilizing spyware and allow the user to opt-in and out of anonymous information gathering, then my review would be much better.  The presence of Protexis, however, forces me to remove 4 full stars.  Yeah--it's that important to me.  The software itself seemed OK, but I really didn't play with it that much because I was really just eager to remove the spyware from my system.  If a future version is released without Protexis being installed, then I'll give it a whirl and I suspect I'll rather like it.  For now, I'll stick with Adobe Premier Pro, Roxio VideoWave and Pinnacle Studio.  If you are already using Corel software, then you probably already have Protexis installed.  If this doesn't bother you, then go ahead and try this software out.  What little I saw of it seemed as good as my other video editing suites. For the rest of us...  NOT RECOMMENDED.	-1
Video editing is not my cup of tea.  I typically avoid it, not because I don't understand it, but because I just don't have the time.  I want to shoot the video and watch it.  Unlike photo editing (which I love to do), video editing always seemed tedious.  Splicing together clips seems painful to me. Enter Corel VideoStudio Pro.  Now I am not going to say that this program changed my mind about editing, but I will say it made the task interesting.  From the beginning VideoStudio made it simple to organize, cut, and splice clips.  I found the tool intuitive and am willing to dive deeper into it's functions.  So if you are like me and don't like editing your video clips, try VideoStudio it might chenge your opinion of the whole process. Also, my kids love goofing arounf making funny movies from various clips (they are 8 & 12).  They were able to pick up on it with only a couple of lessons from me.	1
I have been making home videos for years. I used VideoStudio 7, 9, X1, X2 plus, X3 Plus, and now X4 Ultimate. I also tried digital video softwares from Pinnacle, Roxio, Adobe Premiere. However, Corel software beats them for stability and easy of use. The Adobe Premiere is a great software, but it's overwhelming and overkill for most of us. In general, Corel's VideoStudio is less frustrating than any other softwares.  From product line point of view, Corel VideoStudio has all the basics, not a lot of bells and whistles that are hard to learn. The basic functions are easy to use and intuitive. You use the timeline to place video clips, then add transitions, background music, titles. After you are done, it can be easily exported to YouTube, FaceBook, Flicker...etc. Or you can burn your own DVD, or Blu-Ray disks.  Once a while, bad batch did occur (like Microsoft's Vista), the VideoStudio X3 was slow and crashed a lot. The VideoStuido X4 has significantly improvements. It integrates the disk authoring tool. So I don't need to run separate tool to burn DVD or Blu-ray disk. Also, VideoStudio X4 is extremely stable....I haven't run into any crash after several home video projects.  However, editing HD videos requires a very very powerful CPU, this is especially true if you are dealing with the highly compressed AVCHD videos. My system configuration is: Core i7 processor, 12 GB ram, Window 7 64-bit, 1GB video card, two SATA-2 drives. I have no problem to advance AVCHD videos frame by frame for precise editing, or to fast forward AVCHD videos for quick preview...etc. Also, the rendering time is fast. During rendering, my CPU usage can go up to 90%. If you feel frame drop, out-of-sync between audio and video, color bleaching, software is slow to response to mouse clicking, video editing process is not smooth...etc, before blaming VideoStudio software, you may want to check your hardware system first.  Here is one trick I learned from Video Magazine. While running the VideoStudio with you main hard drive (like C-drive), you should put all video files (both the video input files and video output files) in a separate hard drive. Doing so can ensure a better system performance. With my system, if I put all the video files in the C-drive where the main program resides, from time to time, the VideoStudio program will still hang (not response to your mouse) for couple of second (not crash). This hanging problem goes away once I put all videos files at a separate hard drive.  So far, I have done 4 home videos and created 4 AVCHD disks. I am very happy with the latest VideoStudio X4.  By the way, they don't include the bonus winZip pro software in the package. You have to download the winZip pro software from their web site. But the provided key does not work with the download winZip pro. I take 1 point out due to this.	1
I upgraded from Corel Visual Sudio X3 to see how they had improved the program. I find this to be a worthy upgrade, well worth the money. The program makes it simple to create very nice looking video projects. It may take a bit of time for a new user to master the controls, but for anyone already used to the Corel studio programs, the transition will be effortless.  It would be impossible to teach someone how to use the program in an Amazon review, so here are the basics of how it works. The Studio allows one to import files from a camera (or open them from a disk file, which is my preferred method). Then you drag the video clips from the "library" (a space on the screen where the files are listed) to a "timeline", which is an area that will allow the user to view each individual frame of the film. Dragging another clip puts it after the first (or before or wherever desired), thus creating the film. Below the film one can drag in clips (for a picture in picture effect), Titles, voice overs, and music clips. With time and patience (learning the software), even a novice can produce good video clips. The software comes with a lot of sample clips, as well as video effects, sounds, and title effects. After the project looks good inside the program, there are various ways to "share" the video - create a disk, upload to web, export to a mobile device, etc. I have only used the disk create option, to put out videos of my family vacations and school plays.  The help documentation is on line, and works nicely. I found it to be descriptive and useful.  The "Burn Disc" options has been updated. I had a bit of trouble figuring out how to get the menus right, but it actually is far more powerful than before, if a bit harder to use.  New Features:  - Unlike X3, which had fixed areas of the screen, this version allows one to change the size and location of each of the various panels (like the timeline or preview area), to allow for use over a larger area. This is great for dual screens, like I have. It really frees up the workspace and makes this version much better to use if one has the displays available (and dual screens are best for any kind of video project). It took me a couple of minutes to figure out how to set everything back to the previous view (it's under the Settings / Layout Settings menu); if one wants to drag those windows back into a single monitor, there is no "snap back" to allow one to see the various panels - they overlay each other. But that is not a big problem.  - The library panel (which contains all the raw video, audio, and pictures for the project) now has the capabilities to be organized by sub-folders, and has quick settings to filter out certain media types. The effect is that it is much easier to find the desired file in the library.  - Time lapse. Provided you have the pictures taken over a period of time, you can put all the pictures in a directory and easily have the program combine them into a single sequence, which can be saved into a video for viewing. It is fairly basic, with only a couple of options, but it does provide a fast way to get multiple picture sequences into the program, which can then be used in the project.  - An enhanced audio mixer view allows more capability in editing and adjusting the sounds of the video, including the capability to control surround sound.  - Stop motion production allows the user to connect to a video camera and capture the images from the stop motion project directly into the program, either manually or at a time interval. This would make it simpler to create a stop motion video from a laptop. It is also possible to import the images instead of taking them in real time.  - Save files in zip format from directly inside the program. This makes it nice when transferring files.  - You can export the project as a template, which means that the next time you need to do a similar project, you can use that template to quickly replicate the environment. This is very useful for me because I do a lot of the same format for my kids school plays.  About the only drawback I find with the program is that it will take a while to master for the new user; because of the powerful capabilities of the program, there are a lot of options. But that is just the way this sort of software works.  Highly recommended for the home video producer.	1
I'm using this software with my Canon Vixia HF10 and it has yet to disappoint me.  The software creates high quality 720p and 1080p video and the editing options are endless.  The biggest draw for me is the ability to transition from one scene to another using transitions and the video not freezing, but still staying in motion.  You have the option of adding video, sound, images, transitions, effects, music, etc. The entire software is easy to navigate and use, but it does use quite a bit of resources so a good, solid PC is necessary to get the job done.  The different formats you can use to create videos are numerous. You can create BluRay videos, DVDs, CDs, YouTube Videos, Vimeo Videos and more.  This is the only software I've been able to find that can handle Canon's MKV files which makes it worth it in that right alone.  I don't think anyone using this software for amateur editing will be disappointed.	1
I picked this up because I am working on my M.Ed. in Instructional Technology and knew that I would need some higher ranking software for photo and video editing than the free stuff on the internet and what came with my camera. Admittedly I have not used every filter and do-dad in this kit, but as an average Joe, looking for something to one up Windows Video editor and such, this did the trick.  While we worked with Adobe products in class, I found that this boxed set contained just what I needed and much easier to understand processes than Adobe. I found myself looking up tutorials left and right for Photoshop, but could wing-it with the Corel software. If I needed a tutorial, there were plenty on YouTube for free as well as great tips on the software itself. For the price difference I found this very affordable and it did what I needed.  If you aren't a professional, but want something better than the standard computer software for photo and video editing, then I would recommend this as a go-to tool in you home office.	1
Both products are great products.  I use the Video Pro all the time to edit clips out of my movies and/or to change the format that they are in.  The bundle is way more cost effective than in buying each individually.  If you have a need for photo and video editing software, this easy to use combo is a good start to learning the basics and improving/changing your various digital media.  4 stars.	1
I had some issues w/ the install and randomly when I do use the software it occasionally freezes and stalls causing me to reboot the PC.  As for the software, I was mainly trying to use it for video editing because I prefer using Photoshop as a photo editor. For someone new to the video editing side, it was relatively simple to use.  If others aren't having the freeze problems then I would recommend the product, as maybe my case was just a singular incident.	1
Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary:  Highly recommended with warm fuzzies!   Design & Features:  Excellent 5-fuzzies rating  Ergonomics & Usability:  Average not-good not-bad 3-fuzzies rating  Performance, Stability & Reliability:  Excellent 5-fuzzies rating  Competitive Pricing & Value:  Excellent 5-fuzzies rating   Positives:   Many stability and performance issues from the previous X3 versions of both PaintShop Pro and VideoStudio Pro were resolved in this X4 version. It runs noticeably quicker, even on slower 5-year old laptops and small netbooks, with good stability.  PaintShop Pro X4 offers a very wide range of tools for both photo editing and graphic design, ranging from serious photography-specific tools to fun graphics manipulation.  PaintShop Pro X4 combines photo editing, photo retouching, painting, drawing, graphics design, and image management in a single package.  PaintShop Pro X4 has a great selection of photo enhancement tools, both to fix common photography issues and also more esoteric image manipulation tools.  PaintShop Pro X4 includes Web graphics tools for image mapping and slicing, and for coding image rollovers and Web button creation.  Very affordable, yet very powerful, for both photo and video editing; currently selling on Amazon at a heavily discounted pricing of less than $90.  A very useful "Learning Center" and video tutorials help newbies learn the software and accomplish common tasks.  The PaintShop Pro X4 user interface is divided into three tabs, "Manage", "Adjust", "Edit", providing a usable workflow from initial photo review to final editing, and allowing you to configure, customize, and save how you use each workspace. You can also customize each toolbar individually.  VideoStudio Pro's "Smart Proxy" editing mode lets you can edit high-definition video in a low-resolution mode, thereby allowing you to use a slower computer without necessarily slowing down to a sluggish crawl.  VideoStudio Pro has a new time-lapse photography feature to create time-lapse movies from a set of photos shot over a period of time.  The included proDAD Mercalli SE video correction/stabilization for use in VideoStudio Pro X4 works wonderfully to stabilize and remove the shake from hand-held videos.   Negatives:   Even though the new HDR "Exposure Merge" tool in PaintShop Pro X4 is a great start, the tool is not always precise at aligning objects between bracketed shots and it is especially lacking in deghosting; both problems can arise from either camera movement or movement of objects in the scene.  PaintShop Pro X4 has limited RAW file processing capabilities and compatibilities compared to Adobe Lightroom, but Corel now intends for RAW handling to be better addressed in their new AfterShot Pro software.  Despite being more uncluttered and streamlined than the previous X3 version's user interface, the "Edit" tab of the new PaintShop Pro X4 user interface, which serves as the main workhorse for serious image editing, is still somewhat cluttered and disorganized, with overlapping functions and ambiguous groupings of tools, and this impacts the ergonomics and usability of the software, especially for new users.  For the graphics newbie who has no previous experience using graphics software, there is a medium-to-high learning curve effort required to learn how to proficiently use the PaintShop Pro software. This software is not specifically designed for simple image manipulation by novices. If you are initially learning this software, you should start off just using the "Adjust" tab and not use the "Edit" tab; the "Adjust" tab is simplified and suitable to novices whereas the "Edit" tab is meant for power users.  As with some of Corel's other recent products, accessing the help documentation for both PaintShop Pro and VideoStudio Pro requires access to Corel's online Web site for information, instead of being able to access all help documentation locally on my computer directly from within the application.  What is in the box package of "Corel Photo and Video Pro X4 Ultimate Bundle"?   2 PaintShop Pro software CDs (for Windows 7/Vista/XP)  1 VideoStudio Pro software CD (for Windows 7/Vista/XP)  3D glasses  Leaflet with WinZip Pro compression software download instructions and activation code.  Leaflet with Blurb.com coupon code for a $33.95 discount off a photo book that you create from the Blurb.com Web site.  Leaflet with Fotolia coupon code that may be used to download 21 photos from that site.  PaintShop Pro X4 User Guide  VideoStudio Pro X4 User Guide  VideoStudio Pro X4 "Getting Started" Guide  This affordably-priced bundle essentially consists of two separate Corel products: PaintShop Pro X4 and VideoStudio Pro X4. In addition, the "Ultimate" extras that separate it from their non-Ultimate counterparts include: Nik Color Efex Pro 3.0 photographic filters, extra "Picture Tube" images for use in PaintShop Pro, proDAD Mercalli SE video correction/stabilization for use in VideoStudio Pro, Boris Graffiti 5.3 for text/title/graphics animation and 3D effects, and coupons for WinZip software, Blurb.com photo book, and 21 free image downloads from Fotolia's Web site. If you are really only interested in either PaintShop Pro X4 or VideoStudio Pro X4, but do not want both products, you can just purchase either product in their separate "Ultimate" packaging.  I have always been a fan of PaintShop Pro throughout the 1990s and I have often kept updating PSP versions after Corel acquired its original developer, JASC Software, in 2004, even though I also have been updating versions of CorelDRAW Graphics Suite starting from CorelDRAW 5. Along with recently releasing the new&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Corel-AfterShot-Pro/dp/B006WVR9GY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Corel AfterShot Pro</a>&nbsp;this year (after Corel acquired Bibble Labs and repackaged their "Bibble Pro" as "AfterShot Pro") and also the newly updated&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/CorelDRAW-Graphics-Suite-X6/dp/B007IWCQ8W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">CorelDRAW Graphics Suite X6</a>, which includes Corel's original photo-editor called "Photo-Paint", Corel now has three photo applications which have some overlapping functions and also unique abilities of their own. As a photo management application, AfterShot Pro is meant to complement PaintShop Pro and compete against Adobe Photoshop Lightroom. PaintShop Pro remains my favorite "Photoshop for the non-professional-graphics masses" application, being more feature-packed and capable like Photoshop CS than Adobe's own&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Adobe-Photoshop-Elements-10/dp/B005MMMT6E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Adobe Photoshop Elements 10</a>.  Even though my video-editing skills rank far behind my photo-editing and graphics design skills, I started using Corel's VideoStudio Pro software when it was at version "X2". The VideoStudio Pro X4 version that is included in this software bundle offers powerful video editing with great stop-motion and time-lapse animation capabilities. But as with the PaintShop Pro photo software, you need plenty of patience to progressively learn all of its features.  The Corel Photo and Video Pro X4 Ultimate Bundle's notable product features are described and rated below:   Design & Features:  Excellent 5-fuzzies rating:   After Corel acquired JASC Software, they have been adding new features with each release, and even though this version runs and feels slower than earlier versions of PSP, I feel that it is a fair trade-off to allow the code bloat due to the number and complexity of features to slow the software down. With this latest X4 version, I get a powerful set of photo and graphics editing tools that is more useful than Photoshop Elements 10. PaintShop Pro X4 pales in comparison to the power of the full-blown Photoshop CS, but with its significantly lower pricing and learning curve compared to Photoshop CS, it is obviously meant to compete against software like Photoshop Elements, which it handily outperforms.   This "Ultimate" version of PaintShop Pro X4 adds even more power and value by including the award-winning Nik Color Efex Pro 3.0 photographic filters, which includes 52 photographic filters that can be applied to images to give them special effects. Also included in this Ultimate version is a collection of "Picture Tubes", which are thematic collections of graphics that can be painted onto an image to add more bling to your images, frames, and borders.   To help you navigate through the plethora of PaintShop Pro tools and effects, a very useful 'Effect Browser' lets you try out the various effects, instead of accessing each effect one by one.   PaintShop Pro includes tools that are very friendly to use by newbies such as 'One Step Photo Fix', 'Smart Photo Fix', and 'One Step Noise Removal'.   The new PaintShop Pro HDR (High Dynamic Range) "Exposure Merge" tool is Corel's foray into HDR software, which Adobe and other graphics software vendors are also incorporating into their tools. HDR processing involves combining multiple exposures of the exact same shot (which is easier if your camera has an Automatic Exposure Bracketing (AEB) function) to create a high dynamic range photo which can display a higher tonal range than what the camera is capable of capturing in a single exposure. There are various software specifically dedicated to HDR processing. For the past four years, since version 3 in 2008, I have been using the excellent&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Photomatix-Pro-4/dp/B002CIP12U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Photomatix Pro 4</a>&nbsp;software for HDR processing. On a relative scale specifically rating its HDR functions, I would rate Photomatix 5 fuzzy stars while this PaintShop Pro X4's new HDR "Exposure Merge" tool only gets 3 fuzzy stars rating. Both Corel and Adobe still have a long way to catch up with the powerful and flexible offerings in Photomatix. In particular, I found the "Exposure Merge" tool in this version of PaintShop Pro X4 to be lacking in its ability to precisely align bracketed photos and thoroughly and flexibly remove ghosting artifacts, which is something that Photomatix does a very good job at. If you use a tripod-mounted camera to shoot bracketed photos where nothing in the scene moves the least bit, then the "Exposure Merge" tool consistently outputs good HDR results. But when shooting portraits or landscapes, or shooting hand-held, bracketed photos often have misaligned objects and/or moving objects in the shots. Even bracketed portrait shots of a person using a tripod can result in tiny movements by the person that require excellent alignment and deghosting by HDR software, and Photomatix currently beats PaintShop Pro's "Exposure Merge" tool in this area. PaintShop Pro's "Exposure Merge" tool frequently has ghosting artifacts leftover either from movement of the camera by the photographer or movement of objects in the scene. This ghosting is especially evident in scenes such as landscapes where various plants may be moving in the breeze or portraits where the subject has slightly moved in between each bracketed shot.  Photomatix also includes a plethora of other tone mapping, image stacking, and on-the-fly editing adjustments, including being able to define specific areas of photos to deghost and specific areas of photos where I can use the original image instead of the HDR output. I use these Photomatix functions a lot because I always aim for very natural-looking HDR images, instead of the surreal psychedelic HDR images that are, all too often, output by people. HDR software can be abused to create unnatural over-saturated photos that become tiresome to look at. Using Photomatix on an image of people set against a beautiful background landscape, I can tell the software to use an original un-HDR'ed exposure of a photo for the people's faces while letting the software HDR-process the rest of the landscape, and this is very useful to me because HDR-processed skin tones can sometimes look unnatural. PaintShop Pro's "Exposure Merge" tool cannot perform these functions that I described. So a good HDR workflow would be to HDR-process your bracketed photos first using Photomatix, and then further edit the HDR output in PaintShop Pro, perhaps performing some sharpening as the last step before saving the files.   The new PaintShop Pro "Photo Blend" tool lets you merge the best aspects of multiple photos into one photo by removing, swapping, or adding details to the final combined photo. This is often used for group shots when you have some people with eyes open and some with eyes closed, or to remove distracting objects from a static scene such as cars and other strangers in the background, but this can also be used for fun creative purposes as well. As with the new "Exposure Merge" HDR tool, this is ideally used with identically composed photos that were all shot from a tripod or a very steady hand.   The new PaintShop Pro "Selective Focus" tool is pretty fun to work with, letting you simulate the effect of tilt-shift lenses (e.g. Lensbaby) by selectively blurring areas. This is also somewhat similar to simulating a shallow depth of field when using a large aperture setting on a camera lens to get a blurry bokeh background surrounding your main subject of focus.   A new PaintShop Pro "Fill Light" filter lets your brighten shadow areas in photos and a separate "Clarity" filter lets you sharpen or soften subtle details in a photo. These two filters, presented together as a single tool, can be used, for example, on a portrait to brighten a dark shadowed region of the face while selectively softening the wrinkles on the person's face for portraits shot in the harsh bright glare of mid-day sun.   Although Corel hopes that users perform RAW conversion using their new AfterShot Pro software (which was formerly "Bibble Pro" before Corel acquired Bibble Labs), PaintShop Pro still includes its "Camera RAW Lab" for RAW conversion, and this X4 version adds new highlight recovery options to recover details in overexposed regions of a photo.   PaintShop Pro has built-in one-click photo sharing that lets you upload photos to either Facebook or Flickr, or send via email. Likewise, VideoStudio Pro lets you upload movies to YouTube.   I had fun using VideoStudio Pro's new time-lapse photography feature. I used a Canon Timer Remote Controller TC-80N3 to shoot a series of timer-delayed photos of the sun setting behind the mountains and another cool every-two-minutes photo series that I made last summer of a morning glory vine slowly opening up its blooms, and then I used the VideoStudio Pro X4's time-lapse photography feature to create a video from both of these photo series that look like a sped-up time-lapse movie. If both videos had been recorded as real-time videos, they would have been mind-numbingly boring to watch, but when sped up using the time-lapse feature, they allow everyday people like me to showcase the wonders of nature just like how the professional movies and television nature programs use time-lapse photography.   VideoStudio Pro lets me use both standard definition and HD videos, and editing, authoring, and burning of both video types is easy. The software is very flexible in importing videos from your hard drive or capturing them directly from your video recorders. There are flexible options for viewing your files in different ways such as timeline or storyboard modes, which are useful for adding videos, pictures, text, audio and music tracks. You can also trim or split your video into sections for better continuity, adding transitions and enhancing with many kinds of built-in effects. Once you upload your video, you can trim and divide the video into clips. Trimming is marking the beginning and ending of an entire clip, while multi-trimming is useful to divide one segment into multiple clips. Multi-trimming is very useful for editing out various parts of a recorded video to exclude sections that are boring or extraneous. This software's trimming functions are powerful and very easy to use, allowing me to feel like a Hollywood film director while I edit my videos to make them flow seamlessly between different scenes.   As with previous versions of VideoStudio, you can import photos to create a photo slideshow along with adding text and music accompaniment. The software is very flexible for adding music or audio voiceovers to your video projects from a variety of sources. You can add audio to your projects in Corel VideoStudio Pro X4 using various methods such as adding audio files to the library from your hard drive, ripping music from a CD, or recording a voiceover clip. You can edit the audio clips using a built-in sound mixer to adjust the volume, length and duration, fade-in/fade-out, and apply various mixing and sound filter effects to the audio tracks. The video editor does limit you to six overlay video tracks along with your main video track, combined with up to two title tracks, a voice track, and three music tracks. While this is less than some video-editing software that lets you incorporate many dozens of tracks, it is more than sufficient for the vast majority of everyday users (like me) who mainly work with personal videos and it is sufficient even for editing important events like videos of weddings and vacations.   After you have finished editing your video masterpiece in VideoStudio Pro, you can export in a variety of common formats including FLV files for YouTube, MPG (MPEG-1/MPEG-2), AVCHD, WMV HD, Windows Media, RealMedia, AVI, and QuickTime. You also have the option to upload your work to Vimeo, Facebook, Flickr, and YouTube. The software can create menus for DVD, Blu-ray, AVCHD, and it offers eight Blu-ray and twelve DVD menu choices. This X4 version also adds new 3D video capabilities. Even though I admit that I am a 3D video editing newbie, this feature seems limited and fairly rudimentary in its 3D rendering options, but it can create some pretty cool eye-popping 3D effects and is easy to use. This will NOT get you the kind of 3D video that Hollywood can create, but it does add another dimension of "eye candy Wow factor" to your videos. Just don't expect to create your own version of an "Avatar 3D" movie. 3D glasses are included with the software.   The "Ultimate" version of VideoStudio Pro X4 includes proDAD Mercalli SE video correction/stabilization software that really makes a noticeable difference to stabilize and remove the shake from my videos, which I mostly shoot hand-held.   Ergonomics, Usability & Ease of Use:  Average not-good not-bad 3-fuzzies rating   The PaintShop Pro user interface now features three separate, yet integrated, workflow interfaces, designated by tabs across the top of the program window: "Manage", "Adjust", "Edit". The "Photo Organizer" in previous versions is now replaced by an "Organizer" palette which is available from all three workflow tabs.   The PaintShop Pro "Manage" tab is where you browse, review, and rate images, edit metadata, and create collections of photos. This workspace lets you review and organize your photo files. Using the navigation palette, you can select an entire photo folder on your computer, narrow the selection according to one or more tags that you have assigned to photos, or narrow the selection according to the ratings that you have assigned to photos. The palette also shows basic EXIF information about a photo.   The PaintShop Pro "Adjust" tab is where you can make photo adjustments using a subset of the most common tools such as sharpening, color balance, brightness/contrast, fill light, clarity, tone mapping, noise removal, cropping, straightening, red-eye removal, or using its various built-in touch-up tools. Edits can also be applied to batches of files. This tab only offers a portion of the tools that are all available from the "Edit" tab. Its interface is cleaner and far less busy than the "Edit" tab, and because of its simpler layout, it makes an ideal interface for beginning users who are just starting to learn the software.   The PaintShop Pro "Edit" tab includes all of the entire sets of tools for photo editing, drawing, painting, and graphic design work. By contrast, the "Adjust" tab offers only a subset of what can be accessed from the "Edit" tab. I think of the "Adjust" tab as being designed for novice newbies and beginning-intermediate levels of users, who often are not exactly sure what is wrong with their photo and how specifically to correct/adjust it, and the "Edit" tab is designed for advanced power users like me who want to have direct access to all the tools. If you are just starting out with graphics software, I recommend that you begin your photo editing from the "Adjust" tab, and then later as you become more proficient with the software, you can ignore this tab and always proceed directly to the "Edit" tab. The "Adjust" tab is much cleaner with its presentation of tools grouped into a handful of categories on the left side of the user interface and four menu options along the top, whereas the "Edit" tab lets you access every possible tool in its comprehensive tool chest and eleven menu options along the top. Overall, I think that this three-tab design strikes a happy balance that addresses the needs of both new users and power users.   While the PaintShop Pro "Manage" and "Adjust" tabs are more simpler, clean, and organized in their user interface layouts, the "Edit" tab feels very busy and crowded, and it can be hard to find tools, especially when you are initially familiarizing yourself with all of the software's dozens of tools. And to add to this ergonomics and usability issue, the main menu on the "Edit" tab divides the tools into two menu options: 'Adjust' and 'Effects'. The "Adjust" tab includes a subset of options that are listed under the 'Adjust' menu option on the "Edit" tab. One ambiguous example is that under the 'Adjust' main menu option of the "Edit" tab, there is a 'Brightness and Contrast' option that then opens up a submenu containing the new 'Fill Light/Clarity' tool. But the 'Adjust' menu also lists a similar tool called 'Fill Flash'. Both the 'Fill Light/Clarity' and 'Fill Flash' tools have a similar function, but neither the printed User Manual nor the online "Help Topics" documentation explain what the differences between both tools are. At a minimum, the 'Fill Flash' tool also needs to be moved into the submenu below the 'Brightness and Contrast' option. Ideally, both 'Fill Flash', which has 'Strength' and 'Saturation' slider settings, and 'Fill Light/Clarity', which has 'Fill Light' and 'Clarity' slider settings, should be combined into a single tool window containing three or four sliders, instead of confusing users as to which of these two tools to use.   I like the changes and improvements that Corel has made to VideoStudio Pro X4. I can resize, drag, dock, and undock various windows and UI elements to suit my workspace preferences and everything seems to behave intuitively. But as with how Corel has designed their help system for PaintShop Pro X4 software, the one aspect of the VideoStudio Pro X4 user interface that I really dislike is that to access the help menus, I am forced to hop through intermediate menus before it launches the online help from Corel's Web site using my browser. With both PaintShop Pro X4 and VideoStudio Pro X4, I now just bookmark the help information URLs and access them directly from my browser instead of clicking the cumbersome help button from within the application. Even though the latest and most up-to-date online help information can be dynamically accessed directly from Corel's Web site when using this browser approach, I would still really prefer the previous approach of at least being given the option during the installation of the software to load the full help documentation on my computer's local hard drive since that also gives me the freedom to access the user manuals and help guides when I use the software without having Internet access.   VideoStudio Pro is a big complex software application that really requires some patience for you to slowly become more familiar with all of its features and power. But its user interface is cleanly designed so that newbie first-timers can start editing their videos with ease without fully mastering all of its powerful features. Fortunately, Corel also provides plenty of online help along with easy-to-use templates and more than 60 really cool special effects and more than 150 transition effects to let you experiment and try out many of its flexible options so even video-editing newbies can create a polished slick video with ease. The software uses a nondestructive editing approach so that your original video file is not being directly modified along the way. This also allows you to experiment, even trying out wacky ideas and special effects, turning a tedious chore into a fun playtime of creating video eye candy.   Performance, Stability & Reliability:  Excellent 5-fuzzies rating   Compared to previous versions of PaintShop Pro, this X4 version has pretty good stability. During almost one year of weekly usage before writing this review, I have had the software crash or hang about 6 times total, and this includes running the software on an old underpowered Windows Vista laptop and a tiny Windows 7 Dell Mini 10 netbook. Corel has obviously worked on adding stability with this version, along with GPU optimizations.   Speed has been noticeably improved, the performance is considerably faster than previous versions, start-up time to launch the program for the first time has been improved, and these improvements are especially apparent when running PaintShop Pro X4 on an older slower computer. When used on my 5-year old Windows Vista laptop with 2GB memory, applying most effects happens in real-time, and for some operations such as adjusting sharpening parameters on 100-MB TIFF image files, the pop-up preview window will still display a progress meter, but these progress meters only last for a few seconds on this older laptop of mine.   PaintShop Pro X4 now requires only 1GB of disk space. The previous PaintShop Pro X3 version required 3GB of disk space, which tells me that prior to X4, PaintShop Pro had become very bloated and disorganized. So this redesign both increased performance and reduced the disk space required. By comparison, Adobe's latest Photoshop Elements 10 requires a whopping 3GB to 4GB of disk space, even though it has less features and effects than PaintShop Pro X4.   With this VideoStudio Pro X4 version, Corel continues to add new features and useful enhancements, important bug fixes and crucial improvements to software stability, along with performance and speed boosts by taking advantage of Intel's and AMD's new CPUs and also GPU acceleration provided by specific Nvidia graphics processors.   One really cool performance feature offered by VideoStudio Pro is that it has a "Smart Proxy" editing mode, where you can edit high-definition video in a low-resolution mode, thereby allowing you to use a slower computer without necessarily slowing down to a sluggish crawl. These performance enhancements offer a huge advantage because many of us do not upgrade our computers frequently with the latest fastest CPU processors. So some of the other brands of video editing software may be unbearably slow on these slower computers (even to the point of completely freezing up) while VideoStudio Pro X4 can still zip along with a decent amount of responsiveness on slower computers.   Back when I was using VideoStudio Pro X2, the software had various erratic and quirky bugs and serious stability issues; it can be disheartening to have the software freeze up after you have spent more than an hour editing a video. Many of these problems have thankfully been resolved in this VideoStudio Pro X4; not once did I encounter a freeze-up or crash during my edits using X4. When used on an older slower Windows Vista laptop of mine, the software can be sluggishly slow sometimes, but I prefer dealing with slower performance on a slower computer than having to deal with annoying software bugs and applications that freeze up or crash on me, so I accept the fact that I have to wait longer when using VideoStudio Pro X4 on a slower laptop that is more than four years old. As with any video editing software, especially when editing HD videos, your best experience will result from using a fast computer with lots of memory.   Competitive Pricing & Value:  Excellent 5-fuzzies rating   At the time of this review's writing, PaintShop Pro X4 Ultimate is being discounted on Amazon at a price less than $90.  For less than $100, there is currently no other commercial software that even comes close to the photo and video editing power and features that are offered in this fully-loaded bundle.   Fuzzy Wuzzy's Conclusion:  For overall bang-for-the-buck combination of very affordable value and feature-packed power in a commercial photo-editing software package, PaintShop Pro X4 currently reigns supreme, beating out Adobe Photoshop Elements 10 and all other photo-editing software that I can think of. If you want something even less expensive, look into a freeware graphics software called "GIMP" which offers a ton of graphics editing power for free. And if you have no experience with graphics software or if you do not want to spend time learning its complexities, look into the free and easy-to-use software called "Paint. NET".  Despite the significant performance improvements in version X4 (I think that it is roughly 50% to 100% faster than X3 and also more stable), it still does have its slow areas of laggardly performance. In particular, this is not a good software for processing RAW files, both due to its slow RAW converter and due to its limited RAW compatibility. But now that Corel has repackaged Bibble Lab's "Bibble Pro" as their "AfterShot Pro" software, you should consider "AfterShot Pro" for your RAW file processing; Bibble had one of the fastest RAW converters and Corel acquired Bibble Labs to compete with Adobe's Lightroom.  If you want the deluxe photo management and editing solution, deluxe in capability, cost, and complexity, using Adobe's Lightroom and Photoshop CS are the way to go. Otherwise, this PaintShop Pro X4 is an excellent "Photoshop for the masses" alternative. If you primarily shoot in RAW, adding Corel's new AfterShot Pro allows for great RAW handling followed by photo editing in PaintShop Pro X4. And if Corel's HDR feature in PaintShop Pro X4 has whetted your appetite for HDR processing, you should seriously consider getting Photomatix Pro (currently at version 4) since its capabilities exceed anything that Corel or Adobe has to offer.  While the VideoStudio Pro X4 included in this bundle lacks some of the features and has more track-editing limitations when compared to both CyberLink PowerDirector and Adobe Premiere, I think that it beats those two when it comes to multi-trim clip editing, key framing, and its best-in-class stop-motion and time-lapse animation capabilities. And VideoStudio Pro X4 is far easier and more intuitive to learn for a newbie compared to Adobe Premiere's dense complexity. If this video-editing software was priced at $300, I would rate it 4 stars or maybe 3.5 stars, but with its inexpensive list price and Corel's frequent heavy pricing discounts, I rate it 5 star	1
I have been using many prior versions of the Corel Photo and Video Bundles for video editing of my youtube videos and editing of my vacation / family photos.  I like this latest version for the following reasons :  Corel VideoStudio  - The video editing software is a lot more stabler - Integrated HD support - 3D movies support - Video tutorial and a variety of free templates  Corel PaintShop Pro  - The smart photo fix feature provides an easy way to do quick editing and enhancement of our photos. It also provides the options for adjusting key settings such as Brightness, shadows, highlights, saturation, and focus. - Great variety of options to manipulating our photos. The ones I used the most frequently is the clone brush which makes it very easy to do quick touch-up of the photos  Highly recommended	1
I'm not a huge techie, but this was super easy to instal and use with my HD point and shoot.  I have made wonderful edits and added special 'effects' to many photos of my kids.  It has given us more favorable standing with our family members.  I highly recommend this for amateurs and semi-pros alike.	1
The Corel Photo and Video Pro X4 Ultimate Bundle combines photo and video processing/editing suites into one bundle.  The two programs work very reilably, offering the most frequently-used editing techniques - not quite Adobe firepower, but a great fit for most users' needs, particularly at the price.  For photos, you can layer images and apply brushes and other texturing techniques.  The video suite can handle source standard- or high-definition material and allows simple yet powerful editing - the add-ons included also permit very nice-looking on-screen titling.  As with any video editing software, you'll need a pretty recent processor and a good deal of RAM for reliable results - check your PCs specs before buying.	1
PaintShop Pro has long been a standard graphics program loved by those who did not want to or could not afford to pay the high price of Adobe PhotoShop. With many of the same functions and sometimes more intuitive than PhotoShop,users have created a wealth of high quality graphics with earlier versions.  Photo and Video X$ Ultimate Bundle includes the Ultimate PaintShop Pro X4 and VideoStudio Pro X4 as well as several bonuses that include Nik Color Efex Pro 3.0, Royalty-free images from fotolia a custom photo book, and a premium collection of Picture Tubes for PaintShop Pro X4 and a free pair of 3D glasses, proDAD Mercalli SE, Boris Graffiti 5.3, and free tutorial videos for VideoStudio Pro X4. Also included are printed manuals, a free download of WinZip Pro, and the complete Corel KPT Collection when you register the product.  I have spent some time playing around with both programs but have to admit that it will take some time to become comfortable with it. The interface is professional and attractive with so many options that it could take awhile to thoroughly explore them all. Included are excellent tools for automatic and manual photo editing and touch-ups as well as a wealth of effects to totally change the look of an image. Just exploring these options can be fun. VideoStudio Pro 4X allows the user to import, edit, and share their videos in multiple formats that are compatible with YouTube, Facebook, and vimeo. Both programs have options for saving and sharing.  I am looking forward to having more time to explore the powerful capabilities of both PaintShop Pro X4 and VideoStudio Pro X4. This package deal is indeed the "Ultimate Bundle" and packs a lot of bang for your dollar. You can't go wrong with this excellent software.	1
I've used several photo and video editing programs, and these are my favorites. Easier to learn than PhotoShop, but more robust than most of the simpler photo programs-- and the video editing has a huge range of features and is stable. Here's a little more on each:  PHOTO  I've had versions 2 and 3, so this was an upgrade from 3 for me. If you're upgrading, you'll notice that the interface looks different. I wondered whether the upgrade was going to be worth it-- drives me crazy when software companies come out with new versions every year and you have to pay for upgrades. But Corel doesn't disappoint.  There are now three workspaces: "manage" to upload and organize your photos, "adjust" for quick editing, and "edit" for more in-depth editing. On-screen tutorials teach you what's what.  I was particularly impressed with the improvement to the advanced red eye feature-- you ever get a photo where the flash doesn't just turn someone's eye red, but like a giant blue circle (like you see in pet photos)? I had a great picture of my daughter and her cousin, but one of my daughter's eyes was all bizarre like that and I had little hope of making it look normal. Then I used the advanced red eye feature here, and it actually "rebuilds" the eye. It draws in a pupil and everything, asking you what color to make the eye. And the darn thing looked natural!  If you had preferences saved in an older version, you'll have to redo them here-- for example, whether or not you want to save all original photos when you're editing them.  There are some cool new effects, like kaleidoscope and sandstone.  Other new features: You can now upload to Facebook and Flicker and send photos by email directly from the program. At least theoretically-- I haven't yet had any success getting my e-mail configured with the program, but that's not a big deal for me.  You can also print multiple photos on a single page more easily now.  VIDEO  Many reviewers have mentioned this software as being "intuitive" and that they didn't have to crack the manual. I can only assume that those reviewers weren't trying to do very complicated things with the software-- which is totally fine. There's a great market for people who want nothing more than to create little personal videos for family or online use. However, for those of us who want to "take it to the next level" without months or years of studying, you can definitely do that with this software.  Until now, most of my home movies were made using One True Media-- a super online service for beginners that makes it very easy to make short videos combining photos and digital video clips with music and effects to share online or burn to DVD. However, I had pushed that service to its max-- it gets very, VERY slow and tedious when you try to make long videos (mine were mostly around 30-45-minutes). The download times were appalling and there were certainly limitations to how much you could customize. So I was ready to try a more advanced program, and this one fit the bill.  I didn't find it quite as intuitive as others did. Some of the basic functions were simple to figure out, but if you want to explore the nitty-gritty bits that make this program what it is and set it apart from earlier versions, then you're probably going to need the manual and the online tutorials, and maybe some good ole' search engine help. For instance, I had problems figuring out how to get Mercalli to work to stabilize parts of my videos. When I tried to apply it to my clips, an error message would continually tell me to try again. Some poking around online finally led me to a video where a user showed the simple step I was missing that enabled Mercalli to work-- which was nowhere in Corel's manual. I loved Mercalli-- I was walking around during a parade while filming, and using this program, it looks so much smoother. Very little trial and error is necessary to figure out the right settings for particular types of clips.  I also wanted to figure out how to customize my audio tracks to fade in and out at particular intervals-- to be quiet during video clips and louder during still photos, for instance-- and couldn't figure that out entirely from the manual, either. It was a video from a VideoStudio Pro X2tutorial that walked me through the steps (even though the interface looked different, it was close enough that I could figure it out).  The newly-added Boris Graffiti is nice, too, to create titles and graphics that are more interesting than you'll find in simpler video programs. This will really allow you to get graphically creative if that's up your alley.  The program has crashed on me once in about 20 hours of heavy use (during audio uploading), but it saved my project, so it wasn't a big deal. However, I have a machine well above the specs required, so I was a bit disappointed that it crashed at all. It loads and uploads video, audio, and photos in a reasonable amount of time.  There are vast numbers of tutorials on YouTube that show how to really get the most out of the program using features like stop-motion animation, image correction, and advanced video editing techniques, so it really depends on how much time and effort you want to expend to get the best result. You can be satisfied with just studying the program for an hour or so and making a nice little video, or you can spend a month or two learning all the ins and outs and making really impressive videos that you can use to promote your business, preserve family memories, and so on.  I think it's a very fair price for all the bundle includes. You can't go wrong with these two programs if you're ready to play with some great photo and video editing tools.	1
This is a great easy to use product that has allowed me to be very creative in my photos.  I found it a great addition to my photography resources.	1
Very good print master.	1
This can be successfully installed on Windows 8.1 and Windows 10.  I was able to print something from each of these two computers.  For Windows 8.1--Place disc in DVDCD drive and then hit the windows key below the Z along with r key at same time.  Not only did it load but all the graphics on the disc as well as other goodies for a print job are there on the hard drive.  For Windows 10-  Right click on DVDCD D Drive area which is part of file that is pinned taskbar. Then right click again.  A whole menu will drop down.  The choices at the top are expand, send to device, and then install or run program from your machine.  Select this one.  Do a custom install.  After finished with that installation, go back to modify on Printmaster menu.  You have to install Art Disc and Art Disc 2 individually.  Then it works as well as the program on Windows 8.1.  I saw something about graphics, etc had to come from Internet.  There are over 300,000 graphic images so I can't imagine going to Internet.	1
Everything worked the same as the 18.0 version, but this version is definitely more compatible with Windows 7. I was also able to retrieve all my projects from my earlier version with no issues.	1
So I couldn't use it. That was disappointing. I will update the review if and when I upgrade my system, but for the time being, I didn't expect this incompatibility for a relatively new computer.	-1
Includes a USB drive in case you don't have an optical drive. Installation went smoothly, and allows use of Windows with no problems to date.	1
I'm about to upgrade to&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/VMware-Fusion-5-for-MAC-OS-X/dp/B008YTAGIK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">VMware Fusion 5 for MAC OS X</a>&nbsp;as I had great success with this version.  I was delayed due to upgrades and other software I wanted to use, but once I got everything ready, it was a breeze to blend the Windows components I missed in my routines, and have them ready in a click on my Mac.  No need to restart or shutdown to go to either OS, just go to what you want when you need it.  Very fast processing, and no graphic degradation to speak of.  With the new Mountain Lion, I just feel it's time to upgrade.  And at their list price, it is still a bargain for the headaches it resolves.  So, just in case you ended up here, just shoot over to version 5 instead.  Unless you are in a preferred situation where this would work better for you and your needs.  But there is no reason 5 won't work for you as it is pretty good with adjusting to older programs.	1
I have been extremely happy with VM Ware Fusion 4. It has been running flawlessly. It is a nice upgrade from 3 and adds many new features that I am really amazed by. And they just work. It's great. I occasionally run window programs, so I can not speak from a daily use scenario. But for those times when I can't run it on my Mac, I use Fusion 4. It's a lot easier to me than rebooting in Windows. I can still have my OSX running and it really doesn't slow down my system much at all. Highly recommended.	1
VMWare works flawlessly.  It lets me run Windows 7 programs on my Mac, just like I would run any other Mac program.  No more need to reboot my computer to switch operating systems like I would have to do previously.  And no need to jump back and forth between computers during my workday.  This saves me time and increased my productivity.  This is a truly spectacular programs.  Anyone who uses both Windows and Mac would benefit from VMWare.  It would behoove Apple to add a program like this in their future OS versions.	1
I'm sure this has been reviewed this way and that so I'll focus on a couple of things that were salient for me.  First, I've been a long time user of Parallels. I run a Macbook Pro (previously a 17" from 2008, now a 15" with Retina Display) mostly because they're well done and because of Parallels (and now VMware Fusion) allow me to run Windows at the same time without having to dual-boot it.  All the major functions work well and as expected. Once set up, you're able to run the host OS with the VM OS at the same time and, as you'd expect, performance is based on how well your machine is ready to handle two OSes (memory, CPU, HD space, etc.).  Install:  One thing to note. My new MBP is on Mountain Lion (wonder if the next release is going to be Cougar or Sabertooth?) and apparently version 4 out of the box (I've had this for about a month now so they might have fixed this with the current stock) won't install. You have to go to the support site, register (for obvious reasons) and you can download the proper installer (4.1. X). You need to register since the installer is a full installer, not a patch. Once you're registered it's currently under Support & Downloads > Product Downloads > All Downloads > VMware Fusion (right column mid-way down). The link is here but bear in mind this might change:  [...]  Once you've got that downloaded, it'll install just fine.  Retina Display + Windows 7 (and others?):  Another problem I had was screen resolution. Retina displays, if you aren't aware, effectively mean you've got double the original/standard resolution (basically twice as many pixels). That's what gives the displays the clarity (more pixels per square inch = better resolution). Unfortunately, this apparently doesn't translate well into Windows in fullscreen mode, at least as of this writing. There are a couple of workarounds so it's not the end of the world and it appears that working in windowed mode (and in a sense in Unity since Unity's got to scale to the Mac OS anyway). Not the end of the world, as I said but definitely something that will need to be worked around until they patch the software.  [...]  Unity/Windowed Mode Switching:  This is a minor gripe if only because it felt a lot easier in Parallels. Switching between Fullscreen, Unity and Windowed Mode is a bit odd. It takes some getting used to (you'd think a couple of well-placed tip bubbles would've been part of your initial experience with the app). They've got two different buttons in different places. It took me a little bit to get used to. Again, minor but you'd sort of think it might be a great design concept to just put them together and in a consistent location so you can just find it fast and do what you need to do. In addition, once you switch to Unity mode, you basically lose the Windows desktop. You'll have to pull up the Windowed Mode to find stuff, including taskbar items. There's a start menu in the Mac OS site with Fusion but I don't see a usable taskbar (I might be missing it). Again, this is just a pet peeve and might not amount to anything for you.  All in all, it does what it's supposed to do and appears to do it well. I haven't tried 3D graphics/gaming with it yet so I can't really speak to that. Compared to Parallels, honestly, they both have all the same major features. I feel like Parallels did a better job of handling the "mixed mode" between the two OSes but I don't have a recent version (last version I used was 4 or 5). However, if you're wondering in general if Fusion will work for you, I can say it will. VMware's been doing VMs for a very long time. A decent amount of cloud infrastructure is running on VMware (though, obviously, not Fusion).  So, while I can't give you a good Parallels versus VMware comparison with current versions, I can say VMware should deliver what you need if you want to host Windows on a Mac. Just remember a couple things: a) you need to own a copy of Windows to run a VM with it, and b) you should have enough resources on your Mac to give up some to run a VM--there's no magic here...VMs run on whatever resources you allocate to them so giving them 1 CPU with 500MB of RAM and 10 GB of hard disk will mean it'll run fine if all you want to do is check e-mail. At minimum, pony up for more RAM and a nice sized hard disk, especially if you're going to run Windows 7 (I recommend allocating the min requirements depending on the version you're running). You can still run on less than minimum resources, it'll just be a slow ride.	1
After using VMware Fusion for a few months it has become a regular tool in my web development tasks. A few of the reasons I enjoy working with Fusion is:  1. Unity (ability to use windowed apps within OS X) 2. Ability to test in IE, Safari (for Windows), Firefox (for Windows) and Chrome (for Windows) 3. Can freeze VM to skip the long loading process of Windows.  Though with everything in computers there are some trade-offs. I found the following to be limitations but not showstoppers  1. Requires a good chunk of storage space for VM 2. Consumes more RAM than Plesk Parallels 3. The Fusion UI is meant to look like Lion but adds to performance decline  Overall even with the limitations I think using VMare Fusion to run Windows is a great option considering the alternative would be to have a complete Windows machine on my desk.  Note: I have not been able to test on Mountain Lion yet, though I did read some of the other reviewers facing difficulties. So I would either wait or contact VMWare for additional support.	1
Setup: iMac 2011 with 12 gigs of RAM (8 gigs RAM is an upgrade), Windows 7 Home Premium  I bought Fusion as I was getting tired of rebooting  from Mac to Windows and vice versa. I was also considering Parallels but Fusion was cheaper at the time I was shopping for a software. Both have high marks and good reviews so I figured any of the two will do.  It came in a box with a DVD and a USB dongle; I chose the DVD. By the way, I have already installed Windows 7 Home Premium using Apple's Boot Camp.  My only concerns were some reviewers mentioned that they have to re-enter or re-register Windows (or  maybe in my case, Autodesk's MEP 2011).  I have all the licenses but still have a bad feeling that something might go wrong and you have to deal with all the headaches of calling customer support.  Everything went smoothly.  There was a dialogue box that popped up telling me that Windows need to be registered again, but all I did was press enter and I'm all set.  The next concern is how MEP 2011 will work along with Fusion.  I see a little bit of hesitation with a few commands but almost negligible that I really don't care.  I am quite happy with the performance. Revit is another thing, I may need to do a bit more searching online to make sure it will work before I install.  Switching between Mac and Windows programs are all stitched-in into the software, quite amazing. I am working on MEP drawings running in Windows and at the same time listening to iTunes on Mac OS.	1
Pros: 64-bit; run Windows seamlessly; great performance  Cons: N/A thus far.  Bottom-Line: Excellent application for running Widows in the iMac environment!  I am a Microsoft Windows user, have been since the release of Windows 3.0 was back in 1989.  I have used each new release of Windows up through Windows 7 the most stable and user-friendly version of the software yet.  But when my Dell XPS AIO started giving my problems I decided to replace it with an Apple iMac desktop running OSX Lion.  Needless to say the decision was not an easy one, so invested am I in everything Windows.  But the decision made I knew I wanted to still run Windows 7 on my iMac and I could do it one of two ways: Apple's Boot Camp application built-into OSX that allows one to run either OSX or Windows, or VMWare Fusion For Mac Version 4.0, which allows one to run both OSX Lion and Windows simultaneously.  Virtual computing; the technology has been around for a while in the Enterprise and VMWare has been the company leading the vanguard.  VMWare Fusion for Mac Version 4.0 allows me to run Windows 7 (Windows XP or Windows Vista) on the iMac without having to reboot the computer and also allows for the sharing of hardware, such as printers and external hard drives between the two OS's.  That last function piece--the ability to share hardware--was also very import piece of the virtual machine puzzle, because I still need the ability to scan documents to .PDF format and store on a Windows-based network.  For all of my needs VMWare Fusion for Mac fit the bill nicely, and it allows me to run a 64-bit version of Windows 7.  Installation of the software on the iMac was simple and easy.  You can choose one of two install methods; 1. via an included memory stick, or; 2. via DVD.  I choose the memory stick, because during the install process I could slip the Windows 7 disc in the iMac CD-ROM player and have the install process install Windows 7after it installed itself.  All told the install took a little over an hour to complete, afterward I had a fully functional Windows 7 desktop computer!  After I ran the install I configured VMWare Fusion for Mac to use share the printer and use an attached hard drive only on Windows 7. After those quick configuration changes were made I was able to download and install Windows security updates and join the Virtual Machine (VM) to the Windows 2003/2008 domain I have set up in my home.  Switching between OSX and Windows 7 is simple: a two finger swipe on the Apple Magic mouse is all it takes to toggle between the two OS's.  I am typing this review on Microsoft Word 2010 installed on my Windows 7 VM, while also using Google Chrome to surf the internet.  Meanwhile back on OSX I am streaming live cool Jazz music! VMWare Fusion for Mac allows you to tweak the VM for optimum performance; e.g. you can set the processor number (1 or 2), Ram allocation and hard drive space.  The VM will have to be powered off in order to adjust these settings.  VMWare does recommend you limit the processor number to unless you have a demanding application that needs more performance space.  Like most virtual machine application VMWare Fusion for Mac will suspend the VM when the iMac is shut down or restarted, so you will not lost any work.  Conclusion  VMWare Fusion for Mac Version 4 is the ideal solution for my needs and I highly recommend it for anyone thinking about running Windows on an iMac.  Since I install the application some five months ago I have no issue what-so-ever with performance. Not one!  My only question is: why didn't I do this sooner!	1
I'm a big Mac user, but my job uses PCs. That's always been an issue for me working on programs that aren't Mac. I wind up working twice as hard to make files compatible between both platforms, and half the time I lose formatting.  I never tried a virtual program before, and I have to say, with so many others, that VMware Fusion is simplicity itself: drag and drop installation, opens PC programs seamlessly, and has my job easier since I can work from home, and move files over with no issues.  The only thing I'd say is to max out your RAM (but you're doing that anyway, aren't you?)  Highly recommend.	1
Easy "drag & drop" install and works well.  Running it on a 2010 era MacBook Pro with 8 GB of memory.  Seems to be much improved over the earlier pre-VM4 versions.  Pricing is also very good, but you'll have to go out and buy a copy of Windows 7 which isn't cheap.  Microsoft sells their OS for much higher pricing than Apple.  However, if you have an old copy of the Windows XP install CD around, you can use that to install Win XP and then use a much cheaper license for Microsoft's Windows 7 "Upgrade" CD to bring it up to the latest Microsoft OS.	1
Poser 9 is such an engaging and fun interface to work with. I am thrilled with this latest release. The presentation is gorgeous; the entire workspace is brilliantly refined.  The well-balanced user interface provides efficient navigation. As always, numerous interface tweaks may be applied and saved to easily accessible memory dots, and when combined with presets of common 3D workflow layouts, it makes preparing for and alternating between tasks almost effortless.  The new features and the core rendering enhancements are quite significant and they target not only the desires of the casual user but also the needs of the most dedicated artists and illustrators. Accessibility defines Poser 9! Vertex weight maps, subsurface scattering, tablet support for the morph tool, Python 2.7, faster hair and (thankfully) framing a selected objet with a toggle to rotate around the selected object describes some of the most welcome, but not the only, additions and enhancements to the software.  I love Poser 9! When I take into account how much I enjoy using it compared to previous versions, I can officially rank it as a heavy hitter as far as quality products go. It is worth the upgrade regardless of which version one comes from, and it is definitely worth the investment for curious new users who can pretty much just install it and take over the creative reins immediately.  It's clear to see the efforts made by the development team in order to make this such an incredible tool.	1
This is one ace of a program.  It is basically drag and drop. However, there are some controls you have to master. This is listed as an intermediate program.  I have Poser Debut which is for beginners, but is very limiting in what it can do.  By the way, at $49, Debut is a bargain for what you get).  This software is $249. and worth every penny.  It isn't always intuitive; for example, I ended up putting atmosphere materials on a skeleton at first, instead of in the background. :=).  I've had a blast playing with the facial expressions!  They are my favorite.  If you make a mistake the software tells you.  Downloading:  There are a lot of instructions on this process, and there are many different methods. There are freebies on the website to experiment with.  Some things are only a few dollars.  You can buy whole scenes or packs of scenery.  One could get carried away! There is a membership deal for hardcore users.  I can see why this can be so addicting.  There is a learning curve, so get out the manual!  Read the "read me" and manual.  You will get so much more out of this software.  Aside from animations, one could save in graphic formats -- even png, tiff, and PSD for Photoshop.  My recommendation is to do a few tutorials that you can find on the internet.  This way you learn it all step-by-step.	1
I have never dabbled in computer graphics or modeling before but I've been into many forms of art and I'm familiar with many of Adobe's art-type programs.  This is a very fun and relatively easy program to use.  I've been dabbling here and there for the last few days and been able to have fun creating various different models.  I'm running a 2009 iMac with upgraded memory and it runs pretty well.  I would definitely buy this program for the artistic kid out there who has some familiarity with more complex computer software.	1
Firstly, I am a complete Poser newbie.  I have always wanted to use the program but have just not had the time/opportunity to undertake learning the software...or so I thought.  For the newbies out there, I was up and running with a character in about 10 minutes, with the caveat that I completed the two things in the paragraph below first!  The package contains PC and Mac DVD-ROMs. I have a blazing fast PC with 18GB of RAM, striped drives, and an Intel 990x processor.  So, installation was fairly quick and painless. I took the opportunity to read the included quick reference card while the software was loading so that I could have a basic familiarity with the software interface.  Also, I did a little picking/choosing of some tutorial videos at Lynda.com that covered an older version to have a basic understanding of what exactly Poser is and does before the software arrived.  The background work was quite beneficial and as stated I was up and running with a basic character in about 10 minutes. Poser is a program in which you create, pose, and animate 3D characters with pre-built libraries of characters, props, clothing, hair, ad-infinitum. You also have control of lighting and cameras as one would expect with anything 3D. Then you pose them as you wish or animate them to use in various other software programs to create art of all sorts.  I found the interface to be fairly intuitive and is like so many other tabbed interfaces in software I currently use. You start with a fairly featureless character in the main window then start adding features, lighting, body type, etc. One can then start to pose the character. Of course this is the 10,000 foot view as there are many controls to fine tune everything and are out of the scope of a review.  There are many sites that sell characters, props, clothing, hair, and the like to help you create just about anything having to do with a character! This is quite helpful, especially for those under time constraints or that may not be savvy enough to create their own in other content creation programs such as a 3D program or Photoshop.  I see this as no different than using stock photos/illustrations/characters in the art one creates, so it didn't bother me.  I have not animated a character yet, but that is on the agenda for the near future.  Having never used the program before I cannot speak to whether it is a worthwhile upgrade from an earlier version, but many professional reviewers think so. I think the price is reasonable. SmihMicro has three levels of this program: Poser Debut, that while being less powerful and feature packed is quite a bit less money and may serve as an entry level into the Poser family; Poser 9 which I am using/reviewing here; and Poser Pro 2012 which has all of the features of Poser 9 and many more pro-level features.  I think because I was able to be up and running so quickly, though at a basic level, that Poser 9 is a great asset to any artist or hobbyist wanting to add 3D characters to the art they create but have nothing to create said characters with. If you are a 3D neophyte that has wanted to try Poser but have been holding back on getting it because you thought it would be overwhelming or you felt you just plain didn't have time to learn it...I say go for it!	1
Poser 9 very happy and do business again  with them I'm happy experience and the Prudence is what decried very happy	1
I got this software with what I thought was a fairly easy outcome in mind.  I was going to work with my 11 year old to produce a small Jurassic Park like comic book. We were going to use some 3D dinosaur models, pose them as needed in Poser then composite them in photoshop to make the illustrations.  All the parts seemed to be there but I keep running into issues.  First, I ended up having issues installing the software, two PC's refused to read the installation DVD.  I was finally able to get my work PC to read the DVD and install the software but that was mostly to make sure the DVD was actually usable.  When I installed it on my Mac laptop it installed fine, but crashed shortly after I tried to open a file.  So the project was shelved for a long time.  I recently got a new MacBook Pro and loaded the software.  I played with some of the installed examples and again got excited for the possibilities.  However, the frustrations returned when I tried to open the downloaded dinosaur models, I have followed the import instructions and still cannot get them to open in Poser. After 6 hours I was finally able to get a model to show in poser, and it was awesome, it was doing exactly what I hoped, awkwardly but a start.  Many tutorials later and I can fairly get it to do what I want for my stills.  The truly frustrating part is that just playing with it, I can tell what it could do for me.  There is a learning curve for beginners.  I'm not giving up yet, but I am taking some time off to read the forums and try to tackle it again fresh.  Playing with the interface, it really is a slick software package.  I love the rigging and quick animation it allows.  I'm posting questions and reading so I'll update if I'm able to get my models to work.	1
Our family uses several software products to create digital art and anime. I thought Poser 9 sounded like a lot of fun.  I received this product to review from Amazon's Vine program free of charge before the product was released to the public. I followed all the instructions to activate the product in order to unlock it to use it. Despite putting the serial number in many times correctly the system rejected me and I was unable to start using it.  I contacted Smith Micro immediately. I copied and pasted the serial number so that what I submitted to them was exactly what I inputted. It took a week for their staff to get back to me by email and all they said was "that serial number is a working number".  Again I tried to activate the software and was rejected giving an error message about "serial number invalid".  I rate this product 1 Star = I Hate It because I was unable to get it to work at all and the staff was not helpful.  Smith Micro should have a customer service line to call and talk to a human live. Also when providing a product for reviewing, if it will not activate the company should provide another product to that reviewer so it can actually be product tested.	-1
One might feel pity for the creators and marketers of programs like Poser 9. They invest their all into a fine application - which this is - but the market is inherently limited to those who want to produce 3D renderings. There are many people who would love to do that, but it is a difficult undertaking.   So the marketers claim it is an easy thing to do, that learning how to do it is simple. They laughed when I sat down to create a 3D rendering of a woodland nymph . . . and they were right.   Creating 3D renderings isn't simple, though the folks who publish Poser try to make it easier with each new version. I own several of the earlier versions and, speaking generally, would give up in minutes.   Poser 9 is an excellent product, but it has a fairly steep learning curve and possessing artistic talent is not optional, it is a requirement. They include a ton of content and the interface is usable. There are a couple of books about using Poser and picking up a used copy of one for an earlier version is a good investment.   If you have the time, though, and the discipline to work through each step, you can master Poser 9.   Personally, considering the low level of my skills, I prefer Reallusion iClone and Daz Studio: they're not necessarily as capable as Poser 9, but they are somewhat easier for novices to approach.   But, as I said, if you can devote the time and energy to learning Poser 9 and practice, practice, practice, you can turn out truly exquisite work with this application. I just wish I could.  Jerry	1
Update: 01 April 2012.  Writer first, page designer second, graphic artist third. Realistic human shapes and postures give me the most trouble, so when Poser 9 came down the Vine, I decided to see if it could help me set scenes for book covers and interiors. As it turns out, Poser is a powerful program with a great deal of plug-in and model support, albeit with a lot of features and nuances to learn. It also demands a current system to run smoothly.  --Enter the Program--  Installation was uneventful. Poser 9 comes in Mac and Windows flavor on a single disc, 32-bit only. Including the 3 gigabytes of model content, it clocks in over 4 gigs total on my hardrive. Smaller than many of my modern games, I can tell you.  Once it comes up, I get a touch overwhelmed by the layout. Controls are not quite as intuitive as they could be, and even with helpful dials and knobs and icons, they don't always go quite the directions I would expect. Models don't follow a standard for labeling their controls, so what makes a pair of nunchucks move one way, will make a pair of handcuffs move a different way when turning the same dial.  Camera controls are typical for a 3D editing program, which is to say that you cannot simply mouse around the models and their stage, but must use keyboard and GUI controls. The same goes for moving props around. You don't simply load things in and have it snap to your model. A lot of camera movement, dial spinning, and menu commands are required. Also, Poser 9 kicks off with minimal defaults. So if you want your models to have realistic bone constraints, instead of being tugged around like a Gumby doll, you'll have to go in and check off the option. Finally, there are a lot of meshes and magnets and constraints and scattering surfaces and other tools to master for the final look. I haven't tried the animation features yet, but the program allows you to render still images which can be exported to a variety of contone formats, including the popular PNG, TIF, BMP, and JPG. These renders look good even on the default setting; however, colors that aren't apparant in the posing window will appear in the render, so you might have to switch back and forth for adjustments.  Once you get the hang of the control nuances, things move quickly enough. The dials turn out to be a good way for posing of limbs and digits, while the mouse works the user interface and moving whole models around. The presets and bundled content are accessible enough to learn, and there is a lot of free stuff on the net to explore. Which leads me to...  --DAZed and Compatible--  One of the first things I did with Poser was to install models from Daz Studio. Victoria 4 and Michael 4 are two of the latter's most popular characters. To go with that popularity are hundreds of hair, clothing, and gadget accessories (many of them costing in excess of $29 a pop). Hair alone is a racket. So when 3D Daz had a promotional giveaway for the base package of both figures, I installed them. Additionally, I've downloaded dozens of props and stages designed for Poser, Daz, or both, from 3D Daz, Renderosity, and various other vendors. Poser 9 allows you to access the Smith Micro Store from within the program. I did not attempt to load Genesis, which are the newest figure series, and which I am told are not compatible with Poser 9 without work around.  Speaking of workarounds, Poser object installation is mostly straight forward. When you launch the executable for a given model, make sure you select it as a Daz Studio item when the dialogue box asks you to chose. Then in the next dialogue box, install it to your root Poser Content folder (installed by default in My Documents on Windows 7) instead of Daz--NOT to Poser's actual runtime directory. Finally, the very first time you install a model, you have to go into Poser itself, and tell it to recognize its own Content folder. Also, you have to restart Poser for them to be recognized. This is easier than it sounds, and instructions are also available on vendor sites.  --Poser Performance--  I tested this program on a five-year old HP media center PC, with a Core 2 Duo E6600 processor, four gigs of RAM, and a 250GB platter drive at 3 Gigabit/s transfer speed. Run on Windows 7 Home Premium.  It works in default settings, but definitely moves sluggishly. Even small props take several seconds to load, and textures may be delayed by an additional few seconds. Moving the models around can bring a touch of stutter if you have a room loaded and there are a number of lighting or particle effects in the scene. The program also crashed on me a couple times, which I suspect has more to do with system limitations than the software.  Since then, I've used the program for work on a custom Intel machine with a i5-2500, DZ68 mobo, 8 GBs of 1600 mhz RAM, and a Radeon HD6850. I boot the app off a Crucial M4 solid state drive, and store the content on a WD Caviar Black platter drive--both SATA III. Booting is initally slow, but after a few sessions the cache catches up and it loads just a little slower than my Adobe apps. Models can be moved smoothly, scenes render faster, and there is much less texture popping.  On that note, 64-bit processors have been commercially available for a few years now, and anybody who seriously uses Poser is going to have more than 4 gigs of RAM. So it would be helpful to have an x64 bit version of the software. While some Operating Systems can allocate more to their 32-bit programs, Windows usually caps them at about 3.2 - 3.4 GBs.  --Applause--  Overall, Poser 9 is more of a "prosumer" product than something for beginners or hobbyists. For the latter crowd I'd consider the Debut version of the program before sinking your cash into this one. Yet it's accessibility and utility is scalable, from simple still poses to animation. It can also support a great deal of Daz Studio content in addition to the library of Poser material already available on the web, some of it free and some of it spendy. The lack of 64 bit support and a GUI that could be a little more friendly for me keep it from five stars. Neither of those are reasons to pass this program up.  Pending Update: comparison to Daz Studio Pro.	1
Poser 9  is easier to learn than&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/LightWave-3D-7-5-Windows-Mac-Duo-Dongle/dp/B000069LH6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">LightWave 3D 7.5 Windows/Mac Duo-Dongle</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Autodesk-Maya-2012-Includes-1-year-Autodesk-Subscription/dp/B005Y355HG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Autodesk Maya 2012 -- Includes 1 year Autodesk Subscription</a>&nbsp;. It's also sold at a much cheaper price point. In my opinion it's aimed at the hobbyist , but it can be used by professionals as well.  A plus is that both the Mac and PC versions are included. Recommended for the novice but expect a learning curve. A minus, intuitive  interface  aside, is the lack of a printed manual.	1
For users interested in rendering people quickly, an obvious first choice is usually Poser. It's been around for a long time and has changed hands many times, now owned by Smith Micro which also makes&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Anime-Studio-Pro-8/dp/B0052VKP0W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Anime Studio Pro 8</a>. Getting started with Poser is very easy. I consider myself an advanced graphics user and this was my first exposure to Poser 9. Even without reading any documentation, I was able to dive right in and get started messing around with the controls, importing a preset figure onto the stage, rotating it around and changing the body position and limbs. There are lots of presets for male and female figures of different ethnicities, ages, and body shapes (child, adult, male, female, etc). It's quite easy to modify the existing models and export them for other purposes. I have seen on the web, for example, artists who use Poser standard models as a starting point for superhero/comic scenes. For architectural renderings, for example, it's easy export the models into other software packages. You could also use the pre-rigged figures for games and shave hours or even days off character modeling and set up. Other industries that can use Poser include comics, fashion, textbook illustration, advertising, and anywhere that needs to include humans and anthropomorphic figures.  For the novice, the camera tools, rotation, zoom, etc are very intuitive. The other feature like hair are not. I played for about 30 minutes without any luck growing hair onto my model. This is something I'm going to have to read the documentation on and go through in tutorials. Thankfully, Smith Micro has a support site with over 100 tutorials on a widely diverse set of topics and a community site with users contributing tips and answers to questions. If you are disinclined to learn 3D modeling and be content with purchasing pre-made objects, models, and clothes to pose, that's an option too. A large market exists for pre-rigged model bundles.  As for the physical product itself, it comes well presented in a DVD case, though the included booklet inside is too thick to fit inside. Many software makers cut corners and only give you a DVD in a paper sleeve these days, so the inclusion of a proper case and printed materials is greatly appreciated. You get the Mac and PC version with the price, another welcome feature. For dual platform users like me, this is great.  I installed it on my white plastic iMac Intel Core 2 Duo w 3GB RAM which is about 5 years old now. Performance at times isn't great and I sometimes have to wait for the screen to redraw. It'll just be filled with garbage until the processor catches up and repaints the menus and such. I've had it crash a few times, but otherwise, no major complaints.	1
I really want to use this software.  I have all the recommended minimums for this software, but it takes a long time to do anything.  I get the "no response from progam" error quite often and then it just doesn't recover.  I have to shut down manually.  I have reinstalled it with no satisfaction.  I hope to upgrade my computer and get a better video card and maybe this will help the problem.  I'm sad that I can't use this software as I was so excited to get it.	-1
Poser 9 is definitely a winner! If you are familiar with Poser Debut, you will have no problem pulling in your projects and getting right into the meat of designing with Poser 9. While Poser 9 is more expensive than Poser Debut, it has a lot more options for those who are serious about their design and development skills. Poser 9 installs fairly quickly and doesn't affect performance much from my experience. If you haven't used Poser, you might want to try Poser Debut until you get the hang of it to make sure you like the interface and design features. But, when you are ready, Poser 9 is a great product!	1
The last version of Poser I worked with was Poser 4 back in 2000.  Wow, have the graphics improved since then!  I'm amazed at how realistic these graphics are.  It is great to see that Poser has kept the layout, menu system and buttons relatively the same over the years.  I had very little difficulty jumping straight from Poser 4 to Poser 9.  The controls are intuitive and the menus do not clutter the screen.  Much of the menu system is in a multi-tiered top menu bar, and not cluttering the sidebars.  The great layout leaves much of the screen space for the 3D model I'm working on.  This is the way it should be!  I'm a PC Photoshop user by trade - graphic design for part-time website work and business promotional material.  It was easy to jump into Poser and not need to re-learn a totally different type of layout.  I look forward to playing around with Poser 9 and integrating some of the awesome graphics in future design projects.	1
If you're anywhere between an amateur cartoonist and a professional animator or crime scene investigator, Poser 9 can make your job easier or just be a barrel of fun. It is designed to interface with your Wacom pressure-sensitive tablet. (I have one, and find this software takes morphing to a new level.) But having a Wacom is hardly a requirement; it's just that I personally like to create my own additions to the models Poser 9 offers rather than buying them.  I've always dabbled in the graphic arts and am fascinated with techniques of color and texture. Therefore, I totally love the translucency feature and the ability to spotlight an object ...and all the lighting effects. I am finding Poser 9 to be intuitive - though I haven't yet learned all its tricks - will update as I do.  Others have written long reviews repeating the specs given by the producer on the Amazon page. That's their business. I'm just gonna tell you that I like it so far, and why.	1
Poser 9 is a greatly detailed and fun 3-D art program for your Mac and PC.  If you're looking for something to create either animation or 3-D art using a Poser program then you will definitely want to get a hold of this.  The software is compatible with either a Mac or PC and it's a whole lot of fun.  Be forewarned, Poser 9 is not for the amateur and you will need a lot of practice and patience to get use to the controls and the expansiveness of the program.  But once you do get the hang of it, its all good.  If you are looking to step your game up in 3-D poser art & animation then you'll want to get this program today.	1
If you've always wanted to be an artist or animator, but lacked some of the basic skills Poser 9 is a tool that everyone from the beginner to the seasoned pro can benefit from.  New and improved features such as subsurface scattering can make your figures appear much more realistic.  For example, if you choose to utilize this feature your figures will no longer look like a cheap wax imitation, but rather it will take on a more life-like, photographic appearance.  You will now be able to take what you visualize and make it come to life.  Many people felt that Poser 8 was somewhat "buggy" and challenging, but so far I haven't hit any snags.  Essentially, for those who are unfamiliar with Poser, you begin with a mannequin-like posed figure you can develop into a 3-D figure utilizing your own vision.  For the beginner there is a steep, but extremely satisfying learning curve.  Those who have used any of the previous versions of Poser will be exited with the new features.  I've listed them below and given a brief overview of what you will be seeing.  Advantages of the NEW FEATURES:  * Real-time OpenGL Scene Preview:  With real-time OpenGL (Graphics Library) you'll be able to produce high-quality  3-D images and will be able to work more quickly to produce the image you want.  Less rendering time and errors with your final product.  * SubSurface Scattering:  This feature enables the user to capture the characteristics of bioluminescence in a character rendering it more realistic.  For example, when you looked at teeth in earlier programs they appeared to be a solid white when in reality they are slightly translucent.  This feature captures light and redistributes it more realistically.  * Rendering Performance Improvements:  In a nutshell, this feature is like path tracing, enabling lighting and movement to be as close as possible to the "real" thing.  Poser 9 has made an excellent attempt to listen to the user and improve upon illumination issues.  *  Weigh Map Rigging:  This feature makes the character more flexible and keeps unsightly bulges from emanating.  Your eyes won't be drawn to a Gumby-like figure, but rather one that is smooth and realistic.  For example, you can pose finger joints, making movements more flexible and natural (ThumbBend, IndexBend, MiddleBend, RingBend, PinkyBend).  *  Grouping Objects:  It's easy to set and manage the stage you wish to create.  This is especially useful if you want a complex background.  *  Expanded Context Menus:  This feature is fun to experiment with.  You can quickly access and change your scene with Context Menus.  Take for example, you don't like a particular piece of clothing that Victoria has, it can easily be changed.  If you want her to Ogg boots you can quickly change them in a second.  *  Full Scene Category in Library:  If you have previously created a scene, there is no need to fully recreate it.  It can easily be dragged to a new scene from your library.  *  Multi-select Drag and Drop from Library:  If you have several items you want to put on Aiko, it is amazingly easy with this feature.  You simply gather them all up, drag them, and they are auto-conformed instantly.  *  Morph Tool Tablet Support:  If you have a pressure sensitive tablet like the&nbsp;&nbsp;you'll be able to make precision paintings if you like to do your own background work.  *  Constraint Channels and Constraint Objects:  This feature simply makes it easier, smoother, and more interesting when your figure catches or shoots an object such as a baseball.  *  Light Casting Objects:  This feature helps tremendously when you want to use dome-based lighting.  You won't see this when you are rendering, but when you are done it will be there.  *  Frame Object Camera:  You can easily zoom in on an area you are working on, thereby saving time and easing frustration.  You won't have to go back to the same spot for correction several times.  *  Rotation Object Mode:  This will allow your camera to work on a specific section of your work from several different angles as you visualize your end product.  *  Faster Dynamic Hair:  Instead of using polygons, lines are used.  You can select the density of the hair and it is rendered faster than ever before.  *  Pre-render Texture Caching:  Textures are preloaded and when you are finished with a session you can cache your work.  Most of the people who will be using Poser 9 most likely will be using it for pleasure as I am.  If you are a professional, you may wish to consider taking a look at&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Poser-Pro-2012/dp/B005LXONE0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Poser Pro 2012</a>, but for now I'd recommend staying with Poser 9 as it offers a lot for the amateur artist or animator.  Features that Poser 2012 has include Queue Manager/Network Render Queue, Background Rendering, 64-bit Application and Firefly Render Engine, High Dynamic Range Image (HDRI) Export, PoserFusion Hosting Plug-Ins, and GammaCorrection/Linear Rendering.  For those who already have Poser 8 and are considering an upgrade there are enough features to make it worthwhile, especially improvements in the interface and workflow. For example, you get the Expanded Context Menus, Full Body Morph Import, Full Body Morph Deletion, Grouping Objects, Frame Object Camera, Rotate Object Camera, and the Hierarchical Scene Inventory display.  I would have liked to have seen a book considering that most people will be using this as a leisure/fun, experimental tool.  There is, however, a cardboard foldout that illustrates the main interface, pose room, palettes and controls, cloth room and setup room, hair room and face room, animation, material room and rendering, and a list of keyboard shortcuts.  There are small black and white visuals, but they are very small.  It won't be long before tutorials show up on the Internet that will help with this minor issue.  It's a great tool and one of the best features is that one purchase gets you DVDs for Windows & Mac.	1
That is a direct quote from the FTM knowledge base AnswerID 1403.  Even more frustrating, printing 8.5 inch x 10 foot charts did work well using my desktop Epson Photo R800 printer with FTM 2011, but ceased working when I upgraded to FTM 2012. In FTM 2011, Page Setup in the Chart Options box correctly read the user defined page size settings entered via Windows and the usual Epson interface. FTM 2012 ignores those settings and defaults to 8-1/2 x 11 even when roll is specified as the printer source.  So I'm uninstalling FTM 2012 and going back to FTM 2011.  By the way, I upgraded mainly to get the new Print Box on chart feature. Let's just say its capabilities are modest compared to similar features in other software. You can specify font, outline box, etc. only once, so there can be no variety in text added to a chart.  And FTM 2012 is definitely slower than FTM 2011 as many have noted.	-1
Doing genealogy research will consume you and this product makes it very easy for you to spend your money and time on Ancestry.com!  You get a 30 day free trial but it is never enough time.  I purchased extra months until my husband had to squash my new obsession on filling the family tree.  I know that this is a vehicle to get people to spend $20 or more a month on the website.  Set yourself limits or this seemingly inexpensive program will turn into an expensive investment.  I have loved using the program to find out how I am really an American mutt whose line goes back seemingly everywhere.  I learned about how my hubby is distantly related to a Native American chief.  Cool stuff.  The program itself is OK to use.  I can imagine computer savvy people can even just guess their way through using it by trial and error.  There is a video tutorial and a quick start guide you can use for direction.  I just liked getting in there and clicking & trying to see what happened.  I read other reviews that commented on it being more difficult than it needs to be, so be warned. Overall it has been worth it just for the information I gained about me.	1
I've not used other versions of Family Tree Maker, but as other reviewers have noted, this version seems a bit slow to start-up and connect to ancestry.com. Also, I found out the hard way that if I close my laptop before I close Family Tree Maker, the link to ancestry is permanently lost and I have to re-sync the trees. With that said though, I do enjoy the charting and reporting features, information on generations, data organization, and the ability to publish books. Overall, I think it is definitely worth the price and can be very helpful to organize family history, even if it does take a couple minutes to start-up and sync.	1
I use Ancestry.com and this is a companion product.  Trees in Ancestry can be downloaded and printed in more formats than Ancestry has available.  Very worthwhile item.	1
I have used many versions of FTM.  I will leave the details to others but I find this version cumbersome and confusing.  I think they put out new versions sometimes just to get more sales, not to improve the product.  In particular, I find it hard to navigate through the tree.  It used to be a family unit was on the screen and you could click on any one of them...then fill in their relatives...then that would lead to others.  It was logical and intuitive.  It is definitely not now.  They really need to simplify the interface and the navigation.	-1
First off, there appear to be several reviews talking about how this program is slow, and is a pain if you were using previous versions.  I can't speak to the latter there, this was my first ever copy or iteration of this software. It worked fine for me!  Granted, I don't have hundreds of people in here, and oodles of data and multimedia to content with.  Perhaps it bloats out if you have an enormous tree, but it was't the case for me.  I like the way it's laid out, and being a newcomer to the overall genre, I don't have a ton of experience with other pieces of software to compare it to.  To that, I won't have a ton to write about in this review.  I'm a genealogy newbie, and I got the software, installed it, ran updates, and started to use it.  No problems in any regard.  I enjoyed it, and if you're just starting out, you probably will, too.	1
I had been interested in joining ancestry.com for a long time and I am happy that getting this software gave me the excuse to join the site.  However, the software itself doesn't provide any features that make purchasing it worth while.  I didn't really find anything that was worth purchasing the software as opposed to just using the web site.  Also, I did find some problems with keeping my online family tree in sync with the software version. Sometimes the software just seemed to hang.  I also found the web site version easier to use and found myself using that version instead of the software.  So my answer is not to waste your money on the software.  If you are interested in joining ancestry.com then just go to the website.	-1
If you are interested in your family history and want to create your family tree, the Family Tree Essentials is a great way to get started. I used to have a very old version of Family Tree Maker, so I was interested to see this new version. The 2012 version has a lot of features that my old one did not. There is also a free trial to Ancestry.com included, so you can get some serious research done during your trial period, which is a great plus of the software. If you are an advanced user of family tree software, you may find this software to be too simple. However, if you are new to family tree makers or just have a really old version, you should consider this 2012 version.	1
I had higher expectations for a program such as FTM.  It seemed mainly designed to get you to sign up for monthly billing of Ancestry.com.  You cannot access your free month trial of ancestry without a valid credit card, which will then turn into recurring billing until you cancel the account.  At first I wondered why would I need never ending access to a website; then as I spent hours finding virtually nothing I realized this family tree investigation would take a lot of time.  And unfortunately with little result for me.  I found the interface not as user friendly when entering extended family members and manually building my Tree.  I admit this is my first (and last, for the time being) shot at creating a family tree because it wasn't as simple, nor fun to do, as it seemed.	-1
I get all the updates to this software because it just gets better all the time.  I've used all the major family tree packages and this one is just the best one available.  The linking to Ancestry.com isn't perfect, but it does work and with some extra steps to save things you can make it work very well.	1
love this product!	1
Ancsstry.com has put on the market a software upgrade that is anything but - DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY IN FTW 2014 if you have any intention of working on-line and uploading your data to the black hole of Calcutta. You risk losing all your hard-won insight into your family ancestry, as the software has more glitches than the B-24 in WWII or the Boeing 787 of today. The "sync" function is a time trap and effort-waster, and the fixes proposed do not work. The lines are always busy when you call for help, and even if you get through, the operators are more interested in reading their scripts from the screen in front of them than in finding a solution.  Ancestry is aware of the problem - but keeps right on selling this trash code, gathering in the $$$ and laughing at the suckers who fall for the idea that a firm in Provo, Utah couldn't possibly be so evil as to take money under false pretenses.  I have used FTM for more than 10 years, and while there were troubles at times, they were minor, and fixes quickly made. Not now. And not again will I buy something from ancestry.com without a written guarantee that the program has been thoroughly tested, and - more importantly - that even if I drop my subscription to ancestry, which is more than $200 a year for full data, any data links to source material will still be valid.  Beware the Provo bandits!	-1
This product seemed easy to work with. I found it so easy, I bought another copy for my Dad as a gift when he expressed interest in genealogy. I've used earlier version and they seem to just get better... easier on the eyes and more intuitive to use. I've got no real complaints, this seems to work quite well.  I've read other reviews saying that FTM can wipe out your tree. As with any software product, you should always be backing up your work anyway. Continual backups = piece of mind and less computer issues.	1
My family has enjoyed researching our genealogy with the Family Tree Maker 2012.  A three month ancestry.com membership is included.  I like that you can back up your records to your computer and an external hard drive.  You can also get an iPad / iPhone app to accompany this product, which is nice for showing family members your findings on the go (i.e. at a family reunion).  Overall this is a fun product and we've been able to discover interesting facts about our family tree.	1
I sat on this product for a long time until my mother and I were able to sit down and map out the basics of our known history.  The software is simple to use, easy to access, edit, save.  Multiple ways of entry, interface, and recommendations are provided.  This is one of the easiest tools to use and it is a great method of capturing legacies of ancestors ... not just names and dates.  It is a great gift for adults and, with tweaking, it can be very interesting for teaching children about their families.  I give this software a grade of A-.	1
I love the program and how easy it makes family genealogy tracking.  It has lots of options and additions; I love the fact that it automatically has a membership to ancestry... enough so that it got me in a mad rush to finish my genealogy before the trial was up.  That being said, it has a few flaws.  1- it's pretty much the same as ancestry.com. I do like having the program ON my computer and not necessarily having to log into Ancestry. But I'm unsure why, other than that, they made a program that isn't any different than their online program.  2- online ancestry is easier to search and get around than the program. I end up doing all my searching online, then syncing my program to the online tree (a great feature, by the way!).  So I wish I could work in the program and search from there but it doesn't work as well.  3- syncing isn't always easy, especially with blending multiple trees. I wish it would blend easier.  Other than that, I love the program. I like the fact that I can add additional notes in there that are not viewable online; for instance notes about my parents which I don't want public but I do want to have around for my children. They can access this in the future.	1
I love how easy it is to chase down the various branches of our family tree with this program used in tandem with Ancestry.com. We've discovered so much about folks, it's even helped us figure out who the heck is in some of the family photos with only a first name scribbled on the back.  Before I used Family Tree Maker, I'd dabble a bit in our ancestry, but it would all get confusing and overwhelming to the point that it was no longer fun. Now Family Tree Maker keeps track of all the threads, and all I have to do is focus on one person, fill in the information, and Family Tree Maker keeps it all straight.  The only downside is the cost of Ancestry.com annual membership, which is relatively expensive if you get the World option. I understand a need to make this a pay-service, but the cost is prohibitive for those of us who just enjoy dabbling in family history, rather than making it our main hobby.  Family Tree Maker is a well-made program, and can be used as a stand-alone without Ancestry.com, but the ability to look up individuals and research census data is really invaluable and only easily obtainable with the online membership.	1
This is great software for the home researcher, and works equally as well if you are highly experienced or just getting stared on your family tree. It was easy to install and easy to use to build my family tree. I have not had the opportunity to use all of the advanced features of the software, but for the basics, it is more than adequate. The 3 month membership to Ancestry.com is great becuase it is almost impossible to do any serious or extensive research without using that website! Have fun!	1
I've been fascinated with our family tree since I was little as part of the family was REALLY into researching ancestors.  Unfortunately, the one who promised to document everything and share decided to change their mind, so I'm going to start fresh, and as a novice, this program is pretty helpful.  Please note that I have NOT used the free 3 months to Ancestry.com yet.  I want to get a little more done and explored on my own before I use that.  I had no problems installing the software or loading it.  I'm making a point to regularly save a back-up of my work, and when I'm more comfortable and have a lot of time, I'm going to really put that 3 month free access to Ancestry to work for me!  Meanwhile, there are some great video tutorials and a helpful book to help me along when and if I run into any issues.  The software makes it easy to work on your family tree, and so far I'm having a great time simply talking to relatives and filling in what we know.  There are even places to save pictures and stories, as well as other documents.  This is really a great tool for a novice to work with.  Just remember to make sure you back-up your work.	1
THE QUICK TAKE:  Family Tree Maker 2012 is useful as a tool to organize and collect your information and related media (photos, documents, stories) about your family history.  However, the really powerful tool is Ancestry.com.  Ancestry should help you greatly expand what you know, not just organize what you know.  FTM 2012 Deluxe includes a three month membership to Ancestry.com, so if you use it well you can get a lot of value from this package.  Before I get into the details of the review, some general advice:   - Talk to your older living relatives now, while they are still around.  Try to get the stories, copies of photos, find out who is in the photos, and so on.  You won't be able to do that later.   - Keep backup copies of all your files, and backup your files before you make any substantial changes or sync your tree.  Work on the assumption that you will have computer problems or a hard drive failure, because at some point you will.  You're going to put a lot of work into your family history, you want to make sure you always have a copy.  GET PREPARED BEFORE YOU START:  To protect the privacy of living people, government records aren't made available for decades.  So before you start using Ancestry and FTM, try to find out some details about your parents and your grandparents - birth, marriage, death, places they lived.  Then you'll be able to start to link to the publicly available information online.  Without information on your recent ancestors, it will be hard to get very far.  FAMILY TREE MAKER IS USEFUL:  FTM is a useful tool.  It seems reasonably easy to use even for those less expert at using the web and computers.  For example, there are tools to allow you to capture text and photos from the web.  The tutorials are worth reviewing.  They are well done, brief, and will help get you started on key tasks.  The software can also do some tasks that you can't currently do on the website, such as split and join trees.  For me, the software installed easily on an older XP machine.  It needs .net 4.0 to run, so will install that if it's not already installed.  FTM Deluxe 2012 comes on 2 CDs, one with the software and the other with the PDF books in the Family History Took Kit (see below for a list).  REGISTER LATER?  When you first run Family Tree Maker, it asks if you want to register the software.  You may want to wait to register, as that seems to start your three months subscription to Ancestry.  You may want to organize yourself a little, and get the basic facts about your family, before you go online.  ANCESTRY.COM IS POWERFUL:  I was able to find a lot of additional information about the ancestors I knew I had, and turn up some new ancestors and new connections.  I found Ancestry's hints and matching to be useful, but then I guess I don't mind searching through dozens of possible matches to see which ones are a fit.  CHECK ALTERNATE SPELLINGS:  Census records are surprisingly uneven in terms of the accuracy of names.  If you can't find what you're looking for, try searching on alternate spellings of a name.  INCLUDE THE WHOLE FAMILY:  Even if your interest is primarily in your ancestors, it's very useful to add the data about all their siblings to your tree, for two reasons.  First, it's incredibly helpful to match the data when you have more than just one person.  Knowing the names and ages of siblings can make it clear whether another record is your family, or not.  It helps confirm a link when a name is common, or when there are mis-spellings.  Second, it makes the story much more interesting to see who was in your ancestor's family and what was happening in their lives.  BE SKEPTICAL:  There are a lot of mistakes in the family trees already online, so don't assume that someone else has done their homework unless there is backup.  KEEP TRACK OF YOUR SOURCES:  Don't rely on your memory.  Make notes and add documents to support the info in your tree.  CENSUS DATA IS INTERESTING, REALLY!:  I found myself surprised at the amount of data in the census.  It collects several interesting facts if you review it carefully.  It's also interesting to see what happens over time to families - the joy of births, tragedy of deaths and mysteries of life. (For example, why was great grandma living apart from great grandpa, and telling the census she was a widow?)  DON'T UNDERESTIMATE GOOGLE:  I chuckled a little that FTM includes Google as a link.  But it's probably not obvious to everyone, and so it's worth saying.  I've turned up a lot of useful information searching on Google, though it really helps to use a targeted search and to try a few alternatives.  CHECK ROOTSWEB:  There are a number of family trees on RootsWeb as well.  It's worth searching for your family.  It can be a useful starting point in your research, but be sure to verify the information, and also make sure it's really your family.  PLAN ON A LONG PROCESS:  Most people spend a little time over years or decades collecting information about their family.  While you can make a lot of progress in a short time, filling out more details or finding new ancestors can take a long time.  CANCELING IS EASY:  Note that if you don't want your subcription to auto-renew, you need to cancel it.  You can do that anytime, and still use the balance of your subscription.  It takes several clicks online, but it's not hard to cancel.  PRINTED MANUAL INCLUDED:  I appreciate that they have included a printed manual for the software.  That's a corner that many other companies cut to save costs, a false saving in my opinion.  FAMILY HISTORY TOOL KIT:  The following PDFs are included as part of the Family History Tool Kit.  They look like useful information, but don't feel that you need to read them to get started.   - Abbreviations and Acronyms: A Guide for Family Historians - List and explanation of abbreviations and acronyms found in census schedules, soundex indexes, mortality schedules, court records, etc.   - Ancestry's Concise Genealogical Dictionary - Definitions of unusual terms, especially in cemetery, probate, court, medical, etc.   - Hidden Sources: Family History in Unlikely Places - Overview of sources that are often overlooked, where and how they can be found, etc.   - Printed Sources: A Guide to Published Genealogical Records - Guide to printed sources such as vital records, definitions and explanations of how to use them.   - The Official Guide to Ancestry.com - Become more proficient with searching the site. Explore obscure databases you didn't know existed. Create and develop your own family tree.   - The Official Guide to RootsWeb - How to use RootsWeb, and success stories of the RootsWeb Community.	1
this is fun, and our whole family got to be involved. it is easy to do to. what i liked is figuring out people on your tree and places you never even thought of.	1
I've been using the service on and off for years so I've got a long, though not expert background in their software.  The thing I used to hate about them was the interface of their software.  Their databases were awesome, but the software left much to be desired.  About five years or so ago they redesigned their software suite.  At first the improved interface was beset with a lot of teething problems.  I stayed away for a few years and finally came back last year and picked up the 2011 version.  That was a HUDGE leap forward over what I was used too.  Better interface, better web integration, better features.  I got the chance to try out the 2012 version so I decided to give it a try.  So far I don't see a lot of changes from 2011.  I just recently tried the iPhone app.  That was clever, and I've used it a few times to look up something during a lunch conversation, but I don't see it being of real use to me.  If you find yourself in the library a lot this would probably be a great way to update information.  So if you've got an old version of FTM then I say go for the upgrade.  If you've got the 2011 version then I don't see a big reason to make the leap.	1
My wife bought and used virtually every Family Tree Maker edition for many years up until the time she passed away in 2004. Before FTM she used PAF. I used earlier versions of FTM a few times, but I never even approached the level she did. A few days ago I installed Family Tree Maker 2012 Premium after I finally located the backup disks from over eight years ago. The 2012 FTM software loaded the old database and converted it flawlessly. To my amazement, there were over 19,750 names and just over 7000 families in her database! It will be fairly straightforward to add another 250 names to hit the 20,000 mark.  It took me a short while to learn how to use the new software and make updates, but only a few hours. I found it more intuitive than Version 8. Since I never used Version 8 very much, others might have a different opinion. I did a trial and error approach to learning, but finally had to resort to the manual. There is a relatively thick FTM book that came with the software, but I found it easier to just make a Google search on the specific topic I wanted to know.  And I was able to find answers to the topics every time with almost no effort. The step by step illustrated instructions are very good.  I made some updates to my wife's database and signed up for the Ancestry.com 6 month free trial. Then I uploaded the entire database to the Ancestry website.  Then the Ancestry web site found several other FTM databases that compared to branches on my family tree. There were a few minor differences, but I was absolutely delighted how accurate my wife's tree information was. Of course, I still have some refinements to make.  I admit that I never would have done so much research to create such an extensive tree structure dating back over 600 years. I'm just thankful I was able to finally recover all her hard work.  You can add extensive notes and link photos, citations and many other things to any individual in the database. It has provisions for multiple marriages and children to the relevant spouse. But it will only display one spouse at a time. It allows you to pick a preferred default spouse. I wish it would display the full tree without being required to select each spouse separately. It has a provision to show foster children's families and name changes, but I have not tried to do that.  I read about it while I was learning some other things.  The performance seems very good in spite of the size of the database I have, but I am using a fast Intel i7 CPU based system with lots of RAM and two solid state disks - one for the operating system and one for the FTM files. But I think it will perform well on most modern computers. Before I installed the new FTM software, I installed Version 8 on a computer that is definitely not high speed with the same large database file. That computer handled it just fine.  The Platinum version is the one to buy. The six month free subscription to Ancestry.com is well worth the difference in price. There is a gold mine of information on Ancestry.com that can link up and compare to your own family tree saving you countless hours of research.  Without the Ancestry link, you would be wasting so much time trying to do everything by yourself. Very likely your family tree is already on Ancestry.com to some degree, perhaps back even hundreds of years.  I don't understand the picky points some people make about this product and the low scores. I'm sure they may have a very technical point to make, but it doesn't warrant anything less than 4 stars. For the average user, this is superb software and a welcome addition to any family. I strongly recommend this excellent software.	1
I set this up on my computer and I think that having everything at hand's length is great for someone who is new to the game.  It is definitely overwhelming when you first dip your toe in - to see all the information that is out there, and if you get a hit right away, forget it - you are hooked.  That makes the initial 6 months free all worth it for the subscription.  Anyway - My step-dad started poking around with it on the computer - he's now if full ancestor mode, and he's found relatives in New York he didn't know about - an uncle, I believe - and they are sharing pictures.  It is wonderful to see the amazement on his face.  I think a trip to Germany is in the offing for the parents next :)	1
Family Tree Maker is the premiere geneology software available for consumers, and has tremendous capabilities for discovery, tracking, and creating documentation to share. It is also very time-demanding to use, both from a learning curve aspect and from a product usage aspect. It can also be expensive in the long-run if you maintain a subscription to Ancestry.com. I have casually used other geneology software years ago, and this package beats previous generations hands down in it's professional interface and plethora of features. Cooperative efforts over the internet through TreeSync with other family members can be a force multiplier. One newer feature, the photo editor, is a waste for me, since I have several other more capable software packages, but for some it may be helpful. If you have a great deal of time available to explore the software and web site, Family Tree Maker Platinum could be a powerful discovery and documentation tool. Frankly, I'm not as committed to tracking my geneology as this software requires.	1
I'm a long-time fan of Ancestry.com and their products, and this was not a let down. They have an extensive depth to their products, and allow you to create a wonderful history that you can easily share with others. This is not something that you need to buy ever year, even though they put one out every year. The updates they have done since last year's release aren't that substantial that it warrants paying the money for. But every other year or few years, yes. Better editing and searching capabilities, and general fine-tuning make it worth it at that point.  If you're not familiar with the products, FTM offers your standard build-a-tree and supplies the capability to enter in a large amount of data. It can handle upwards of 2,500 names, allows for records and pictures to be associated with one or several people, and even states the relation between you and the person you are looking at or editing. You can sync the software and the online information easily, but I prefer to leave my separate. I use the free trial that comes with the software to gather as much data as I can. If I even smell something that might be a hint, I grab it up. Once my time is over, I use it to sort through things. If I come across something I need to investigate further, I purchase individual records where I can, or make note of it for the next time I buy it.  If you are looking to get into genealogy, this is a great way to get started. I highly recommend any of the FTM products. They have great support, the members are friendly, and you'll have cousins coming out of the woodwork!	1
This really causes problems on my computer.  At first I thought it was because I had installed it on my mom's older computer since that is where we do all our research.  However, it also freezes up and causes problems on my brand new desktop.	-1
This is such a great tool for researching your roots and recording your family tree. These are two distinct tasks: researching and recording. Researching your background is where you find relatives you never knew you had. Recording is where you save the results of your research and report them to your future generations.  The 90-day free access to the Ancestry genealogy records is outstanding. After 90 days, there is a monthly fee and the fee is pretty significant. Check their website for pricing.  One misconception about the research service is that you can find your living and recent relatives. I don't know all the details, but there are privacy restrictions that prevent the web service from giving you info on living people.  All in all, the software tool and the online service are really incredible, but they're not cheap. I recommend you don't activate the 90 day service until you know your calendar is free enough that you'll be able to actually use it. Otherwise, you won't get the full benefit from the service before your 90 days elapse.  Researching your family's past really is an incredible journey. My mother traced one branch of our tree back to the Mayflower. Obviously this research wasn't simple. I can't even imagine how much easier it would have been for her with a product like this.  Have fun with your personal history!	1
I've used Family Tree Maker for many years now, as well as ancestry.com.  If you find that ancestry.com is a bit cumbersome at times, you should give the software a try.  Family Tree Maker isn't a fully polished software application, but it does get the job done and when it comes genealogy it's one of the few choices to complete the job.  Deciding between the various versions of Family Tree Maker should be fairly simple as there are few noticeable differences.  Every year or two I will buy the newest version simply to get the ancestry.com membership that is included with the software.  The Essentials version gives you 1 month of ancestry.com access, the Deluxe gives 3 months and the Platinum 6 months.  The platinum also includes some photo software and an additional gift copy, but those are the differences worth noting in my opinion.  Using ancestry.com is much more interactive and it has a cleaner interface, but the FTM software provides better importing and exporting features.  I tend to find myself working much faster in FTM than I do online.  Is the 2012 version worth an upgrade from previous versions?  Like I said, I often upgrade simply for the ancestry.com membership that is included.  New to 2012 is the Tree Sync, but it wasn't super impressive.  They have also improved some of the guides/tutorials and editing options.  Overall, the interface has gotten cleaner, but I still the only true reason for an immediate upgrade is for the membership when you need it.	1
After shelling out for the 2011 version of Family Tree Maker Platinum, I waited with bated breath for the 2012 version to grace my doorstep.  Not because I loved 2011, but because *anything* had to be better than 2011. I'm sorry to report, 2012 is basically more of the same.  More of the same "Did someone write this in&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Microsoft-Access/dp/B004MNDVN4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Microsoft Access</a>?" More of the same "Why doesn't this look like it does online?" More of the same "But I can't just export everything I have on the site to a 'nice' format I can share with others?" More of the same "Why can't I just enter a license code, instead of having to call and get them to stop billing my credit card for six months' worth of service?"  If you haven't been using genealogy software for some time, Family Tree Maker is a pretty hateful application to fight with -- but, it also costs about half of what you'd pay for the included six months' service.  If you have been using the Family Tree Maker series up through the more recent iterations, you're not going to have to learn anything new to step in to 2012. That's probably the only real feature it offers over 2011.	-1

If you own a HP with an AMD Athlon x4 processor running  64 bit Win7 this software is a potential nightmare.  I spend 4 hours installing (and uninstalling) three (3) times with no success.  FTM 2012 regularly crashed when merging data from Ancestry.com and crashed 100% when printing a report.  Upon reporting these issues to Ancestry.com customer service I was rewarded with a link to a  7-page "canned" solution to the problem I experienced.  Obviously this software has experienced these same issues since FTM 2008 (5 YEARS) on XP, Vista, & Win 7.  Their solution is to blame every other product (Windows 7, net.framework, HP PC's,  HP printer drivers, security software, a corrupted user account, MSE 3.0, a damaged FTM database and every other potential excuse except the most obvious.  Their "fix" included disabling security software, updating Windows, updating net.framework 4, re-installing MSE 3.0, updating printer drives, and manually re-installing FTM 2012.  Each suggestion appeared reasonable excepting the manual uninstall which include the use of RegEdit to  manually delete several keys in the registry - a dangerous proposition for the average PC user!  Another 5 hours invested (+ 100 hours frustration) and no solution.  The final straw was their instruction to manually toggle through all keys in the WoW6432node, locate any reference to FRM 2012, and delete the entire key.  Wow! on my HP machine this represented 196 keys to be scanned, analyzed, and deleting  (hopefully)  the correct key.  We have now expanded the fix to realm of crashing systems.  I wonder how many systems have been rendered useless as a result?  Fortunately I located a fix for the printing problem at[...].  A solution that addresses the issue and actually works - what a concept!  The merge issue still exists with no solution from Ancestry.com.  The bottom line is Family Tree Maker is buggy, unreliable, and contains unresolved issues that have been known for years!  Purchase at your own risk and be prepared for an adventure (unsupported).  Ancestry.com should be ashamed!  This product is without value.	-1
I built a family tree more than 20 years ago, the old fashioned way, on paper.  I based in on interviews with grandparents, parents and cousins. There was no internet database in those days, and documents were extremely difficult to come by.  Even a visit to Ellis Island did not produce information concerning the ship on which my paternal grandmother arrived, as a child, with her mother, my great grandmother.  But this program is useful in any case, to add to the tree, and put everything in one place. It certainly offers a vast improvement over the only other family tree program I'd seen before ---- something put out by the Mormon church, and gifted to me by an uncle in-law fascinated with family lineage, including mine.  Good item. Glad to have it.	1
I installed the software on a Win 7 - 64 bit system.  Prior to testing I installed the latest software update.  The software worked very well with no stability issues or anything else.  I feel the "learning curve" required for using the software is reasonable with not too much difficulty.  One big "Pro" of this software package is that an extra install disc is provided so that you may give an additional copy to family or friends for their use.  Also included is a six month subscription to a genealogy data source.  This worked very well and was very impressive.  All in all I feel this product is excellent at its price point and is highly recommended.	1
Let me discuss most of the other reviews first, then I will get to mine. It is kind of important for a software company to nail their demographic when making a product. Its just the way it is that most people doing genealogy are going to be older adults. This is because as we get older it is more important to make a link with our time here. There are some younger people doing this to be sure but most I have met are generally older adults. Regarding that I believe they may have made this a tad bit user-unfriendly. If you are well versed in computers then you cannot even see why they are having an issue. Just getting my mother to move one window over another on the desktop takes me 5 minutes and I have been building PC's since the '80s it gets pretty frustrating. My recommendation to this company is to make an interface that mimics something found in an Apple product. Simple intuitive and foolproof.  ----------My review----------- Overview: Ok lets say I love this software! For the past year I have been putting all of my family history on Ancestry. It has been pretty good with regard to finding details out that I might not know. The main issue I have with Ancestry is the monthly cost. With this software you get 3 months deluxe US, which is almost 2x the cost of this product, for that alone its worth it.  Reports:(+) So what makes this software so great? The reports mostly. I have one branch of my tree go back to 1060. Thats more than can be shown on any tree available from Ancestry. The farthest you can go on the web is around 3 generations not 25 generations. With the reporting tools on this software you can get a variety of reports that flesh out your family. Ones such as marriage report listing whom everyone was married to. A generation report listing who was born under whom. Honestly there are too many to list here, each one is a very unique way to view a part of the story.  Seamless integration with Ancestry:(+) I lost not a single bit of data transferring it from the web down to my computer. All I did was log into ancestry from Family Tree Maker and it drew down all of the data in a GENCOM file. Once in the software it populated a local database with over a years worth of work. With my personal experience this was pretty great.  Trees:(+/-) Along with reports the trees available are all great tools for showing your family. I mean the software is Family Tree Maker it should also print out the trees. It does with some great designs. Unfortunately the trees on the software are also limited. I believe you can go back max 6 generations but then it stops. The designs are pretty good to show different relationships. Overall I would have liked more generations, knowing the tree would be physically huge but that is what I want to show.  Manual: (-) Holy cow! This is the most convoluted huge tome I have seen in a very long time for a manual. My advice; skip it. Nice effort on their part to add it but it makes even opening the box a daunting appearing task that might scare more users than help them.  Summary: (+/-) If you are a versed internet user/ computer operator you can expect this software to perform as an essential at-home addition to the work you have done on Ancestry. If you are just starting out on this journey it might be better for you to use the website first and then start using the software. Their website has much of the same interface and use along with other family members you may not know providing key pieces to your tree. I don't think of this as a solo tool but instead as an augmentation of another (Ancestry). As that, it excels.  Thank you for reading my review.	1
I don't use this product.  I got it to evaluate and, to some extent, compare it to Legacy Family Tree.  Family Tree Maker has lots of really cool bells and whistles but I found it a bit cumbersone.  The views are nice but not a large enough print for my old eyes to see well.  On the other hand Legacy is too big.  I have done genealogy for over 30 years and have thousands of family members in my database.  Family Tree Maker handled my database very well and it imported my GEDCOM (standard genealogy format)quickly and accuately.  It has a feature that allows you to validate your entries fairly quickly but given the number of names, places and dates that I have in my database it took the better part of two days to validate them.  It found obvious errors and even a few that really made me think through the information.  If I was not so proficient in Legacy I might consider going over to FTM.  This is a great program and one that has been tried and true for many years.  It may be difficult for a person just starting out in the family history area to learn quickly and Legacy or Personal Ancestral File from the LDS church may be a better way to start.	1
First, I've got to say big kudos to the Family Tree Maker for dropping the price for the 2012 Deluxe (currently about $44). You may not realize, but the 2011 version was $69 (essentially the same product) and previous versions charged upwards of $100. I hope this indicates a commitment on the part of Family Tree Maker to keep the product affordable in the future.  That said, we've used 3 different versions of Family Tree Maker, and "tinkered" with the Ancestry.com online tree maker. This, of course, has been the top selling & #1 rated genealogy software for many years.  We are NOT accomplished genealogists or computer experts ... however, if you're fairly new to this process & are shopping around for genealogy software, here are some observations we suspect may be helpful:  -The upgrade from 2010 to 2011 was substantial, but there is almost no difference between 2011 and 2012. No need to upgrade if you have 2011.  -Both the 2011 and the 2012 versions are significantly more complex than older versions (the previous version we used was 2005 or 2006).  -Our goal for this software was to aid my grandfather through the family tree research process. I'm a novice at family research, he's a novice at computers. Unfortunately these newer versions are too complex for him, not as intuitive as the online tree maker or the older versions. He won't be using the 2012 version, which basically means we're dead in the water for the time being.  -If using Windows XP, the 2012 version requires SP3 (service pack 3). They don't advertise this, but if you read the small print on their web site, any other version of Windows XP is not supported.  -If you have an existing family tree on Ancestry.com, merge your software data AT YOUR OWN RISK! As I understand it, the information on your existing account may get overwritten by the information on your software (meaning, blanks will replace actual data). Backups on Ancestry.com do NOT back up all your data, either. I know this sounds convoluted, but I suggest creating a new Ancestry.com account, or simply not merging accounts (cut & paste information, etc).  -If you've never undertaken a family genealogy before, you might consider starting out on Ancestry.com before buying any software. Granted, this software is not a huge investment, but anyone can get a 2-week or 30-day free trial on Ancestry (you don't need the software) and the free online tree-builder feature that is simple & straightforward.  -You really need access to your own records, or online research, or a membership with Ancestry.com (free trial included) if you're going to actually fill out your family tree. This software by itself will not do it for you.  -If you want help building your family tree or doing research, keep in mind the LDS (Mormon) church offers free help to the public. If you just want to chart out your tree on old-fashioned graph paper, for example, you can accomplish this free via email, phone, or visiting a Mormon genealogy center. If you buy the software, the tech support is very good, too.  They will *not* try to convert you - these offices are very PR-friendly (though they may give your deceased family members one of their controversial posthumous baptism ceremonies!). A central tenant of this denomination is knowing your family tree, so devotees can track down ancestors after the 2nd coming. They are therefore happy to help non-members in creating family genealogies. The church is closely tied to both the Family Tree Maker software, and also to Ancestry.com.  BOTTOM LINE:  If you're a beginner and not sure where to start, skip the software for now and get a free trial at Ancestry.com. The free tree builder is a great place to start, or just dig around the Ancestry database and collate your own research.  If you're committed to this process, are ready to dig in, & don't have any trepidations about navigating new software, then the 2012 Deluxe version is it! It has the most features and is actually cheaper than previous versions.  Hope this helps - good luck!	1
This is like an OEM version - only one installation and one activation. Forget about installing it on more than one computer like the disc/retail version. Also, forget about moving it to another computer and getting it activated again (legally anyway).  I'd stay away from this unless you are absolutely sure that you will only be installing it and activating it on one computer AND that you will never want to move it to another computer in the future. Otherwise, pay a little more and get the non-PKC version that lets you install it on a desktop and notebook computer and move the license to another computer if you ever need or want to.  For a little more money, the non-PKC version is a much better value for many.	-1
Good....as expected	1
I have used Office for several years now, at work we have recently updated our systems to the 2010 Office business and I upgraded my home version to Office 2010. Both the home and business editions are very worthy upgrades, both myself and my work are very pleased with the improved functionality and interface of office 2010. It is very well polished and fine tuned for both home use and getting work done. Between home and work I regularly use Word, Excel, Powerpoint, Outlook, One Note, and sometimes Publisher and they all work great and perform flawlessly on Windows 7/8, I have had zero crashes, freezes or lags using this product on both Windows 7 and Windows 8. Very happy and 3 PC's for a great price is totally worth it for your own PC/Laptop etc or other family members computers. Office also works great on Windows Phone 7/8 as I have been using that version on the go also.	1
Downloaded and installed on a customers computer in less than 45 Minutes. I like the downloading capability when you need software fast.	1
Google: "Classic Menu" from "Addintools"  They have one for Office 2007 and another for Office 2010. I use it and love it. No, I don't work for the company that made it.	-1
I have never had any issues with TurboTax.  I've used the product for at least a dozen years, even to do the taxes for a home based business.  There is no issue with using the tool or the effectiveness. (Still puzzles me how Tim Geithner couldn't figure it out.)  I have a few serious issues that do not affect the use of the product, just personal gripes.  The first, is selecting the "right" version for you to use.  Effectively, the most basic one will work for everything you need.  The pricier versions provide you more "hand holding" through the process rather than just quoting the IRS language.  It is a bit annoying as you enter different areas in the software, how they try to get you to "upgrade" online, with veiled threats of what might happen if you don't take advantage of their support and the IRS finds an error.  Another, is the need to buy a "full version" every year.  Seems to me, once you buy TurboTax, you could pay a lower fee each year to upgrade to the next year's version.  Finally, there are situations such as mine where I live in a state with no income tax, yet to get the version I need, there are only versions with the State Income Tax software included.  If I bought a lesser capable version, it can be bought for several dollars less without a State form as an option.  These are just annoying things I am reminded of every year when I buy what I need to do my taxes.	1
Great software as always.  Thank you TurboTax.	1
TurboTax Deluxe 2011 is very similar to the previous versions, although of course updated for this year's tax tables  Note: This version does NOT include filing a state return -- it's Federal only.  Using the built-in upgrade will cost you more, so if you need to file a state return, buy "TurboTax Deluxe Federal + E-file + State 2011" instead of this one.	1
Great Product. Shipped Quickly!.	1
Worked great saved me so much money versus a "Pro" brick & cement house"	1
Nice...as expected	1
Product was very helpful for filing my taxes, I have used turbo tax for over 15 yrs.	1
Although this program was purchased 3eryyears ago it was helpful in solving my case of Identity Thief to the IRS in 2014.	1
It Turbo tax - it works.	1
TurboTax is great - been using for several years	1
Was good	1
No issues with TurboTax products in general.	1
Good seller and good item.	1
as described	1
as expected	1
When you need to amend a tax, the software would made it easy to  send the corrected tax forms to the IRS.  A Note for those that use TAX software keep a copy handy, The Tax software would not go back to prior years, consequentially you need a copy or the original software.	1
As advertised...works very well.	1
I bought this to file an amended return and as usual it was easy TurbTax software.  It was simple, direct, and almost "idiot" proof software.  I highly recommend it to anyone.  You get what you pay for when it comes to reliable tax software.	1
I bought this software to file my 2011 taxes as I have bought Turbo Tax software for the past several years and find it very easy to use.  I would definitely recommend this software to others as it walks you through easy to understand directions.	1
I use turbotax each year.  I find it easy to use and very straight forward in its approach.  I can easily recommend turbo tax.	1
Great product love it Use no other product have been using it for years and will continue to do so thank u.	1
I have used this product for years and have never had any difficulty, not one!  It's gone down in price over the years and the filing is free.  I use a number of other excellent Ituit items and this continues to be the go-to tax help.	1
This is an excellent product that I have used for several years now. Would definitely recomend Turbotax to a friend. Has very easy to follw instructions which guide you through every tax form.	1
Downloaded directly from Amazon.com This product is much easier to deal with than waiting for the software to arrive in the mail.  Makes doing taxes so much easier and cheaper.	1
I've used Turbo Tax for many years now and never had a problem.  It goes well with my Fidelity Account, Bank accounts and my Quicken software.  Combination keeps home accounting organized and accessible.	1
I've used TurboTax for many, many years and never had any problems at all. It is really flexible and the submission of modified tax returns after the fact is great.	1
The key to me when using a product like this is simplicity and accuracy. This one performs flawlessly and allowed me to complete my tax return in a very short period of time. While the price may seem expensive, it's a lot cheaper than the $600 I was paying to an accountant for all the previous years.	1
If you buy/sell stocks, TT Deluxe is "crippleware" when it comes to calculating capital gains - I want a refund! We own a small LLC, so each year we have to buy TT Business at nearly $100 and TT Deluxe @$60, which seems prohibitively expensive. We consider this parceling of the software for a two person LLC to be a rip-off.  But, this year we discovered another rip-off, when we learned that TT Deluxe is "crippleware" when it comes to calculating capital gains from buying and selling stocks. Like a lot of folks, we have an Ameritrade brokerage account, so we can buy and sell a few stocks, which we did this year. Ameritrade likes their customers and provides a great piece of software called GainsKeeper, to calculate the cost basis of each stock transaction.  Now, here's the rub: TT Deluxe is SUPPOSED TO import this data from your Ameritrade or other account. However, this feature does not work properly, ESPECIALLY if you bought a stock, say APPLE, in more than one lot. The import feature only pulls in the basics of the listing for each stock transaction, so you get to RE-ENTER all the data, from Ameritrade, FROM SCRATCH. WHAT A JOY!!!  Meanwhile, the software displays a sales pitch dialog encouraging you to spend another $30 to immediately upgrade to TT PREMIERE!!  What a ripoff! I can't believe how INTUIT is doing this to their customers! I would not have bought TT DELUXE if I knew (which I could not have known) that it would not import my stock purchases correctly. Worse, if you back up and EXPORT the data from Ameritrade in a TTF file, the software will IMPORT the file, but will not RECOGNIZE any of the stock transaction data, which indicates that INTUIT has CRIPPLED TT Deluxe intentionally.  As a former software validation analyst, I have to warn all TT DELUXE consumers that CRIPPLING a piece of software to reap more profits is a HORRIBLE BUSINESS MODEL and a real ripoff to consumers.  We ended up having to edit each and every single stock transaction, one-at-a-time, in order to complete our return. So, I went from being VERY SATISFIED with the software (as we did not find a lot of bugs this year so far, as has been the case in the past) to COMPLETELY DISSATISFIED.  Way to go INTUIT SALES & MARKETING! Next Year, we won't need TT Business or TT Deluxe, as we will have a simpler return and we will be buying H& R Block software instead. We don't tolerate being ripped off by CRIPPLEWARE!  I will also want a full refund for TT Deluxe, because I think this is a misleading and deceptive business practice!	-1
We've used TurboTax for our taxes for at least a decade. It has every software bell and whistle imaginable and many I would never have thought to ask for. This software has saved us untold thousands in tax-preparation fees over the years. It can be purchased as an instant download, but my husband always likes to get it as a disc which can be re-loaded on the computer in the future if a need for it ever comes up, such as (which sadly is all too common) the computer it was originally on crashes and burns and has been replaced.	1
Easy to use.  Saves time and money.  E filing included which makes it fast and easy to file your taxes with a faster refund!	1
about a month after my early order the price was $10 cheaper in local stores.  Next year I won't rush to buy but i WILL by Turbo as it is easy to use and seems to get easier every year.	1
Sure, it will get your taxes done, but you'll have to go through pages and pages of "offers" like credit cards and other add-on services from Intuit much like their flagship Quickbooks software.  Intuit, when are you going to stop these practices? We've already paid for the program, so why bombard us with ads?  The software itself is just not very intuitive.  All I wanted to see was the difference between filing jointly or married.  All it would take is a nice tab, but after googling around, I found that you're supposed to hit forms, then type in "what-if", then pick a scenario....how in the world is a user supposed to know this?  Garbage.	-1
I've been a TTax user for many years.  My return is simple enough that I could probably get by without buying the Deluxe version, but I usually do.  I thought about saving a few bucks by using the online version but I'm afraid to.  Your data on someone else's server is another opportunity for disgruntled employees or hackers to destroy your life.  And, when you get ready to print, their servers may be down or overloaded.  So, I always purchase.  The Amazon download and install worked flawlessly and the installer created a Windows backup just in case I had a problem.  As I said in the title, one problem is that every year they make significant changes to the GUI. Some of these are clearly improvements and others are probably due to tax law changes.  In the end, it's pretty easy to use the wizards to fill out the forms.  The "final" check is very useful in that it finds "errors" that may or may not be errors.  In my case, I left a 1099 placeholder for a bank that I thought I might be getting interest from.  It saw that I had not entered data, a good reminder to do so (or delete, as I did later).  Then, it said that I hadn't entered some data in another form.  Selecting the "forms" mode, I was able to enter the missing data.  I don't know if I forgot to enter the data or if TTax forgot to ask.  Finally, it said that I had not entered data for "installment income".  I don't have any of that.  It requires a little bit of detective work to figure out how this form was generated.  They COULD point you to one of the wizards to re-run and look for the source of the problem.  In this case, it looked like there is a TTax error.  On one page, the "installment income" checkbox was checked and could not be unchecked.  I entered "none of the above" but the block remained checked.  Fortunately, I was able to delete the form and finish. So, this looks like an error.  From past experience, I'm used to getting TTax updated virtually every time I started it.  But, my TTax said my version was "up to date".  Here it is, mid-February, and we have "bugs" like this that should have been fixed.  I'd like to go ahead and submit my return as I'm getting money back but I'm afraid that there will, as in the past, be more TTax updates.  All in all, unless there was a large price differential in the future, I'm happy enough with TTax to stay with it.	1
This product is easy to use for a beginner or for a practiced old tax hand.  You have the choice of using the interview to input your data and let the program walk you through the various options, or you can enter information directly onto the IRS forms.  I have been using Turbo Tax for over ten years and it has saved me a lot of money that I would have spent by paying a tax firm.  The tax laws and forms have become so complicated, it would be almost impossible for someone with even a moderately complex situation to do their taxes manually.  Save yourself some money and headaches - buy this product.	1
TTax2011 Deluxe (Federal + State) works great for me, as have TTax Deluxe versions over the past decade. I highly recommend this software especially if your tax return involves complications (NOL, passive gains & losses, depreciation, AMT, etc. -way too complicated thanks to the Congressional Boneheads who have made tax preparation a living Nightmare by passing stoopid tax code changes over the past century - can you spell Flat Tax?).	1
TurboTax continues to be a bright point in Intuit's line-up.  As usual, critical elements of my 2010 return made the transition smoothly and I was able to put together an initial version of my return with no problem.  Perfect for getting a picture of how my final taxes will look so that I can plan deductions, etc. for the reminder of the year.  No problem installing and downloading updates.  Works great all around.  The download version from Amazon is a major plus (although you will only be able to choose wither the PC or MAC version).  The DVD/CD option carries both verisons.	1
TurboTax downloads from Amazon are great! In minutes you can have access to TurboTax without a trip to the store.	1
Worked as advertised.	1
Great	1
Easiest way to do your taxes. I have done mine and 3 friends taxes every year.	1
the best as far as I am concerned	1
This review is for TuboTax 2011 Deluxe for Federal Returns. Fortunately I live in Texas and there is no state income tax so I don't have to worry about the state portion.  TurboTax has had its share of issues but I came back to it because it does seem to be the best there is, but I'm knocking off a star because of the history of issues I've had with the program in previous years (like it not calculating tax correctly until I deleted some assets and then re-entered them). However, I was a little shocked to read that it requires 515MB of HD space PLUS up to 1.5GB more if Microsoft .NET 4 is not installed (Mac is only 330MB). Wow! That could be over 2GB of HD to do taxes (last year it was over 1GB). How inefficient we have become!  Fortunately the system requirements says it works on 64-bit systems, and now it specifically mentions Windows 7 64-bit as well as Vista. When I installed it on my Win 7 64-bit machine, installation (mid Jan 2012) seemed to go well without any problems. When it checked for updates, it found 4 updates at 13.2MB and they all seemed to install properly... so no major install issues for me (unlike 2 years ago), however I did have a minor issue. I accidentally canceled the initial updates because the program responded slowly when I clicked the Update button and so I clicked it again. The problem was by the time my 2nd click "registered", Turbotax had changed the button to a 'Cancel' button. No big deal though but a little annoying.  NOTE: Deluxe will do a Schedule C just fine, but it may not provide as much help as the Home & Business version. If you have been doing taxes yourself for awhile then you might not need to pay the extra money for the additional help.  I will update this review as I continue to use the product.  Pros: * Price includes federal E-File * Overall, probably the best tax program there is * Does not say it works on Windows XP 64-bit (but does with 32-bit XP with SP 3+) * Works on 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Vista and Windows 7 * Deluxe version can do a Schedule C for the self-employed - but it doesn't provide as much guidance as the Home & Business edition * Claims "100% guaranteed accurate calculations"  Cons: * Not perfect (but how can US taxes ever be perfect)? * Have encountered bugs in previous years that caused me to have to delete and re-enter assets * Might take over 2GB of HD space on Windows according to the system requirements  Other: * Their marketing continues to be "guide you step-by-step like a GPS" to get your max refund... hope it doesn't make mistakes like my GPS does sometimes! But they seem to have toned it down this year (good if you ask me).	1
I have been filing my own taxes since I was 16. I am now 60. I have tried most of the programs out there. Turbo Tax is by far the best. H&R Block, by far the worst. I use the "Turbo Tax Premium" because it has rental properties on it. It keeps track year by year (by importing last years form, from a saved Turbo Tax copy) on depreciation and prompts you for all deductions. You can't beat it. WalMart had the same program for $84. Amazon comes through again.	1
Delivered as advertised.	1
Easy installation.  Worked as expected.	1
Used	1
These dopes think I'm going to write something here. Nuts to them.	1
every year, we order the turbo-tax, and it alway have a high level of success. thankyou  james.	1
Good purchase	1
I had to do a lot of manual conversions from quickbooks.  Otherwise I would have missed several thousand in deductions.  So bad I went back to paying a CPA.	-1
I've used Turbotax since it first came out. Amazon's price is competitive and shipment fast. No one should be afraid to do their own taxes. There is an easy learn step by step process that takes you through the process. It automatically creates your state tax for you as you compete your federal tax. I don't know why more people don't use it and save the money they have been paying to a tax preparation company.	1
Good Price and right timing to file my Income Tax Return.  I always buy Turbo Tax every year there and after.	1
I have been filing my own taxes for the past three years now and will never, ever go back to an accountant. TT makes it possible for anyone to file their own return ONLINE! My refund gets deposited directly into my Chase account within 2 weeks. Love it!	1
hey, every year ya gotta deal with this.  I have been using turbo tax for over ten years. I like the "its deductable" feature, as well as the e-file.  I consider it a "must have" every year!	1
This product makes doing our taxes very easy!  I don't know if we would have saved more by going to a tax preparer, but our taxes are not complicated!	1
Bought this last year and was pleased with its performance.  Liked the efile feature.  Bought it again for 2012 and presently using it.	1
Don't waste you time, energy, and especially money going to a "professional" like H&R block.  A lot of the time those places aren't even really accountants, they just take a simple exam to be certified as tax preparers and then use software similar to this.  I took classes in college on income taxes and did income taxes for the foreign students as a certified rep for the school so I've got a bit of experience with different software packages.  This is the most user friendly for a novice and still lets those that know a bit fast track through and prepare returns with minimal hassle.	1
I have been using Intuit products (QuickBooks, Quicken, TurboTax) for many years and these are very inexpensive tools to manage finances and prepare/file taxes.	1
Have used Turbo Tax for years. Don't know if there are better programs or not. I see ways that program could be improved but I always seem to muddle through it and get my taxes done.	1
I use the Deluxe version every year.  Works for simple Schedule C's as well.  Works well and hope they stop trying to change the user interface just for the sake of changing it.  State returns are getting pricey but can't beat the simplicity of filing.  I've had friends the have been burnt by bugs but seems if you call their support line (and wait forever) they have back doors to fix just about anything.  To date I've had no problems.	1
gets better and better every year - outstanding quality, reliability, design, ease of use ... i can't say enough good things about this software - used it for last 6 years	1
Easy to use and pretty comprehensive.  Cheaper than commercial services.  E-File option is nice and seems to have worked well.	1
Past experience with TurboTax was wonderful, this time, not so.  The program would not let me download updates, or my state returns. Or would it let me print my returns. After spending an entire day, I finally got my taxes done.  I would have been better off doing them by hand. An online search told me that many others also experienced the same.	-1
TurboTax makes doing business taxes easy.  I have saved hundreds of dollars in doing our business taxes with this program year after year...and feel confident doing so.  I even found errors our prior CPA made in years past.  Will continue to use TurboTax for Business and Amazon always has the best price.	1
Used TurboTax for years now and have been very pleased with its easy of use, the transferring of the previous year's data and ease of filing.  The more one uses it, the easier it becomes.  Recommend w/o hesitation.	1
Didn't work for me, apparently I have "difficult" taxes.  I ended up hiring a CPA.  Also ended up going MAC when my PC died, but this ran fine on Windows under Parallels.	-1
I had not used the Turbotax product for a while, but getting up to speed with this was not tough.  And the download was purchased at a great price!  And for those who are interested, delivery was prompt, even over this holiday period (product from Cellular Factory, fullfillment by Amazon)-  P.K	1
I use QuickBooks and TurboTax for business to file my business taxes. Now I have iMac and unfortunately, Intuit does not offer this version for Mac so I am not happy with Intuit.  Other than that great software!	1
I've used Turbo Tax for years and thought that my tax returns were being prepared correctly until I ran into a problem this year.  The problem revolves around an incorrect error message this year in Turbo Tax regarding HSA (Health Savings accounts)  After looking through all of the help topics on the Turbo Tax "Live Community" site,  I found a "work around" under this title, "HSA "Failure to Maintain HDHP Coverage" Displays When Not Applicable" that didn't work.  Not only that, but I would have been submitting false information on my tax return had I used it.  They stated in one post that the update in Feb. fixed the problem.  Since I used the software in April it obviously didn't.  So I called Turblo Tax after hunting all over the place for a number. I sat on hold for 35 minutes and then after being connected to someone on their help desk and explaining my problem sat on hold for another 40 minutes before being disconnected.  Update 4/15/12 - I finally posted the question about the error message on an Amazon discussion thread where Bob Meighan with TurboTax was posting answers to other comments and questions.  He posted a link (the one I had already found that didn't work) and also posted a link to his email.  My emailed questions were answered promptly and finally ended up with him phoning and I thought the problem was resolved but then found out after reviewing the filled out forms that it still wasn't right.  The error message wasted a lot of my time which I don't think I should have had to spend.  And my tax forms weren't filled out correctly in the end.  I ended up purchasing the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/H-R-Block-At-Home-Deluxe-State-2011-Win-Download/dp/B0068TJ7OC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">H&R Block At Home Deluxe + State 2011 Win [Download</a>] and had my taxes done within an hour with no headaches.	-1
pretty good tool. Need it every year for my two small businesses,  Even I plan to use a CPA next year, I discuss with the CPA and plan to prepare tax by myself and let the CPA review. That still save a lot.	1
I have used TurboTax for several years and have had generally adequate success with it. Some iterations have been more trying than others, but overall I found the Deluxe 2011 product to be somewhat better than in years past. The return appears to be accurately prepared, and the interview interface is less confounding in some areas than in the past: the capital gains and charitable contributions sections, though, are sometimes needlessly convoluted, and the worksheets produced if you want to print the whole thing for your records are mammoth (my return with all records and worksheets was 242 pages long; each charitable contribution got a three page "Charitable Organization Worksheet" that is nothing but a waste of paper.) If you give to a lot of charities each year (which I do) the dimensions of your records will astound you. Of course, the actual return for filing is much smaller, so saving the full set on a CD is most likely adequate.  The other irritants are the aggressive promotion of TurboTax Premier if you have any interest or investment income; I have used Premier in the past, but don't see any way it would have helped me in my situation. It may help some people with more complex returns, but if you have run-of-the-mill interest, dividend, and capital gains income, Deluxe is probably sufficient. I do think the badgering from Intuit to buy ancillary services is a bit better than in years past, honestly: besides the pitch for Premier and Audit Defense, it's pretty benign for 2011. The interview is extensive and worded in a much more user-friendly way than in years past. There are still occasionally puzzling questions to make you wonder what they are trying to get at, but their help section was able to make quick work of it (I had a question on a property sale, and it was quickly resolved.) One thing I would like is for Intuit to make it easier to enter data in the order in which you wish, as everyone has different recordkeeping and organizational systems. You can skip around, but it's much easier (and less error-prone) to do it in the order which they have devised. Another issue which I find extremely irritating is getting to Intuit's privacy policy and opting out of mailings, e-mail, etc. from them. It is a real challenge to find this, and I recommend doing it right off the bat if you want to because otherwise you will forget about it. I did it when I registered, but even then I believe I had to search for privacy options with the "Help" function.  From an ease of use vantage point, installation, download of my state return data, and updates were a breeze (I'm using a Windows machine) and I had zero problems with the program itself, which is a huge blessing. (I have not been as lucky with some previous incarnations.) The questions took me through every aspect of my finances for 2011, and with the exception of the property sale question, I couldn't find anything it overlooked. I have used TurboTax in most of the last fifteen years, and found 2011 to be one of the best years yet. I have tried the competing H&R Block software (TaxCut) in a few years, and while it produced adequate results, I found the interface to be much less user-friendly than Intuit's (though I didn't use it this year, of course) and as a result I plan to use TurboTax Deluxe for 2012 as well.	1
Turbo Tax downloaded and installed flawlessly, was cheaper than buying a boxed version and it did exactly what it was supposed to do.  I can't comment on customer service because I did not have any reason to use it, which is another good reason for me to use Turbo Tax again next year.  I can not compare this to other tax software, simply because I have never used tax software from any company before this year. But based on my experience with this version, I am certainly going to put Turbo Tax at the top of the list for next year.  In all honesty I can say my sister used the one from the nationally based tax chain and was happy with it, so it seems people have at least two good choices.	1
LOVE turbo tax. Don't know what I would do without it.  Savings is great compared to an accountant.  Easy to use.  Just answer the questions and it does all the work for you.	1
We own a small LLC, so each year we have to buy TT Business at nearly $100 and TT Deluxe @$60, which seems prohibitively expensive.

TurboTax 2011 has the same easy interface as prior years. The navigation seems a bit easier this year than the past years. I used to print out the TurboTax forms to mail them in. Now, I just used e-File. The federal and state returns are both free for the TurboTax Deluxe version! 2 hours with various tax documents and my TurboTax and I am done!  The only minor nit is that the loading time for the program is a bit longer than other years. Not a deal breaker though.	1
Turbo Tax has always been easy software to use to do my own taxes. This years version was easy to use. I was able to do my taxes in about 45 minutes and my roommate's taxes in about 20 minutes. Turbo Tax makes it easy to E-File with both the IRS and the state government. I look forward to next year's version to just as easy to use. I also like that Turbo Tax is available for both MS Windows and Mac OS X.	1
The Step-by-Step Interview doesn't allow Invesment Management expenses to my broker (it puts an error message concerning investment interest when I am working in the investmetn expense catagory) and does not link to the Foreign Tax credit form as it states it should.  If I didn't know the IRS system better than the Step-by-Step Inverview, I would have been charged an extra $1700 in taxes.  No mistakes on the calculations; just that the proper information could not be entered during the interview.  I had to force TurboTax to enter the information correctly using the FORMS entry.  Even then it put the dividends in the Interest column of the Form 1116 (which I had to OverRide).  I guess this does not violate their accuracy guarantee, because it would not cause you to have a penalty with the IRS, but the effect is still too much money leaving my pocket.  From the TT Live Community I found that the foreign Tax credit problem has been a multiyear problem that has not been fixed.  WHY???  Also the Business version WILL NOT IMPORT from a Brokerage.  How many businesses and Trusts have investment transactions?  I bet a large percentage do; but it will not import from the brokerages like the Personal Version of TurboTax.	-1
I've been using TurboTax for over ten years and have tried both the web version and disc product. I prefer the disc product since new versions will read the information from prior editions and automatically import them after installation. The 2011 edition was the fastest install ever. Even the updates did not take that long. I had a state download for CA that was also quick and streamlined. I was able to have my W-2 information imported (a real time saver, love that option) and the step by step screens were easier than ever to walk through. Printing and saving was also quite fast along with the federal e-file. It took barely a day to be submitted and accepted (this was in late Feb). State e-file was offered for an additional $19.95 which I didn't bother with. Unfortunately I don't get refunds. TurboTax is a solid product. I think the disc version is better than the online since the installation will read the previous version information and saves you a lot of time, especially if you continue to use the product as long as I have. I would not consider another tax product. It is so easy to revisit options or jump around to different sections. After you do your taxes you may also be offered an opportunity to join the TurboTax panel and give input about your experiences and help improve the product. This is a worthwhile option if you would like your voice to be heard.	1
I got away from TurboTax for the last couple of years and really paid for it in frustration. I just finished my taxes with TurboTax and it took a fraction of the time it did with Block, and I am not shaking and about to blow a gasket. Spend the extra $10.00.	1
I do our taxes every year and it is a tedious job.  If it wasn't for TurboTax I probably would have it done.  Using TurboTax is fast and easy and I like several features that I use every year:  * The ability to import last year's data automatically into this year's preparation. * The ability to E-file your taxes with the federal government which speeds up your refund, if you are getting one. * The itemized deductions for gifts to charity is very helpful as we donate quite a bit every year and it makes it easier to compile a list, keep it for your records and come up with a reasonable value to claim on your taxes. * I actually pre-calculate my next year's taxes and print out the forms to mail in quarterly payments for the next year's taxes to avoid a penalty.  These are just a few of the main features that I like with TurboTax and I recommend the software to you as an easy tool to use.  I do wait to find a good price on it as the price keeps going up and up. I got mine at 30% off on Amazon with free shipping!	1
TTax2011 Deluxe (Federal + State) works great for me, as have TTax Deluxe versions over the past decade. I highly recommend this software especially if your tax return involves complications (NOL, passive gains & losses, depreciation, AMT, etc. -way too complicated thanks to the Congressional Boneheads who have made tax preparation a living Nightmare by passing stoopid tax code changes over the past century - can you spell Flat Tax?).	1
Installed fine and is easy to use. The only problem I had was the State portion (which this software includes 1 state return) wanted to charge me $39.95 to download my state program! I had to do a search on the Turbo Tax site to find a contact number. I called, waited about 10 minutes, explained the situation, was told it was a glitch with the retail version of the software and thankfully a code was able to be given to me to "unlock" my one free state program while in the software. Once I got that info then it was easy to finish as usual. Just so you know, if you purchased the Federal + State, then you are entitled to one state return for free so if the software prompts you to pay for your one state download, stop and contact intuit. The only charge should be $19.95 to e-file your one state return (if you choose to e-file it) and you can e-file your federal return for free.	1
I like this product a lot! I wish I would have seen the online version available before I bought the CD! It's half the price and I don't have to store the CD which I will never have to install again. My biggest problem with this software was the darn package that it came in. No matter how hard I pressed in the center of the CD case the case would not release the CD. I was afraid I was going to snap it in half. I ended up cutting the center spokes out with some scissors to release the CD. This was over-packaging at it's worst! They could release this in a simple cardboard envelope and shrink-wrap it for protection and that is all it would need. Most people will only have to install this once and then they will either destroy or store the CD. If the prices for the download were even 2-5 bucks less I bet they would have even more people purchasing it in that format.  Just like last year I installed it without a hitch on my Mac 10.6.8. The Fed eFile is still free but the state eFile is still about $20 so I opted to mail it in again. Not a big deal. Other than the packaging, I was extremely satisfied with this software and will use TurboTax again next year except I will probably utilize the online version they have available .  FYI-If your taxes are VERY easy. Like you do not own a Home/Property and don't have any children or investments. Just a job and a savings account you should be able to use the Turbo tax free version that you access through their website. They have this great "help me choose button" that will let you know if you can use or not.	1
I have used T. Tax for years.  This version appears to be even better than past years versions and is very easy to use.	1
I have used Turbo tax for years and during that time I have also tried other products H+R, Jackson, blahblahblah.  I always go back to Turbotax, if you are not sure of anything it will walk you through, if you are comfortable with the software you can use the form straight from the software.  In the nutshell, this will get your taxes done quickly with the right forms and get you all set for your taxes.  Those of you who like to be "creative" with your taxes this will also tell you how much BS your filing and your chances of being audited.  The one thing I have noticed is that not all software can handle the states very well, people have complained about their state taxes being hosed somewhat.  Overall I give this a 5 star considering I could take my personal papers to a CPA, tax preparer, or try to hammer it out myself.  It cuts the time down to nothing, 2 hours and I'm done.  Just remember to update Turbo Tax after you install.	1
The same old good software I use every year to make submitting taxes easier. Cheaper than paying H&R Block, but just as effective for my situation (Married, filing jointly, we both work, have one kid, own a house, a dog . . . nothing really complicated). This is my first year buying from Amazon (I usually get my copy from Costco, but Amazon was the same price). I have never done a digital download from Amazon before, but it worked pretty easily. Just download and install, that's it. The one thing I think is silly is the fact that there is a $20 fee to eFile State (Federal is free). You'd think that the state would want to pay us to make their job easier, but no, so they'll be getting a fat envelope by snail mail from me.	1
I wish they would be a bit more reasonable with the price on it.  But they know they have the market pretty much cornered.  And if you've used Turbo Tax for a few years chances are I likely wouldn't change to any other product anyway.  They got me, and they know it.	1
I've used this product for the last 14 years. It remains as valuable today as it was when I initially started using it to process my tax returns at the State and Federal level.	1
I specifically bought this for the additional free state but Turbo tax charged me an additional 40.00 for the state.  What a ripoff..amazon at 45.00 and then 40.00 more for the state...so in essense I paid 85.00 for a piece of software that is suppose to be 45.00.	-1
I wanted to write a review now before tax season is over.  I will update this review as needed.  So far it has worked great.  It installed no problem on Windows Vista.  it found last year's tax return on my PC and imported that--no problems.  It also imported my data from Quicken 2012 smooth as butter, all my stock trades came in and my capital gains for the year were calculated automatically..a beautiful thing.  Now, whether all this automatic importing is correct is another matter.  I'll need to review all this as my statements at my brokers become available.  However, at this time everything appears to be working great.	1
I have been ordering and using this program for about ten years, now, and just can't say enough good things about it. Every year it just gets better and better, covering all the bases and making completing and filing your tax returns for maximum returns a snap. If you haven't yet tried it out, what are you waiting for? Start getting more of your money back, today!	1
I bought this d/l version because it was cheaper than the CD and I didn't have to wait a week or more.  Although I use TurboTax each year I was a bit leery about downloading it after reading some of the negative reviews on here.  Everything went fast and painless.  The d/l took less than 3 minutes (26 Mbps Broadband) and I had TurboTax installed, updated, prior year tax info transferred and ready to begin this year's return in 14 minutes.  I kept a close watch on the time because of some reviewers saying how long it takes to d/l and update.  It probably would have gone even faster but TurboTax said Microsoft .NET Framework 4 wasn't installed, which they did for me.  I hope the rest of my experience with TurboTax 2011 goes this well.  I've been using it for many years and I haven't been disappointed yet.	1
I've been a TurboTax user for many years, and the 2011 version continues the positive experiences I've had in the past. Installation on a PC running Windows XP (SP3) was uneventful. It took about 15 minutes start to finish, including the time to download an update from their website.  No problems pulling in last years Turbo Tax return. That's a big feature for me, since as a business owner, I have to deal with issues such as depreciation schedules. Plus, it's always helpful to see the totals for each line item from last year to make sure I didn't forget something.  I use the Deluxe version and it offers everything I need for dealing with investments and my business (Schedule C). Turbo Tax continues to try to up-sell me into the business version, but the Deluxe gives me everything needed at a lower cost.  The menu system is clear and easy to use, and the software also allows a form view so you can jump to a specific form or line item.  I'm sure other tax software works just as well, and offers the benefit of a lower cost. I stick with TurboTax mainly because it always has worked well for me, and I just prefer to stick with what I know will work. Plus, I'm concerned there would be problems pulling in the prior year's return when it was prepared with a different package.  I can't say it makes paying taxes fun, but it certainly takes the sting out of dealing with all the rules, regs, and paperwork. I'll be buying it again next year.	1
Its the best tax program I found so far, have not used amazon before but they had 2012 for download when intuit will not have it till 11/25/11	1
I have been using TurboTax for many years.  It is consistently easy to use, with the "road map" guiding the user through all the apprepriate steps.  The bulit-in segments on helping the user find deductions - and even estimating the value of non-cash donations - helps any user find everything they wish to include quickly with minimal fuss. The program itself also looks just like it has for several years.  The only differences seem to be behind the screens, designed to make the system easy to use while constantly updating forms and calculations to match current IRS guidlines.  Highly recommended.	1
I have used TurboTax now in some form (online or pc software)for about 10 years and I am totally happy with the product.  What I am not happy about is that after purchasing from Amazon, the price paid was not the final price.  It was an additional $19.95 to e-file my state return.  Even with the addition, I still am satisfied with the product.  But, I don't like hidden fees so minus one star.  Yeah, I know that it says it in the small print, but what are they trying to hide?  Unless they think that they are charging too much?!	1
Great product.  Use every year.	1
I've been using TurboTax for many years now, and have always been pleased with its easy interface and final results. This 2011 tax year version installed fast and without any hiccups, and found the previous year's info very quickly and made my info startup a breeze. Now I have to wait for everybody to send me my yearly statements for me to enter the info. One year, after doing my taxes on TurboTax, I brought all my info to a local (not a chain) tax preparer, and his results came out the same as TurboTax, which amazed me completely. He asked me the same questions as Turbo did (he probably used the professional version of TurboTax.  I "gladly" paid him 165 bucks to know that I could use the software myself from now on.<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/TurboTax-Deluxe-Federal-E-file-State-2011/dp/B005TK64AQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">TurboTax Deluxe Federal + E-file + State 2011</a>	1
As advertised.	1
Have been using this for years.  Good value.	1
This review is for TuboTax 2011 Deluxe for Federal Returns. Fortunately I live in Texas and there is no state income tax so I don't have to worry about the state portion.  TurboTax has had its share of issues but I came back to it because it does seem to be the best there is, but I'm knocking off a star because of the history of issues I've had with the program in previous years (like it not calculating tax correctly until I deleted some assets and then re-entered them). However, I was a little shocked to read that it requires 515MB of HD space PLUS up to 1.5GB more if Microsoft .NET 4 is not installed (Mac is only 330MB). Wow! That could be over 2GB of HD to do taxes (last year it was over 1GB). How inefficient we have become!  Fortunately the system requirements says it works on 64-bit systems, and now it specifically mentions Windows 7 64-bit as well as Vista. When I installed it on my Win 7 64-bit machine, installation (mid Jan 2012) seemed to go well without any problems. When it checked for updates, it found 4 updates at 13.2MB and they all seemed to install properly... so no major install issues for me (unlike 2 years ago), however I did have a minor issue. I accidentally canceled the initial updates because the program responded slowly when I clicked the Update button and so I clicked it again. The problem was by the time my 2nd click "registered", Turbotax had changed the button to a 'Cancel' button. No big deal though but a little annoying.  NOTE: Deluxe will do a Schedule C just fine, but it may not provide as much help as the Home & Business version. If you have been doing taxes yourself for awhile then you might not need to pay the extra money for the additional help.  I will update this review as I continue to use the product.  Pros: * Price includes federal E-File * Overall, probably the best tax program there is * Does not say it works on Windows XP 64-bit (but does with 32-bit XP with SP 3+) * Works on 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Vista and Windows 7 * Deluxe version can do a Schedule C for the self-employed - but it doesn't provide as much guidance as the Home & Business edition * Claims "100% guaranteed accurate calculations"  Cons: * Not perfect (but how can US taxes ever be perfect)? * Have encountered bugs in previous years that caused me to have to delete and re-enter assets * Might take over 2GB of HD space on Windows according to the system requirements  Other: * Their marketing continues to be "guide you step-by-step like a GPS" to get your max refund... hope it doesn't make mistakes like my GPS does sometimes! But they seem to have toned it down this year (good if you ask me).	1
I've been a TurboTax user since 1998. Of all the things a PC brings to a household, one thing I appreciate most is the taming of the onerous chore of tax preparation into something much simpler. Tax time for me used to be a three-day long parade of headache-inducing calculations and HOPING I had all the correct forms. TurboTax has turned three days of extended misery into a couple hours of compressed misery. Intuit had rough period in the early 2000s with privacy and functionality in TurboTax (and a STINGY approach to how many users could prepare taxes from a single copy). Happily, those days are far in the past.  This version allows you to prepare up to five federal returns. Installation and updating were painless on a Windows 7 machine. Because I had data from last year's edition on my computer already, our personal data was already filled in, and it smartly queried about the same sources of income and interest and deductions/credits as last year. It also handled a major change in our filing status.  With all of my tax documents at hand, and a moderately complex 1040 filing scenario, I was finished in less than an hour. Sweet. Error checking and efiling was painless, and I am now eagerly awaiting a modest federal refund while procrastinating re-investing that into the userious coffers of my home state:-)  Select with confidence!	1
NUMBER ONE !!	1
This is a good program if you have a sole proprietor business, easy to follow ,there has been a problem down loading the selected state. Turbo Tax customer service has been very helpful in solving this problem	1
great software used for years with no problems or hesitation	1
use it every year , very good	1
I have been using Turbo Tax for years and I have to say the 2011 version is really improved and so much easier to use.  When compared to the other tax preparation software out there, there really isn't any comparison.  While Turbo Tax might cost more you get a far superior product.  When it comes to tax preparation software you get what you pay for.  I have never had a tax problem since I been using Turbo Tax. I have been using it for over 6 years now.  I like the basically idiot proof nature of the product.  It asks you simple yes or no questions and guides you step by step through everything so you don't miss a thing.  It even pointed out things I could deduct that I wasn't aware of.  If I can say anything negative about this product is the support is a bit lacking. It takes several days to get a reply to any support issues. The software also arrived 3 days before expected delivery date.	1
TurboTax continues to be a bright point in Intuit's line-up. As usual, critical elements of my 2010 return made the transition smoothly and I was able to put together an initial version of my return with no problem. Perfect for getting a picture of how my final taxes will look so that I can plan deductions, etc. for the reminder of the year. No problem installing and downloading updates. Works great all around. The download version from Amazon is a major plus (although you will only the PC or MAC version. The DVD/CD option carries both verisons.	1
Have used this product for the last 11 years. Easy to use. Periodic, timely automatic updates. Audit reviews invaluable to pinpoint possible areas of contention with the IRS.	1
The CD would not load on my XP Professional PC. I just returned this software to Amazon.com and TurboTax is sending me a corrected CD free next week. Their support WEB sight (e-mail back to me)states that a fix will be available Jan. 5th 2012. If you need help let me know and I will try to share my expereinces with this problem and how you can make contact with TurboTax. Also check out FaceBook and like the TurboTax page to see my posts.	-1
I just downloaded TT Deluxe, and did my usual preliminary tax computation for 2011.  (I'm using Windows 7, on a pretty fast computer, with all Windows updates current.)  I had no problems with the program.  It installed with no problems, checked for updates (none), found various copies of my 2010 tax file, allowed me to select one of them.  I quickly reviewed the imported 2010 info, and it all looked correct.  I don't use the "import from Quicken" feature, because I find that it sometimes causes problems.  Instead, I create reports in Q that I export in TXF format, which I can then import into TT.  This worked fine.  I couldn't download my brokerage & mutual fund information yet, obviously, since that will not be available until late Jan or early Feb.  Same with the W2 info.  Instead I entered some info based on my records, just to go through the preliminary calculation.  Everything worked as expected.  BUT note that some forms (e.g., Sch D) aren't finalized yet, are waiting for the IRS.  One note: Intuit pushes the more expensive Premier version for those with investment income, but you don't need it unless your situation is rather complex.  If all you have is mutual funds and some brokerage stock/bond transactions, you're likely to be fine with Deluxe.  (If you have option trading, you'll have to look into the details, Deluxe might still be fine.) NOTE:  Thought it might be helpful to briefly report here what TT says about why they recommend Premier; they help if the following apply to you: Unsure of your capital gains? Don't know your cost basis? Confused by ESPP sales?  Also note that in the past I've used H&R Block (aka TaxCut), and have found it to be about as good as TT.  If I were paying money, I'd get the one that's cheaper.  (I get TT discounts from my fund company, hence it's cheaper for me.)  I'll update this review in Feb after I've done more with the program.  (See below.)  Quick note on hidden privacy option: Just noticed that Intuit hid a privacy option nice and deep.  Go into Help-About, and select the Privacy tab.  You'll see a box to permit sharing metrics about your usage.  Seems perfectly reasonable and harmless, but it annoys me that they felt it was ok to hide it like that.  So guess what, I unchecked it.  You can decide for yourself, I don't think it's a big deal either way.  1/12/12 Update:  Since my review above I've been able to download the state program, and it did fine with my preliminary information.  Full test will wait until I have all my data.  I ran into a problem with W-2 imports: the program won't let me enter cents in the box 1 & box 5 fields, just whole dollars, but then the import fails saying data mismatch.  Interesting.  I spent about 40 minutes in a chat session with someone in tech support, who was unable to provide any useful information at all.  (Began with the usual "it works on my machine".  I used to say "ok, then ship me your machine".)  Intuit brags about the excellent US-based tech support, but I was unimpressed.  2/17/12 Update:  There have been many bug fix updates over the last few weeks (at least 5, maybe more), which is good in the sense that they're delivering fixes quickly as they have them.  (No one's found a way to create bug-free software yet, of course!)  I've not run into any problems lately, and the W-2 problem I mentioned above was also fixed (I can't fully test it, not having multiple paychecks).  One good thing to report: my state tax return (MA) took very little time to do and review: the initial data entry captures just about all the useful information that transfers neatly to the state return, and all I had to was to go through the yes/no stuff and then review the return.  One area TT could improve: the entry of capital gain transactions is unnecessarily tedious, requiring that you go through several screens for each transaction.  This became particularly annoying when I had to go through them to correct a set of errors I found in my data (incorrect records).  It would be so much easier to have an option to enter the transactions on a table.  (No, the "quick entry" spreadsheet doesn't do it for me, it's an ugly user interface in my opinion, makes it too easy to make errors.)  On another note: I used TT to do some what-if calculations related to getting a Schedule K-1 from an S-corp (with "material participation"), and found it quite useful.  When you get to this kind of thing the program doesn't really help you much, you have to know the tax laws and rules  (or learn quickly!)  in order to do the right things.  But at least I was able to have the program do the calcs for me, which saved me a ton of time.  In summary, I found this year's TT to be a pretty good program, worth the 4 stars I initially gave it, with enough shortcomings to fall short of a 5-star product.	1
I have used Turbo Tax for over 20 some years and I have never been disappointed except with the amount we owe IRS every year!  I is that absolute best program.  I have done taxes professionally and this program is as good or better than any other program I have ever used.  We have our own businesses and this version handles everything for us without any problems.  Thank you Intuit!!	1
I have used TurboTax for years and would never switch to any other method of doing my taxes! You can't go wrong with it.	1
Wouldn't use anything else.	1
I had not used this Turbotax product for a while, but getting up to speed with this one was not too tough- similar enough to the prior year versions.  And the download was purchased at a great price!  And for those who are interested, delivery was prompt, even over this holiday period (product from Cellular Factory, fullfillment by Amazon)-  P.K	1
I did my taxes way back in January, so can't remember much, but do remember the software catching something that would have been impossible for me to catch on my own, so that the taxes were done right. It had something to do with the business that I no longer have. So I'm really happy that I bought this, however, since I no longer have a business, probably will go with cheaper version now.  Highly recommend if you have a business of any type though. Thanks - Turbotax peoples. Whoever did the programming of this software did a thorough job, in my opinion.	1
Like other reviewers, I've used Turbo Tax a very long time --- since the 1990s. One year (2003, as I recall) I had a serious problem and the program cost me a great deal more in taxes than I ought to have paid. It missed many new regulations, and the calculations were all off.  This year, I upgraded to Home & Business, whereas previously I used Turbo Tax Deluxe, Federal and State. The program is an enormous memory hog, and since I've been stuck on a semi-functional laptop for about seven weeks now, that is a big problem. Very often, the program takes several tries to start at all. Several times, it has frozen the machine all together, requiring that I use the power switch to reboot and try again. And generally, the program won't run at all unless I exit all the unnecessary ancillary items before opening TurboTax (Windows Messenger, my printing software, and so on).  It's hard to tell how accurate the calculation is; a huge number of rules and regulations changed this year, making the entry process far more complex and time consuming than it has ever been before. That's not the fault of Turbo Tax, but I am not entirely convinced they covered all the bases, so I've spent extra time reading IRS files just to be certain that I don't miss anything.  Like at least one other reviewer here, I too file my state taxes on paper to avoid the extra filing fees. And I too save my work after pretty much every entry. I also use a remote hard drive to back up the file --- just in case.  One year, I lost all the data after e-filing, simply because I mistakenly saved an empty tax form over the completed TurboTax file. And while I had saved a pdf file of our taxes, it has been a consistent aggravation that one cannot import data into TurboTax from a prior-year *.pdf form. Once you over-write that *.tax file, it's gone. The only way to avoid that difficulty, apparently, is to fill out the entire tax program --- and file it --- online at the Turbo Tax website.  Given the number of hacking issues at major corporations in the last few years, however, there's no way I'd trust my tax data to Turbo Tax, long term. The do-it-yourself version, on a home computer with an excellent firewall and security program is a much safer bet.  I've never used an accountant for our taxes; before tax programs were available, I struggled with the paper forms and the "move this line to form XXXX, line 9999" issues on my own. It was a complete nightmare even when our taxes were pretty simple, and I was delighted when computers made the annual process more manageable. I have always figured that hiring a CPA would require me in effect to do our taxes twice --- collect all the documents and then walk the accountant through them all. Not to mention costing exponentially more than Turbo Tax in fees.  Regarding one complaint, no, this year's program has NOT incorrectly required one to indicate a "stock sale" to report options trading. Under investment sales, one must enter "other," and on the next screen, enter "option." Incorrectly entering an option trade as a stock sale will definitely and unnecessarily raise one's taxes on any options that expired "worthless," as the IRS treats those differently than stock sales.  Admittedly, I found this aspect of the program confusing. I could not figure out why certain entry forms were missing until I called Turbo Tax support and sat on hold for an hour before obtaining a supervisor to explain it all. However, once reached, the tech walked me through the entire form, and explained the IRS code. It checked out at the federal agency website, and my hour-long hold time paid off.  To be sure, Turbo Tax is not fail safe. But with all the changes in the tax code this year, probably nothing is.  And if you think this year is bad, wait until 2013, when the bevy of new ObamaCare tax levies kick in. Then, Turbo Tax users will undoubtedly need three gigabytes of memory to keep the program running --- even after all other non-essential programs have been shut down.  All in all, TurboTax is pretty good, past disappointments and technical issues not withstanding.	1
I have been a loyal TurboTax user since 2003.  It is easy, as thorough as you need it to be for at home use, and affordable compared to professional tax return services.  I have never had a problem installing this software for 8 years now, and it has always performed reliably, preparing flawless tax returns, and ensuring quick and easy refunds.  I've used the relevant versions to report Schedule C self-employment income (the program quickly and easily calculates the self-employment tax, ensures you get social security credit for your self employment, and gives you next year's estimated tax payments) as well as investment income.  The feature to download 1099-DIV and 1099-INT statements from your investments accounts is priceless, as is its ability to calculate your short and long-term capital gains.  Schedule D is a scary form, I cannot imagine doing it myself.  Yet I breeze through it year after year with the help of TurboTax and the automatic imports from my brokerage accounts.  If you're thinking of giving this program a try, I can thoroughly recommend it.  Your life is about to become a lot easier ... enjoy your refund!!	1
Please don't have your accountant or the IRS call me, but this tax software at least appears to be so good, and so easy, a monkey would have a hard time getting their taxes wrong!  I am an independent contractor and after being charged up to $1,500 for my accountant's receptionist to do my taxes (did she use TurboTax?) and for him to check it, I decided to give TurboTax a try.  Following what appears to be complete and certainly thorough directions, I entered all my information, just like the account had done in past years, and out came a complete tax return with all the forms filled in just like I had been paying to have done.  Now, I suppose that you could run into problems (You already know some tax companies advertise that they can get you more money by fixing what other paid professionals missed or screwed up on your return, right? And, they get paid for it!) if your information changes, or if you enter items in the wrong places, but the TurboTax software does check for mistakes, points out areas where you may be audited (according to statistics) where you can also look for mistakes, and you can ask questions, search help, or join forums to get more information, PLUS you can also sign up for tax audit assistance and representation.  I am one of the most skeptical people you'd want to meet, but I feel comfortable in my third or fourth year of using the software. Good luck!	1
I have been using TurboTax many many years, ever since they first introduced their software for help in preparing taxes. I consider it to be the very best. Doing taxes is a tiresome and tedious task,  never easy, but TurboTax is the best help available. It walks you through every possible situation and has in depth explaining for cases where needed. It will print the entire return for sending electronically, or mailing and especially for your records to keep. It saves your returns from year to year saving much time. This version, Home and Business, is my choice because it also handles 1099s which are especially difficult to do "by hand". A simpler TurboTax version is just as valuable especially if you have a "plain vanilla" return. Most of the TurboTax editions, and there are about a half dozen choices, include one state return. Don't pick up your W-2s without it!! TurboTax is highly recommended.	1
Yes, what took me about half an hour last year from download, install and data entry is still not done after at least six times that long and I am ANGRY. I am trying to create 1099s, a simple programming function compared to the rest of the tax needs I am going to have as I prepare our full taxes and THE SYSTEM DOESN'T WORK. 1099 and W-2 is now forced to be online and the system is horrible, doesn't work and each successful data entry takes at least three attempts. And then you aren't sure if it is successful because instead of freezing your computer, you get this message:  Houston, we have a problem... Luckily, we're not in space. Rest assured, our programmers are on it.  That may work if you sign out, sign in and try that again. If you see this again, please contact us so we can help.  I am not amused. NASA wouldn't have ever gotten to the moon with TurboTax 2011 Software. They'd never gotten to the launchpad. Or the rocket built. We'd still think it was made of swiss cheese.  Then, of course, when you go back and try again, your data is often correct--after all you just entered a four digit number! Why would that break a system?  So, yes, believe the reviews. I haven't even started the individual tax return and I am worried. I might be buying TaxAct or whatever I can find before this tax season is over because my trust level is kaput. I could do 1099s online at the IRS site or handwrite them, they are the easiest, simplest form I will deal with over the next few months. But I bought TurboTax to make it even easier. And if it can't handle these, well, I shudder and I worry.  And if you are in the same boat as me and bought early before the reviews and WANT to try this anyway, well, the functionality is slightly better in Google Chrome over IE 8. Not much but at least I got a file to transfer on my sixth attempt on Chrome. So my names were imported from last year's file. Never mind that it said it didn't and then it transferred the file twice and now won't let me delete the duplicates without that lovely Houston message I shared above. I finally got one to delete after 8 attempts. I may not be so lucky with the rest of them.  So yes. Crap. Utter, useless crap. I want a refund but it is software so that's not possible since I've ripped open the box and loaded this simulation of a tax preparer.  This is my 9th year using TurboTax and by far the worst experience I have ever had with it. Phooey on Intuit.  UPDATE on 1/31/12:  After countless attempts at data entry in the online 1099/W2 Reporter system, I finally got my 8 1099s completed. It took me 6 hours of repeated attempts to get the data entered. Yes, I was foolish. I could have done it somewhere else in less than an hour. Then I read in another review here that there is a backend way to do the reports through the software.  Click FILE in the upper left hand corner menu and select NEW TAX RETURN and the selection like previous years. For kicks and giggles I decided to do that after finally printing up and mailing the 1099s today, a few days past when I intended. The whole process took me 15 minutes, what it has done in previous years. Why did Turbo Tax not give us the outright option? Why did they release extremely flawed online software? (Even selecting a state doesn't work in the drop down boxes unless you hit a hard enter after selecting, otherwise it clears out the field when you move to the next one. Nevermind the inability to process submitted info, the forms can't even handle data entry such as 5 digit only zip codes, etc.)  So this is too little too late for me and for you, but perhaps someone will be saved the headache.  And do save that return for the 1099/W2s in the software (the work around) because even though you save it, it doesn't not come up as an option for your ongoing working returns in the open file page. You have to browse for it on your computer--know where you saved it!--if you need to access it again.  Pure idiocy...	-1
This review is for TuboTax 2011 Deluxe for Federal Returns. Fortunately I live in Texas and there is no state income tax so I don't have to worry about the state portion.  TurboTax has had its share of issues but I came back to it because it does seem to be the best there is, but I'm knocking off a star because of the history of issues I've had with the program in previous years (like it not calculating tax correctly until I deleted some assets and then re-entered them). However, I was a little shocked to read that it requires 515MB of HD space PLUS up to 1.5GB more if Microsoft .NET 4 is not installed (Mac is only 330MB). Wow! That could be over 2GB of HD to do taxes (last year it was over 1GB). How inefficient we have become!  Fortunately the system requirements says it works on 64-bit systems, and now it specifically mentions Windows 7 64-bit as well as Vista. When I installed it on my Win 7 64-bit machine, installation (mid Jan 2012) seemed to go well without any problems. When it checked for updates, it found 4 updates at 13.2MB and they all seemed to install properly... so no major install issues for me (unlike 2 years ago), however I did have a minor issue. I accidentally canceled the initial updates because the program responded slowly when I clicked the Update button and so I clicked it again. The problem was by the time my 2nd click "registered", Turbotax had changed the button to a 'Cancel' button. No big deal though but a little annoying.  NOTE: Deluxe will do a Schedule C just fine, but it may not provide as much help as the Home & Business version. If you have been doing taxes yourself for awhile then you might not need to pay the extra money for the additional help.  I will update this review as I continue to use the product.  Pros: * Price includes federal E-File * Overall, probably the best tax program there is * Does not say it works on Windows XP 64-bit (but does with 32-bit XP with SP 3+) * Works on 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Vista and Windows 7 * Deluxe version can do a Schedule C for the self-employed - but it doesn't provide as much guidance as the Home & Business edition * Claims "100% guaranteed accurate calculations"  Cons: * Not perfect (but how can US taxes ever be perfect)? * Have encountered bugs in previous years that caused me to have to delete and re-enter assets * Might take over 2GB of HD space on Windows according to the system requirements  Other: * Their marketing continues to be "guide you step-by-step like a GPS" to get your max refund... hope it doesn't make mistakes like my GPS does sometimes! But they seem to have toned it down this year (good if you ask me).  Old review:  This review is for TuboTax 2009 Deluxe for Federal Returns. Fortunately I live in Texas and there is no state income tax so I don't have to worry about the state portion.  TurboTax has had its share of issues but I came back to it because it does seem to be the best there is, but I'm knocking off a star because of the history of issues I've had with the program in previous years (like it not calculating tax correctly until I deleted some assets and then re-entered them). However, I was a little shocked to read that it requires 500MB of HD space PLUS up to 620MB more if Microsoft .NET 3.5 SP1 is not installed (Mac is only 255MB). Wow! That could be over 1GB to do taxes. How inefficient we have become!  I just installed TurboTax Fed Deluxe on a Vista x64 system (it's Jan 7th, 2010) and didn't have any problems. In fact, it installed very quickly considering that it claims it needs 500MB (but I do have an SSD drive that greatly speeds things up). TurboTax immediately found 4 updates and asked me if I wanted to update. The updates seemed to have installed just fine. "Uninstall or change a programs" says TurboTax 2009 is using 343MB. It says TurboTax 2008 (from last year and still on my computer) is "only" 162MB, so a BIG increase (but I wonder how accurate are these figures?). In any case, even 1GB of space is not a big requirement nowadays.  I will be working with this to help estimate my 2009 taxes before I pay may Jan 15th estimated tax payment.  NOTE: Deluxe will do a Schedule C just fine, but it may not provide as much help as the Home & Business version. If you have been doing taxes yourself for awhile then you might not need to pay the extra money for the additional help.  I will update this review as I continue to use the product.  Pros: * Works on 64-bit versions of Windows XP and higher (of course that includes Vista and Windows 7) * On Jan 8th, I used it to help compute an estimate of the tax I will owe for 2009 to help determine what to pay for my last 2009 estimated tax payment and the program did not crash. * I had a "flawless" install and update on Vista 64-bit - didn't ask for any serial or reg code * Probably the best tax program there is * Price includes federal E-File * Deluxe version can do a Schedule C for the self-employed - but it doesn't provide as much guidance as the Home & Business edition  Cons: * Not perfect (but how can US taxes ever be perfect)? * Annoying "smart" input entries that try to format things like dates while you're still entering them * Bad/complicated handling of SEP contributions * Have encountered bugs in previous years that caused me to have to delete and re-enter assets * Doesn't jive well with multi-monitors - it likes to pop up windows on various monitors instead of staying on the same monitor * Might take up to 1.12GB of HD space on Windows according to the system requirements	1
PRIMARY USES ADOBE BUT CPD MAKES A GOOD BACKUP FOR EXPERIMENTING WITH LAYERS.  IF IT COULD EXPOR ALPHA (COMPLETE GREEN/BLUE) VIDEOS/PHOTS, WE WOULD HAVE GIVEN THIS A FIVE.	1
First of all, I use a great many non linear editing packages for digital film.  I cut my teeth on Final Cut Pro 7, I have used Avid and Adobe Premier (CS5). I have also used some off the shelf- consumer oriented packages.  I will say that Cyberlinks Power Director 10 is ok for what it is. Having been spoiled with the prosumer packages, it made Power Director 10 seem somewhat counterintuitive for me.  It was prone to crashes for me and that very well could be that I just need more RAM.  Those crashes, however, can be very frustrating when you are in the flow working on a project or are on a tight deadline. I do like the subtitles feature, and it does take advantage of the 64 bit technology, but it just is not my first choice for an editing package.	1
This software is very easy to use and have lots of features so you can make lots of different projects with it, you can be creative and have all the tools you will need.	1
All I really want to do with video is improve raw footage. So things like cropping, adjusting the brightness, stabilizing, and such are what's important to me. I have no interest in 3-D or "particle effects" and such. So from that point of view, this program is a bit of overkill.  I read with interest what some reviewers had to say about their tribulations with tech support. CyberLink products have always worked well for me, so I have not contacted tech support.  Overall, I'd say PowerDirector 10 is recommendable, especially at its low price. If you're concerned about tech support for the product, see if what others had to say seems meaningful for you.	1
I have used PowerDirector for some time now and found that the transition to Power Director 10 was seamless. Version 10 is noticeably quicker and I am not seeing the crashes that I saw with the previous versions. PowerDirector 9 was buggy on my 64 Bit Windows 7 i7 system with 16 GB of RAM (PowerDirector 9 ran perfectly when I first installed it and overtime started crashing. Reinstall didn't help. Customer support was clueless. Hopefully 10 maintains it's great performance). PowerDirector 10 runs like it was built for my hardware. The good news is that PowerDirector is so easy to use and intuitive that you would be up and running quickly even with minimal experience in video editing.  My video editing is pretty basic, splicing together shots, trimming videos, importing stills, adding transitions, and messing with audio. Basically, I want software that just works quickly and does what I want, which is why I bailed on Adobe Premiere. I love Adobe Photoshop and generally think that in every category Adobe beats the competitors...except video for my basic purposes. I can get done in 5 minutes on PowerDirector what might have taken 15 on Premiere (granted I have an old version of Premiere so it may not be a fair comparison).	1
This is not a very good program, as others have made quite clear. It consumes a great deal of time to install, does not run cleanly, and crashes constantly.  While some seem to have had a good experience with this software, I count myself among the vocal minority who were unable to make the thing run.  And my computer has a 500 Gig Seagate hard drive and 4 gigabytes of DDR3 memory. This is hardly a low end laptop, to put it mildly. I should be able to run this software, but couldn't. I junked it.	-1
Overall, I would rate this one just behind Roxio Creator 2100 Pro for ease of use and functionality.  The interface is clear and simple, but I did see some lag after entering commands.  Nothing serious, but not as fast as Roxio either.  There is a ton of downloadable content, but most of it not worth using, in my opinion.  The 3D conversion does work very well, though.  Otherwise, I will stick to using Roxio or iMovie in my iPhone for editing over PowerDirector.	1
CyberLink PowerDirector 10 is a video production application that can be used to assemble all manner of video projects. Normally when I think of CyberLink I think of DVD playback software so PowerDirector was not a product with which I was previously aware. I have worked with other video production software, namely Pinnacle Studio and especially Corel VideoStudio, so I was interested in comparing PowerDirector to these products. While PowerDirector is not perfect it is a good software package.  Installation of the application from the DVD was quite painless. The installer asked me a few simple questions and shortly thereafter I was off and running. The install didn't take long and ran into no glitches. Once finished, I launched the application and was ready to start working.  First things first - unlike other video editing applications I have used, PowerDirector runs as a native 64-bit application on my system, not a 32-bit application in compatibility mode. For some this won't matter, but what this really means is that it should run faster as it has the full 64-bit address space. While it is very likely that other applications will be available as 64-bit applications in the near future, PowerDirector is already there.  The similarity of the graphical interface between PowerDirector and other applications of the same type is striking, at least in terms of color scheme and basic layout. All of the applications I have tried (with the notable exception of a single shareware application) have a slate gray color scheme with dark backgrounds, gloomy gray palettes and neutral colors for the menu systems. I am not sure why this has been adopted as a standard. Also, all have a review window in the upper right of the client window, a media palette in the upper left and center and a timeline-style editor on the bottom where you can drag and drop media files and text to compose the video.  Once past the basic layout of the GUI, PowerDirector goes its own way. The basic interface is very clean and uncluttered and the timeline is divided into logical track groupings to make editing straightforward and easy. By the smart use of tab controls everything is very well organized.  CyberLink has included a very generous set of transition effects as well as media files. What really startled me most in this regard is the inclusion of sound clips from which you can build a soundtrack to your video production, all without needing ti import more music files or audio clips. Clicking and dragging to the timeline is all that is required to put together a complete video production.  I decided to use PowerDirector to put together a stop-motion video with a series of still pictures. I have over 500 pictures in the series and the purpose behind all of these pictures was to tell a story and to create a video from them. I was able to import the images, select them all, drop them on the timeline and play them back without any trouble, but I did run into a small disappointment in the settings in the process of putting this together.. Rather than set the image duration on all 500+ images, I instead went into the application settings and changed the default. The installed default was 5 seconds, and I had in mind to change it to 0.1 second, but the application only allowed me to set it to 0.2 and gave me no indicator at all that the setting was invalid.  Another disappointment was that I found absolutely nothing in the documentation or the help file to tell me what I needed to do in order to create stop-motion videos. I finally resorted to an online search which took me where I needed to go.  I have a webcam on my computer and in playing with the interface I ended up in the Capture area. PowerDirector immediately found my webcam, turned it on and I found myself looking at my own face on the screen. This was a startling but good surprise - PowerDirector had no issues with setting up my webcam for capture.  Creating a video from a completed timeline is simple and straightforward. It provides output for AVI, MPEG, MOV, WMV, FLV and more. Of the applications of this type that I have used, PowerDirector has the widest variety of available formats. And, yes, it's fast.  I have not played with the 3D effects or the disc creation. I have explored a little, though, and it looks like creating a DVD is a straightforward task. I will try this later.  Many reviewers have complained about stability issues with PowerDirector and I have just not seen any issues so far. The application has been fast, stable and easy to work with. That does not invalidate their claims though - there are enough people that have stability issues that it leaves one to wonder what I am doing differently (what what I am NOT doing). From my personal experience, though, I have not had a moment's trouble with PowerDirector.  There is no question that PowerDirector is a powerful application for creating videos. It is easy to use and it is fast. For me it has been stable. It is not perfect, but I am satisfied with it and based on my own experiences with it I can recommend it to anyone wanting to create video content.	1
This product was easy to use and I liked the various features. However, occasionally during usage, my PC would crash, and I was not able to figure out why. This usually only occurred when I was using this product and it was not consistent. Other than that, the product worked great.	1
I have mixed emotions about CyberLink PowerDirector 10 Ultra.   It is a more than adequate video editing and slide show creation program. Definitely faster to deploy than Adobe Premiere Pro and Premiere Elements. Not as feature laden as Adobe Premiere Pro, but more than enough cool stuff for doing pretty complex video productions.  Execution speed is very respectable, though the program does crash more often than I would prefer.   A major plus is Cyberlink's Director Zone where you can download thousands upon thousands of effects, templates and such. Many, if not most, are a little cheesy, but there's a lot of excellent stuff as well.   Cyberlink's approach is "video editing for dummies" - and that is a compliment. Everything is accessible, nearly all functions are easily understandable. For most people, PowerDirector is all they need. I like it (along with Magix Movie Edit Pro) because the programs are quick to deploy, easy to learn and (most of time) work as advertised.   Is PowerDirector Ultra a replacement for Adobe Premiere Pro or other high end video editing applications? No. But most people simply don't need Premiere Pro.   Now, my enthusiasm is tempered by what I don't like about Cyberlink as a company. Their tech support is sub-par: questions are often answered with form letters put together by people who obviously did not understand the question. Cyberlink's product cycles are very short, often less than a year before you are being asked to buy an expensive upgrade.   Overall, I think CyberLink PowerDirector 10 Ultra offers good value to the end-user. It will cover the needs of most people for video editing and slideshow production. Tech support is, in my opinion, is not what it should be and the short cycle upgrade policy is brutal.  Jerry	1
I need simple programs. It gives you extra features to use when creating pages and adding stuff into your video. It also gives you 3D options. I only compiled videos from my little camcorder. It took me some time, but I managed to come up with a 5 mintue video.  I personally can't sit at the computer long to create these things. But I can see how someone who loves creating videos can fall in love with this program!	1
All the gushing reviews about this product are great, there is no doubt that PowerDirector has the best bang for the buck when it comes to features.  But there is much more to video editing sofrware than that.  Most fail to adequately highlight what's truly wrong with this product, so I'll focus on that:  1.  "Fastest video editor":  Translation - it's 64-bit, like pretty much everything else these days.  This is nothing more than marketspeak that CyberLink is using to distract customers from this software's big problems.  PowerDirector is indeed very snappy during the editing process, and it's nice, 64-bit does make a difference in most cases.  But the fact is, any 32-bit video editor that has proxy file functionality is just as snappy as PowerDirector.  2.  PowerDirector maintains its status as the most buggy, crash-prone video editor there is.  It might be faster than ever, but this includes how fast it crashes as well.  This crash-prone behavior is considered a normal part of the user experience with this product.  Depending on the crash, this includes the known examples of project files getting corrupted, "auto save" or not.  PowerDirector is also known for crashing and ruining Blu-Ray discs during the burn process.  3.  PowerDirector has MUCH more downloadable content than Corel's VSX5, the selection is really fun - but cumbersome.  Worse, most all of the content is completely unusable kiddie stuff that just can't be taken seriously.  The good stuff that you might find online takes hours of sifting through the endless menus of user-contributed junk.  Like one reviewer pointed out, its just a bunch of teenage girly junk.  And most of it is for standard def DVDs, not even HD/Blu-Ray.  Most of the stuff I downloaded turned out to be horribly pixelated and unusable for HD.  4.  Output quality:  MAJOR disappointment and critical showstopper.  PowerDirector will keep your 60fps video and get it to the disc, but it will compress the hell out of it until it's pixelated mush on the BluRay disc.  And there's NOTHING you can do about it unless you resort to other software products to convert your 60fps video down to 30fps first (to maintain a high bitrate), which PowerDirector does not do (VSX5 does this automatically if needed).  UNACCEPTABLE.  If all you're interested in is creating little YouTube clips, then you're probably fine.  But compared to other products in terms of producing high quality Blu-Ray discs, PowerDirector's Blu-Ray output quality is notably inferior and quite obvious on large screen HD TVs - it is literally unwatchable if you attempt to keep 60fps.  The #1 reason I use VSX5 is the highest Blu-Ray output quality in a consumer-level product.  It's crystal clear, which is far more important than doubling the framerate of something that is already smooth as glass.  On-screen quality of the final result trumps everything else, no matter how many bells and whistles the editor itself may have to brag about.  I'm not editing video to be dazzled by the editor - I'm editing video to be dazzled by the output of a BluRay disc on a 55-inch 3D Samsung.  Output quality alone is a showstopper here, rendering the product unfit for use for Blu-Ray or any other situation when the preservation of original source quality is paramount.  5.  File sizes/disc content:  For some reason, this product cranks out file sizes that are way too huge for what you are attempting to produce.  In VSX5, I'm cranking out 25GB Blu-Rays with almost 3 hours of content with quality that is almost impossible to distinguish from the original camera source files (1080/60i)- and that's on a 55" HD Samsung DLP.  I have been unable to get PowerDirector to do this.  Again - I'm not editing video to be dazzled by the editor, I'm editing video to be dazzled by the output.  This could be a setting I might be missing, but I have seen many complaints about this problem in here and elsewhere on the net.  6.  Tech support:  Notoriously worthless.  Possibly the absolute worst - and dare I say most hostile - tech support I have ever experienced in my life.  If you can understand what they are even saying, good for you.  Even better if you don't get treated like a thief, regardless if you have your registration information on hand or not.  Additional bonus if they actually help you fix a problem, and that's if you were willing to wait for the long lengths of time for them to respond (days, weeks).  CyberLink tech support left me feeling like I had been taken for a ride - now that I've made my purchase, they have my money and it just sucks to be me.  For the product I continue to run back home to (VSX5), I get immediate phone support (instant) and email questions are answered like clockwork in under 12 hours, all in perfect English.  This includes general product usage and information - I don't even need to be experiencing a problem.  Bottom line, I would LOVE to be able to put my trust in this product.  But I find more use out of the purring VW Bug that crosses the finish line with better results than the screaming Porsche that broke down every 30 minutes along the way and produced inferior results because it couldn't be tuned right.  "Fastest" has proven to mean nothing to me with this product.  Output quality (and stability) continue to prove to be EVERYTHING - as it should be.  5 star potential for the best featureset avaiable and 64-bit power.  But output quality and well-documented crashing are unforgivables that knock it down by 3 stars.  And to be clear, I do not work for Corel, I work in the defense industry.  I merely use this stuff for my own personal video hobby, which I'm increasingly serious about.  And PowerDirector doesn't measure up once it hits my bigscreen because of the shocking pixelation issues.	-1
I was a little apprehensive about trying  PowerDirector 10 Ultra because in the past I'd downloaded a demo to  edit my AVCHD video footage and the program crash and gaged on it.  To be fair, though, it was in the early days of hidef video editing and all the bugs had not been worked out yet; I also have a more powerful system now.  I was pleasantly surprised when I dug into the program, I've been a Pinnacle Studio and Sony Vegas user for  years.  Without having to read extensively in the manual I was able to create a short high definition video complete with effects.  I'm not overly fond of the surrogate AVCHD files the program creates, but it does have the definite advantage over Pinnacle Studio (which has to render each high definition clip as you place them on the timeline)--they are good enough to give you a rough idea of what your project will look like when created.  The editor has enough advanced features to keep the intermediate and novice editor busy for a while, and it has many good output options and disk making capabilities.  The video rendered relatively quickly and I was quite satisfied with the output in the .mt2 format especially for upload to Vimeo and YouTube.  I did have some trouble with  Smart Sound, however, I was unable to use the free music I had for it in my library.  This may have been because I had Roxio Creator 2012 on my computer as well and could not reinstall Smart Sound with the program without possibly effecting Roxio.  You can buy Smart Sound music to use in your projects, but it is very expensive--were I doing videos comercially for a profit I could justify the costs, but the average hobbiest is better offer trying to find some other sources of royalty free music.  The reaason I've given the product 4 stars instead of 5 is because I was generally dissatisfied with the automated movie output.  I never use automated movie features in other products because I am a control freak and want to control my projects from beginning to end.  I did try the automated movie output for the purpose of this review and did not like the way it showed video clips as separate files and did not transition them together, I found the themes cheesy, and the slideshow created with still images displayed the images too long.  If you are a fan of automated movies, I'd reccomend Pinnacle Studio over this program--it has nicer themes and splices  video clips together with interesting transitions.  If I had dug deeper, I might have been able to wield more control, but found that the Magic Movie dialogue to be less than intuitive--so my suggestion is that if this feature is important to you download the demo and try it first.  Like most recent consumer level video editors Power Director 10 Ultra gives you the ability to create 3D movies that can be viewed on any computer or TV with red/cyan glasses.  Since I don't have a camera that shoots 3D footage I can't comment on how well it handles the new 3D camera output formats.  It also comes with a nice pair of 3D glasses.  Since 3D is not important to me currently I did not experiment with creating a 3D film, but if it is important to you, again I reccomend downloading the demo of the program before buying.  All in all this is a good video editor when compared to others I've used.  If you're just starting out with video creation I don't think you could do better than this program.  I reccomend it over Adobe Premier Elements, and it offers more controls and flexibility than Pinnacle Studio, but is not as difficult to learn to use as Sony Vegas Movie Studio.  Check out the video I created here, it exceeds Amazon.com size limitations and if I compress and reduce it, it won't give you a good idea of the high definition quality:  [...]	1
I have used many different video editing programs over the years including APE and the previous version of this program and after trying this out for a few weeks, I declare this to be the best I have ever used! Fast at rendering? you bet it is! and has a whole host of features that I love, yet some I do not use or maybe am not yet ready for (3D)  I installed it and right away assembled video I shot with two different cameras at a recent wedding. I used the easy editor to create my first clip, I chose a theme, added my clips and I was stunned to see the results....an impressive fast-rendered 20 minute movie with impressive special effects. (Friends congratulated me on my work lol) I also used the same clips to make a straightforward movie with titles and transitions, it rendered very fast and the quality of the finished product was impressive. My only issue initially was choosing the right file type to create but now I have the hang of it it is a breeze  Pros Very easy to use easy mode makes movie creating ridiculously easy! Super fast rendering Excellent quality of the final product An insane amount of features. Lots of tutorial videos on their web-site Not one freeze or crash..yippee!  Cons The only con was when I tried to initially choose an output file but I got the hang of it.  I have to say, I have used Adobe Premier Elements for many years and always considered that the best...but no longer, Power Director Ultra 10 has really impressed me and I will be uninstalling APE because I no longer see any need for it! If you need video editing software and are new to video editing don't let the vast array of features scare you off, just use easy mode until you get the hang of it. Maybe they should call it "Super Easy Mode" because that is what it really is. I am so impressed, really! An amazing piece of software!	1
I have used&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/PowerDirector-6-Boxed/dp/B000VYAL2C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">PowerDirector 6 Boxed</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/PowerDirector-9-Ultra-64/dp/B004EWJB32/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">PowerDirector 9 Ultra - 64</a>&nbsp;before trying&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/CyberLink-PowerDirector-10-Ultra/dp/B005S7ZLU4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">CyberLink PowerDirector 10 Ultra</a>.  The software has become more stable over the years, not crashing quite so much.  It's also much faster at editing and rendering than ever before.  The only negative thing about PowerDirector 10 Ultra is the loss of the randomness of the Movie Magic Wizard.  In version 6, I was able to select the entire library of contents and a time frame for the movie and the wizard would spit out a movie with random photos and videos from the library cut to fit the time allotted.  In version 9, the movie wizard would cram every pic and video in the exact order they appear in the library into my movie -- sped up to a dizzying pace when I elected to have a very short movie.  Version 10 is a little better.  It does speed up the pics to fit the movie but I also noticed some videos were left out if there wasn't enough time.  I can also quickly rearrange the photos and videos after the wizard is done and have the wizard redo the movie, which is better than having to go back to the library to rearrange everything.  After making my video via the wizard, I then tamper with it in the main screen.  That's the beauty of having a powerful editor coupled with the wizard.  We get simplicity and versatility in one.  I can add and subtract from the movie.  Of course, movies can be made without the wizard.  I choose not to.  Smartsound is nice.  I've never used it before because it didn't work well, but it does now.  Basically, it's a whole library of music that plays in some sort of endless loop that I can use for my videos.  I can just tell it how long the video is and the music will automatically be adjusted to fit the timeline.  The library is fairly large, including a wide variety of music and some sound effects such as animal sounds and footsteps.  I can usually find something appropriate.  We also have the option of using our own music and capturing our own sounds.  Rendering is quick and easy.  Whereas in the past, this was where my computer would crash and burn, it no longer does.  I like being able to render the video into so many different formats.  I can even make it 3-D, and the box comes with a pair of 3-D glasses just in case I feel the desire to do so.  I can automatically publish it to YouTube or Facebook and a copy of the video stays on my hard drive.  It's so simple, I've already placed a few videos on YouTube over the last couple of days.  Overall, I like this version very much.  It's faster and more stable than ever before, and the Smartsound works.  Just hoping they'll fix the Magic Movie Wizard to be like it was in version 6 and everything would be perfect.  _________________  UPDATE 6/20/13:  A reader pointed out that we do not get the entire library of music in the SmartSound library.  She is correct.  SmartSound is a library of music.  We get 10 pieces with many variations of each piece.  The rest can be purchased.	1
I really like this software. The editing tools are excellent and the special effects let you produce unusual, fun videos. The easy editor does step you through the process and by adding the special effects you can have a very professional looking video. I also like the slide show option. I made several slide shows of book covers. The special effects, particularly the 3D give you very interesting effects. The one caution I have is to check how the special effects crop the pictures. My book covers have portrait orientation. The balloons option crops them as though they were landscape which made the book covers unreadable. However, there are plenty of other choices.  Much as I like the software and will keep using it, there were some problems. The manual is difficult to use. It reminds me of my camera manuals which take a bit of study. This is fine for the advanced effects, but I think an instructional video for beginners would be a help. There are excellent instructional videos for the advanced effects, particularly 3D, on the website.  The other problem I had is that the software locks up a lot. You can cure it by shutting down the computer but that gets frustrating after awhile. I also had trouble consistently loading my videos into the editor. To be fair, this may be due to the way my videos are stored. My camera is the Canon HR10, which stores the video on small discs. Sometimes I could load a file perfectly. The next time, the same file wouldn't load.  So, I recommend this software if you're serious about making great looking movies. If you just want to share the family video, it may be overkill. The problems can be overcome, and the videos I made came out looking great.	1
Fix-It utilities seems to do a fine, if temporary, job of speeding up network browsing time and PC performance issues.  But everytime you want to fix a problem, you are asked whether you want to register the software.  If you don't, the program closes.  No program you pay for should force you to register in order to use it, especially when cnet.com puts it in the center of the pack, ranked below some shareware programs.	-1
Fix-It Utilities 12 Pro really made me want to rip out my hair. Thankfully, I tried it on my older computer and it made the computer crash. And yes, the computer was an older Windows Vista Sony and still worked fine. Now I have to toss the computer and I'm not thrilled. Buyer beware.	-1
needed a way to boot when i couldnt.  it works.. too outdated to be of use as an online utility cleaner or anything else,  but for a dollar it works for what i got it for. and the updated versions always leave little to be disappointed about.  good product. good company.	1
Avanquest is one of the worst software companies I have ever encountered. They sell buggy software, refuse to acknowledge any problems, they will ignore your letters and then want you to pay for upgrades. I got conned by their hype and bought a couple of their products. By the time I realized how buggy the software was, it was too late to return them. Then I get an email which essentially said I could buy a new version that might fix the bugs. Why should I have to pay for something to fix the bugs? I emailed them repeatedly and they did a great job of ignoring me and repeatedly asking what the problem was, I then realized they were just laughing at me.	-1
There are a number of PC utility packages out there. Symantec (Norton), Avanquest, System Mechanic, etc all make system utility programs that are supposed to help you remove old programs, de-clutter your hard drive, remove viruses and trojans, recover lost files, securely delete old files, etc.  I found Fix-It Utilities to be similar to what I have seen in the other packages.  Here's the trick though - DO NOT INSTALL any of these programs in the name of preventative maintenance. Sure - you need antivirus software, but there are simpler programs out there that offer antivirus protection without all of the other functionality (bloat) that comes in these complete utility packages.  This type of program is intended for computers that already have problems. For example, I installed this on an employee's computer that was experiencing repeated system crashes, was taking 10 minutes to boot up, took 10-15 minutes to shut down and ran just about every program at half the expected speed. In the case of this computer, Fix-It Utilities successfully removed a bunch of old programs, cleaned up the registry to remove mention of retired servers, and made a bunch of other changes. After that was done, I had it securely delete the unused portions of the drive. The end result is that this machine boots MUCH faster (under 3 minutes), hasn't had a crash since the clean up, and shuts down in less than 5 minutes.  After the maintenance was done, I uninstalled the Fit it Utilities software from the machine as it was no longer needed. I re-installed Symantec antivirus and was done. Uninstalling the software took some time, but no longer than uninstalling other utility packages.  By the way - I normally would have wiped the hard drive and re-installed the OS and apps from scratch with a machine that runs this poorly. In this case there was a particular program used to control a machine tool. The install disc was lost and the machine vendor is out of business so I could not go the reformat route.  To summarize - do not install this if your computer is working fine. If you have problems with crashes and slow speeds, this program may help you. Uninstall it after you are done with maintenance as it has the potential to slow your day-to-day computer activities down if left on 24/7.	1
This software will really help you clean up your computer. We used it to clean up an older computer to be reused again. It worked great. Helped it start up better and function much better. It also has anti-virus software to help protect your computer from viruses. I highly recommend this product.	1
This collection of mainentence software utilities is quick, easy and seemingly effective. Easy to install, it detects preexisting virus protection and gives you the option to use it or theirs.  The utilities are divided into three separate catgfories:  Security, Optimise and Fix and Maintain.  Security lets you set up different types of scans and set up block list.  Optimize has a fast disk defrag tool among others.  Fix and Maintain deals with system restore and file recovery and a scheduler for automatic maintenence. The company also provided a rather thick owner's manual which I appreciated.  I don't know that the scans are quicker than my previous system but the computer is running significantly faster.  The One Click Fix is sufficient for the average user but I like that there are options for those more technically adept.  The cost is reasonable and the scope is comprehensive. Recommended.	1
This will give my experience with Fix-It Utilities Professional, which took place over about a week of using this program on our home network.  We have three computers:  (1) HP Pavilion Slimline desktop PC (mine); (2) HP Pavilion Entertainment notebook PC (my husband's); and (3) Dell Inspiron notebook PC (backup/auxiliary).  All three run Windows 7 Home Premium with Internet Explorer 9; the HPs had Kaspersky and the Dell had McAfee for virus protection.  Installation was fairly easy on the two computers running Kaspersky.  On the HP laptop, it mostly installed except for the malware/antivirus program, which it would not load until Kaspersky was disabled.  For my HP desktop, Fix-It loaded everything.  For the Dell PC running McAfee, we ended up uninstalling McAfee and installing Kaspersky first.  We did try to install Fix-It with McAfee disabled but still ran into problems, i.e., we simply could not install Fix-It at all with McAfee.  We were going to take McAfee off the Dell anyway.  Once we had Kaspersky loaded onto the Dell, it still took three hours to load Fix-It because we kept getting error messages saying that the program had stopped functioning.  I was not unfamiliar with this type of performance program, having run TuneUp Utilities for the previous year with no problems whatsoever.  Fix-It offers most of the same features as Tune-Up, including pc analyzer, registry repair, one-click pc maintenance, program optimizer, and browser acceleration.  The file shredding and lost data recovery functions were enhancements over TuneUp.  Ironically, Fix-It advertises the ability to stop "frustrating PC crashes."  Well, we did not have any PC crashes before installing Fix-It.  About three days after installing Fix-It, both my computer and my husband's started experiencing the "blue screen of death."  For those of you unfamiliar with this unpleasant phenomenon, the entire screen goes blue with writing to the effect that Windows has encountered an insurmountable error and is going to shut down.  All data in progress at that point is lost.  Over the next four or five days, both of the HP computers experienced several blue screens.  We have had these HP's for about three years, and prior to installing Fix-It, we literally had never had any blue screens on these computers. Both my husband and I have been using pcs for over 20 years and are fairly experienced, but we do not have the patience, much less the special expertise, to deal with constant blue screens and the potential damage they can do.  We therefore took Fix-It off all three computers.  Since uninstalling Fix-It, the blue screens have stopped.  In particular, uninstalling Fix-It from the Dell turned out to be a royal pain. Under these circumstances, I cannot recommend this program.	-1
I am someone who only has a basic knowledge when it comes to computers so I wasn't sure if I was going to be able to set up and run this by myself. As luck would have it the instructions were really easy to follow and I was able to accomplish using this without any other assistance.	1
I have been experiencing a lot of glitches with my home computer and it is only a couple years old. I thought that I'd try this software to help extend the life and maybe just maybe relieve some of its issues. Instillation was easy and without problems. It seems to have fixed a few of my issues but not all of them. I think with this software I was able to get some more life out of my computer then if I hadn't utilized it. I believe at this point for my computer a complete re-install is necessary and will be performed soon. Good bandage but I don't think it is good for my particular problem.	1
This software advised me that a free software I downloaded was actually spyware. It appeared to me that the software was just fine.  But upon removing it, my computer issues dissapeared. I had tried nearly everything trying to figure out what was wrong. I even had an I.T. guy look at my laptop.  His advice?, "Buy a new one, it's 5 years old!"  This affordable FIX-IT software gave me my computer back!  Thank you Fix-IT!  The disc is easy to upload, software is easy to use, issues are easy to fix. I also used it on my desktop family computer and cleared up some minor issues that might have led to bigger problems later.	1
It is a toss up between giving this 3 stars or 4.  Either seems appropriate so I will lean towards 4 stars because it works and that is what really counts.  I own several PC's and I have this utility running on one and TuneUp 2012 running on others.  If I had to buy one of these I would definitely buy the Tuneup product.  It takes up fewer resources and runs much quicker than the Fix-It product listed here.  Don't get me wrong - this product works.  It found and fixed several issues and my PC works better because of it. It just takes a lot longer to run than the TuneUp does.  If I had to guess I would say it is 5 times slower than the TuneUp and the results are no different (not better, not worse).  The user interface is sort of neolithic too.  It would have been a cool runner 7-8 years ago but here in 2012 it seems out of date.  Would I recommend this?  Maybe, it depends on what kind of deal you can get.  If I had to select based on the product then TuneUp would win hands down based on speed & interface.  If I had to choose based on price, then this might win - if it were cheaper.  Your call, but like I said at the onset... it does work.	1
Yes, I own Fix-It, which I received through the Amazon Vine program.  However, after reading all the negative reviews of this software, I decided not to chance trying it. Thanks, but I have had enough of Blue Screen Death to last a life time. Admittedly, that's more a problem caused by Windows than by virus and malware software, but any software that causes it as often as this one seems to do must be problematic.  I have a laptop that had blue screen issues a few years ago, but after obtaining a new hard drive and new virus software --- none of the major brands --- that system has worked fine. I use it seldom, and would like to preserve it for those rare times I travel and must have a functioning PC with me.  Fix It sounds like it would cause more trouble than it solves.  When a computer virus and trouble-shooting program begins to guarantee that it will replace the computer if it is destroyed during installation or use, that's when I'll try Fix It!  Meanwhile, I will stick with the Kaspersky&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Kaspersky-Internet-Security-2012-3-Users/dp/B0056CZC2S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Kaspersky Internet Security 2012 - 3 Users</a>&nbsp;I've happily installed on the Windows 7 disk on my desktop --- also used seldom, but enough to need a viable virus program.  Thanks, but no thanks.	-1
Well, I don't know how it does on new computers, but I installed this on my older version HP and I've had nothing but problems.  Now I can't get my printer to work, and other programs are having a lot of problems.  I wish I would never had installed this thing.  The computer was fine before I tried this.  I don't know if it was this program, or if I got a virus by chance at the same time--but I'm now very disgusted.	-1
into the blue screen of death. Four times in an hour. After not having seen the blue screen of death in years.  I've kept some of the changes, but when this program had my computer running at its fastest, it ran it into a crash very often and didn't offer the least bit of guidance on how to fix the problem other than to uninstall and reinstall.  After doing that three times without fixing the problem, I uninstalled once and for all.  I do not recommend this program.	-1
There are better utilities out there that perhaps don't promise as much (Norton) but do deliver on their promises.  Cons:  -Lengthy installation -machine crashes increase after installing -major headache to remove  Three days on luckily a secondary machine with Fix-It that I can never recover...	-1
I have been using Tax Cut which is now H&R Block for years.  So far, everything is running OK.  But for late filers, it does not supply the hyperlinks do not work.  But, that's an easy fix.  You can simply go to IRS.gov for that particular year.  The one disappointing thing is the Deduction Pro link does not work.  I had to manually key in every deduction.  The Deduction Pro is one feature that I miss.  I wish they would bring back the Deduction Pro CD.  Hence the reason for the 4 instead of 5 star rating.	1
I took a distribution from a rollover IRA and had long term capital gains from a stock sale.  This program handled the complexities involved in those with no problem.  It also calculated the Michigan pension exemption correctly, something it didn't do last year.  State filing is #20 extra.	1
I usually review books, CDs and DVDs here on Amazon but I also - like you - need to prepare my tax return. Hence this review.  I've been using H&R Block's tax prep software (the Deluxe version) for at least 20 years and always found it the easiest to use and it provided good reporting. Until  this year's version. I prepared my first return - I do a few - last night and  first imported the data from last year's (2010) return  and then entered the data for 2011. There was a fairly large variation in the tax owed and so I thought I may have entered an incorrect amount. What I usually do then id go to "Forms", then "All Forms" and then choose "Two-year summary". This report compares each summary line on the return with the previous year - allowing you to spot an obvious error. But, the report was not listed. I thought maybe they renamed it and did a search. No luck. So I called H&R Block Tech support and spoke to two different staff there. When I showed them that, if they looked at list options under Forms for the two years they would find "Two Year Summary" missing. After being placed on hold for 3-4 minutes, the reps each told me ". No that form is not included this year". They had no explanation why.  In my opinion, this is one of the most useful fo9lms and H&R has taken one BIG step backward. The only way to do a comparison is to PRINT out both the 2011 and the 2010 returns and match the lines by hand. This wastes paper and takes time.  This may very well be my last year with H&R Block @ Home (formerly Tax Cut). Turbo Tax costs more - and is not as user friendly - but it offers this option (as far as I know).  So I'm alerting those who might be looking for the "Two-year Summary" that it is no longer included and have dropped my rating from what was once a five star rating to just 2 stars.  I hope you find this review helpful.  Steve Ramm "Anything Phonographic"	-1
H&R Blocks software is more intuitive, uploads the state and all updates faster without any hassle, and their customer support actually exists.  The T....T..people treated me like a waste of their time when I called which is why we switched to H&R Blocks some years ago.	1
This is a preview of what I think interested buyers would like in advance.  I will follow up with a more complete review when I finish my own taxes.  I have used this program year after year, so I don't expect to find too many faults, but as I said, I will do an update.  What I should have done is wait for a better price.  I bought it at 34 dollars and change.  You can get it now for 19 dollars and change.  Tax law has changed allowing banks, businesses, etc. to wait until much later to provide your tax information therefore there really is no need to buy early.  Update:  This year's version provides for downloading tax info from many financial firms.  Most firms have established deadlines when this feature will be available.  My firm will be ready to download on February 2nd.  Of course, you always have the option to enter the info from a paper form, or using online data at the firms web site. The tax software itself has had one update in late January and another update is scheduled for February 23rd.  Without the updating being completed (there may be more), you cannot submit your return with any confidence it is correct.  The software will tell you if another update is planned.  Update:  I downloaded data from my financial firm.  Numerous entries were created for Interest, Dividends, and Stock Sales.  It marks each entry asking you to verify each one.  All entries were accurate.  The download saved me a lot of time.  Update:  I submitted 6 returns (3 Federal and 3 State) for members of my family.  All electronically submitted returns were accepted by the IRS within 1 day.  All returns sailed through processing and refunds came very quickly as direct deposits.  The State returns cost $19.95 to submit electronically.  All Federal returns were free to submit electronically.  The software is worth every penny I paid!	1
I've used H&R Block's tax software every year since 2004. Some annoyances, but most of it is excellent.  The 2011 version is much like 2010.  You can save money by waiting for price dips (see below).  Unlimited number of tax returns: (family members, what-if copies of your return, etc.) 5 Federal e-Files included. Nice!  Unlimited paper filings for one state ($ 19.95 extra per state e-file). So, I just file state returns on paper.  I would say it delivers huge bang for the buck.  - - - Price Dips - - -  The amazon price swings mostly between 25 and 40 (see Note 2). Amazon has almost always had the best price. There's an "Online Price Alert" that will email you whenever this or any amazon product dips below your target price. Google it. It's nicely done.  - - - Typical minor annoyances - - -  These are all carry-overs from 2010   - Upgrade pitches: They weave it into the interview and make it sound as if "an upgrade to Premium is advised for your situation" even when it makes little or no sense for your situation. Sleazy.   - Unclear wording in a few places, although most wording is very clear and accurate.   - Privacy Policy: Hard to view. Hard to read. Has reassuring tone, but doesn't hold much water.   - Copy...Paste from Interview screens: That would be very handy at times. No can do. Can't print them either. Only way I found is ALT + PrintScreen, then paste the graphic into Word or a paint program.  - - - Alternatives - - -  <a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/TurboTax/dp/B005TK64AQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">TurboTax</a>&nbsp;is the head-on competitor.

The software is easy to use and navigate.  I have 7 rental properties, capital gains, dividends, a small business---and it walks me though everything.  I am very happy with the program.  I use it on a MAC--it was very easy to install.  (i am still running snow leopard and not sure if that makes a difference).  It comes with free audit support if you ever get audited.  i've been audited two times---both times I won!!!  It also includes a free phone call to a tax advisor but i didn't need to use that as the program is self explanatory.  You get 5 free federal efiles but have to pay for the state efile.  After you are done, i encourage you to save a backup copy as a PDF.  I learned the hard way that the on of the old pc versions i have can no longer be opened on the operating system i have on my pc so i can't really access those taxes.  But, if you save them as a pdf, you don't need the H&R block program to open the document--any computer will always be able to open it.  Lesson learned---luckily, those tax years were so long ago, that it didin't ultimately matter.  I don't print my taxes as they are over 100 pages due to the rental properties, deductions, capital gains, dividends, and small business.  I would highly, highly recommend this program.  It is a great value both because of its price and because it delivers a product far superior to the price they are asking (and superior to my experience with turbo tax	1
One would think that after so many years at it, H&R Block would be a lot further ahead with its tax software package, but it is more or less the same old thing, revised every year, but no dramatic improvements.  Another surprise, installation woes. Windows 7 in 2012, and you still can't install a simple program without issues. In my case, on a quadcore AMD 64-bit Windows 7 computer. On the third installation attempt, the Program Compatibility Assistant finally sorted it out on its own and the darned thing installed.  After the successful installation, you run the software for the first time. You have the option to register it, and then it automatically checks for updates on the internet.  From within the program, you can then select to install the State Program. You get one free State program with this version, but not a free state e-file. You can purchase additional State programs if you need multiple states. Installation of the State program is a program installation in itself, you have to close the H&R software and go through the installers.  Preparing taxes was the usual routine, going through the different Q&A screens, and on and on. Navigation, usability, and explanations could have been better. The e-filing part worked without issue. The Search feature is borderline useless, it looks like something from 1999. The program gets things done when you slog through it, but after so many years at it, it should have been a lot better at it.  Another major point of irritation: you get five free federal e-files and zero state e-files. It would be more fair if they offered five free e-files and it would be up to the consumer to decide how to use them, federal or state or a combination! Overall it does what it's supposed to do, in a rather clumsy fashion, but you can get things done.  I have not used the customer support or live help options, so I can't comment on them.  Even though I have been using this program for many years, it is disappointing to see how little things have changed in terms of user-friendliness and installation and operations.  For the first time in years, I am considering whether to switch to something else for the following tax year.	-1
I have been purchasing this product for the last eight years, ever since TurboTax crashed my computer when I tried to uninstall it. I then tried H&R Block and have never gone back. I find their product intuitive, good advice, good instructions, and easy to uninstall. I love their product and will never use anything else. Oh, did I mention it is always more reasonably priced than the Turbo.	1
I've been using H&R Block's software for more than 10 years, and it's the easiest of all to use.  I've never had a problem with it.	1
We have been using the H&R line of products for years. We are a double income family with no unusual sources of income or deductions.  It is quite easy for us to prepare our federal taxes and file them using H&R's program.	1

- Downloaded this version of Office for Mac because I upgraded to OS X Yosemite and didn't want to deal with apples version of office apps. - Price is right, but use the comparison chart on Microsoft website or Amazon to see the differences in this version vs more expensive and all inclusive versions. This version included Word, PowerPoint, and Excel. - Activated using the code that Amazon sent me. Easy process there. - Surprisingly easy to download, Amazon downloaded ran itself, and all I had to do is click my way along and the product showed up on the program dock. - It's easy to find downloaded or digital purchases in your order history and I'm confident Amazon will give me a assistance if for some reason I need to re-download in the future. - Best part: no box or CD to store!	1
Replacing the hard drive in my Mac forced me to repurchase the software.  I completely followed Apple's instructions on how to to copy my hard drive, (easy). (The Hard drive was purchased on Amazon.) Microsoft somehow detects this, and prevents the software from running on the new hard drive. I tried contacting Microsoft by telephone, the robot hung up on me. I was never able to speak to a human.  ALL other non-Microsoft software is operating perfectly with the new hard drive and required no additional money or effort on my part.  No complaints about the software itself, but clearly Microsoft is becoming more consumer hostile.	-1
If your not familiar with one of the only great products from Microsoft, you won't learn anything here. I upgraded my mac to Mavericks and had to part with Office for Mac 2004. Some changes I did not like but in time I got used to them	1
so I don't like putting a massive anti-virus or huge firewall up. I know what I'm clicking and I'm careful. But I'm a pro. For the newbie out there, or my mother (OMG I can't tell you the number of times I've had to fix her computer cause she clicked a bogus link), this little piece of software might just save you HOURS of your life and the migrane to go with getting hacked.  I noticed that it didn't slow me down too much. I'm devilishly fast, so I notice. A normal user wouldn't notice at all.  Think of this like safe sex, only for your computer. Or better yet, Purell hand sanitizer. It makes sure the hands you're shaking online are nice and clean.	1
Viruses are a real computer threat and after one wiped my computer I refused to have that happen again. I got a new computer and I ordered Norton Internet Security for my new Mac.  I didn't want anything happening to this huge investment, so far so good, fingers crossed for longer.	1
This product installed without a glitch.  I have heard that over 90% of computer viruses affect Windows only.  Apparently, Apple is becoming a more desirable target.	1
Norton as been around the longest and stays true to it's name. I think it is one of the pest internet security product there is. They have great customer service as well. Recommended	1
Mac viruses still make up a very small part of the overall virus world out there, but they are a growing target because of that fact plus the fact that more and more people are using Macs so the target is growing. Anyway, it's hard to see at this point if this product is making a difference but it is providing peace of mind now and I believe it will save the day in the future if a virus comes down the pike.	1
Since there are few to no viruses out for OS X at this time I can't really say if its working or not as far as malicious software, but it does have some nice features. I really like the IP connection notifications when I use Skype. Whenever someone tries to message me I get a notification if I want to allow IP: 142. XXX.XXX.XXX to connect to my computer. If I allow it their message gets sent to me. I could see this being very useful in the future for banning malicious IPs from connecting to my computer.  Even though the software does seem to weigh down my computer I find the extra security options worth it. Can't go wrong with extra security right?  Pros: Feels secure (Not really absolutely sure, seeing as I haven't found malicious software yet) Lots of customizable options on notifications/popups Many features for the security fanatics  Cons: Not designed for OS X 10.8 Apple already releases security updates fixing the latest exploits It slows my system down a good amount	1
It slows everything down, as others have also complained.  It installed easily enough, but once installed, my computer's performance took a real nose dive.  There's no way I can recommend this to others; sorry about that.	-1
We have both PCs and Macs at home and although I am a PC user first and foremost, it's important to protect all the machines. I have got viruses in the past from the internet, and my job involves spending a lot of time on the web, so it makes to take security seriously. Also, I have Norton software on another machine, and it has worked well.  Pros: -Easy to install. -Security options are customizable. -I'd certainly recommend for open networks. -Gives warning when detecting something potentially harmful. -Helps eliminate spyware and protects your machine.  Cons: -Noticeably slows down system, but not to the point of incapacitation (yet). -Some files regarded as spam, but to me I know they are not. Minor annoyance. -Blocks sites as harmful that I know are not. Again, minor annoyance.	1
It happens.  I actually had this in the pocket of my&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Belkin-F8N044-023-Notebook-CushTop-Stand-Dark-Sky-Pitch-Black/dp/B002GHCT2W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Belkin F8N044-023 Notebook CushTop Stand (Dark Sky/Pitch Black)</a>&nbsp;when I was trying to log into a site and discovered that I was blocked because of a problem with my computer.  I never saw that before.  Then I saw a bunch of attack screens pop up.  I'm like, seriously?  You just did that because you saw the Norton in my pocket.  Before I could install this, I had to update my OS X.  I have been ignoring, or doing my best to ignore 10.7 Lion.  I can fly with 10.6 and sometimes these upgrades seem gratuitous, especially with all the problems this one reportedly caused.  But it was worse than that because Apple wouldn't let me go up one step.  The word I am thinking of starts with a B, has 8 letters, and rhymes with astards.  I had to go up to 10.8.  Then finally, I was able to start the Norton Internet Security. Something that should have taken five minutes took over an hour.  Why is it that I have so much difficulty doing simple things?  I had done the upgrade to 10.8, against my will, but nevertheless.  This should have been a breeze.  This is NORTON!  The first error was that I could not run a scan because the program I JUST installed could not load the scan engine because it needed to be updated.  REALLY?  I just updated it.  THREE minutes ago.  Neither could I slide the simple on button of virus protection.  I just got error readings that told me I needed to do a Live Update that wouldn't run because I JUST did it.  I have 91 messages like this pending:  Norton AntiVirusError AntiVirus Auto-Protect could not load the scan engine. Please run LiveUpdate to get the latest version.  I know that it is faster for Rajesh and all his counterparts to use a remote control on my computer to get it to work and my degree of frustration had me let him.  I LOLed very loudly when I saw the same things happened to him for awhile.  He finally just deleted everything Norton from my computer and reinstalled it.  He was very polite but my computer still had to be invaded to get this program to work.  It should be easier.  I want to be able to think: Yes, put this on my computer and have it be done.	1
Since I am going to college online and have to upload and download files, I worry about what could happen, since I am online a lot. This gives me the peace of mind that my computer is protected. It is a nice piece of software.	1
The Norton Internet Security for Mac states clearly right on the box that it "Includes Norton Internet Security 4 For Mac OS X 10.4.11-10.6.8. I have OS X 10.6.8 and the box says that it includes this software which will work with my version! Great! Only, not so great, because they lied. This software won't work with OS X 10.6.8 at all. The installer says that I didn't have "OS X 10.7 +" so I couldn't install any of the software! Then why do they even state that it contains Internet Security 4 which works with my OS X 10.6.8 if you need 10.7 to install it? This makes no sense to me.  I tried to ask Norton Tech support a simple question and they refused to answer whether it was possible to install Internet Security 4 which requires the OS that I have. All Mustafa did was bombard me with questions on the Instant Messaging Window where I had just typed in what was going on and my question of whether it was even compatible. He refused to address that issue. Instead he asked where I got the program, did I install it, what's the keycode! The "guy" didn't even read what I wrote! I had already told him the software didn't allow me to install it!  This is my last foray into Norton products. I have a few more to try out and review but after that, I will not even bother, because they stink.  Update: Sometime after the above disaster, I received a phone call telling me that the product does have a program that would run on my Mac's OS. Unfortunately, I had already discarded the program in disgust.	-1
Norton Antivirus was used several years ago for virus protection on one of our workstations. It has continued to work well protecting the system from viruses, etc. until a new version was installed last month. Never had any issues with the product.	1
I've used a variety anti-virus products over the years, from the whimsically permissive to something that feels like your computer is in a maximum security prison and this products strikes a nice balance of ease of use with good security.  Installation was easy and once the system was rebooted and fully updated, I tried a variety of tasks and didn't notice much impact to system usability (disclaimer: I have a dual-quad core Mac Pro). I did notice that one of the CPUs was fully pegged while doing the regular scans, so I tend to schedule those very very late at night so it has minimal impact on the usability of the system.  The initial virus scan took what felt like ages, I have several multi-terabyte drives tucked away in the system and it took quite some time for the software to get through all of them.  For the average Mac user, Norton AntiVirus is a good choice for basic system security.	1
Mac viruses still make up a very small part of the overall virus world out there, but they are a growing target because of that fact plus the fact that more and more people are using Macs so the target is growing. Anyway, it's hard to see at this point if this product is making a difference but it is providing peace of mind now and I believe it will save the day in the future if a virus comes down the pike.	1
Overkill on a Mac? These days, probably not. And 20 bucks isn't a big investment when it comes to peace of mind. For Intel and PowerPC based Macs running Mac OS X 10.4.1110.6	1
I installed this with no difficulty and it seems to be working like a charm.  I'm quite sold on Norton.	1
Norton antivirus for MAC works great. I like the frequent updates feature as it constantly gets updates for real time threats and works more pro-actively. Reasonably priced.	1
I'm never really sure if I actually need anti-virus protection on a Mac since many people say you don't. However my belief is not that the Mac is bullet proof when it comes to viruses but that virus creators just don't bother to try because there are more PCs and that PC viruses are easier to create. That being said when I was offered the chance to obtain a copy of Norton Anti-virus for free via the Amazon vine program I jumped at the chance to do so.  My one concern is that Norton would slow down my Mac. Norton does not seem to do this on the PCs I use but MacAfee does. Anyway my concern was unfounded as there is no perceivable difference in performance now that NAV is running.  Installation (I got the CD) was painless and I feel that if a Mac virus does come along I'm protected as well as I can be since I've taken all the steps that I know how to. Additionally I try to be smart about email attachments, fake websites, phishing schemes, etc.  So I'm not totally convince a person needs this but if the price is right it may make you feel more secure and give you some peace of mind.	1
I installed the DVD version of NAV for a 27" iMac 2012 running OS X 10.7. Installation went well, no hiccups. I did have a little trouble getting the LiveUpdate to work but I called up Norton's support and they straightened everything out. I had an older Anti-Virus application installed that I forgot about and they helped me with removing that.  I've also noticed that scans don't seem to affect the computer's performance. Since I love to push my machine to its limits, I tried to think of what is the most resource intensive program I could run while running a scan. So I started rendering a Final Cut X project that I've previously rendered under the same conditions. It completed with only 2 minutes added to the total render time. With that small of a time increase it could very easily be due to the other system processes and all in all would not be noticeable during normal system use.  I know that most people will swear by Macs being pretty much invulnerable to viruses and the likes, and they very so may be correct. However, my view is if I've spent 2.5k on a Mac, $20 a year for assurance that my machine will stay running virus free is well worth it.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for peace of mind. I'm already planning on purchasing the new version for my MacBook Pro Retina whenever they update to 10.8 compatibility.	1
Good value for the money. Much cheaper than buying antiviral software directly from Symantec. It located 1 infected file and blocked 1 outside attack in the 2 weeks I have had it.	1
I installed this on my Macbook Pro without problems. I was leery it would slow my computer but it has not reduced speed of start up or performance. It didn't find any viruses or mal ware so I will have to wait to see if it catches anything. But at least I have the assurance that I have a security system in place. I will update at a later date.	1
The Norton software was easy to install and runs quietly.  There are daily updates to protect your Mac from newer viruses, software vulnerabilities and spyware.  This antivirus also safeguards your iPhoto pictures and iTunes media. I have not experienced any software glitches or issues with virus scanning, and feel comfortable recommending this Norton software as basic antivirus protection for most Mac users.	1
When I got this the Norton page didn't have the "Mac OS X 10.7 only" warning. My Mac is about 3 years old so I wasn't thinking it was that out of date, but I guess if I want virus protection I will have to upgrade as Norton tech support told me there is no alternative product for slightly older Mac operating systems.	-1
I've used Norton security products for PCs before, and I've just started using it on our Macs.  My Norton experience on PCs (of a couple of years ago) was mixed. The machines didn't have virus issues, but they seemed to get bogged down with Norton scans and such. Full virus scans could only happen when I didn't need to do anything else with the machines as they become unusably slow.  Thus, I've been pleasantly surprised at how smoothly and quietly Norton for Mac takes care of things. It doesn't bog things down as far as we can tell. The installation was easy, and the application appears to run smoothly and stay in the background with just the occasional notification / question pop-up to respond to.  Even the thorough, file-by-file virus scan zips through smoothly and essentially in the background.  Most importantly, we've not had any virus-related issues while this software has been deployed. I suppose that's the most critical topic, but it should be noted that our Mac went about nine months without any virus protection before we installed Norton...and never had an issue.	1
Antivirus software is one of those that you have to trust is working, it's hard to actually say it's working without knowingly putting a virus on your system. So when I had the chance to try out this item I did. I've used Norton in the past on windows PC's and it's always been somewhat cumbersome in how it ran. It would use system resources and slow down the system. My fan would kick on at all hours of the day and night as scans were ran and it just made using my PC unbearable.  Enter Norton Antivirus for Mac. It seems like they fixed the issues that the PC versions have. It didn't take up all the resources on the mac, it still ran fine. Now is it working? I don't know and I won't put a virus on my system to check. But all signs show this is good. Scans are fast, user interface is friendly. Overall it's a good product.  If you think you need antivirus software for your mac, I can recommend this to you.	1
Not many manual controls. Otherwise, Norton Antivirus ("NA") detects, removes old at the installation, and blocks well new viruses from accessing through email, downloading, or copying, has a small initial footprint, but does not uninstall completely and leaves a residue interfering with superseding security programs, which requires a special uninstalling program from the Internet. NA is constantly up-to-date. It works fast and in the background, and allows manual customization in case of an atypical computer setup. A description of virtually every case can be found on the Internet.  Initially, NA takes up less than 100 MB of memory (RAM) that is much less than the competitors. However, not all memory (RAM) used to monitor the running programs is freed after closing them. But, it tends to slowly increase memory retention during or after using especially Web browsers. That so called memory leakage might drain away memory causing the computer to slow down to a crawl and theoretically even to a halt (crash). However, it is unlikely and would be unnoticeable at worst in and thus irrelevant to modern, multi-core computers with min. 4 GB of RAM (memory).  NA automatically updates its new virus data base via the Internet by the included 1-year subscription. Its operations are transparent in the background. It is as fast and thorough as other leading security programs. The installation is simple and fast. Everybody could do it.	1
Norton didn't slow down my Mac or give me any problems. This antivirus software is stable and gives me some peace of mind knowing I have in case some new threat emerges.	1
I've used H&R Block's tax software (formerly called TaxCut) every year since 1995. Several times when I saw a promotional deal I purchased both TaxCut and TurboTax to compare. I found that TurboTax did not do anything better than TaxCut while costing consistently more. In addition, I like the option of being able to file 5 free Federal e-files as I do taxes for other relatives who are less computer savvy.  H&R Block software also wins if compared to the free on-line options. I don't like using the on-line tax programs for two reasons (1) I don't want my financial data to be on someone's web site (2) free offers include the Federal tax only.  This year I used a digital download for the first time rather than a boxed version. I liked the security of having a physical CD in case I need to re-install on another computer several years down the road. But you are supposed to be able to download the software again to a different computer and when the boxed version was not available I went digital.  Downloading the software was easy, however during the install I got an error registering the software.  When I started the software it immediately gave me a prompt to enter a key-code which (the prompt said) I should have received in the email after purchasing the software.  The email I received from Amazon contained no such key-code.  I had to call Amazon support and they told me that this information can be found following these steps 1) Log into Amazon 2) Select Your Account at the top right of the page 3) Select Games and Software downloads which is towards the bottom of the long page you see when you log in 4) Then under H&R software entry you will see the key-code that you need to enter to unlock the software  Once this was done the rest of the software functions well. In fact it looked more polished than in prior years. I always had minor display problems because I use large fonts and they never scaled quite right.  This year everything displayed perfectly.  I read one review which mentioned a problem with seeing selection boxes.  The problem there most likely caused by low screen resolution.  Both Windows and Mac minimum requirement for screen resolution is 1024 x 768 pixels or higher.  At a lower resolution, there will be problem with display such as not seeing selection boxes. Screen resolution can be changed on your control panel by change PC's display settings.  I did a preliminary tax return and below are my observations.  1. H&R Block starts the interview process with an annoying up-sell pitch, recommending an upgrade from Deluxe to Premium even when it is not necessary.  2. Copy and Paste from Interview screens is not possible. Sometimes I wish to do it for some issue as a reminder to myself. My solution is to do PrintScreen (holding ctl key, shift key, and PrintScreen key at the same time). This generates an image of the screen, which I paste into paint or photo editing software which I can print or save for later.  3. I don't use the default location for the tax returns, as I want to my backup program to back up only the data not the software itself. The software does not  initially remember this new location on startup, it tells me I have no returns.  I needed to pick the return manually from the File menu, as it does remember recently used files. The third time I started the software, it finally knew the location of the tax return file.  4. Some forms (such as foreign tax credit over the limit to be directly on 1040) require entering data manually.  This year the foreign tax credit form is some what automated, when you hit next button it takes you to the next place on the form you need to fill out (last your you were just presented the form to fill out on your own). This form is not that hard to do manually as this form does not change year to year.  5. I use large font option on my monitor display and in the past had display issues (some things were displayed on top of each other). This year all forms displayed properly with this option. This is the first time in all the years I've used H&R Block software that I have no complaint about the display and did not need to change my monitor settings just to do the tax preparation. Nice!  6. H&R Block charges $19.95 to e-file each state return. Of course, this charge can be avoided by printing the forms and mailing them in.  7. In prior years the package include DeductionPro software. This year, like last year, this software is only available as an online tool. I will not use software that requires me to put my financial data on their site, and DeductionPro wants to import the data to H&R web site, so I will not be using it. Disappointing.  8. The price on this package changes day to day. I found a nice tools that shows history of Amazon prices and allows you to generate an email alert when the price reaches our desired price range.  If you enter "price history alert" in Google it will come up at the top, it has the word camel in the name.  I find this tool very helpful.  I purchased this package for $31, last year I saw the prices fluctuate between $25 and the list price of $44.99.  9.  For folks trying to download State Forms before January 16, 2012. The state forms are not available for download until January 16 for most states. If you go to the Software Update Center on H&R website you will see a section called State Updates. Under there you there is a link called "Forms Available". If you click on that, it will show a table that shows availability of forms for each State.  Right now (last checked on 1/6/2011) none of them are available.  I called about my state (Massachusetts) and they told me that most state forms will become available for download on January 16. In the software package, select State Tab and click the button that is called "Buy"  (a little scary since we already paid for it) but then "buy"  will turn into "update" and when the forms will become available they will be downloaded to your computer.  10. ** ERROR ALERT ** 1/16/12 Version of Massachusetts state return contained an error that was corrected in 1/24/12 update. If you owed taxes on your 2010 State return and paid owed tax in 2011, this payment was incorrectly included in Line 36 on the MA Form 1 as an amount withheld in 2011. This overstates the amount paid to the State for the 2011 tax year. This error has been reported to H&R and corrected in 1/24/12 update. Thank you to Tech Impaired to spotted it and reported to H&R!  I have been a H&R Block/TaxCut user for many years. The interview process is helpful in reminding you things you might have forgotten. On-line help is useful.  2011 H&R Block package appears more polished and has a number of improvements to a couple of small pet peeves I had in the past.  So I am quite pleased with it and recommend it!  Ali Julia review	1
Received as promised	1
Never had a problem with any of the H&R Block tax software versions including this one.	1
Good....as expected	1
best tax prep software i've ever used.	1
After spending countless hours trying to get Turbo Tax, which I'd used for about 10 years, to fill in and calculate my taxes correctly, I gave up and bought H&R Block At Home Deluxe + State 2011 instead.  The download took less than a minute and installed quickly with no problems at all.  H&R has a feature that can get your info from last year's Turbo Tax but since I'd had so much trouble with Turbo and was concerned that it might get this year's instead, I started from scratch with adding our information.  The whole process went quickly and it filled in and calculated our taxes.  It was able to handle the HSA account info accurately and without a glitch.  This was what had caused the problem with Turbo.  It also took me through itemized deductions, interest and dividends easily.  The interface isn't as graphically appealing as Turbo Tax, but it's easy to use and did my taxes accurately.  I was able to download the state version for free and it took less than 5 minutes for it to install, get my info from the federal taxes and fill it out.  Both state and federal seemed to go faster with H&R and it was very straightforward.  I'll be using H&R Block from now on.	1
Once again the H&R Block tax package made my job easy. Our taxes are fairly complicated, with a home office, a business, capital gains, itemized deductions, depreciation, mileage, and other tax details that can keep you on your toes.  Once our figures were compiled and in a spreadsheet, using this software had the taxes complete and ready to mail inside of two hours. Once upon a time I used to spend all day long, on the floor surrounded by piles of papers, with a calculator, extra copies of the tax forms, and a pencil. All of that is pleasantly, a distant memory.	1
A convenient and more economical software to allow tax preparation. Been using for 15 + years. Tried Turbotax once when computers were very primitive (IBM AT Type)and it over loaded the processor so went to TAXCUT, the forerunner of HRBlock and been happy ever since. Besides Turbo was quite a bit more expensive. Handles schedules C & D well and provides state returns in this package. So filing federal gets the state done too. Once had to contact HR Block and they were spot on with the assistance.	1
I have used taxcut for at least 10 years with no issue.  Granted, my return is not that complicated, w-2, several 1099's, mortgage interest, real estate taxes, and a K-1.  The federal and state went smoothly and e-filed both.  The only complaint, which is why it gets 4 stars rather than 5, is that past versions allowed you to compare the current year with the national average.  This is not longer a feature (at least not during the interview process).	1
Independent reviews rate this software virtually as good as TurboTax and you save $$. I purchased last years version and found it to be no different than TurboTax in ease of use and efficiency at finding ways to save paying more taxes than you need to.	1
Norton! Nuf said	1
fits the need.	1
Good	1
Norton's products used to be a trial to install.  No more.  Each release has gotten easier and the latest one is a breeze.  I bought this as a download.  Does anyone want or need CDs any more?  Can't beat the convenience. Norton's anti-virus products always rate at or near the top in computer magazine reviews.  I've never had a problem with malware getting past them.	1
This works well, I like the vault feature to remember passwords and information. I find it easy to use and slows me down a little less than some other protection programs.	1
I have used Norton anti-virus and security products ever since I first became involved with computers in the late 1990s. For the most part, Norton products have served me well over the years, aside from a glitch or two along the way. I have installed this version on three machines, one running Windows 7, one running Windows Vista, and the third equipped with Windows XP. The installation on the old XP machine gave me the most trouble. I had to stop the installation, restart the machine -- which had frozen -- and then finish the installation. Everything went smoothly on the two newer operating systems, and I have been pleased with the performance of this product since installation.	1
I've used Norton 360 for years now and I couldn't be happier with it.  It keeps my information safe, my computer tuned up, and it keeps my passwords handy so I can log into my accounts quicker.  What else do you need in a security suite?  Update:  I used Norton 360 happily for years but their latest update is highly flawed and it keeps timing out when I try to log in on both of my computer.  The only fix is to uninstall and reinstall the entire software suite apparently.  I've been on chat with support multiple times and that is all they can do to make it work.  While I write this I'm on hold on the chat system and have been for over 25 minutes again.  If they fix this it will become a 5 star product again but there is something seriously wrong with the current updates and windows 7 computers at least so I can't recommend this to anyone until its fixed.	-1
It works well with Windows 7 and I have it installed on 3 different PC's. No complaints here. 2 more words	1
Amazon had the best price for Norton 360 for 365 days than the norton website. I paid almost $28. I received the cd for the product, too. The norton software on my computer was about to expire any day when I received my new norton  antivirus in the mail. I am a satisfied Amazon customer and norton user.	1
Norton 360 is the best Antivirus program on the market today and yesterday. I have been using it for about 20 years and have not had a virus in my computers. I had viruses with other brands. Our computer Club switched to Norton.	1
Recommended for anti-virus and automatic back-up.  It works and buying the whole package from Amazon is cheaper than renewing through Symantec.  I didn't reload it.  Just used the code to renew for another year.  Will probably do the same next year.  Doesn't seem right that it's cheaper to buy the whole package from someone else than to renew but it is.  Go figure.	1
I recently was running 'AVG free edition' on my Dell dual core Vista PC with 3GB RAM. Just the other day, I was attacked by a 'Trojan' virus, which AVG could not apparently get rid of (I even tried a full system scan). I still kept getting pop-up messages regarding the virus and a new tab I never had before. I also had audio advertisements running without my choosing at times, even when I closed my browser! Talk about annoying. So I decided to can 'AVG' and go with Norton 360, which I downloaded. It seems to be working in some regards, but a full system scan took nearly 6 hours (5 hours, 50 minutes to be exact)! Is this normal?  UPDATE 6/26: Today, Norton 360 keeps asking me to re-start my computer, each and every time I turn it on!  2 starts every time I want to use my PC?  Are you kidding me?!  Ridiculous!  It also did not stop yet another Trojan virus, which it cannot 'quarantine' or get rid of.  Now I have 2 tabs i've never had before, and the ad music keeps playing again, even when i'm logged off of my 'Explorer' browser.  And 'Windows Security Center' does not work at all.  It has been disabled (I get a message stating that 'the security center can't be started').  I cannot turn it on or off, which includes updates and firewall settings too!  In addition, many applications run very slowly, or don't run at all when Norton is updating automatically!  You would think a 'full system scan' would have taken care of my issues.  There is a reason this crappy security suite is 63% off (at time of download)! What a waste of 32 dollars.  I am going to try Kaspersky, and hope it fares better than this.	-1
I purchased this thinking that I had purchased a full version at a bargain price.  It arrived today.  However, it was only a 30-day trial version.  I saw nothing on the Amazon.com page describing it as a trial version, and their is nothing stating that on the box that the program came in.  I tried to get support from Corel and found that I did not have the qualifying code to receive support.  This is only a review of my own experience this one time.  It should be balanced out with reviews published by other customers.  I hate to think that such an outstanding and respected company would deliberately function in this manner. It must be a mistake; but I am returning the program to Amazon.com for standard refund.  I have already attached the appropriate labels and sealed the box.  Note that I have not been harmed, just inconvenienced.  If any employee of Coral wants to add anything to this review, I'm open.	-1
Never purchased; don't own a Mac.  Did purchase FTM for PC, which I would rate as 4-star, AND it was the current version!	-1
You need to be very patient to use this buggy software. And to use the added features is going to cost you. It's like buying a nice inkjet printer and finding out that ink costs more than the printer. All that I swear I've had more Mormons visiting my house since I started using this. Seriously. I stopped using it and went to something more reliable.	-1
Do not buy this software unless you want: an installation headache, frequent computer crashes, a heavy drain on memory and super slow computer speed, and choppy video playback. And just for reference I am running an upgraded Dell XPS with Windows 7. There is no reason for a program like this to turn my computer into the sluglike machine it became with Cyberlink installed.	-1
This is too bad, because I have other Cyberlink (PowerDirector video editing) programs that I really like. But this one, let's see: install problems, slow, program freezes, computer freezes.  I think I'll uninstall and just go out and buy a Blue Ray player. Not worth the headache, definitely not worth the $100 price tag.	-1
I want software that plays media, including BluRay, on any device. I don't want malware, ads, software that insists on interfering with my firewall; in short, this program is invasive and not the kind of thing I want installed on the computer. I couldn't de-install it fast enough. Not recommended.	-1
If you have content that you want to convert (DVDs or BluRays), this won't do what you need, because those discs are copy-protected with DRM (digital rights management).  In order to convert those discs to a format you could play from another source (like your iPad, iPhone, Kindle Fire, or tablet), you need to somehow remove the DRM first.  This product doesn't do that.  The rest of the features for this product are clunky and are redundant when you realize that your PC already has Windows Media player and probably iTunes installed.  I'm afraid this product really doesn't solve anything for me.	-1
Honestly I just wouldn't buy the Cyberlink PowerDVD 12 Ultra software. I installed it on a laptop running Windows 7 and installed the Android app on my Samsung Galaxy S2 Skyrocket as a test platform.  *Laptop: Lenovo x201 with 4GB of RAM, i5 Processor and Windows 7 *Phone:  Samsung Galaxy S2 Skyrocket running Android 2.3  Pro's *Can't say I found anything that made me want to use the product.  Con's *It really doesn't play "All Media." *I could never get the link to work between my laptop and my android phone. *The software seemed to bog down the laptop by putting a load on the processor. *Every time I started my laptop Cyberlink would launch and I could not find a setting that would prevent that action at startup. *Not intuitive at all. *Generated crashes  It was bad enough that after trying to for two weeks to get the software to a minimum level of usability I finally uninstalled the software from my laptop and the app from my phone. Cyberlink is also the gift that keeps on giving. I still had crash and error issues after uninstalling the software. Using a cleaner fixed the issues but save yourself the headaches and just don't get it.	-1
I got this because I wanted to be able to watch my Blu-Ray movies on my computer and the feature that allows me to play my media on any device really caught my eyes.  I was highly disappointed after I tried it out. While it can play Blu-Ray movies, it is the other video media that seems to have problems with. There were many videos that I tried to play that were on my computer to my PS3 that it would tell me that it was unsupported data. I also noticed that when I tried to watch things on the PS3, there were a lot of videos missing and I can't figure out what the issue was. They were all .avi or .mkv and yet only some videos show up and others don't and they are all in the exact same folder.  Also, the connection isn't that great. I've used Vuze before as a media server and that one trumps this by far. If you want to fast forward a little, it lagged and got hung up.  While all the features sound good, it just doesn't do what I need it to do.	-1
Argh... I remember being stuck with a limited selection of software that would play HD DVD (for those that remember that now dead and well orphaned product) and Blu-ray and being faced with the choice of PowerDVD and a few other products (including from a competitor of the manufacturer of this product).  In the end, well, I'd have to recommend going with a competing product *still* as it seems that Cyberlink has failed in any real effort at improving their products in any significant manner.  Let me summarize it this way -- this product is ok if you have no other choices, but if you check around just a little you'll find you do have choices and I think you'd be happier with those products rather than this one.	-1
Listen to the words of the reviewers who tell you that this product is unnecessarily troublesome to install (it took me three attempts to find success). Listen to the words of the reviewers who tell you that this product freezes (it happened to me four times ... and then I cleansed my system of it.) And, truly listen to the reviewers who inform you that this is "bloated." My Alienware is under a year old ... and I can feel the drag of this software. On a new computer? I cannot imagine what it would be like on an older computer.  As a number of reviewers noted, after every less-than-glowing review is a boilerplate comment from the company. They ask for more details about the errors. Anyone else have the impression that this product wasn't thoroughly beta-tested? Or maybe that people are paying nearly $100.00 to be beta-testers? That's a shame.  If this were freeware, I would have still uninstalled it (and I would have still used a cleaner after it). At nearly $100.00, I cannot imagine how anyone can think he/she is getting a product that reflects that (hefty) price-tag. A true disappointment.	-1
Don't use.	-1
Maybe it's I've been hardwired into Microsoft Word for so long, but I don't find this program to be all that intuitive. It comes with a crude and inaccurate tutorial that is virtually useless. Fortunately, there are many how-to books on the market, and I have acquired on. The best I can say so far is that this app was relatively inexpensive.	-1
I have six computers and all of them run Kaspersky in one version or another. I put Kaspersky Pure 2011 on my computer last year. I don't use it to manage the other computers and so I figured it was a waste of computer resources and decided to take advantage of a sale on Kaspersky Internet Security (KIS) 2012. I've installed and used the KIS before on all my six computers and others. In the past, I was able to install a newer version of Kaspersky without uninstalling the older version. Last Spring when I installed KIS 2011 on my daughter's computer, I had a problem and had to uninstall the previous version of Kaspersky. No problem. When I tried to install KIS 2012 on my computer last week, I also encountered the uninstall request, so I tried to uninstall Kaspersky Pure to no avail. It kept hanging up after going through most of the uninstall and my computer froze and had to be rebooted. This occurred three, separate attempts and my computer froze at the exact same point each time. Well, I needed AV software particularly since I was beginning my last online graduate class on cybersecurity. So, I had no choice but to order Kaspersky Pure 2. I could not call Kaspersky only email them. When they got back to me, I had already installed Kaspersky Pure 2. This installed without a problem and no hanging up or rebooting was needed. So, Kaspersky's response was a form letter kind of response about incompatible software, firewalls, uninstalling other versions of AV software etc. I emailed them once again. Really, they should look into this because I do not want to have to install Pure next year! I have not yet heard back from them. I will say that when one of my daughter's accidentally downloaded malware to one of our computers, Kaspersky was spot on and responded in a timely fashion and provided steps on removing it and sending them the evidence. So, either they have changed since last year, or they don't care about this problem. The two stars are about the issue of not being able to uninstall Kaspersky Pure - ridiculous. I have a Windows 7 64-bit Dell core i7 laptop with two solid state hard drives and an undercarriage cooling system. Other than this issue, the Pure 2 has worked well except that I apparently encountered TWO (count 'em) Trojans on a very reputable website (doing research paper work) and rather than quarantine them, Kaspersky Pure 2 presented a message stating that they could not be quarantined, that I must delete the archive or do nothing. I don't know what archive it was referencing but without any other options, I did what I was told and had to do this twice - I guess one for each Trojan. With other malware in the past, Kaspersky has always quarantined it. I am unsure what to make of this but haven't had time to research it.	-1
The title should say it all.  This is a Microsoft product - and follows along in a long line of poorly designed-for-the-average-user technology/software.  I hope to warn you so you'll avoid the hell I've been having.  Consider getting an Apple and free yourself to do other things in life than solve for why your computer isn't working smoothly.	-1
when I loaded it it was fine but  it has big issues with windows explorer it keeps crashing	-1
I had wanted to downgrade my Windows 8 laptop to a Windows 7 OS, but I was advised by a knowledgeable friend that this was fraught with all kinds of peril, not the least of which it was too complicated and would've carried the risk of damaging my laptop.  Rather than risk damaging my machine, I sold Windows 7 Home Premium to a friend whose Windows 7 OS was messed up.  I couldn't use it, but I'm glad I could help someone else who could.	-1
So to start, let's get this out of the way. There are a lot of free products out there. These suites are perfectly fine for an average users, with a notch down on the scale in terms of the user interface and visual appeal. These suites do lack some features for power users, or, if money is not really a consideration, maybe the user interface is worth the extra funds.  This is my first WordPerfect product. I've been using Office products for years, but I used to use Lotus and OpenOffice as well with no real issues. There was a slight learning curve with this product, but nothing too great. The word processing portion was fine, worked great, no reason to dislike it really. Creating the document, spelling checking, a quick check, nice formatting options. It's all there and right up there with Word I felt. The power point presentation equivalent, Presentations, worked great. There were themes, easy to use animations, a some sounds, clip arts. It worked exactly as expected and required very little in terms of investigation to figure things out. Word Perfect Lightning, basically a an advanced note taking product was kind of compact and fun. I kind of liked that little edition although I am not sure light users would do much with that. I found the XML project offering kind of interesting too, but that will take more investigation and a hobby approach that i didn't get into fully to really review that... which leaves Quattro, the excel equivalent.  Here's the problem I ran into Quattro, it was really, really buggy. And by was I mean is. It would not actually launch the first dozen times I attempted to run it. I ran it as an admin, tried running the .exe, ended the process in Task Manager and finally ran it in compatibility mode. Once i ran it in compatibility mode, i could launch the program but none of the budgets or built in projects would load. I spent more time crashing out of the program that stopped responding than actually using it. I did install the service pack, tried looking through the knowledge base to no avail. I am running Win 7 64-bit. It is a gaming rig i built myself, so it is not lite in terms of specs. There is no logical reason for this to be happening really, although I have read Win 8 with ATI cards might have a problem.  For me, without a fully functionally spreadsheet, this just won't work for me as an Office replacement. I use excel professionally, and it looked like there were Pivot Table replacements, they call them reports, the formulas worked fine, Macros are available... this is a really rich suite that would great for a better price and especially since the EULA allows for 3 PC installs at the same time when Microsoft is going the opposite direction with a single install and a much higher price. I can't fully recommend a product I cannot get up running at 100%. Of the all the products on here, including Winzip, Paperport and some interesting utilities like the custom dictionary and XML offering, Quattro was the only one with an issue. In an office suite though, that spreadsheet is important.	-1
I use word processing software all the time. Lately it's been either Microsoft Word or Open Office. I've been pretty happy with both. Word is significantly better if you're doing any kind of fancy formatting, but Open Office works fine for simple text stuff - and since it's free, that's the one I use when I'm not at work.  I had not tried WordPerfect before but was excited to, since I'd heard good things about it. But.. I didn't like it. Not at all.  The first problem, and biggest, is that it crashed every time I tried to open an existing Word document. It is supposed to be capable of handling practically every format, and yet any .doc file not created in WordPerfect crashed the software. I don't know if this is my version of Windows or what (I have W7) but I was not happy about that. It pretty much made it 100% useless - I tried reinstalling and etc, but nothing helped.  But let's say I did do something wrong and it's my fault about the crashing, even then I do not like the software. I thought it was obnoxious, complicated and ugly. I hate looking at the screen. I hate zooming in and out. I hate changing the format. Again, maybe I'm stuck in my ways, but I don't like it. My reasons may not be the best and are mostly cosmetic, except for the crashing, which literally happens all the time - right now, for example, it just crashed for no reason. All I was doing was testing some of the different toolbars! Still, I'm uninstalling it ASAP and going back to OpenOffice, which, generally speaking isn't that great.  OVERALL: Don't buy! I don't know why it crashes all the time, but it does and the last thing you want is an important document to be ruined by terrible software. Even if that is fixable, however, I would not recommend it just out of user complexity. Download OpenOffice, it's free and works much better.	-1
A way to track your stolen laptop or computer, sounds great.  What you're buying is not software, but rather an activation number for this software through the Norton website.  It installs easily, but I didn't have the need to track my device.  However, assuming it got stolen, tracking my iPhone or laptop would have limited utility.  My inner city Police Department isn't going to be interested that I can track my missing iPhone to a region of the city, nor would I confront a thief over an iPhone.  The security this service provides is suspect at best and since there are plenty of free apps overing a similar sense of false security, there are more economical choices if you're interested.  Not recommended.	-1
Over my life I have had electronic items stolen or lost more than once.  Once I lose them they seem to never return.  So, when I got a chance to try this item it was with high hopes.  Although it might help if my phone or computer was stolen by someone who uses it over the internet in a public space (so that I can confront the thief), I don't think that this would be very practical in most situations.  It was disappointing to find that many of the features that this program are available free online.  I conducted a mock kidnapping of my laptop and tried to find it via the Norton Anti-Theft.  I had a very difficult time but I eventually pinned it down to a few houses.  I was disappointed in this as it does not seem accurate enough for retrieval.	-1
This Norton software is set up to work when your laptop is on WiFi. It sounded cool as you can lock down your laptop remotely and show a courtesy message, but as people have pointed out anyone with some knowledge of computers may be able to over ride it, if they reinstall the operating platform.  This software proved mostly useless, as it did not locate my mobile device accurately. For my laptops it was a little fussy to set up, especially on Windows 8. It had trouble locating the laptop even when on WiFi. It can also take pics from the webcam enabled laptop at 10 second intervals but that feature did not work well for me.  The IP address search if the computer is not on WiFi is also very approximate, and wouldn't do any good if the laptop was actually stolen.  Overall, it seems like too much money for just 1 year subscription. As other reviewers have pointed out there are free apps available for this type of stuff which are not as full featured but do the basic job.	-1
At first I thought that this product would be great for my teenagers' computers.  Then I read the fine print.  1. The "protection" is good for 1 year only & then you get to pay again. 2  You have to put in a credit card number when you install the software. 3. There is a Norton anti-theft icon on your desktop for any would-be thief to see. 4. Any would-be thief that knows a little about computers can override this Norton software and/or wipe the hard drive.  This software does not live up to my expectations.  For a laptop locator, I'd look elsewhere.  For phone tracking, I can do that for free on my Windows phone & the GPS is accurate, so this Norton software is not something I'd consider buying for my phone.  I believe that Android phones have a free tracking app too.	-1
The product info says," Norton Anti-Theft for 3-users" yes, it will allow for 3 devices, but there is only a set up for one user and one log-in and password. Besides the fact that it is not very accurate at locating a device, we tested it in the college library, what a joke! I do not recommend this at all, and besides that there are better, FREE anti-theft programs out there that DO work! (just search the web), this is really not worth buying.	-1
Up until acquiring this product last month, I had used the 2011 edition of Sage Peachtree. I loved it. The set up was simple for my small business. Based in NH, I did not have to worry about the tax element of the program. But after two years, I felt it was time to update my software. I have an associates degree in accounting, so I did not need it for the technical aspect, just the update.  Besides a couple screen layout changes, I really did not notice a heck of a lot of changes. Certainly not any changed to justify the price. When I found out that the program required the payroll subscription yearly to operate, I decided to uninstall and go back to my old software. I am a sole proprietor, and play both owner, and the only employee. I do not need payroll software.  If you have a large company with multiple employees it sounds like this program will work for you. But for small businesses, especially sole proprietors, I would use a different software. This just is not meant for business owners like myself. If you have a knowledge of accounting and just want a software to create inventory control and bank statements, I would look into buying the 2011 edition of peachtree. By now you can find it for a low price, and it works well.	-1
I am looking to replace quickbooks pro.  I would really love to replace quickbooks pro. I wish their was something available that would. I was hoping this new Sage 50 Complete was a viable replacement. However it seems that Peachtree has been bought out and Sage has turned the product in to some sort of subscription based accounting software.  You will be spending much more money than the initial $200 to get started fee. At least $250 or more annually. If they had taken a similar approach to the ink jet printer market they would have offered the program for $50 and then made you shell out more to continue. However the up front cost plus the high subscription fees make this a ridiculous purchase. I will not be continuing down this path. If you have peachtree, don't upgrade unless you have to and are prepared too. If you are on quickbooks, stay on quickbooks. Make sure you know full about what you are getting in to with this Sage program. It is an accounting program that adds to their bottom line, not yours.  1 star ridiculous.	-1
It's insane to me that you have to pay over $200 for a software that can only be described as base software since you'll have to pay much more to get any use out of it.  All tax tables require an additional investment and you cannot enter information manually. I have not used previous versions of this software but I understand they did allow manual data entry.  I feel like this is one of those "FREE" iPad games that require you to pump more and more money into it if you want to keep playing. If you need good accounting software, I'd look elsewhere.	-1
I've had a small business for years, and I've kept the books for it using another popular software that suits my few needs quite well.  This software program is far too complicated for my needs.  Perhaps it is perfect for a large and growing concern, but it's not good for me.  I'm going back (happily) to QuickBooks where I can be small and remain small.  This experience would have convinced me to give this product an average (three rating).  However, finding that I needed to buy more (tax tables), gives me a bad impression of the product, thus the rating was knocked down a notch.  I have noticed a number of software manufacturers now include this feature.  You get a thirty-day trial, but then you have to buy an additional feature at a significant cost.  I consider this a poor strategy to maintain a happy customer base.  Two Stars	-1
I was expecting a bit of a learning curve with Sage 50, but after spending several hours with it, it ended up being way too complicated and not worth the effort in wasting any more time. Unless you're already familiar with the program or have somebody who knows what they're doing working with this, I can't recommend it. It's just not worth the extreme hassle -- they could have made this much easier to learn for the average person, or even somebody with a little knowledge in the area like myself.	-1
I ordered te Sage 50 Complete Accounting 2013 and it installed alright, ran ok, but I really am very dubious about a program that has such a high annual "renewal cost".I will more than likely return to my previous program that I used before installing Sage.  At $650, for me, a person with a small home-based business, I just cannot justify the cost.  I have not had to call custmer service for any reason, but based on the other reviews I have read,it seems that I have been most fortunate.	-1
The 2013 version of Sage Pro Accounting edition is very different from older/previous versions. The most significant chance is you have to pay to have the tax format tables work. Previous editions of Sage have always given the user the option to enter their tax information manually. This process is moderately easy and once learned is very easy to annually update (and costs nothing). However Sage Pro or any edition of Sage has never been an easy program to pick up and use with ease. For new users who have never touched a Sage program I would Highly recommend reading up on it prior or else you'll be left with a blank stair or confusion.  Sage Pro is more of a business edition meant mainly for small business or people who must also manage their employees.  I have used Peachtree software in the past and it has always been reliable and easy to use. However the 2013 Sage Pro has turned their popular program into another way to make tons of money. Depending on your choices you could easily spend $250-300 dollars a yeah on the tax program alone.  Sage is meant to work on all recent editions of Windows. No need to buy the New Version stick with the Old.	-1
I have had three computers brick with Windows 8.  Two were brand new laptops and one was a one and a half year old desktop PC.  All three had the same issue.  When booting up for the first time everything seemed to go fairly well, once logged in things were a little laggy and unstable and required updates.  Once the updates were almost all installed it began doing the required restarts and thats where the problems bagan.  Some of the updates were broken causing an infinate restart loop until eventually (sometimes days later) it would say there was an error installing updates reverting to previous installation.....that was good except for it never did revert and only stayed on the "reverting to previous version" screen forever.  I returned the two laptops for a refund and had to buy a new PC even microsoft support said to return them and they were toast.  Garbage.	-1
Windows "upgrades" are WORSE THAN USELESS.  When I had to get Windows 7 with a new computer, several programs I owned--including the rather costly Corel PhotoPaint--would not work. In other words, Microsoft essentially destroyed a couple of hundred dollars worth of software for me. The operating system has bugs too, e.g. when I try to select a default program to run a certain type of file, the "always use this program" box is grayed out.  Microsoft Office "upgrades" also are like throwing money down a sewer. The 2010 version of Excel does not do anything substantially different than the XP version, and actually has less functionality in terms of importing other kinds of files (e.g. Quattro Pro) than the XP version. The last thing I want to do is get Windows 8 or higher and then discover that Quattro Pro, which I have to use for my financial records (because I can't import the files in Excel) won't work any more. There are other problems as well, e.g. "Search my computer" NEVER works for the Help function in Office. It is clear that Microsoft is running on name recognition only rather than the quality of its products.  I had to buy Windows 8 with my new tablet, and it is absolute trash-much harder to even access your desktop than with Windows 7, and it keeps slamming unwanted applications onto the screen when I try to access my desktop.	-1
Windows new GUI called Metro is a HORRID user interface for the desktop user.  Even worse, when you figure a way to get back to a normal desktop -- the type you have been trained to use now for over 20 years -- MS decides on some sneaky way to throw you right back into the clumsy Metro interface!  Indefensible, Microsoft.  If you thought Vista was bad, you'll find Windows 8 is much, much worse.  It's clear to me that MS did little to no desktop user experience testing before sending this piece of software "krappola" out the door to make bundles of licensing cash.  It also looks particularly sleazy of them to do this when you realize that modern, well designed OS interfaces like Linux Mint and the new Mac OSX "Mavericks" are totally free.  Microsoft tries to rob you of over $100 for this ugly OS "upgrade" version and up to $200 if you want to go for the "full" install of the "Pro" version.  And if the horrid Metro UI isn't enough to scare you away, please realize the if you buy the "upgrade" Win8 OS package because you already have XP/Vista/Win7 on your system but then decided (smartly) to do a clean install of Win8 (because the install DVD gives you this option), you'll soon find out that the activation key provided by Microsoft in the "upgrade" DVD package DOES NOT WORK!  Microsoft wants you to buy the "full" install DVD -- not the "upgrade" install DVD -- if you take the path of doing a clean install over your existing Windows system.  Unacceptable!  Why the executives at Microsoft haven't all been fired for this OS disaster is beyond me.  It's really is that bad.  In summary, if you like the idea of being forced at almost every turn to use a ham-fisted, clumsy "XBox" style visual interface to control your PC, then you'll love Windows 8.  Most desktop users will feel otherwise.  Save your money and wait for Microsoft to fix this incredible mess with Windows 9.  The fact the used copies of Windows 7 with valid product keys are now going for very high prices on EBay and at other retail sites should tell you something.	-1
This operating system has caused us nothing but trouble. Looking after more than 300 clients in New York we have seen a never ending array of incompatibilities and failures, simple things like the most common printer drivers fail to install, USB devices are not detected and the drivers available do not work. About half of all systems we tried to upgrade from windows 8 to 8.1  failed during the upgrade. This is really the new Vista, right up there with Windows ME. If you need to upgrade from XP move to Windows 7. Shooting yourself in the foot it is probably less painful than dealing with the Windows 8 upgrade.	-1
I am not going to beat around the bush here.  Windows 8 is the worst operating system I have ever had the misfortune of working with.  This is coming from someone that has used Windows ME and Vista.  I don't know what Microsoft was thinking in releasing OS or if they were even thinking at all. But apparently they only care about the "next big thing", and care nothing about people who actually use their software.  They also apparently don't have a QA department because I find it very hard to believe that any sane person would sign off on an OS with so many usability problems and bugs.  I don't know where to begin but to get started I will just take excerpts from an opinion I wrote about Windows 8 on another website and go from there.  Windows 8 was clearly designed for a touchscreen, but not every one wants touchscreen, and not every windows application is compatible with touch screen. Users should not be forced to buy a computer that has touch screen just so they can use Windows 8. Windows 8 might work well on a tablet or phone, but it sucks as a desktop OS however Microsoft seems hell bent on shoving touch screen down our throats.  If people wanted a tablet or a phone, then guess what?  They would BUY a tablet or a phone.  Why try to force an OS designed for tablets or phones onto a desktop or laptop?  To my surprise Windows 7 ended up being a pretty good OS and I use it at work and many people also like Windows 7. However Microsoft had to go and ASSUME (like they always do) that we all want touch screen now and remove everything that worked so well in previous OS's.  i.e. the start button.  Pressing the windows key on Windows 8 will not bring up the start menu, but instead it will bring you to a poorly designed screen with stupid tiles every where making finding what you want a tedious task.  They hid everything from you and many times you have to search the web to get help to find what you are looking for.  Touch screen is stupid for a desktop or laptop computer. The tiles, metro UI, or whatever you call it is idiotic and makes working in the OS an absolute nightmare. I couldn't care less about stupid teeny bopper Facebook or other social media crap. I just want to do what I need to do on the computer and not have to go through menu after menu of Nickelodeon type tiles just do a simple task. This OS isn't about productivity, its about pretty colors, and Facebook status updates. Microsoft seemed to forget people actually do WORK on their computers.  For example I VPN to my work network to work from home occasionally and I need remote desktop connection to connect to the many servers I use at work.  However because Windows 8 is so poorly designed, instead of just double clicking the mstsc application to open a new window, now double clicking it just brings up the existing connection, meaning I have to again search for the mstsc app, right click it and then click open new connection.  This takes a lot of time especially when I'm working on 3, 4, or 5 servers at the same time.  Even stuff like configuring a printer or getting into the control panel is an exercise in hair pulling frustration.  Switching between windows which what 99.999% of people who actually do WORK on a laptop do, is extremely cumbersome basically eliminating any hope of productivity.  Heck even turning the damn thing off, or logging a user off is made unnecessarily complicated. Who ever designed this OS or thought people would actually like this mess needs to be fired and banned from ever designing an OS again.  Luckily the only computer in my household that had this turd of an operating system was my son's laptop.  But low and behold Windows 8 crashed for the 2nd time and now won't let me back in thanks to the endless "We are automatically repairing your PC". loop.  The automatic repair is just as useful as Window's assistant in previous operating systems.  Now I can't get into Windows at all so all the stuff is now gone.  Luckily I had the foresight not to put any important files on this computer so I really don't lose anything.  I'm writing this review on my Windows XP laptop I bought nearly 6 years ago, and other than a few hardware issues, the operating system itself has been pretty solid, which is much more than I can say about Windows 8.  Today I'm going to install Windows XP on my son's laptop and be done with it.  I should have done this as soon as my son got this laptop and I wouldn't be going through this today.  Windows 8 is the reason I will never buy another laptop unless it comes with Windows 7. In addition, I will never even consider purchasing a Windows Tablet or a Windows phone. Words simply can't express how much I hate, loathe, despise, detest, abhor this operating system.  I can't wait to get it off my son's laptop and out of my life for good.	-1
I used almost every Microsoft operating system since MSDOS. Windows 8.1 is comparable to Vista, Windows ME, and Windows 3.0. All were losers. . The biggest problem was the elimination of familiar functions that existed in the past generations of Windows. When it took me 25 minutes to reset the screen resolution and another 20 minutes to locate the setup for my wireless router, I threw up my hands, deleted the upgrade, and went back to Windows 7. . The second biggest problem was incorporating tiles on a desktop monitor. For small screen tablets, this feature is essential. For a large desktop monitor, it is useless. Most manufacturers do not make touch sensitive features on large monitors.	-1
A Start buttong? Really? That's something that's unnecessary? I'll tell you what's unnecessary. An interface that sucks being your only option across desktop, laptop, tablet, smartphone, and gaming console. The key words aren't, in deference to the Windows 8 fanboys, "only option". The real fighting words are "that sucks." Some people do not feel that way, but then again they think every trend is a good one-and I saw some trends during my time in school that have me ready to deliver TKOs to innocent objects when I think back on them, and the same is true with Windows 8. As it was with Vista, and they share important qualities. They were ever more refined implementations of a certain highly distasteful vision of computing. One that Steve Jobs did both infinitely better and equally horrid at doing simultaneously given the appropriate tools. For this to work, it has to work better than s***. Which, despite a Start butt on, as opposed to what you get with Windows 7, is NOT the case. It's flat, colorless, atrocious, and despite all that I would be willing to put up with it if I could get the right PC to run it on. The key is on it you spend all your time in the Metro UI and don't play music since the default Windows Metro music playing application is more limited in function than a hood ornament on a fancy vintage car-and also only venturing to the desktop when you need to change a desktop only located setting, and using free apps as much as you can. (If I am going to pay money for apps, Apple will get my money because they're full-featured desktop applications with their only disadvantage being they're distributed like apps.) I don't want 16-color display on a monitor supporting millions of colors, and that's why I compromised and went for 7. I gave up on the third-generation Core i3, gave up on integrated Bluetooth, but don't have Vista 2.0 or 2.1 related headaches either in the user interface or in the background processes carrying out intense extracurricular activities. Instead I have Vista 1.1, which has a halfway tolerable amount of extracurricular activities and a UI that makes Windows Vista Ultimate and Windows 8 Pro or even Enterprise look like bloated unruly pigs. It's not that Windows 8 sucks, it's that the vision that caused it to come to pass sucks, and not even in theory but merely in practice. Oddly enough, I do like Metro on an Xbox-and don't give me the crap about how Windows 8 turns your computer into an Xbox. Because you have top-flight for the era graphics hardware in a gaming console and you often have graphics that are crap when it comes to games in a PC because they're different devices. With different target markets when comparing low-end PCs to gaming consoles. And it also works well on the Windows RT Microsoft Surface (the Surface Pro has full PC power, and so that comparison falls flat, as it does with all the other permutations of laptops and desktops), but on phones, laptops, desktops, and full PC or even Atom ULCPC tablet systems Metro does not work-you want Windows 7 and Microsoft won't allow it because they want to increase the level of Vistafication and force you to accept it or push you off the Internet. I'm about to go off the Internet before I'll adopt Vista 2.0 in the guise of the Windows 8 family, but then again I want to confirm what I have been reading. (But budget restrictions will likely nix it.)	-1
Windows 8 is the poor and inferior OS (Operating System). I will describe it in detail below.  First of all, when I turned on my PC, a strange unfamiliar screen was displayed. Additionally, speed of my mouse was too fast. So I wanted to change the speed. But, the control panel did not exist anywhere. And then, I entered words "control panel" into search bar. But, there was no search result. Similar faults exist very much. It is unbelievable. It is no longer OS. By the way, control panel was hidden in the deep and deep back.  Additionally, the notorious interface "Ribbon" (adopted into Microsoft Office series) was adopted widely. For example, explorer.  Other contents are as same as Windows 7. In other words, Windows 8 is aggravated edition of interface of Windows 7. I bet that Windows 8 never spread from now on. Windows 8 must be steadily falling like Windows ME or Vista. So, you should not purchase Windows 8. I downgraded Windows 8 to Windows 7 quickly.	-1
OS has been stable since installation. Somewhat of a learning curve switching from Win 7 to Win 8. But one will quickly overcome that. PC boots faster. But it did break several things including the Intel WiDi I had on my Win 7 and using it to mirror my screen to a large HDTV. I miss this a lot since the upgrade. Strangely Intel nor MS have done anything about it to release the appropriate driver to support WiDi. It also broke Kaspersky Internet Security, but Kaspersky did have a compatible upgrade to support Win 8. Phew... Broke quite a few other things like Canon printer driver etc which had to be installed again. Win 8 is a big failure for Microsoft.	-1
I just don't get it.  What was Microsoft thinking when they released Windows 8?  We had this operating system installed on our new computers for our office and it has been one nightmare after another after another.  Nothing seems to work as it should and it is so different from the previous versions that it just boggles the mind.  All I have now is a group of very frustrated workers who can't finish projects, transfer date, printer and numerous other compatibility issues.  As a matter of fact, we are in the process of stepping back to windows 7, at a great cost to our financial pocket.  If you are in the same boat, or about to purchase this program for your home or office computer, think again.	-1
It seems that it usually takes Microsoft two tries to get things right with O/S's (operating systems) nowadays!  Windows 7 righted the fiasco of Vista and hopefully by October of 2013 "Windows Blue" aka Windows 8.1 will right Windows 8 or Metro without additional charge.  What is good about Windows 8:  In one word: fast.  What is not so good about Windows 8:  (oh boy...)  1.  The Metro interface is a mess for use on a desktop! Touch screen and the Metro interface is fine for tablets and phones, but for a desktop, most people want ease of use and they just want it to work.  Perhaps for a touch screen all in one computer, it might be ok.  For a desktop with a keyboard, mouse, and monitor - Windows 8 is a nuisance.  For many users who are upgrading, it is unfriendly and downright unusable.  Unless you are a power user or someone who embraces new ideas quickly, Windows 8 in it's present format is probably not for you.  2.  Microsoft doesn't seem to understand the basics of customer loyalty.  It is a big mistake to take away something you gave in a previous O/S.  Microsoft's ill conceived plan to leave out Windows Media Center and try to charge extra for it in Windows 8 (after the initial limited time give-away) is a huge mistake.  There are indications this will be corrected in Windows 8.1 as well.  Let's hope so!  Now for the big question:  HOW CAN YOU FIX IT?  One way to overcome the Metro interface is to use a free and relatively simple program which restores the desktop interface.  You can research these products by reviews on PCWORLD magazine online.  (Like any other program, you use it at your own risk!)  I chose a program called CLASSIC SHELL by the open source people at Sourceforge.  I am not affiliated with them and I cannot make any statement as to its suitability for you or your computer.  However, they are the people who have developed the popular open source programs VLC and 7-Zip.  The program is working very well for me.  Anyway, if you upgraded or bought a new pc with Windows 8, don't panic!  Once you get the desktop interface back, it is a reasonably good and stable O/S. Hopefully Microsoft has heard the outcry of their customers and have seen the plummeting sales of Windows 8 and new computers and will restore the ability to boot to the desktop interface and restore Windows Media Center as part of the O/S as well.  Happy computing!  Update:  July 14, 2013.  Although the Windows 8.1 update will be free, I still cannot recommend Windows 8 or 8.1 for the following reasons.  First, let the user decide whether they want to have a desktop or a mobile pc experience.  This means fully restoring the desktop menu system rather than providing a semi-functional start button.  Second, Windows Media Center needs to be part of the operating system and not some very expensive extra cost add-on.  Home theater computers are very popular and a great way to enjoy movies and music.  Windows Media Center must be restored as a standard feature to Windows 8.  Unless Microsoft wakes up, the rate of adoption of Windows 8 will remain very low.  It is much easier to migrate your Windows 7 operating system to the new computer rather than put up with the cumbersome mess that is Windows 8.	-1
I do not recommend the Windows 8 upgrade because :  (1) Before upgrading to Windows 8, it is recommended that you download and run the Windows 8 Upgrade Assistant. It scans your computer to provide a compatibility report etc. There are different versions of windows 8, like RT(on PDA and tablets), 32 bit, 64 bit etc.  (2)You may have to spend money to upgrade your computer's components to meet the minimum requirements to run Windows 8.   (a) 1 GHz or faster processor with support for PAE, NX, and SSE2   (b) 1 GB (32-bit) or 2 GB (64-bit) RAM   (c) 16 GB (32-bit) or 20 GB (64-bit) hard drive   (d) DirectX 9 graphics device with WDDM driver   (e) Screen or monitor that supports multitouch to use the touchscreen features.   You may also have to download and install new drivers for different components. It is easier and usually less expensive to buy a new computer with Windows 8 installed, for around $250, than to upgrade different components and software.  (3) Too many bugs in Windows 8, leading to too many and too often updates, over 110. My computer is downloading and installing updates every few days. Imagine you boot up to try to use software ZZZ, but the screen says it is checking for, downloading, installing, configuring updates and restarting, the hard drive is spinning, you can not do anything but wait for it to finish. It can be 30 minutes to almost 2 hours. I am disgusted and turn auto-update off.  (4) Parts of many software that run on Windows older than 8, may not run properly on Windows 8. Many software simply do not run on Windows 8 RT and Windows 8 64 bit. That means you must spend more money to upgrade to the latest versions of application software, assuming they will run in Windows 8 without problems. Adobe Flash Player 11.8 crashes in Windows 8, but not version 10.3.  (5) The new internet explorer on the tiled Start Screen is full of bugs. You encounter disappearing address bar, screens, sudden zoom in, zoom out etc. I end up using the old x86 internet explorer (32 bit) on desktop, or Firefox. Many software included with Windows 8 like Internet Explorer, Paint, Wordpad etc are full of bugs and exclude nice options like "Undo", available in older versions of the same software. The new Paint does not have options like "Undo", "reverse color", attributes (size the image to fit on paper), etc.  (6) I am a computer programmer. I notice some of the menu choices do nothing when clicked on. In the past, I have been told to put a lot of menu choices or options on the screen even though the codes to execute those options are not included because they have not been written or do not work as yet. Many companies do that to mislead consumers into believing that their software can do many more tasks than they actually can.  (7) To shut the computer down or restart, you have to move the cursor to top right edge of screen. Click on settings bar on right when it appears. click on Power when it appears. Click on shut down when it appears. That involves 4 steps. It also takes longer to shut down.  (8) Devices that work with older versions of Windows (XP, Vista,7) may not work properly with Windows 8, causing freeze ups, non-recognition etc.  (9) Parts of many websites like [...] webmd.com have frozen up, did not work and so on. This happens whether you are using Firefox, Internet Explorer or other browsers.  (10) Need at least a few weeks, to learn to do the same things in new ways etc.  (11) Wait until year 2015 or after to buy, give Microsoft, software and device manufactures time to fix the bugs and update the drivers for Windows 8.  It takes time to research these information. Please click "Yes" below this line if this review was helpful to you.	-1
While I am a consummate an early adopter, Windows 8 has been a painful education. Microsoft's latest OS been a disappointment, corrupted with marketing-centric features that waste enormous amounts of time. Recently, I purchased a Dell PC with Windows 8 for an elderly relative. It was overly time-consuming to configure despite the success of Easy Transfer from a Windows XP  machine 2002 vintage. Yet, Windows 8 is just not that easy to navigate for either power users or entry level users. Overall, the tile design is innovative and visually appealing but not particularly intuitive. Basic operations such as "Shut Down" take several steps. Toggling between the tiles and desktop is confusing for even tech savvy individuals.  What is particularly irritating is the time wasted dealing with Microsoft's features that channel users to their online services. Specifically, getting a basic POP mail account setup is a hassle, requiring a separate download of Windows Essentials, which in itself tries to download other unnecessary applications.  It would have been much easier to deal with Windows 7 or Mac OS on an Apple machine. At some point, developers such as Microsoft need to value the time of their consumer customers and minimize functions that are for the benefit of Microsoft and to the detriment of users.	-1
I'm mostly a Mac guy - we have 8 in our household - but I run Windows (using a separate hard drive) under VMware Fusion on my Mac Pro and also use a Dell laptop for work.  I upgraded the Mac Pro from Windows 7 to Windows 8; I wouldn't consider introducing Windows 8 into my business environment (I'd have a couple hundred people staring at their screens trying to figure out how to open Outlook or Excel or Word).  The so-called Modern UI is a disaster to navigate without a touch creen (and don't tell me about keyboard shortcuts, not interested in those as a clumsy substitute for a touchscreen).  And without a touchscreen, the tiled Start page is just an unnecessary encumbrance to accessing apps, and a very, very clunky one at that.  When you first encounter Windows 8, you'll find yourself bewildered as you try to discover how to do even the things that were utterly simple in Windows 7 and previous versions of the OS.  And when you finally figure out how to do them, you'll wonder why it takes so many extra steps.  I can't imagine businesses implementing this OS on desktops (and that includes desktop replacements, especially with a large external monitor connected) unless and until Microsoft gets rid of the Start screen and reinstates the old Start menu on the desktop.  I've played with the Surface tablet, and the interface works for that, but it's a disaster on a PC...unless you're mainly interested in checking the weather and your social networking activity in a tile on the Start page (they should have called it the "Abyss" page).	-1
I will never upgrade my parents to this OS.  I can not imagine trying to help them use it over the phone.  It would go a little like this:  Mom: I want to have my email and my internet open at the same time so I can type a recipe in for your aunt. Me: Ok. Are you using the mail application that came with Windows. Mom: Yes, I click the mail button and it takes over my whole screen.  So does internet. Me: No, you can't do that.  You need to open your mail in your browser, because I haven't figured out how to make the mail app not take over. Mom: Ok, but I'm stuck again in the mail app.  It took over my whole screen. How do I get back to the internet? Me: Well, you can put your mouse up in the upper right corner. Mom: Why, nothing is there? Me: I know, just put it up there and it will make the charms bar appear. Mom: The what bar? Me: Nevermind what it is called, just do it. Mom: Nothing is happening. Me: Did you go all the way to the top right? Mom: No... okay, I did it, but they went away. Me: Okay, put it up there and leave it there and then go straight down the four little squares together. Mom: Four little squares? Me: Nevermind.  Just push the windows button on your keyboard. Mom: Which button. Me: It has the windows logo and might say "start". Mom: Why isn't there just a start button on the screen like my old computer had. Me: Hitting my head. Mom: Okay, I found it. Me: Did you press it? Mome: Ok, I pressed it and now I'm back to all those square tiles. It is really cluttered like when you used to scold me for putting everything on my desktop. Me: Yeah, that's it.  Click Internet Explorer. Mom: Let me find it... Mom: Okay it took over my screen. Me: Okay, you need to open two tabs.  In one tab put in your email website and in the other put in the site for your recipe. Mom: That's not what I want.  I want them side by side. Me: Okay, you'll need to change to desktop mode and launch internet explorer in desktop mode.  Then you can have two internet windows open side by side. Mom: Desktop mode? Me: Yeah, press windows button and hold it down while you press M. Mom: That just took me back to all those cluttered squares. Me: Try again. Mom: That worked! Where's internet explorer? Me: Well, you still need to launch it.  You need to bring up the charms bar, search for it, and then launch it.  Then you need to configure it to run in desktop mode. Mom: Nevermind.  I'll just call your aunt and read the recipe to her over the phone. Me: Good idea. Mom: Why did you put the new Windows on here? Me: Because it is faster and Microsoft said it was simpler. Mom: Umhmmm...  ----- So, I gotta be honest.  I thought the concept was brilliant by Microsoft to come up with a fusion product that merges the world of touch traditional.  However, it is so poorly executed and provides such a jarring user experience at times that I just can't give it a high rating.  I'm afraid that I am just hoping for Microsoft to release some updates that allow you to force it into one mode or another. I'm forcing myself to keep Windows 8 to become proficient, and I'm resisting the urge to install one of the "classic" start button programs to make desktop mode feel like Windows 7, but it really is tempting.  I think Microsoft is onto something, but it just isn't right, yet.	-1
Good: Easy installation. Start screen is attractive and useful.  Not so bad: The Windows 8 screen is made for a touch screen or a large touchpad. It works fine with a smaller touch pad or mouse, however.  Bad: It keeps switching from Windows 8 Start screen to the Windows 7 Desktop. Why? It's not because you are really in Windows 7, because there is no real or easy control over what is there. And you are no longer on the Windows 8 screen. It needs to be one or the other.  Finding out how to do stuff is a pain, because it seems very disorganized--things are not located where I expect them. Part of this is the Mac-emulation of "Here, let me do it for you," which also means, "Do it my way."  There are a number of reasons I don't buy Apple, and this is one of them, so I don't need their nonsense on my Windows machines.  Also bad: It is always on the Internet. It has cute pictures that run continuously, weather, etc., and you have to go to the trouble of turning it off. I spend a lot of time on the Internet. However, when I am working on something else, I don't need my machine spending time with open connections to the Internet. It is hazardous enough when I am actively online. Also, there are times I need the computing power of my machine and I don't want to share it.  My conclusion: I assume Windows 9 will have the Windows 8 interface all the time with no nonsense about switching back and forth between 8 & not-7. I have one computer switched to Win8, but I am going to wait until Win9 comes out to switch the others.	-1
I actually decided to upgrade because my school offered Windows 8 for free.  That was a mistake.  I'm not sure what the software developers were smoking when they developed this, but it doesn't take a rocket scientist to know that a tablet interface is usually best when it's used on a tablet.  When you try to bolt it onto a desktop like ketchup on ice cream and force everyone to use it as an additional obsticle to their work, you're bound to run into problems.  The security hype is completely overblown.  When I say overblown, I mean that whoever told you that this OS is secure is either incompetent or lying.  I had just cleaned out a bunch of junk spyware from Windows 7 before I upgraded.  Once the upgrade was complete, literally within seconds both Internet Explorer and Firefox were hijacked by an intrusive malware program that changed my home page and a bunch of my registry settings.  All efforts to fix my browser were repulsed.  The virus had managed to not only crawl into my computer without being noticed, but modify my registry settings so Windows had no idea it was being secretly installed on my computer.  No annoying pop-up that says "Are you sure you want to install?"  On a side note, I have declared that annoying feature completely useless.  Thank goodness Chrome is more secure.  To make things worse, there is poor backwards compatibility...even though the desktop uses the exact same engine as Vista and Windows 8.  It's aparrently so bad that my sophisticated anti-virus never saw the virus even though it says 2013.  I had six spyware programs all scanning my computer at the same time.  None of them could find it either.  Finally, I was forced to completely erase Windows and do a fresh install.  Funny though...I do a spyware scan at least once a day.  Every time I do, it catches about 200+ suspicious cookies.  My advice to anyone who is thinking of upgrading from Windows 7...DON'T!  For anyone thinking about upgrading from Vista...DON'T...upgrade to Windows 7.  For those of you still running XP...save yourself $600 and install Ubuntu Linux for free.  You'll get another 4 years out of your computer.  As for me, I'm going to enjoy using Windows 7.	-1
As a member of a computer club, I would not advise anyone to upgrade to Windows 8. It randomly removes programs, pictures,  and freezes up. I have been battling it for about 8 weeks while trying to evaluate 8 and still have issues with it.	-1
EDIT, 1/30/13:  I bought two Win8 upgrades of the twin DVDs for each 32-bit and 64-bit.  I will install them on laptops whose drives are easily switched out post-clone, so not to disturb the original drives.  In short, clone original drive, switch it out, pop in a new drive, clone back to that drive, then partition, then put Win8 in its own partition, then switch out again.  This is one dangerous OS.  The reviews later than mine here for 1/10/13 report more horrors post-installation than I'd have imagined.  The laptops I bought for this were Dell Latitude 6530, 6510.  The other Dell laptop with an easily switched-out-drive is the D630.  But its memory is expensive.  Memory for the 6530 and 6510 runs only about $35 per 4 GB. In short, Win8 will NEVER be on a mission-critical machine, and NEVER be on a mission-critical original internal drive.  Comparable Precision models are 2400, 4400, 6500 (which uses same internal HDD as the 6530), 6600-6700.  Precision models are more expensive.  Dell's memory is easy to change (except on the D630, where the DIMM A module is below the keyboard, lol).  So if you're debating whether to install Win8, get a used Dell laptop in dellauction, DFS, or Dell Outlet.  If it's after January 31 when you want to install, don't upgrade at all.  The real cost of this upgrade is in the HUNDREDS of hours' frustration you'll have in trying to learn and use it.  For that reason, I won't install Win8 until maybe a year from now, or whenever reports of it regaining sanity and stability, come out.  Partition size should at least be 80 GB, because Win8 might impose a recovery/restore file.  That file is at least 22 GB, which is the Win7 file size.  Atop that, you need space for the Recycle Bin, paging file, other junk.  So figure 80 GB or 60 GB at smallest, for a Windows 8 partition.  Put all your other programs and files elsewhere, back up your registry regularly.  Win8 forces you to be online more often, so you are at greater risk.  Original review follows below, before the upgrades arrived.  Those upgrades are still in their little sealed boxes, unopened.  The boxes are the size of a CD.  ========= I made Youtube videos on Win8 as 'brainouty'.  My videos aren't worth watching, but the video descriptions ARE worth reading: they contain a lot of links relevant to Win8 installation and usage, from users installing, and from computer magazines online, forums, etc.  See also my posts in PC World, which often contain links to other places.  Yeah, and maybe ignore my irritation in those posts.  I need Bible's 1John1:9 every 30 seconds, when working with Windows: sorry!  Oh, understand this clearly:  I'm MIFFED that I have to move to Linux, in order to avoid this OS.  I'm not an MS hater, but an XP fan -- just bought four more XP Pro OS here in Amazon.  Linux will be used for internetting and email when the support for XP ends.  That way XP security will remain, as Linux for COMPUTERS is not popularly or easily targeted by hackers.  (Android is another story.)  Besides, XP's security has matured after 11 years.  Win8's just born, and its security is untested.  So you see: I'm not an MS hater.  That said, here's the review:  ======================================================= Windows 8 pro-purchase: none, for an experienced computer desktop user. =======================================================  Might be worth upgrading, if you like poking touchscreens; for that's the essential difference in Win8 (ignoring the new garishly annoying 'tiles' on the Start Screen which replaces the Start Menu).  If you have big screens sitting over 8" from your face, you won't want this software.  They made Win8 for touch, to compete with Apple and Android;  so mouse or touchpad, keyboard equivalents are awful.  Gone is the easy way to shut down, close a window, open multiple windows, change options.  It's all hide-and-seek now.  Plus, the screen response is MUCH slower.  You're supposed to get the thrill of watching a 'page' turn, the screen glide horizontally.  So it's DELIBERATELY slower.  Blecch.  MS chirpers boast about 'fast boot times'.  Honey, I had to DISABLE fast boot on my Win98, XP, VISTA, and Win7 machines, so I'd have enough time to select the boot menu at startup, in case something went wrong.  The last thing you want is fast boot times, for then you bypass your ability to STOP the machine from hanging up.  Go get a cup of coffee when you boot.  Every Windows system, if new or tuned, boots in a minute or so.  Depending on what other programs you have scheduled to run at start up, it can take longer.  But just wait:  Win8 will be as slow as molasses, just like every other Windows OS, after it ages with the many 'updates' you'll have to get, to fix the OS bugs.  MS chirpers also boast about 'safer'.  Baloney.  IE10 and the OS had security fixes in the first week!  And there are still problems.  If anything, Win8 is more susceptible to attack, because it imposes these LIVE TILES on you at boot up, and you can't really use it well unless you sign on with a Microsoft Account you create.  In short, you're ONLINE most of the time, that's what this OS is designed for;  so, you'll be under more attack, not less.  ========================================== Windows 8 contra-purchase:  keep reading this review. :) ==========================================  A) I bought it, B) I hate it, and C) it hasn't even arrived yet.  Bought it, because of the January 31 deadline, and needed to get that product key for the Media Center so at least I can play my DVD drive so I can maybe INSTALL something after Win8 disables the drive, post-installation.  NOTE: if you install 'plain' Win8, your DVD drive will become disabled;  but if you use the PRO upgrade here, the DVD/CD drives are supposed to keep working.  Will see.  B) Hate it, for 3000 reasons, most of which are covered by other reviewers, to wit: ======================================================= 1.  Installation is VERY GLITCHY. =======================================================  So be sure to clone your existing drive with Clonezilla (be sure the destination clone drive is about the same size as the original);  both Clonezilla and the destination drives (i.e., from Jacob's parts) are here in Amazon.  Expect your drivers not to work, your internet not to work (way to go, MS, disable the customer from troubleshooting your buggy installer), your programs not to work, if you install ON TOP OF the existing OS.  Better still, first partition your drive (if drive is greater than 100 GB), and install Win8 on a newly-created and formatted PARTITION.  You can do that with Clonezilla, too (which is a flavor of Linux), but most recommend you partition a Windows disk with Windows.  So maybe do that first, before you clone.  Then do a 'custom' install to install to the partition.  Oh: and keep your data on a different drive, because from Win7 forward, RESTORE and REFRESH don't exactly work as advertised.  You lose data and programs sometimes yes, sometimes no.  NOTHING BEATS CLONING.  For the clone drive is a live and bootable copy of your hard drive.  DO IT.  REMOVE any anti-virus or disk management software prior to installation, if you'll not do a clean install.  The reviews I've read often report aborted installations due to those things (i.e., Kapersky, Norton, Acronis) being on the machine.  MAKE SURE that UEFI boot is NOT enabled;  Windows 8 changes your BIOS, if UEFI is enabled, and you really don't want that -- it will be very difficult to recover your old system if it's enabled and you decide Win8 is not for you. Basically, a 'UEFI' is a traffic cop between your OS and your machine which stops any boot without a pre-authorized 'signature' being sent to the computer;  so, your machine is effectively DEAD. But how to do this?  First, if your machine is about a year old, you may have this problem;  even then, it seems to affect only 64-bit installations.  Google on 'uefi boot option', and then find superuser(dot)com for the most comprehensive explanation on this problem I could find.  (I can't put the link in here.)  So: if you have it, you should see something like 'Legacy' or 'UEFI' on a screen, waiting for you to select it; should be in your system setup prior to booting in Windows.  If you select/enable UEFI, then maybe you won't be able to dual-boot with some other OS, later;  because, some systems thereafter HIDE the option.  So that's a problem, for Win8 DOES NOT UNINSTALL, as the instructions to the upgrade here in Amazon, warned.  If UEFI is enabled, not sure you can even clone back, to get rid of Win8. For the UEFI option creates a hidden partition on your hard drive which runs first in the boot sequence -- and maybe you can't reformat that partition, either.  Real pain in the neck.  NOTE: if you don't see a 'UEFI' option, you probably don't have it, so your computer will NOT be locked by Win8 installation.  Win8 is supposed to warn you it can't use 'secure boot', when you install: if it does, SMILE BROADLY, grateful to Heaven you're not religiously tyrannized from deciding how YOU want to use your own machine!  NOTE 2: Apparently all Dell workstations and mobile machines beginning with the Latitude 6410 (or near that vintage), have this 'UEFI' option, and you CAN turn it off (by selecting 'Legacy', instead);  the UEFI thingy began with Windows 7, in 2009.  So if your machine is older than that, you don't have it;  if you don't have Win7, you don't have the UEFI problem;  and if you have Windows 7, you'd already know about UEFI, as that was an issue in Windows 7 installation. One final way to check:  do you have an 'MBR' (master boot record) partition?  If 'yes', then likely you DO NOT have UEFI, because then an option to 'enable' it (radio button next to 'UEFI' in system setup) would be present.  Whew.  MAKE SURE that AHCI is enabled.  Again, settings are in your system setup prior to booting in Windows.  Older machines might not have AHCI, or might not have it enabled.  AHCI controls how your DVD drives work, versus your other storage (like, your internal hard drive).  Apparently Win8 glitches up if AHCI isn't enabled, as reported by some users on the internet.  Again, if you don't see an option to enable it, don't worry.  ===> What's great about this Amazon deal (hence at least one star) is that you get BOTH 32-bit and 64-bit disks.  FAR BETTER TO USE THE DISKS THAN TO DOWNLOAD THE PROGRAM FROM MICROSOFT.  Most installation complaints are by people who downloaded from Microsoft for the $15 or $40.  Many problems reported:  aborted installations with many retries;  12+ hours simply to download (for MS servers control the rate, not your IP); worst of all, the download was keyed to the computer used, so (example) if you were on 32-bit Vista at the time, you got a 32-bit Win8 keyed to THAT Vista machine.  In short, the MS download is CUSTOMIZED, not generic.  So if you value your sanity, get these disks here in Amazon, instead. Pay the extra $27-52 here, unless you love waste and pain.  ===> here, you get BOTH 32-bit and 64-bit, as just said.  So look: I can install Win8, yell at it, then uninstall via clone-back and install Win8 later on something else -- probably also test 64-bit (to test DOSBOX and Taos Computing's DOS emulator).  So I get two experiences for the price of one.  The 64-bit use might actually be worthwhile.  Will see.  ===================================== DVD/CD Read/Write/PLAY ISSUES, post-installation: =====================================  Allegedly, if you're installing Win8 Pro from these disks instead of downloading from MS, your DVD drive will still work, afterwards.  I'm not taking any chances, but will download VLC player (which also works in Linux) before I shut down, post-install.  I actually plan on triple-partitioning the drive, with the existing OS first (which will likely be Vista), then Linux in some flavor, leaving a third partition for Win8. I will then custom install it to that third partition, in 32-bit.  IMPORTANT:  Windows Media Player won't necessarily work in Win8.  Instead, to play DVDs, you'll need the 'free' Media Center.  To get that, you have to go online to MS and give them your email, wait for a 'product key' to be mailed to you, which you have to use AFTER installing Win8 but BEFORE January 31.  Supposed to be five per customer, but to get that, you have to use five email addresses. If you do NOT install the 'free' version prior to January 31, your product key won't work.  SUGGESTION: Bite the bullet and pay for Media Center ($10!) after January 31, downloading it then from MS.  The downloaded PAID version will enable your Blu-Ray player;  the 'free' version will disable the Blu-Ray player.  LOL can MS give you more DISincentive to buy?  Did the people who designed this OS sit around a conference table with lattes, asking each other, 'how can we best alienate the customer, today?'  ======================================================= 2.  COMPATIBILITY with hardware is also very glitchy. =======================================================  After reading 3000 reviews here in Amazon, new egg, TigerDirect and elsewhere (i.e., in comments and in computer magazines), it seems that the following hardware is problemmatic when Win8 installs (please add comments if I missed your own hardware glitch):  * HP/Compaq computer and printer hardware -- they won't allow you to back-grade to Win7, but apparently the drivers in HP when you're not YET on Win8, don't function after Win8 installation.  Lots of problems reported, here in Amazon. * Sony -- Sony has a lot of proprietary adjustments in their stuff, and it works or often fails when Windows installations are done. *Graphics Cards, Nvidia or ATI Radeon -- problems with the drivers not being compatible. *Touchpads -- maybe won't work post-installation. *PROCESSORS -- Pentium 4 won't work, but Windows 8 advisor claims it will.  Some other processors might not work, as well.  In short, your installation might abort, or after installation and shutdown you might not be able to get the machine on again, due to the processor being incompatible.  But you won't know that, nothing tells you what's the problem. *WEBCAMS -- Logitech in particular might not work.  Don't know if any embedded laptop webcams will work.  Driver problems. *ROUTERS in your house. This too is a driver problem.  Some routers really have problems with Win8, so maybe first go to your router maker's site and see if there are any known problems.  Or, Google. *64-bit installations are more prone to problems than 32-bit.  So if you have 32-bit now, STAY on it.  You can always change later, especially since you get both 32-bit and 64-bit installers in this Amazon-purchased package. *1GB-RAM machines.  Win8 is supposed to be more compatible with low memory, but Pro requires 2GB, and you really need 4GB if you want smooth operation.  It's really tough to play videos or surf with 1GB, unless you have good broadband like XFINITY.  So if you have XFINITY, reserve your 1GB machine for internet and your TV hookup, or upgrade your RAM before moving to Win8 Pro. *Upgrades from Windows prior to Win7 are more glitchy.  CLONE FIRST.  You can only migrate your settings from Vista, and you can't migrate anything from XP.  So that will mean lost programs, lost drivers, lost a lot of things.  When my registry died on my XP in May-June (twice), it cost me three months to rebuild the thing, for back then I didn't know about cloning.  So CLONE FIRST.  Costs $8 for Clonezilla CD (I like their $60 USB, too), and maybe $30-$100 for an external hard drive the same size as your internal drive.  WORTH IT.  --->  Ask people you know, who HAPPILY installed Win8 on their machines, what brands and processors, graphics cards, etc. that they have.  Frankly, you can spend $200 and just buy a cheap netbook to try Win8, leaving your main machine alone.  Then buy the upgrade here, if you're happy with Win8 function.  If not happy, you can always sell the cheap netbook here on Amazon, or to a friend. :)  Dell machines seem to be the most compatible with Win8.  So I'm buying a Dell D630 to use as my test machine.  ======================================================= 3.  COMPATIBILITY with software is weird and conflicting. =======================================================  Win8 will tell you it can't handle MS Office prior to 2010, but users tell me they can even get old Office 2000 on their Win8's.  I'll be testing it with DOS Lotus 1-2-3 version 2.01, on 32-bit Win8, and other software from 2003 and prior.  That's why I got Win8, to see first-hand how bad it is.  Most of the software-incompatible complaints come from 64-bit or Adobe and Photoshop users.  Graphics display problems, colors wrong, formatting weird, colorspace problems in particular.  Probably every utility program you had pre-Win8, won't work.  Anything which makes direct calls to the hardware or to the OS, or uses context menus in prior versions of Windows, will likely not install or cause the machine to freeze.  Same problem happens in Win7, especially with respect to programs that use the context menu (meaning: the pop-up menu when you right-click, in XP, Vista, Win7).  DEALBREAKER?  YOU LOSE YOUR EMAIL CLIENT after installation. Win8 is not compatible with old Win7 mail, nor Vista Mail, and of course isn't compatible with Outlook Express.  So move your mail to full Outlook, back up, then pray.  If you only use online email composition, then you might actually prefer Win8, because if you create an MS account when you first install, it will then take you through the steps to consolidate your email: but you can't compose offline.  I hate composing online, so I hate this 'new' feature.  But Outlook 2010 might work for you.  I don't like any Outlook after 2000, so will try and install that, see if it works.  ======================================================= 4.  NAVIGATION in Win8 is disorienting. =======================================================  Remember Kurt Vonnegut's 'Breakfast of Champions'?  Where the guy was in WWII Dresden, then suddenly on a planet living in a glass orb -- watched by aliens -- having no idea or control how he'd flip from one world to the other?  Win8 works just like that book/movie!  One minute you're in the desktop, doing something normal and productive, then ZAP!  You're back in the Start Screen again!  Why?  Because something you did in the desktop, actually called forth some program in the Start Screen TEMPORARILY, after which you're supposed to return to the desktop.  But, sometimes you don't.  It's kinda like going into your bedroom to pick up the socks, then you see the plant needs watering so you go to the kitchen, then you see the dishes need doing so you wash them.. and then you forgot about both plant and socks.  Guess guess ugly interface schizoid operation made for XBox kiddies who have no discernment except to poke at a screen.  Just go look at the Youtube videos on Win8, watch how they navigate and use the OS, and you'll see how it works.  It's not hard to learn, it's ANNOYING to learn and even MORE ANNOYING to use.  MS hates its customers, always wants to make them play 'guess how to find me or use me' with each new OS they put out.  And in Win8, they want to control your 'experience' to seeing EASTER EGG HUNT TILES OF MS PRODUCTS when you boot up.  Really childish.  As a result, I'll gradually move to Linux.  But I still have to buy ONE copy of this garbage to learn it, in case a client asks me how to send an email or open a file, and all he has, is Win8.  ================================================================================= 5.  OPERATION of value will be its desktop, which allegedly is like Win7.  But ooops: no Start Menu! =================================================================================  A Start Menu in prior versions of Windows was handy to organize and 'park' your program shortcuts.  YOU chose where they were organized, YOU designed the folders and icons and whatever to remind YOU what and where they were, and YOU controlled how YOU wanted to see that stuff displayed.  Totally.  Well, that productive tool -- in use since Windows 95 -- is gone, in Win8.  Seriously:  it's as if MS had INTENDED to destroy the best interface features of Windows.  So of course, you can't customize the icons and background, like before.  God forbid you want to preserve your eyesight by muted shades and graphics, rather than GLARE TILES with a GLARE background, no matter what color you choose, excepting sleepy gray!  Windows 3.1, all over again!  Here, the MS chirpers will chorus that many THIRD PARTY add-ins restore your Start Menu.  Not really. There are hundreds of these programs you must TRY and then INSTALL and then USE to recover some of the functionality you had.  But now you spent effort and time searching through all these programs; every update to Win8, will maybe necessitate updating these programs, too.  So guess what? Now your day is spent on tweaking and updates.. not on working.  Did someone in Redmond call an in-house meeting, on 'How To Create World Inflation. Quickly'?  So I wonder how No-Win8, will truly resemble Win7.  XP is far better than both; but Win7 happily formats DVDs; its MovieMaker 6.0 is fabulous.  Win7's Help actually helps (what a shock).  Excepting Explorer (that Win8 essentially obliterates) Win7's reorganized options are pretty decent and intuitive.  So I'm dying to see if I can override Win8's interface the way I overrode Win7, resulting in a 'classic' interface (meaning, like Win98, replete with Start Menu!) across all my (soon to be 14) Windows machines.  See my 'Vista versus Win7' thread in PC World, if you're interested in that.  ======================  C) So my Win8 Pro upgrade will arrive in a few days, allowing me to buy a Dell D630 for Win8 installation.  Someone here in the Amazon comments said that model worked well with Win8. The Dell machine's design is fabulous -- internal hard drive, just slides out after removing two screws on the back!  Machine is for sale here in Amazon.  I made a video on it, too.  Alas, the D630's memory is slow, only 800MHz.  Still, that moseying RAM fits the pokey Win8 OS:  for you are expected to SIGH or drool,  while its tiles waft lazily across the screen, just as in any tablet;  then, you again swipe, sigh, drool.. one 'page' of tiles at a time.  Oh wait: you can also type the first three or four letters of the file you want, and magically 'search' appears with the many tiles answering that description.  Hmmm.  So now you have to TYPE and SWIPE?  Sheesh.  So I won't do a more personal review, for awhile.  Then my rant here will gradually suffer edit. I did nearly six months of intensive research on Win8 installation and operation, prior to buying.  Still, would love to be wrong -- if the 'right' answer is good.  :)	-1
After nearly 20 years of training users to accept the oxymoron of clicking "Start" to shutdown, Microsoft has now completely removed the start button and created an interface that's totally unusable for Windows power users.  I've been happily using Windows 7 for a couple of years and really not had any problems. It's faster and more stable than previous versions and relatively simple to use. Windows 8 on the other hand branches from all previous editions, forcing a tablet interface on laptops and desktops that's inappropriate, confusing, pointless and impossible to avoid. While you can still see a "Desktop" mode, it doesn't boot directly and there's no way to turn off the endlessly moving carousel of brightly colored squares that practically give me a seizure every time I want to find an application.  Much like the way Microsoft foisted the universally hated ribbon on its audience in Office 2007 and beyond, Windows 8 grants us all the demented ideas of their questionable UI/UX team and to hell with whatever their customers wanted. I have to dive all over the screen from corner to corner to do basic operations and almost anything from "Shutdown" to setting up a printer involves more clicks, confusion, frustration and exasperation. It's really, really terrible in every way. I've used Windows all my life and know almost every little feature - but now I know how my Dad feels using a computer as I stare hopelessly lost at the screen.  While Google and Apple products are getting simpler to use with every subsequent iteration (check out the Chromebook), Microsoft is headed in the opposite direction of trying to confuse all levels of its audience from amateur to expert. For some reason, MS is convinced that we're all going to be using touchscreens on our desktops so instead of moving a little mouse 2 inches at a time I have to flail my hands all over my paper-piled desk in a simultaneous effort to find a lost file and induce carpal tunnel syndrome.  As for its attempt to network with other computers in your house, who cares? If you're not storing your files on Google Docs or Dropbox or streaming your music from iTunes or Amazon, you're doing it wrong. As for stability, it's a staggering leap back to the flimsy days of Vista, with a newly revamped blue screen of death to brighten your morning a few times a week. It's fast but that's more due to the extraordinarily powerful microprocessors in my PC rather than the near 10 seconds it takes me find absolutely anything on the godawful operating system.  Coincidentally, Office 2013 has an equally atrocious UI that will have you begging to revert to Office 2003. I've not used a piece of software this bad since the Ask toolbar got bundled with a Java upgrade. Someone at Microsoft needs to be fired for this - if desktops are in decline, this version of Windows will be remembered as one of the larger, rustier nails in the coffin. Avoid at all costs unless you're one of the few who own a Surface tablet.	-1
I went from Vista to Windows 8. I lost all my programs having to reload them. As of today, I still can not load office 10.  About 3 times a week, windows 8 has to reload taking 30 minutes or more each time. I'm going back to Vista.	-1
The most schizophrenic OS ever.  It is TWO Windows 8; a desktop and an ARM OS.  They force the Metro UI down your throat which turns "windows" into an app running in one screen which is great for a smart phone, bad for an OS.  If you longed for the old days of DOS when progs ran in a single screen, this is for you.  If you are used to multi tasking, switching from one window to the other--you'll hate this.  The so called App Store is packed with apps that are worthy of a yawn or two.  Nothing dynamic or exciting here.  Mostly, a lot of lame software apps that have been done better other places.  You won't find the really great apps of Android or Apple.  No siree.  Half the apps don't even work as they should. The XBOX Music App is the worst.  Want to arrange playlists, drag and drop, edit and create play lists on the fly with ease--forget it.  Speaking of the multi windows thing; the ease of drag and drop, cut and paste, etc becomes cumbersome when using Windows new Metro UI Apps.  Expect a steep curve of learning.  And of course, M$ will nickle and dime you.  No native DVD or Blue Ray Player--buy that seperate.  Good thing there is Freeware that will do the same thing.  Want the Windows Media Feature--you have to buy that.  With a few hacks, you can make Windows 8 look like Windows 7.  It's out there.  Oh, and that old Blue Screen of Death? Ittt''sssss baaaaaack! Yup! Missed it? What is old is new again and hey! The revamped it.  Now it is a blue screen with a sad face emoticon.  :( and a pithy message that amounts to Sowwy. Because, let's face it, when your new OS throws the BSOD so often, you have to do something to make it look spiffy.  Freeze ups, crashes, BSOD's and crappy apps will make you long for the days of Vista.  NOT! After making a good stable OS like Seven, why not just throw a monkey wrench in the works.  If you have a new computer, don't thing upgrading will be painless.  You may have to update your BIOS and Drivers.  Expect Windows 8 to work with your iPad, iPod or other fancy devices--think again.  Luckily, instead of making devices work as a priority, they decided to throw in some software hoo-doo to make you run an emulation of an OS Past--like Seven or XP.  Because making a new OS isn't about giving the consumer a fun, fresh out of the box easy experience.  Nooooo sir! Call up the Geek Squad and get the Cheetos and Jolt Cola ready.  You SOL kiddo.  This was released in October 2012 and STILL no support for the iPod/iPad.  It is a game of Stalemate with you in the middle.  You lose!  When it does run smoothly, there are no shakes here.  Like 16 billion colors for menus and taskbars? FUGGEDABOUTIT! 256 colors for you on your Start Screen! Vaguely transparent task bar, more opaque.  Nothing pretty here.  The designs for the Start Screen are limited so it looks like a Hipster Art Student took LSD and barfed on your screen in 256 colors.  We are talking fugly here.  Unless you are a hardcore computer geek with a morbid sense of curiosity, hang on to your money and Windows 7.  There is no going back easily kids.  You don't want to truck with this monster.  Microsoft sure must be paying lots of people to jam magazine forus with fanatical zeal to scream that this is wonderful! Ask anyone in IT or any Geek and they will tell you to put the Kool Aide down.  This will go down along Windows ME and Vista as the Golden Turd of OS'es.	-1
Change, simply for the sake of change, is never a good idea. The main problem I have is that Microsoft seems to feel it is unnecesary to shut off my notebook. Truly, something as base as turning off a computer is not something I want to have to hunt and search for. Please, geeks at Microsoft, explain why you have hidden this function.	-1
============================= My Final Opinion On Windows 8 =============================  I've plugged in the Windows 7 drive to access things on it, and I really don't want to plug the Windows 8 drive back in (even though I could simply take the cables out of one and put them into the other directly below it). Windows 8 really is a lame operating system; it should come in both desktop and handheld device versions, not a hybrid all-purpose version, but that's just my opinion. I gave it a fair chance...I got "used" to it...and still, I think it's a horrible implementation. I feel like I'm working from one convenient location again.  ============= Previously... =============  I just need to add one more edit. My install is still fresh, yet I've come to a snag that has brought my system to a screeching halt. I'm unable to boot up at this point, and although it says "Preparing Automatic Repair," no repairs are taking place. Enough trying to look for the good in Windows 8. It really is garbage. The start screen is stupid, and it has no place on a desktop machine. I guess it's time to install everything from scratch again, but that's okay, since I didn't get around to installing more than a couple of programs before this happened anyway. So lame.  I drop it down to one star, because the description for one star is considered "I hate it," and I do. Even if this was working without incident, that when a product works as expected, that doesn't count toward an opinion of the OS. It really has been unproductive, inconsistent, inefficient and quite unnecessary in regards to what it has to offer.  ============== Prior Opinion: ==============  I like the operating system now that I turned the house upside down looking for my upgrade path. I haven't had a single issue with performance.  There are things I think need much refinement with Windows 8, and all of it has to do with the transitional elements. Though I've figure out where the options are that I wanted to manipulate, it was nowhere near being an intuitive process. The new Start Screen is like sitting on the internet all day; you get all the pointless fluff you would browse through on the internet, all in one place; only now instead of doing it at your convenience, your online presence is announced to the world the moment you log in to Windows 8.  I have the internet, but I don't keep important files on the computers that are connected - I only goof around on this [Windows 8] one. So what does this mean for our work computers? I'm not sure yet, as those are still on previous versions, but I've got to wonder what good live tiles are going to be on a computer that isn't linked to the world.  One common annoyance is when I go for the top of the scroll bar on the right side of any scrolling window, the charms menu pops out and is quite distracting.  Anyway, this is a great operating system for goofing around.  =================================================================== 12 of 15 people found the two-star review helpful below this point.  ===================================================================  I bought this and opened it before Amazon added "- UPGRADE" to the title. Yes I read the upgrade notes, but I figured it was a message indicating that if I choose to upgrade a current installation, that my programs and their settings would remain intact after the process; there was no indication that I could not do a clean install on a new hard drive. I thought it was a great deal at almost seventy dollars being offered to entice those of us early-adopters who may be holding off because of all the updates and downloads that would be needed down the road. Well, it's still seventy dollars. Had they just put that down as the MSRP, I would have questioned it being a full version.  Although it has been made clear since, I am still stuck with an upgrade disk, which so far I'm not getting to use. Under normal circumstances I wouldn't ding a product that I haven't used, but I zoomed in on the pictures to make sure it was a full version and I didn't see "Upgrade" marked on the packaging, and that is Microsoft's fault, so yes, this product gets one star from me.  I have searched for a full version, and still this comes up as the most expensive Win 8 Pro at the MSRP of $199.99 - why would anyone have thought this isn't the full version?  I am furiously unhappy.	-1
Upgraded to Windows 8 from a very stable Windows 7 systematic.  Now my computer constantly crashes and is plagued by several issues like I cannot shutdown without using the power button.  I feel like i am a beta tester.	-1
Well after installing Windows 8 Pro upgrade I immediately came to the conclusion very quickly  I missed my Windows XP on my laptop as it is very user friendly . I felt like I had to take another College course to figure it out.  There was no instruction manuals of any kind came with the software on this upgrade version . If I could give the review a ZERO I would.	-1
Windows 8 is the worst mistake in Microsoft's history.  How sad.  After four frustrating days of trying to find something in Windows 8 to make up for the total loss of direction in the Windows' interface I went back to the Windows Store and got my money back. Maybe Windows 9 will be led by some new management with more vision.	-1
I've been a strong Microsoft supporter for decades. When Windows 7 was out, I bought more than six copies to upgrade every single computer I had access to.  Fast forward to November 2012, I ran out of Windows 7 boxes so I had to buy a new one. Windows 8 was already out so why not getting the "latest and greatest"? BIG mistake.  I'm trying to like it, but I can't, I just can't.  If a veteran Windows user has to open google and search for "How to access control panel in Windows 8" then you're doing something SERIOUSLY wrong.  I'm sorry, but GUIs are supposed to be intuitive! Another example: how are you supposed to guess the "hot corners" without doing some research or somebody telling you?  Trust me, as soon as you start using Windows 8 you'll find yourself in situations where you want to go back and there's no back button, you'll want to close something and there'll be no "close" button, you'll want to configure an application and there'll be no menu or "settings" button.  Yeah I get it! it's the whole Metro/Tablet thing, right? I'm sorry but my main computer at work is not a tablet, it's a workstation and I deserve a real OS, not something that resembles my phone or some kind of kindergarten software.  Anyway, I've been flirting with the idea of getting a MacBook Pro for a long time, well, Windows 8 gave the little push I was missing. I just bought one and I'm in love with i (I can run my Windows software using Parallels).  Way to go Microsoft! you just lost one loyal customer.	-1
You will be sorry.  I downloaded the Windows 8 upgrade Thursday evening into Friday morning. Yes, the download took several hours on my 3Mbs DSL line. After the download, it took another 3 hours to install the Windows 8 Pro over my Vista Business OS. After that was done, I was faced with a very foreign user interface. There was no help offered to ease the transition. I finally figured out that the Windows key on my keyboard would present me with a desktop. No Start button, just a bunch of new Apps. The upgrade did not preserve any of my old apps, so I must reload Office, my scanning software, Adobe Reader and all my other apps. The new Internet Explorer won't let me use my old email system. Apparently there are some default browser settings that won't let me open the newer att.net mail, so I am using the old version. What's the deal with Windows mail? I tried registering, but it keeps telling me that I am already registered and must use some existing password that it apparently emails to my new Windows email account that I can't log into.  The resemblance to Widows XP, or Vista is lost to me. This new Wibdows 8 more closely resembles Android, except I find Android easier to use. Maybe because my tablet has a touch screen and a voice command interface. I'm told Windows 8 is designed for a touch screen interface, but my PC does not have that. Actually, now that I think of it, I had fewer troubles adapting to Linux and Unix when I first strarted using them.  I suppose I'll get used to it, but for now, I am using my older PC thst still has XP installed. Even though it is an older PC, I can get a lot more done, more quickly. I'll turn on my newer PC when I have more time to figure things out. For now, I'll stick with XP.	-1
Windows 8 may be great on a tablet, but I'm a power user with a desktop PC and a laptop. I tried Windows 8 on the desktop and quickly went back to Windows 7. My laptop is still running XP, it just works and if it ain't broke, don't "fix" it.  I can only imagine what MS was thinking. I've been using Windows since 3.0 and have run almost every version since then and warmed up to most of the changes. 3 years of using it and I still *hate* the ribbon interface that invaded Office starting with 2007 and proliferated into Win8. The modern/metro interface is just pointless on a desktop or laptop and the desktop mode Win8 does have is crippled. I sure hope they keep selling Win7 for a while.	-1
September 9, 2013 UPDATE This shabby bloated software only gets worse.  With several GIGABYTES RAM it still cannot run Outlook without freezing.  I tried several cleanup programs (System Mechanic, CCleanup) and Windows 8 STILL WON'T RUN PROPERLY.  No wonder the CEO is quitting.  I would abandon ship too if I ran this company into the ground.  October 2012 What a step backwards. I'm still trying to figure how to find the start program lineup. Takes so much time to learn. Counter-intuitive. Unlike Apple, this requires a manual.  Which of course is not included. I am so tired of having to learn new commands.  There aren't even icons to click ... unless you buy Microsoft's cloud offerings. I can imagine how reliable those are. It's like going back to DOS where you have to learn and remember commands. What a waste of time.  And money. December 6, 2012 UPDATE It only GETS WORSE! Now my PC will not boot. Gets hung up on the splash screen. What a nightmare. Since Sunday I have been trying to get it to boot. Tried reset, refresh, safemode. I GAVE UP. I BOUGHT A MAC. LIFE IS TOO SHORT.	-1
If Microsoft 8 works faster and better under the hood, great.  I am not opposed to the pretty tiles..  but they lead to apps that just don't cut it.  I have spent years finding and working with programs (mail client for example) that do what I want very well.  Great if they come up with a better mail client but they haven't... and it is unlikely that they will be better than the market (this was always Windows' strength..the market competes to come up with applications that work well).  The aggregation function of the people app is nice, but frankly, it just isn't as good as the facebook page itself so I am not going there. It is cool to see my photos aggregated, but the functionality isn't near as good as picasa.  so I have to wade through these tiles to get back to the programs I already know and use.  It seems like such a waste of time.  I am happy to try new things but they just seem to want to go to the top down approach of apple (with all their built in apple applications).  It works for apple because they have honed these programs over years and years.  Even at that, they aren't as good as marketplace produced applications.  Their benefit is that they are so tightly integrated with apple, they work well without glitches etc.. but still, they are only valuable because they have been honed.  I am not willing to wait 10 years as MS hones its mail app.  I'll use the one I have.  Or finally go to apple if this becomes too much of a hassle.  I tried windows 8 on my extra laptop.  If I avoid the apps and go right to my desktop, it is fine.. but annoying.  I will not upgrade my main desktop computer or my other laptops.  This is a fail.  sorry microsoft.	-1
This is probably my worst experience with a Windows platflorm. Everything you knew about Windows has changed in this edition and quite possibly will frustrate many people who are not computer friendly. The "new Start Menu UI" is supposed to be simple yet it's much more frustrating to use.  I like the Start Menu for many reasons. When you receive an update, you can just click the start menu & click the upgrade-shut down function. When i have many programs open already and i need to do a quick search, the Start Menu is the quickest way with keeping an eye on what you have on the screen. With Windows 8 they don't have that. Instead when you fumble around with the mouse to look for the Start Menu and finally find it, it takes up the entire screen. This is something you would see with Win 3.1 where MS is just throwing in whatever to make it look interesting and appealing to people yet at the same time you are frustrated because there is just no easy access to everything. Most things are hidden or invisible and if you can figure out how to shut down the system without giving up and hitting the power button on your PC then maybe perhaps this OS was right for you. However Windows should be easy to use, this isn't.  Another problem i have with this OS is the control panel options and all those little awesome library icons that is right there on your fingertips when you want to watch a movie, access a document or games if you are a gamer. However, instead of allowing people to get used to the new system by leaving the classic start menu & all it's wonderful actions for a less, technical way of moving around in your system. You can tell this was designed for simple users who don't require all that extra fluff and your stuck with a cheap style that doesn't want you to customize your PC the way you want it to be.  The desktop itself looks plain, looks like a modern version of Win 95 with plain tiling and expecting you to figure out how to customize it to look more appealing. No Aero theme which was innovative in itself. Under the hood for specs and Win 8 is a little less on processes giving you more power to use elsewhere and a nice task manager. Here i give a little breakdown on the pros and cons & see for yourself.  Pros:  It's new. Windows Task Manager has more to it with more functionality. It's easy on the processes (but doesn't necessarily make your system faster)  Cons: No start menu making the OS more difficult to use. Replaced start menu with an entire screen forcing you to leave your immediate screen. Many things are invisible and for a new user of Win 8 will be lost & leaving you more frustrated then excited about a new OS. No Aero theme, desktop is plain. Charging users to get the legacy start menu back.  So there you have it while i could have given this a better rating, i just hated this OS & wouldn't recommend it to anyone. MS listened to it's users with Win 7, it's easy to use and i will continue to use this OS & will not bother to upgrade to this system or the next one if MS will not listen to it's feedback, put features in that a good portion of users are not familiar with. With each new OS it takes me 5 minutes to learn each one. With this one, it was just unnerving, awkward & it's a mess. After trying this out i won't even buy a tablet. iPod's interface blows Win 8 away. Had MS kept the original start menu & did something different with the new look i might have given this a better review. However Win 8 is unfinished, poorly executed & overall i am unable to see how anyone could enjoy using this system. As a tech point of view, it's frustrating not having control over an OS & it is NOT easy to use. The easiest and fastest way through the system is the start menu. It was replaced by an inferior, non-sufficient UI system. Sticking with Win 7 for as long as i can. After 2020, i hope that either there are some better OS's in the future, otherwise i would pay MS $50 a year to keep Win 7 in operation.	-1
I've been running the preview version of Windows 8 on one of my laptops for a couple of months now. To be honest, I totally despised it at first. Without the "Start" button, trying to learn a new user interface was very frustrating. It took time, and I got used to it. Still though, I thought the Metro UI was very awkward on non-touchscreen hardware. Why Microsoft decided to not give users the option to have the Start button, and use the "Classic UI" desktop if desired, is beyond me. What turned me around was the 3rd party applications that give you back the Start button and Desktop. I've been using a free program called "Classic Shell" which allows me to run Windows 8 in a hybrid mode where I have both the Metro UI, and classic Windows Desktop with Start Button. With 1 click of the mouse, I can switch back and forth. I highly recommend it if you find the new Windows 8 Metro UI frustrating.  OK, on to my upgrade experience. I decided to upgrade my old, modest dual-core, Windows 7 desktop. I downloaded the "Windows 8 Upgrade Advisor" from Microsoft and let it analyze my system. After about 5 minutes, it told me what was compatible, what wasn't, and my installation options. It offered the special limited time $40 upgrade, which I took advantage of. The download was about 2GB, and took about 5 minutes on my fast internet connection. Once downloaded, I decided to upgrade my current Windows 7 installation instead of starting from scratch. This is probably only a good idea if you're sure your current version of Windows is running well, as any issues could be imported into Windows 8. The installation process took a little longer than an hour, which I thought was a little long. When it finished, Windows 8 booted up and I was up and running Windows 8. I only had 1 issue. The installation nuked my Norton Anti-Virus 2012. Despite being supposedly compatible, the program would no longer run. I also couldn't get it to uninstall normally. The "Norton Removal Tool" was no help either, as it just hangs up when run. I'm not too concerned. For now, I'm using Windows 8 new built in security suite, "Defender". Once I sorted that out, all my programs seem to run fine. As stated earlier, I installed "Classic Shell", and enjoy running the Metro UI and classic Windows Desktop at the same time. I ran "Windows Update" and there were several large Windows 8 updates already available. The download was over 1GB, but installed quickly. Windows 7 ran very well on this old system, and Windows 8 does too. I'm not seeing any real differences in boot times, etc. I'm getting more and more used to Metro, which I guess eventually we'll all have to since this is the road Microsoft chose to take. All in all, at the low special upgrade price, I'm happy with Windows 8. With the 3rd party application giving me the choice which mode to run in, I have the best of Windows 7 and Windows 8 running on my system. To the person with little experience with Windows 8, do some homework and have a lot of patience. It's a whole new experience from Windows 7. Some will love it, and some will hate it. Luckily there are tools out there that allow you to have the choice how the OS looks and runs.  Edit 11/14/2013: From now until January 31,2013, you can get the "Windows 8 Media Center Pack" free of charge from Microsoft. Just go to the link below, and follow the instructions. If Amazon removes the link, the link is on the MS Windows 8 "Add features" page, or just Google "Windows 8 Media Center Pack offer".  :[...]	-1
I liked the older versions. This new version is not flexible enough. This review process is not cool. I don't like it at all. In fact, I believe that I will look for another package which would suite my need.	-1
I'm in the process of updating a will, so was looking forward to using this as a starting point, leaving only the final review to my attorney.  In practice, I found it impossible to get what I wanted that way. Instead, I ended up just manually editing my existing will with a word processor.  If you've never created a will, living will, or durable power of attorney, this software gives you a starting point for your thinking, and helps make sure you don't skip important steps.  However, don't expect your attorney to thank you. Several attorneys I know went out of their way at a recent estate workshop I helped pilot at our church to tell me this is a waste of time, and wouldn't help them meet my needs more efficiently at all. I realize this could be seen as just protecting their turf, but at least one is a good enough friend that I know it's his honest opinion.	-1
Hard for these products to compete with MINT which is free.	-1
Gets worse with every version	-1
I have just upgraded from Quicken 2011 to 2013.  I have been Quicken for almost 20 years.  I usually upgrade every year or two.  Unfortunately Quicken contains a bug in the account reconcile process.  This is the heart of any accounting system.  As you check off checks that have cleared Quicken keeps a running count and total.  Surprisingly, the counter skips from 24 to 26 and the total changes to an incorrect value.  The new total is not the sum of the previous value and the last check.  I recommend that you either wait or consider other options.	-1
I have been using Quicken since the 2nd DOS version. I cannot understand how Intuit can mess up so consistently. Since the 2004 release, every update gets worse. This is up there with the worst of the worst. Good features that worked no longer work, little frustrating things never get fixed -- EVER! This goes on and on for years, and then more little frustrating problems get added. Over the years, I have sent Intuit a long list of items to fix. Never once have I received so much as one acknowledgement nor, to my knowledge, has one single item I have mentioned been fixed. I have not been asking for major feature additions or even enhancements. I have been asking for little things that any user would find beneficial. The irony is that I am a Software Design Engineer -- for about 30 years. So I don't send frivolous ideas.  Here are some annoying examples of the functionality that is now no longer working in 2013: Whatever category you had for your downloaded items before the 2013 version is no longer used. Quicken just seems to pick whatever it wants. In my case, everything is categorized as "Income." Also, if you enter in the category and memorize it, it still will not be recognized in the next download. If you rename payees, the renaming will not be seen by Quicken the next time that same payee is downloaded. If you click on a downloaded item in the bottom window that has already been Accepted, that item is no longer highlighted in the register. So getting back to it is time consuming and requires hunt and seek or search.  I wanted to have a separate paragraph for this one: speed. Or, rather, the complete lack of it. It is even slower than the 2010 edition - which was a dog. I have a 4.4Ghz hexcore Intel machine with the fastest solid state drive money can buy. I have 64Gb of very high speed DDR. Quicken is now slower than ever. I don't know what others are experiencing on older machines with slow, spinning mechanical hard drives and 1.5Ghz dual core CPUs, but it must be a special form of torture.  Now we are forced into an upgrade to keep our bank downloads. I call this extortion. The only way Intuit can get us to upgrade is to threaten to curtail downloading from our banks if we do not upgrade. Making a better user experience seems to never enter into their plans. Reporting to Intuit the problems and bugs is now so obfuscated that I do not even know how to do it. I have posted several messages to them, I thought, but they end up in some blog that generates user response. What can users do about bugs? Just ludicrous.  If you do not have to upgrade, then DO NOT. You have been warned.  (See my other reviews to know that I review a lot and have no particular bias to grind. If Intuit gets its act together I will give them a good review. One can hope.)	-1
Having used Quicken in the various encarnations, I will say that I like the product.  Why give it a poor rating you say?  My main issue with quicken is that the product is great until you get to the end of life which is usually 2 to 3 yrs and then most of the functionality of it becomes useless, which in fact, forces you to upgrade.  Quicken 2013 seems to be very buggy as well and has had 10 updates since its initial release.  One I found right away was trying to convert a graph to a pdf file to save, that is buggy at best and doesnt appear to work properly.  As long as this program has been around you would think that the bugs have been worked out by now.  Utilize online banking, its cheaper and does most of what this does these days anyways.	-1
If possible, I would rate any recent version of Quicken zero stars.  I have used current versions of Quicken non stop for over 25 years.  Now I am being forced again to "upgrade" from Quicken 2010 as Intuit will no longer support downloads.  At each new version, I find a less accurate, slower,and more buggy product, with less user friendly interface and more useless options.  My data has been corrupted several times by program glitches.  My wife's checking account has been hopelessly scrambled to the extent I had to delete it and start new twice in the last 6 months.  It also has inexplicably lost or changed the capital gains basis of some investment accounts I have held for many years.  The reports section does not even display my actual net worth even though all the individual asset values are correctly shown.  My computer and drive are fine and no other software has had a data problem.  I believe that financial software needs to be both reliable and supported.  Neither of these is true of Quicken.	-1
After reading all the problems with quicken i am going to stick with my quicken 10 version.  my subscription runs out in april so i will be be entering my CC transactions by hand.  quicken needs to fire people and get the product quality back up.  it has been a mess for years.  apple did not waste any time getting rid of execs that were responsible for the maping problem.  it is unbelieveable that a company like quicken can still stay in business with all the problems them are having with the product and the lousy customer service.  i do not have time to spend hours working on software bugs and getting frustrated.  it appears quicken is getting worse rather than better.  they need to develop a quicken lite that just handles simple CC and bank account transactions.  i only use about 10% of quicken's capability mainly for budgeting and keeping track of expenses.  i am not sure why people keep buying quicken if they have read the amazon reviews first.	-1
Using Quicken Deluxe for years, however, the FORCED UPDATE is an issue I will no longer tolerate - So long Quicken!	-1
I've used Quicken for many years....and been trapped in their terrible forced upgrade policy before.  Now I am again seeing pop ups telling me that my software will stop working after 4/30/2013.  Why?  Simply because they want me to upgrade again.  The software isn't sold as expiring in a couple of years; in fact, the software will continue to run.  They just cut off allowing it to update your data from banks, etc!  This is a product that has a rating of 1 star on CNet; just about every one of their 35 reviews was scathing.  Before you get in bed with them....think twice!  I wish I didn't have to continue to support them!	-1
If you ever find yourself with nothing to do just check the Quicken registers for missing/incorrect entries and incorrect categories assigned to the entries. A true balancing act that should give you two or three hours of maintenance work pretty much any day. Just don't expect to get through it with a sense of fulfillment.	-1
Most of the features simply don't work.  Many of the reports and forcasts perform incorrect calculations.  I have limited success syncing online, as often Quicken gets errors trying to download transactions.  I have to track my investements in a spreadsheet, because the Quicket feature is a joke.  And the most painful part is just all the small bugs, like when buying a stock you have to enter the date and information before you can type in the new symbol, but when Quicket looks up the symbol it erases all the information you entered.  If you want a basic checkbook with a calendar to track your bills, it is adequate.  But it's rediculous that they want $50 every year for an upgrade, and it doesn't include simple bug fixes.  As a software engineer myself, I would be ashamed to work on this product.	-1
Like other software manufacturers with annual updates, the manufacturer often places the product on the market before it is completed.  Their thinking is probably that they will have commited the user to their product AND that the user will wait patiently for the needed updates/upgrades. In my opinion this release did not meet the "minimum" a user should expect. However, I am waiting and continue using my Quicken Deluxe 2012 -- of which I am a very satisfied user.	-1
*** Update 9/30/2013 ***  I am reducing my rating from four stars to one. This is because this program not only does not work as well as the  2005 version but it also failed to migrate reports from the older version to the new version.  I have installed this version on a Windows XP and Windows 7 partition. In both systems for the program works the same: Even though I have set it up to memorized transactions, this version absolutely refuses to do so. After going through a lengthy troubleshooting with Quicken tech support we determined it was not a corrupted data file. They recommended I uninstall Quicken and download and run a program that will clean out all traces of the installation (supposedly).  After doing the above and reinstalling Quicken 2013 the same problem exists. It took me a while to notice this as many of my routine transactions were previously memorized and those memorized transactions still automatically popped up. As of this date there seems to be no solution. To put it bluntly this version is a dog.  *** Original Review *** I've been a Quicken user since version 2 for DOS way back in 1988. While I don't use many of the advanced features, I do rely on it to keep my finances in order. Over the years Intuit has had a nasty habit of messing with an interface that worked pretty well. They also tweak the file format just enough so that the data from the new version is not backward compatible, so you can't go back, even if you don't like the new product. My latest version was Quicken 2005 and I was happy with it, but since it was offered this on Vine, I decided to give the latest version a try.  Before beginning the installation I did a backup of my Quicken 2005 data. After the backup was completed I begin the installation.  After accepting the license agreement informs me that it will uninstall my previous version and migrate my data the new one. After the installation is complete it wants me to reboot. This I do.  After rebooting I start Quicken 2013 and register the product. After completing the registration it converts my Quicken 2005 data to Quicken 2013 format, but only after backing up my Quicken 2005 data to a separate folder. Nice touch.  Quicken 2013 puts two icons on your desktop, one for the program and one inviting you to check your credit score. I think the second is really lame. Still, there's a lot less advertising than in previous versions of Quicken.  As with any Quicken installation it automatically installs sound files for many operations. I immediately went to the control panel and eliminated most of them. Besides these minor gripes the installation went smoothly.  Most, but not all, of your settings from the previous version are maintained, so you still have to go into the preferences to check.  Once the program opens the first thing you notice is the drab interface. Still gives you a choice of four color schemes but all are equally drab. The shading in the register is so light it's virtually indistinguishable from the white.  Tab Bar Across the top of the register are several tabs. You can choose which tabs to show or hide, but the process is clunky, as you must go into the "View" menu for each item you want to change rather than just presenting you a list that you can choose from and letting you click all the ones you want. At least you can choose "Classic Menus" and uncheck "Show Tabs." There is also a tab bar at the bottom of the screen that you cannot make go away.  The new interface is generally nice and the program is stable for me both on XP and Windows 7.  Bottom Line I find Quicken essential to managing my finances, but for my modest needs Quicken 2005 worked well. Had I not gotten the program through Vine I would not spent the money on this version. Now having evaluated the program I do not feel there is sufficient added value to justify upgrading. IMO, if you have a previous version of Quicken that works well for you I see no reason to upgrade to Quicken 2013, especially since there does not seem to be an upgrade price for users of previous versions. If you are just starting out with Quicken, I would suggest Quicken Basic or even Quicken Checkbook.	-1
I have had a couple of different versions of Quicken over my life. My last was version 2012 and I hated it. Every time I would sync my checking account, I had to reconcile since it typically missed pulling in things. When it missed a few, it became cumbersome to even want to use it, so I uninstalled.  Now version 2013.  I was happy that setting up accounts was even easier with this version. I got everything synced and thought it looked good. I synced again after a few days and wouldn't you know it, my checking account (different bank this time) was wrong. It was missing entries. I deleted, set it up again, which does take a while  assigning categories. I did a sync a few days later and this time it was fine.  Great I thought.  I just synced again today and sure enough, it is missing several entries.  One from over a week ago.  If I delete the account and set it up again, those same entries do come over, so it is not like it is a pending transaction.  So, I hate this software. Two different versions, different banks, and it still skips downloading entries.  What good is financial software if it does this?  I want to use it for its most basic functionality and that fails for me miserably.  If Quicken support comments, yes, I have the latest updates. i also had them with 2012 and it did not matter then either.	-1
Read all the reviews decided to install & hold off using the mobile app & cloud sync until those issues were resolved.  Install pretty smooth though I don't understand why Intuit makes you uninstall prior versions before you can install the new one.  Seemed to take a long time to download & install updates (to R4).  First One Step Update took 30 minutes to complete (normally takes about 2 mins in 2012) and didn't update about 1/3 of my accounts.  Tried clicking the try to update again button (or whatever its called) & 1 or 2 accounts did update but most didn't.  Tried One Step again..same result.  So new software take 15x longer to operate and fails on 33% of the downloads.  Goodbye.  Refund.  Uninstall.  Back to a happy 2012 user.  I've been using Quicken since the 90's and this is absolutely the worst crap they've ever released.  I'm very scared now for Turbotax if the same incompetence is applied to it.  Hey Intuit, do us a favor, Turbotax is perfect..don't try to improve or fix it, just load the right forms & schedules.	-1
I was perfectly happy with Quicken 2012 but when I saw that 2013 had an iPad app I had to take the plunge. Throughout my day, I spend a lot of pocket cash that I often forget about, and the idea of being able to enter transactions directly on my iPad and then sync them when I got home was *very* appealing to me since I'd often end a month with a few hundred dollars in "pocket cash" when my wallet only had $20 in it.  However, the cloud experience just flat out does not work. I added all of my accounts, but when I log into the iPad App it tells me to go to my computer and add the accounts. I've tried cloud sync several times. After about 5 minutes, a window pops up that "Quicken has stopped responding" with options to close the program or continue waiting. I picked "Continue" then took my dogs for a walk, only to return 20 minutes later to the same message and I have a *VERY* fast Internet connection (it took about 1 minute to download the Quicken program itself).  After doing some research on the web, I saw that a lot of users were not only having trouble with the iPad app, but were LOSING DATA. This thought terrifies me, so I temporarily turned off cloud sync.  As for the rest of the app, nothing really new and exciting. It does what Quicken is supposed to do.  I'm giving it two stars because the basic app itself is functional, but I feel Intuit has really misled the consumer into upgrading with the idea of a cloud-based iPad app when this app isn't working properly.	-1
Thanks for the review.  I have wanted quicken on my phone for years.  Looks like I'll wait a few more.  What is up with Intuit anyway?	-1
Look up the Q2010 and/or Q2008 products, where I posted detailed logs/diaries of the endless bugs, errors and frustrations I endured as a Quicken user.  Here's a permalink to just one of my earlier, quite detailed Amazon reviews of the Quicken product: tinyurl.com/AmazonQuickenReview  I owned Q2008, Q2005 & Q2002 and I used them daily. During that decade, I observed no significant product improvements, just the aforementioned continual increase in software bugs, eternal peddling of affiliated products, etc.  In August, 2010, I finally migrated to the Moneydance product and--after the migration and learning curve issues--I find it swims slick as an eel. I wish I'd done it years sooner.  Since at least 2002, Intuit has been using Quicken as a pure 'cash cow' - a product to milk revenue out of, but making no investment in it - while it continues to toy around with other new product developments toward future revenue streams ... ... Quicken Loans, Quicken Credit Cards, etc.  The history of the Quicken product doesn't suggest a bright future for Quicken users. Don't get suckered into starting up with Quicken. Go with Moneydance.	-1
This is probably the WORST version of QuickBooks I've ever used in my life and I've been using QuickBooks since the 90s.  The layout is atrocious, the stock reports are next to useless, and it crashes as if Intuit is a open-source startup!  I haven't experienced such poor quality from Intuit since they "upgraded" Quicken 6 (which was the last great version of that program by the way).  If you have an older copy, stick with it.  This is not a great upgrade.  ADDENDUM: It even gets worse! Not only does it behave like a version 1 program, it seems as if the developers have lived in a cave as UI design advanced through the 80s, 90s, and 2000s.  And I don't mean fancy widgets.  When I can't do something as simple as favorite a report THAT I AM LOOKING AT, there's something terribly wrong.  Even from the Memorized Report List, I can't favorite a report.  What I have to do is drill down to the section the report resides and THEN click the heart to favorite it.  Why did they even bother?  By the way this tedium is necessary because I can't simply create a generic Memorized Report that can be used GLOBALLY across companies!  Again, WHY?!?!  The concept of accounting is pretty simple: assets, liabilities, revenue, expense.  The memorized reports group according to those parameters but I can't create ONE memorized report that I can apply GLOBALLY.  The lack of foresight put into this software is ABSOLUTELY SHOCKING for a company that has existed for MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS!  How they outsurvived Meca Software is beyond me!	-1
I have an older version (I think circa 2008) that is far easier to use.  This one is flashy and was hyped up, but it is very confusing.  I am having a hard time getting the data from my old version to transfer to the new one.  Maybe I'm just a door knob?  Maybe this is not one of Intuit's better products.	-1

In all fairness, Intuit has done a good job refining Quicken over the last decade. There is only so many functions you need in a personal finance software. So Intuit is now forcing the users to upgrade by shutting down online feature of the past versions, which I think it's a bad business practice. But I can live with that, if it provides an effortless upgrade. Unfortunately, it doesn't.  Every upgrade is full of problems. The latest episode is upgrading from 2010 to 2013. It won't accept the file password after upgrade. I had to use Quicken password removal tool, by uploading my Quicken file to Intuit server; which has an upload speed of 50kb/sec and download speed is about 30KB/sec. Really Intuit, you can't afford broadband speed?  After an hour of troubleshooting, I was able to open the file with Quicken password removal tool. And all seems to be there...fingers crossed.  ***WARNING*** Quicken password removal tool only supports certain versions. A statement from its website: "The Password Removal Tool will only work with data file passwords used in currently supported versions of Quicken for Windows. So, what that means is it will not work on data files for Quicken for Mac (including Quicken Essentials), older versions of Quicken for Windows (Quicken 2008 and older), nor other passwords associated with Quicken such as transaction passwords and your password vault."  Make sure you backup your file BEFORE installing 2013, otherwise you might never be able to open your file again.	-1
All,  Please read the full review by Robert Sweed (see 1st paragrpah copied below).  I had the same problem, but didn't realize that Quicken Deluxe was the cause - and went into diagnostic mode with Symantec.  Intuit support is horrendous and doesn't take responsibility for their problem.  The fact that the problem is unresolved in R11 is appalling.  I'm on now with an Intuit supervisor who denies the problem and says they test everything and offers no help whatsover.  Please review Robert's review and all the others carefully - DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT  PLEASE REVIEW THIS REVIEW CAREFULLY:  It's shameful Intuit would release a product that should be a beta than a production release. I am a long term Quicken user from back in the DOS days and a former beta tester! Upgrading from Home and Business 2010 was a nightmare! After purchasing the download I installed it, and the program returned an error it couldn't apply updates it had downloaded. Next up was to...	-1
If you decide to buy this software think twice, because have some bugs that the customer support team can't resolve, then you need to do some things manually ... I have problems (CC-502) when I try to download my data from PayPal with Quicken, this issue is since more than 4 months and any one in Quicken Intuit can't resolve this issue ...	-1
I must agree with the other reviewers. While QuickBooks is an outstanding program (I have used the Windows version of this product for years and years), this version for Mac is so buggy that I uninstalled it in under three extremely frustrating hours. At one point I was near tears and checked the other reviews here ... I must admit, I felt better knowing that this was not an isolated incident. And, yet, I also felt perturbed that this was not an isolated incident. It may be that this product was not properly beta-tested? (It seems that something is inherently wrong when so many consumers present the same issues).  But, all is not lost. I still trust QuickBooks and will continue to use it ... for Windows. (It is such an intuitive, user-friendly program that I would not dream of switching to anything else). I am in agreement with some reviewers in believing that Mac software (across-the-board) does seem to get less beta-testing and does seem "buggier" than PC software. As a user of both platforms, I have no prejudices against or for either. Nonetheless, I have found that my most frustrating experiences have occurred on my Mac. So, my plea to QuickBooks (and other software companies) is to give Mac users some love and beta-test a little more thoroughly.	-1
I've been a Quicken user for many years, but am really ticked off at their upgrade policies. The best you'll get away with is repurchasing Quicken every 3 years if you want to retain the online banking feature. I presently run the 2010 version which works well. I see no reason to upgrade and agree with some other reviewers that Quicken upgrades rarely improve anything or add useful features. However, I now get frequent reminders that if I don't upgrade by April I'll lose the online banking feature. That is blackmail! If I ever find a decent useful personal finance program that supports online banking, I'll switch in a second without looking back. Mint looks decent but it is now owned by Intuit and will soon become Quicken. I used Microsoft Money a long time ago and would still use it if it had not been discontinued.  It deserves only a 1-star rating, but I give it 2 stars because I've had a good experience with Quicken 2010 so far.  11/27/2013 update: I compromised my morals and upgraded to 2013 because nothing else looked very robust. Lowered to one star because the 2013 version is not any different than the 2010 version, yet I was forced to upgrade to retain online banking. Idiots. I'd really like to monitor anticipated income and expenses easily. I can probably do it with Quicken but it is soooo cumbersome and takes way too much time and thought to make it work. Microsoft Money did it well but that was many years ago. We've come a long ways backwards with Quicken. Quicken 2013 also doesn't like the Quicken Exchange Format that one of my banks uses so online banking is only partially successful.  2/8/2014 update: Yet another reason to hope that Quicken or someone else comes out with a better product. I anticipate a budget crunch in 2014 to pay for unforseen federal taxes so I started a budget under Planning. They've removed a feature that previously existed! I'd like to specify the starting month for my budget but I'm limited to complete Jan-Dec years. I don't consider defining a date range for a budget to be an advanced feature. Another thing I'd like to be able to do is enter paychecks in as bi-weekly, not monthly. That is not possible with Quicken 2013 Home and Business.  Intuit is slowly dumbing down Quicken to the point were anyone can use it at a very basic level at the cost of leaving experienced users in the dustbin. The problem with doing that is once people own it and try to use it for the purpose it was designed for, they become experienced users and start looking around for something better. There isn't anything better, yet.	-1
I've been using Quicken to manage my finances for about 20 years.  Quicken is a great aide and worth the time it takes to input income and expenses.  I upgrade almost every year.  The 2013 version, even though they've had updates to it since it was released, seems quite buggy.  If you're a Quicken user I suggest skipping the upgrade this year and waiting for the 2014 version to come out before upgrading.  Aside from the bugginess, one thing that irked me is that my hidden accounts, accounts no longer used came back to the forefront after my data file was changed for this version.  I had to figure out how to go in and officially close those accounts.  Two of the accounts wouldn't close, probably because even though they were zero'd out, Quicken still shows them each with a balance of .01 cent even though if I look at the account itself it shows zero there.  Buggy, buggy, buggy.  Wait until next year.	-1
Thanks for the review. I have wanted quicken on my phone for years. Looks like I'll wait a few more.  What is up with Intuit anyway?	-1
Kept crashing. But there are no good alternatives there.	-1
The front of the Premier program says "Manage Your Investments".  However, It's the same program as the Deluxe 2013 Version.  I bought both programs thinking I needed both; one to manage the checking account; one to manage investments.  I feel I was misled by Intuits' advertising on the boxes.  Now I have almost two of the same programs and a $100 invested.	-1
I only wanted to use Quicken to track my investments.  Ive used Quicken on and off for years and it has become too buggy to use for everything. The advertisements are also too annoying.  By only using it for investments, I only have to use it once a month.  I have tried other software and unfortunately they are even worse.  So, I'm stuck with Quicken or Excel.  I have too many transactions for excel.  I used it with Fidelity and Etrade.  It has always worked fine with Fidelity.  There has been an issue for years with Etrade.  Dividend reinvesment transactions on ETrade are out to 6 decimal places for number of shares.  The Quicken import only goes out to 3 decimal places.  This always causes an out of balance condition and Quicken tries to make me enter a placeholder transaction to fix the out of balance condition.  I've contacted Quicken many times over this, for no help.  I finally did a download from Etrade in quicken format and looked at the file.  Etrade is actually the problem, only sending the transactions to 3 decimal places.  Obviously, this is a process that was never thoroughly tested by Quicken or Etrade.  I contacted Etrade, who will not admit it's a bug and classified as an enhancement request.  Bottom line, if your using it for investments with Etrade, it will be annoying to use.  If your using it with Fidelity, it works well, including dividend reinvestments, which Fidelity does out to 5 decimal places.	-1
This installed easily (though rather slowly). However, after importing my ING/Capital One 360 accounts, I immediately noticed there was a problem -- every single balance was at zero! The only account that did import properly was from my credit union. Mint is free and far more accurate, in my opinion.	-1
Adding to previous review after using for another month and hate it even more.  Its buggy, forgets passwords every couple weeks, loads slow, shows no improvement over previous versions and clearly is only changed so that Intuit can continue to extort outrageous upgrade fees. I would pay a reasonable annual subscription charge, as I understand that they can't offer services forever for free.  But they actually offer almost no service.  If there were any other financial sotware available I would dump Quicken instantly.	-1
I purchased the 2013 Quicken before researching on Amazon - stupid error. First - I had the same trouble doing the transfer as other users - there was no warning that the password on my old file had to be removed before the upgrade was installed, so I could not open my data file.  So, three hours later, having finally deduced that there was no other option than to uninstall 2013 and reinstall 2010, then remove the password, reinstall 2013 (but this time in a separate directory)and transferred the file and decided against a password for now, tried entering a few transactions.  Rubbish! Total RUBBISH! Entering a price for a listed option took no time at all, but after each entry, the program ground away for up to 20 seconds before allowing entry of the next option price. (Quicken does not download option prices correctly, so they have to be manually entered) Everything is slowed down in the Budget area, making the feature valueless. Presentation is  changed for many reports, so you have to re-learn report building, etc. etc. etc.  After trying the system for several days, I uninstalled 2013, returned to 2010 Premier, and pray that Microsoft will see the errors of their ways and bring MSMoney back. Of course, when I took the software back to the retailer from whom it was purchased, demanding refund, the store refused - but one of the clerks told me that "lots" of people had returned theirs as well, and Intuit's response had been that the customers were just trying to cheat their way out of paying for "a perfectly good product."  A last point - Intuit gives you an on-line discount of 20% on their garbage product, some banks tout that they have negotiated the same 20% discount - Amazon makes it 30% - but I wouldn't buy it again with a 100% discount and an apology letter from the Chairman of the Board of Intuit after he fired the Intuit developers and their over-paid management for this software travesty.   - - - - - subsequent update 1/1/2013  Glitches? You betcha !!! If you are working on a PC with a non-US keyboard and/or a non-US English compatible character set, you have to re-set your entire system to use the US English standard, which wreaks havoc with spreadsheets, correspondence and non-US proprietary software files. Reports are not easy to define when multiple currencies are involved, and currency conversion is confusing at best. Oh, yes - when you re-start your system after re-setting the character set, your internet connection parameters are lost, so figure on re-entering them from scratch - pay no attention to the error messages spat out by Quicken - they are wrong. Just re-set the connection, and re-start Quicken as soon as you calm down from your hissy fit about the absurdity of a badly-QC'd software from a $***&U*I outfit like Intuit.  BLACKMAIL !!! BLACKMAIL !!! BLACKMAIL !!! BLACKMAIL !!! I have used TurboTax from this same renegade outfit since before the Roman Empire was founded, and whilst having the occasional gripe, loved the tax preparation software. But if you purchase TurboTax 2012, IT WILL NOT TRANSFER YOUR DATA FROM THE 2010 QUICKEN SOFTWARE - YOU HAVE TO UPGRADE TO 2013 QUICKEN IN ORDER TO TRANSFER YOUR FINANCIAL DATA FROM 2012 !!!  This kind of entrapment of customers - deception if you are feeling charitable, highway robbery if you are being realistic  - is totally unacceptable, reprehensible and borderline theft. My license to use 2010 Quicken was valid throughout 2012, yet Intuit won't allow me to transfer my data to Turbotax because the license expires in 2013 ???  This kind of maltreatment of customers is why I curse the days of birth of the Intuit developers and their demonic management, and light candles to ask that their genes never be permitted to be passed on to another generation of thieves and scoundrels. I also pray that one day soon a team of honest developers (in a software company that doesn't have as its top priority the ravaging of the customer base in order to increase the value of stock options for the top managers) will write a solid tandem of software products that blows Intuit out of the water - and blasts those developers and managers back into the fires of Hades from whence they come.  Update 8 Jan 2013 - - - - -  If you have foreign accounts, beware! When transfers are made from Quicken 2013 (Q2013) of 2012 data entered in Q2010 and transferred into Q2013 because TurboTax 2012 (T2012) will not take data from Q2010 . . . Euros are not converted to Dollars when the transfer to Turbotax is made! My compensation is paid directly into an account in Europe denominated in Euros - but the transfer takes the total amount and calls it dollars. The interest on my bank account is kept as the same number, but shown as dollars, not Euros. Same for everything else I've checked so far. I don't think the IRS would be amused if I trusted Intuit's software. Neither should you.	-1
I am a 20 year user of Quicken.  Generally I have been satisfied with it until this year.  I am a Mac owner and have installed Parallels and Windows just so I could run Quicken.  I even was a beta tester for their Mac product.  I was disturbed when as a tester that Quicken ignored the majority of the other beta testers who were asking them to basically port the Windows version and features to the Mac version.  Now with 2013 they have decided to eliminate a simple way they had been using to enter, track and pay loans.  Instead they have created an obscure, complicated, not user friendly process (Not a simple window with your needed options like "pay" and "when" and "make extra payment" and check balances.)  Other users have complained about this and several have said they will drop the program after many years if Quicken does not change it to the simple process it was before.  I will wait a month and if it is not fixed, I will look for a better finance program.	-1
I do a lot of photo and video editing and have never had a program this unstable. It crashes often, particularly when editing titles or menues. The good news is that when it works, it is decent for video editing and DVD production. It's capture features are average. Also, when it crashes, it restarts to where you were in the editing process with minimal loss of progress...just lost time. If Pinnacle fixed the stability, I would give it 4 stars at least. I would note that I have a fast computer that is otherwise stable as a rock, and completely up to date, both drivers and software.	-1
There are a lot of things this software does that older versions do as well and some things the others do not such as the stereoscopic 3D and the ability to author to Blu-ray.  Though the software is nice, its what's missing that makes me want for more.  I compared my old version 12 to this version 16 and found that I had options like picture noise removal in the older that is a cost add-on on this version. And the buttons are easier to locate and use on the older version than this one.  Also, just setting up a basic video for adding sound and effects seems to take longer and doesn't quite come out as good as the other version.  Overall, as you can tell, I am not happy with this version and will likely uninstall this to go back to version 12.	-1
At first glance, this software seems loaded with features. Interface looks relatively simple to use, sure there will be some learning curve, but the actual layout looks intuitive.  Unfortunately, the words "looks" and "seems" are all I can use to describe this software. After many, many attempts and two full weeks of reading Pinnacle's Knowledge base, I have yet to get it to successfully run. So I simply can't use it. I've tried everything they suggested on their help pages. Reinstall, update drivers, download latest patch, change folder names in the AppData folders, etc and I still get the "NGstudio Error" which, according to their site is a "general error".  From their support pages they suggest you rename a folder in AppData. If that doesn't work they link you to another page that does stuff you have no doubt already tried. Reinstall, etc. So, logic says you then move to actual tech support right? Nope, you see, when you pay for this product they seem to think it's ok to then charge you again for the privilege of getting to ask them a question. That is a definite 100% turn off for me.  This may be decent software, heck it may even be really good software, but I'll never know. I am out of ideas to get it to work, and honestly out of patience to keep trying. There are many other video editing software options out there. I'd strongly suggest looking at those instead of this.  Thankfully this was a review copy for me and I am out no money. If I was out actual cash I'd be much more angry. This will be filed in the circular file cabinet and taken to a landfill soon.	-1
Update September 2016 Corel ha dropped support for this . It WILL NOT INSTALL as of now .  Requires software that no longer exits as part of the installation process. Upgrading to Windows 10 Update generates error message about re-installing the software. This was a 5 star program . I've changed my rating to 1 star because I can't give it a 0 .   Pinnacle Studio 16 Ultimate is a full featured video editing suite. It's minimum specs are :   * Windows 8, Windows 7, Windows Vista (SP2) (64-bit OS recommended)   * Intel Core Duo 1.8 GHz, Core i3 or AMD Athlon 64 X2 3800+2.0 GHz or higher; Intel Core2 Duo 2.66 GHz, Intel Core i5 or i7 1.06 GHz or higher required for AVCHD*, stereoscopic 3D*, and Intel Quick Sync Video support   * 2 GB of RAM or higher, min. 4 GB for Windows 64-bit (strongly recommended for stereoscopic 3D)   * DirectX 9 (or higher) graphics device with Pixel Shader 3.0 support such as:   o NVIDIA GeForce 6 series or higher (CUDA enabled required for CUDA support)   o ATI X1000 series or higher   o Intel GMA X3000 series or higher   * 128 MB VGA VRAM; 256 MB or higher recommended, required for AVCHD*, stereoscopic 3D and CUDA   * Display resolution: 1024 x 600 or higher   * Windows-compatible sound card (multi-channel output required for surround preview**)   * 4.5 GB HDD space for installation   * DVD-ROM for installation   * Internet connection required for online activation and cloud or online services  * Requires free product activation via the Internet  That said don't expect speed or ease of use at these specifications. If you only meet the minimum requirements you might be better off trying&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/VideoStudio-Pro-X5-Ultimate/dp/B007GFNPFY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">VideoStudio Pro X5 Ultimate</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Cyberlink-PowerDirector-11-Ultra/dp/B009716GWE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Cyberlink PowerDirector 11 Ultra</a>. Of the two I'd recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/VideoStudio-Pro-X5-Ultimate/dp/B007GFNPFY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">VideoStudio Pro X5 Ultimate</a>&nbsp;as the more stable program. Another PC based alternative is&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Sony-Movie-Studio-Platinum-Suite-12/dp/B008MIMIY8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Sony Movie Studio Platinum Suite 12</a>.  Regardless of the software you choose , keep in mind the more memory , larger the hard drive and your video card will determine performance.  As with all video software there is a learning curve to each of these products and I didn't necessarily find one harder to learn than another.  On the other hand if you need to replace your computer to run this software you might be better served by switching to a Mac and going the Final Cut route to editing.	-1
I don't even know where to begin with this software. Let me start off by saying that it's not very user friendly. There is a lot bloatware that comes along with it. I was really disappointed at the fact that I kept getting errors when trying to upload to You Tube. What is the point of having the option incorporated if you can't even use. I did finally get a video uploaded but it took forever. It's hard to find support on their website plus they want to charge you for calling in to ask for advice on how to get their software to work properly. I like the fact that there are many options available to you in the software but I hardly get the opportunity to use them because the software itself is always freezes up and then I have to hit ctrl alt delete to get the crappy software off of my screen. I've tried using this software for several months in order to really form an accurate opinion and I honestly can't recommend this software to anyone. If you want to continuously feel frustrated while editing videos then Pinnacle Studio 16 Ultimate is the perfect software for you! I've finally given up and uninstalled the software. At least Corel Video Suite is a little more user friendly.	-1
I've been using Pinnacle software for years and upgraded to Avid Studio after Avid purchased Pinnacle.  Now Corel owns Pinnacle and this product is an upgraded version of Avid Studio.  However, if you have a problem, you'll run into is a maze of technical incompetence. Corel promotion pages that say something will work and it does not. This is misrepresentation.  Plus the PDF help files that come with the Corel Studio 16 Ultimate install point to dead end broken links. Ergo, absolutely no quality assurance.  This is a slam bam thank you mam release.  But support is the real nightmare. It's like who's on first via email. No phone support whatsoever.  At least when Avid owned the line, you could talk to someone live instead of emails with techs who don't bother to read your message carefully.  Corel did a horrible sloppy roll out on this product. It will them a long time to sort this nonsense out - if ever.  Don't come near this product until 2014 or later.	-1
When I choose a software program to use I look for those that are so intuitive that I can do in and play around without reading the directions.  This isn't it.  It has a lot of capbabilities but honestly I did not have the patience to figure them all out- especially since other providers offer a more intuitive interface.  If you are really into this for professional use or you want profession effects then it might be worth you taking the time to read through all the directions for "ultimate" experience.	-1
I have done everything I can think of to like this program and it seems everything I try is just not working.  First, let me say I am not new to video editing.  Most of the time I use Adobe Premier Pro and sometimes Sony Vegas.  No matter what I tried in this version, it just didn't seem to work.  I tried to get film off of two different video cameras, one a Sony and one a Canon.  No matter what I tried none of the videos would come in with sound.  I could take the same videos into QuickTime and Adobe Premier Pro and they worked perfectly.  I also tried to basic green screen editing and it was next to impossible.  When I finally did get a video to save out, the sound I played on screen was actually slightly off in the saved file.  Aside from these issues, there were a few notable program crashes along the way.  For now, I don't recommend it.  I will continue to try to use it and if I feel differently at any point, I will update my review.	-1
I have recently been using&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Photo-and-Video-Pro-Suite/dp/B008MR2GUA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Photo and Video Pro Suite</a>&nbsp;for several weeks now. It is an inexpensive program that has more options than I will ever even used. In fact, I could not be much more impressed with that software (for my somewhat limited personal needs). Therefore, I thought this Pinnacle software would far surpass my wildest expectations ... it is much more expensive and seemingly has endless options that sounded exciting to explore. I was ready to start experimenting!  Well, the reality wasn't as rosy.  While the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Photo-and-Video-Pro-Suite/dp/B008MR2GUA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Photo and Video Pro Suite</a>&nbsp;I was using never froze, this one froze on four (extremely) frustrating occasions. (After the first incident, I did close all other open programs). After the fourth, I elected to remove the software entirely and then ran CCleaner just as a precautionary measure. (There is something about this software that I simply do not like, and I felt more at peace by running the CCleaner ... even though I know that sounds extreme).  And, when I briefly had it working, in no way is it "user-friendly." What's more, I have used Pinnacle in previous years and I have never experienced comparable annoyance and problems. One wonders if they have become complacent (they have had success in the past) or if they failed to beta-test this  software. Nonetheless, this topic is  moot: I do not believe the average consumer will wonder what went wrong with Pinnacle, they will only know they are out over $100.00. And, in this economy, no one can afford to "throw away" $100.00.  As a final note, believe ALL of these posts about non-existent, gratis customer support. Who charges their customers when the flaw resides in their own product? The reps need to learn the difference between a person inept using the program and a person genuinely disappointed and in need of guidance for a program the company created.	-1

Immediately got C++ runtime errors.  Need to go to Corel website and download latest version Pro x5 service pack 3!  Amamzon should state that it is only a 32 bit programs, therefore it runs slow, Windows 8 is 64 bit.  They immediately hit you up with an upgrade for PSP X6 for $60-70, which runs th 64 bit program.	-1
I found this version harder to use than the x3 version.  Working with layers did not function as I thought it would (e.g. buttonizing a layers image changed the whole workspace, not just the layer.  I also had trouble just dropping layers in.  Beyond these little annoyances I don't see much difference between x3 and x5.  JASC should have kept this product!	-1
No problems installing and running the software, and wow, did it remind me of Corel video editors when I saw the UI.  Corel now owns Roxio, by the way.  It looks easy, but it can't find video files that don't have Roxio extensions.  I already have loads of photos and videos on my computer, and it did not recognize any of my video files.  I found a way to pull them in so I could try editing them.  It works, but it isn't great.  It's functional, but it simply doesn't have a lot of bells and whistles.  Professionals will hate it.  Even hobbyists will squirm, if they have used other video editors.  It creates .dmess files (that's not true, but the file extension is similar), and I wonder if it's compatible with commonplace viewers?  Honestly, I haven't tried.  I'm not optimistic.  It does recognize commonplace photo extensions, and the photo editor is very easy to use.  But it's not much better than the Windows photo editor you probably already have installed.  It does run on Windows 8, so it is an option if you're running Windows 8 and you're seeking budget software.  But I don't recommend it.	-1
I have found this product more then usually hard to use. The description of the product sounds much better that what you get. I can't say I have accomplished much with this program, but it was not for lack of trying. A rather frustrating program that requires a lot of time to get working and then to figure out. There must be something easier to use out there that does the same basic thing.	-1
This software is really a mess.  I am running Windows 7, and this was nearly impossible to install and seems to behave like malware.  You would think that Corel would make a great product but I am really questioning them.  They have really strayed from the original Sony product. On system startup and other odd times I am getting strange popups advertising, or asking me to sign in.  Roxio also used to be a trusted name, and who knows what has happened to them.  At the least they should offer decent support, and not direct people to forums.  That is just asking people to do your job for no pay.  it is their duty, IMHO to offer support for installation problems people encounter.  When people lose everything because of some shoddy piece of software, well it is nothing short of criminal.  I couldn't install it. I couldn't get help.  I gave up. Who needs this nightmare.	-1
The mac version of office is obviously vastly inferior to the Windows version as most programs are, but it's far better than Open Office.  It won't open Iwork files as other users have noted which is a real pain if you use that useless Isoftware for actual work.  I found the program itself to be very sluggish on OSX snow leopard and later worse on Lion (same OS only Apple killed off rosetta/PPC apps/games/programs for us without warning.)	-1
Could not open iWork files - the description of this product states that it can read and write iWork files - ???? I didn't care much for the feature set available after opening a Word document either. It's coming along - just not THERE yet...  Please fix the description - this product cannot open Pages or Numbers documents!  This makes me happy that I chose to use iWork for my needs. Works great every time and is a very powerful suite.	-1

I have just posted a review for the latest version which is much better but if you are looking to save a little bit of money thinking that you will get an okay product you are wrong this product is absolutely horrible and should have never been released.

I love using the voice recognition software on my MacBook Pro. But one of the drawbacks is you have to be connected to the Internet for it to work. If you don't have a connection your voice recognition does not work. So I got this to fill them with my voice recognition needs. It seems installed easily but when I went to use it I couldn't get it to work. I called the company and they gave me a workaround. But it was a too much of a hassle. So I just use my voice recognition program on my iPhone and write in Evernote. Then transfer the informationThen transfer the information onto my MacBook using my Evernote account. It's a great and easy solution so I never got Dragon Dictate to actually work.	-1
Unfortunately, this program does not work anywhere as well as my Dragon Natural Speaking Windows/PC program.  Reading through the reviews here I can see that others have come to this same conclusion.  Very disappointing.	-1
Apple has a built in dictation system, and Dragon is a HUUUUGE waste of time.  Dragon & Digital River should give seminars on horrible customer service.  First Digital River never sent me the physical shipment.  Either they (or Dragon) calls me once every couple of months to sell me what I already bought, and I tell them I never received it, and of course, they do nothing.  Then I get my new IMac, so I want to set up all the software.  For regular Apple software, is amazingly easy, and took less than 10 minutes of actual work for all Apple products (although some downloads took some elapsed time).  Dragon Dictate wasted almost 90 minutes of my time on the phone, and I won't get the software for another 24 hours.  Ridiculous.  They KNOW I bought it and didn't get it.  They initially said they can't do a digital download, and now they said they can, but it will take 24 hours.  I had to wait and wait and wait on the phone, then speak to 2 people from some foreign land who don't understand enough English to know the simple problem even when I have order numbers and emails in front of them.  The indian lady at Digital River said the best she could do was to refund the sale price and charge me full price.  Worst customer experience I've had in a long, long time.	-1
Knowing that all Macs running the newest operation system, Mountain Lion, now have an application called "Dictation" built into the operating system many people completely dismiss Dragon all together. However, there are some reasons that you should consider Dragon over using Dictation. First of all, Dictation is only a speech to text application whereas Dragon is more of a different means to control your computer. If I was to solely judge which had the better accuracy I'd give it hands down to Dictation and I'd recommend it to anyone who wanted simply speech to text. The only reason I can see for buying Dragon would be if there was some reason that you couldn't use a mouse or keyboard. Dragon isn't as accurate as Dictation, the headset isn't anything to get excited about, and the setup/registration of Dragon is a major pain. Also note that if you don't have OS X 10.8 (Mountain Lion) and want speech to text, it would still be cheaper to buy Mountain Lion versus getting Dragon.  In order for Dragon to be a reasonable alternative to Dictation they'll really have to step up their game in order to even compete.	-1
If not for the "Metro" interface and start menu(or lack therof), Windows 8 would be an upgrade to Windows 7.  The fact that it does have Metro and does NOT have a start menu, keeps me from giving it 3 stars.  To get the same functionality, I have to install third party software and re-purchase DVD functionality and Media Center, which I already had before...and used.  In desktop mode (funny because it's a desktop anyway), the interface is a lot smoother.  I've noticed that they made some real improvements with network connectivity on the Xbox 360.  Whenever I wanted to listen to music from my Xbox to my home stereo using Win 7, it would only connect about half the time, making it unreliable.  With Windows 8, the connection is virtually 100%.  Of course, Microsoft overdid it and, my xbox imports all my file folders too, which gives me a big mess of empty folders it can't read.  With all the sophistication of the Xbox, you still rely on folders...really?  Regarding the Metro interface, it's a good tablet OS, but why on earth would you bolt a tablet interface to an OS designed for a desktop??  It's just plain stupid!  Oh yeah, take away the start button...and menu, then put settings and folders in places where no one can find them unless they navigate through a tablet interface with their mouse and keyboard.  Fortunately, there are third party programs like "Classic Shell" that adds a start menu and boots straight to the desktop.  For most people, they would be wondering if this is some kind of Halloween prank.  When I have software like DVD playback working, then take it away when I pay for an upgrade, then make me purchase it again as an add-on feature, it's not much of an upgrade, is it?  In fact, that's a downgrade that I just paid for!  Another issue is UEFI.  Basically, Microsoft takes control of your bootloader with the installation of Windows.  This had nothing to do with security.  It was Microsoft's way of locking-out Linux by encrypting the bootloader to anything except Windows 8.  Ethics will always be in debate.  Apple does the exact same thing, but at least it locks the computer into good software.  Apple also designs the hardware, so it has an interest in protecting hardware integrety.  Microsoft is a software vendor, so they do not design any of the hardware it runs on, so the only other reason would be to lock out another OS.  As a desktop, it's surprisingly stable.  It has all the good qualities of Win 7 with better connectivity and plug & play support.  Unfortunately it doesn't have much more than that because Microsoft spent so much time and money on Metro.  Security is as poor as ever, so I rely on Norton.  All in all, had it not been for the fact I can get this version for free from my university, I never would have upgraded.  For most people, it's not an upgrade.	-1
Avoid this product at all costs, unless you want headache after headache using your computer.  I can't even begin to describe the frustration with  this product.  I'm so mad that I've had to waste hour after hour trying to complete the most basic tasks with Windows 8.  What worked yesterday, doesn't work today. What works tomorrow, won't work the next day. Nothing is compatible, files get lost, the program seems to think on its own, incorrectly almost continuously.  I HATE IT!  Who ever had this hair-brained idea?	-1
Let's see what Microsoft is offering for the money.  I am supposed to pay Microsoft 89 dollars so that I can get Windows Media Center which was already included free as part of the operating system in Windows 7.  It is outrageous to charge $89.00 to upgrade your Windows 8 installation (you already paid for Windows 8 in the price of the computer) to Windows 8 Pro.  You can upgrade from Windows XP or Windows 7 to Windows 8 Pro for the same price.  Thanks, but NO thanks!  Microsoft is no longer focusing on creating great operating systems with features that customers want, they are focusing on offering less and then wringing money out of the consumer to get features that were already included in Windows 7.  If you have to charge for Windows Media Center for Windows 8, put it in the APP store for 10 dollars and get serious about serving the customer.	-1
I bought a $600 HP desktop and I was forced to purchase it with a 8.0 operating system.  After 5 hard disc crashes, I had the motherboard & drive replaced under warranty and I donated it to charity.  Because of the HP design type, I couldn't downgrade to 7.0 or upgrade to 8.1.  DO NOT EXPECT 8.0 or 8.1 to be Senior friendly when upgrading from XP.  Also, I had to purchase $300 in new software.  I ended up buying a new Dell XPS8700 with Windows 7.0 installed.  Lord Billy Gates kids really designed this 8.0 operating system for use with their toys.  Do yourself a favor!  Avoid being forced into purchasing this shoddy operating system with all its glitches.	-1
Windows 8 and it's spawn 8.1 really suck.  I had bought a new laptop with windows 8.  It might be good for a tablet or phone; but on a computer, it is a bloody torture.  And of course, here comes the Blue Screen of Death! They even put an emoticon of a frowny face on it.  What operating system would have a song singing, "honestly, I want to see you be brave?" Honestly? Bravery is not what you need to run a laptop.  You should open it, start it, have it be easy and work.	-1
The biggest piece of junk released since ME.  This might be and improvement for a tablet or a phone but not for a desktop or laptop user. Everything in this setup requires more clicks and in W7. The best thing is that trying to upgrade this thing to Windows 8.1, resulted in one of of two systems getting stuck. If you do not need to upgrade stick with w7 and save yourself the agony. Maybe they will fix it in the next 12 months.	-1
I had windows 7, and it's ok but the best. I updated to Windows 8 and found I had made the worst mistake I have ever made. I don't think Windows 8 should even be called a version of windows at all. It has none of the things that other Windows have had. This one has only social apps on it. You must also have an windows account or you get nothing from this version. I have never had a windows account, and never wanted one. I think Windows has gone to far by denying you access to certain uses of Windows 8. Every computer maker who uses windows has this version on it because you have no choice, and it's time to go to Apple Computers, and I'm not a great fan of theirs either but it's better than Windows 8. So if you like windows already don't waste your time getting W8. I still have Windows Vista and Windows XP, and I far happier with these versions.	-1
(9/25/2012) I went to Best Buy to get a new computer. I stood there and tried out Windows 8 on different computers. I am a semi expert on Windows - I've owned a 95, 98, XP, Vista, and Windows 7. I have 7 computers in my household of 5 people, and I am a big fan of Windows and have studied up each one as it came out to know almost everything about it. I feel that Windows has greatly enriched and empowered my life the last fifteen years.  But I had a heck of a time with Windows 8. The store employee had to show me how to get started like I'm someone clueless about Windows. I greatly disliked the big squares on the screen. They are ugly, take up too much space, and has no reason to be there. A small file icon is all that's necessary. One of the computers were on with the wrong aspect ratio and I tried to fix it but couldn't find display settings even when I found the settings. Couldn't find the control panel. Couldn't do nothing. Windows Vista took a bit to get used to too, but at least it was beautiful with its brand new Aero effect. Windows 8 is just plumb ugly with nothing but big squares. I don't want a big sign of ebay on my screen, but even if I did, I don't need it that big.  Finally, I got so annoyed that I did not get a new computer but instead, went home and ordered online a desktop that has Windows 7.  My prediction: Microsoft has maxed out on Windows with Windows 7. They will never produce any better Windows than 7.  Note to self: Be satisfied with Windows 7 and never expect anything more from Microsoft.  I will post this comment on Amazon now and add to it 5 or 10 years later. If my prediction proves to be wrong (which would be great for everyone) I will admit that I am wrong in the above prediction. If I turn out to be right, I will gloat.  (10/22/2013)  I wrote the above a year ago. A couple of months ago, I bought a new laptop directly from Dell. They still give the option of Windows 7 or Windows 8, and I chose 7 because my laptop does not have a touch screen.  Just so you know,even now, you can still buy a brand new Windows 7 computer if you want to. My new computer's aero effect looks so good, sometimes I just sit and admire it!  Funny story: A friend of mine recently went to Turkey and told me it was paradise on earth. He has a Windows 8 computer. I ask him to email me some pictures of the paradise, but he says he can't because he still hasn't figured out how to use Windows 8! I laughed when I heard him say that.  Another funny story: my son was telling his school friend on the phone how to do something simple on the computer. I heard him yell, "Just go to the Start button and choose control panel!" Then he yelled, "Why can't you find the Start button, it's right there on every computer!" So I had to interrupt to say that if his buddy has Windows 8 there is no Start button. My son's jaw dropped, then he screamed, and in the end, his friend still couldn't do the simple thing. It made me laugh, though.  One last thing: I just want to clarify this: I don't mind learning a totally different kind of Windows if it's better. I love computers and I love what's new and better, even if it has a steeper learning curve. But I don't like ugly. Windows 8 is ugly up front, and I will not give up the beautiful Windows 7 for something ugly!	-1
I've been a strong Microsoft supporter for decades. When Windows 7 was out, I bought more than six copies to upgrade every single computer I had access to.  Fast forward to November 2012, I ran out of Windows 7 boxes so I had to buy a new one. Windows 8 was already out so why not getting the "latest and greatest"? BIG mistake.  I'm trying to like it, but I can't, I just can't.  If a veteran Windows user has to open google and search for "How to access control panel in Windows 8" then you're doing something SERIOUSLY wrong.  I'm sorry, but GUIs are supposed to be intuitive! Another example: how are you supposed to guess the "hot corners" without doing some research or somebody telling you?  Trust me, as soon as you start using Windows 8 you'll find yourself in situations where you want to go back and there's no back button, you'll want to close something and there'll be no "close" button, you'll want to configure an application and there'll be no menu or "settings" button.  Yeah I get it! it's the whole Metro/Tablet thing, right? I'm sorry but my main computer at work is not a tablet, it's a workstation and I deserve a real OS, not something that resembles my phone or some kind of kindergarten software.  Anyway, I've been flirting with the idea of getting a MacBook Pro for a long time, well, Windows 8 gave the little push I was missing. I just bought one and I'm in love with i (I can run my Windows software using Parallels).  Way to go Microsoft! you just lost one loyal customer.	-1
This program is totally useless. Here are my reasons: . 1. The interface is confusing. . 2. The program produced errors in the image file. As a result, the program crashed when resurrecting my boot partition. . . . I tried again with the same results.	-1
You need to know that when you purchase these super low priced, slightly out of date security programs, they will probably not actually last the full year they advertise. I purchased this only a few months and was recently surprised to discover it had expired. Live and learn. Webroot is otherwise good	-1
I had it on my computer for about 2 months and had several problems so I removed it and went with Norton. I do not remember what the problems were because it was a while ago, but I do know when I found the disc the other day I threw it away.  It had one more load to it but I would not even give it away.	-1
UPDATE 3: This version appears not to recognize my SSD upon restore.  I had everything set to do a migration and my SSD is nowhere to be seen.  I can see it in BIOS but the restore software doesn't see it at all.  If I could rate this product zero, I would!  UPDATE 2: I'm sorry I'm going to have to lower it back to 1 due to its unreasonable DRM that doesn't trust you enough to use your licensed copy on more than one machine.  A realistic scenario is backing up on one machine and restoring on another.  And I think it should not be a problem if you are not concurrently using the software on more than one machine.  I will not be buying another version of this software ever again nor would I recommend it.  This is the same customer hostile tact that Adobe took and I have successfully found alternatives to the whole suite (saving $400 in the meantime).  I will be doing the same with this package.  UPDATE: It appears I ran into one of the many bugs cited in reviews on this page.  After I rebooted and started the program again, folders showed up under "My Computer" properly.  I am holding out hope that I didn't make a mistake so I'm raising my rating to a 3 stars from 1 star.  I will update after a few backups and restores.  There's no option to backup a specific folder on a given drive!!!  What the heck is that?  It only allows you to back up from the Desktop down.  I found now way to get to the root drive.  The "My Computer" listing doesn't drop down so anything under it is inaccessible.  Unless they fix this, it isn't even worth it if it's free!	-1
I gave Acronis 2011 five stars because it did what I needed it to do (and thankfully never gave me any issues).  I installed Windows 8 on one of my PCs and went to the Acronis website to see if there was an upgrade to my 2011 edition of True Image. I saw that version 2013 is apparently compatible with Windows 8, but reading further I noticed that it now requires online activation. So instead of making the software less buggy (as many other people have requested), Acronis have gone ahead and made their *backup* software rely on some activation server to work.  No thanks. Looking at alternatives.	-1
I bought Webroot SecureAnywhere Antivirus 2013 because it was highly rated in a prominent computer website. Part of the high rating was for good system performance. That wasn't my experience. I had Avast Internet Security, but switched to Webroot SecureAnywhere Antivirus because of the high rating in the computer website review. My mouse arrow was slow to respond and I often saw the spinning circle telling me to wait for functions that used to happen quickly. After a couple of days watching my computer do its own thing, I decided that I wanted to take back my computer. I uninstalled Webroot SecureAnywhere Antivirus and reinstalled Avast Internet Security. My computer is now fast again. Avast Internet Security doesn't get as good a review as Webroot SecureAnywhere Antivirus, but I get to use my computer. By the way, my computer is Win 7, with a fast Intel processor, 8GB RAM, and a high-power graphics board, so it is fast, without Webroot SecureAnywhere Antivirus.	-1
I purchased Webroot Security Software based on a good review by PC Magazine--big mistake!  Although it doesn't take up much space on your computer it slows it down big time.  The time when I noticed it most was when I would surf the Web.  This happened on all three of the computers we installed it on--two of them are pretty new.  Web pages would take literally 30 seconds to load and they would freeze until they were processed by Webroot's firewall.  I never had this happen with any other security software and we've used just about all of them.  When I turned off the firewall sure enough the problem was solved.  But everytime the computer would turn back on it would reset itself and the problem started all over again until I changed the settings.  I tried the tech support which is about as helpful as asking a chicken to help you on a test.  The tech rep wanted me to create a log which I did and then true to form he blamed it on my computer.  Of course I have this on all three of my comptuers, so much for his help.  Simply put, having Webroot on your computer is like putting chains on racecar tires!	-1
This once was the best software. Now? Not so much. I do not recommend buying this. The last 2 downloads I made with is software had issues. Webroot Tech is a joke. They sent links that had nothing to the issues I asked about. It's a waste of time. Buy something else. I will when this expires.	-1

I have no ideas about this Antivirus. Everything is ok until they have locked my account with reason is serial key not valid. Customer services are so weird. More than a month problem is solved with new key numbers. I give up it, I don't want to spend again. I throw it away, see it a good lesson for myself. As if it were free, never and forever use it again.	-1

Apparently only decent reviews get posted!  I justed  posted a very detailed review on how turbo tax failed this year and it's no where to be found!  I've used turbo tax for over 15yrs and of all the times I really needed it to be correct it failed.  I sold my rental property and the necessary forms schedule D,E & 4797 were not completed!  I discovered this after I already efiled!!  I have never had a problem before but I really needed it this time for the sale. The Federal/State accepted my taxes but I may have to file an amended return.  When you pay the high price they ask for you want your taxes to be done correctly...	-1
I had the following problems with TurboTax Premier 2012: 1) One inactive cell.  On one occasion, TubroTax had a prompt asking for a number to be entered in a highlighted cell, but the cell was inactive and would not accept any entry.  This single dead cell resulted in a return with an error, and TurboTax as a result would not file my returns despite lengthy efforts. 2) The step-by-step instructions on filing K-1 forms are muddled to the point of being impossible (for me) to use -- even after repeated attempts.  Twice TurboTax asked for information that went beyond that provided on my K-1 form itself, and which I had no idea how to answer.  One prompt suggested something like "enter negative one in column A".  I had no idea to what the prompt was referring. 3) TurboTax reported one discrepancy in values between those on my Federal and State returns although the values on my State return were loaded by TubroTax itself from my Federal return that TurboTax had just prepared.  Though unlikely, it seemed possible that the discrepancy was generated by TurboTax itself. 4) One error message (#3 above) offered no clear (to me) indication of where the error was occurring or how it might be fixed. 5) No useful help was available to trouble-shoot any of the difficulties above.	-1
It would not print, Sent 8 e-mails and it took them 15 days to answer, I sent it back and I am using H&R block that you could call and get help. After 10 years I will not buy another Turbo Tax.	-1
Preliminary Review - - -  I have used TurboTax from Intuit since before the Roman Empire was founded, and whilst having the occasional gripe, have always loved the tax preparation software. A feature I particularly appreciated was the ease of transferring copious investment data from Quicken to Turbotax, saving hundreds of hours of manual entry to satisfy the prying eyes of the gnomes of the IRS. But if you purchase TurboTax 2012, IT WILL NOT TRANSFER YOUR DATA FROM THE 2010 QUICKEN SOFTWARE - YOU HAVE TO UPGRADE TO 2013 QUICKEN IN ORDER TO TRANSFER YOUR FINANCIAL DATA FROM 2012 !!!  This kind of entrapment of customers - deception if you are feeling charitable, highway robbery if you are being realistic  - is totally unacceptable, reprehensible and borderline theft. My license to use 2010 Quicken was valid throughout 2012, yet Intuit won't allow me to transfer my data to Turbotax because the license expires in 2013 ???  So, having returned my first copy of Quicken 2013 to the store from whence it came, and denied a refund despite its admitted failure to function correctly, then accepting a 50% discount on another software purchase as my consolation . . . I have now been forced to purchase a second copy of Quicken 2013 from  Amazon so as not to develop hand cramps from transcribing data from Quicken 2010 into Turbotax 2013 !  This kind of maltreatment of customers is why I shall curse the days of birth of the Intuit developers and their demonic management, and then light candles to ask that their genes never be permitted to be passed on to another generation of thieves and scoundrels. I will also pray that one day soon a team of honest developers (in a software company that doesn't have as its top priority the ravaging of the customer base in order to increase the value of stock options for the top managers) writes a solid tandem of software products that blows Intuit out of the water - and blasts those Intuit developers and managers back into the fires of Hades from whence they seem to have come.  The software itself is brilliant, if a bit on the heavy side. The preparation of a straightforward tax return is simple, fast, effective and as far as I have been able to discern, totally accurate. It would rate 5 stars if it weren't for the scam I perceive as outlined above.  Update 8 Jan 2013 - - - - -  If you have foreign accounts, beware! When transfers are made from Quicken 2013 (Q2013) of 2012 data entered in Q2010 and transferred into Q2013 because TurboTax 2012 (T2012) will not take data from Q2010 . . . Euros are not converted to Dollars when the transfer to Turbotax is made! My compensation is paid directly into an account in Europe denominated in Euros - but the transfer takes the total amount and calls it dollars. The interest on my bank account is kept as the same number, but shown as dollars, not Euros. Same for everything else I've checked so far. I don't think the IRS would be amused if I trusted Intuit's software. Neither should you.	-1
I had Norton Family Parental Control (free version) on all my computers, and when I installed 360, neither Parental Control or this program seem to work correctly. Now, I'm constantly getting messages that I'm not registered and can't log on to the system. I think I will go back to the free Norton Family Parental Control.	-1
I got Norton 360 on a Gold Box special.  I haven't used anything from Symantec in a few years as the last anti-virus program from them caused some serious issues with my computer. I'm afraid this just confirms that Symantec is not to be trusted; ever.  Pros Installing 360 on my Windows 7 desktop went fairly smoothly; it did force a reboot without warning, but I didn't loose any data.  It offered to add Identity Safe to my browsers and so far, I don't think that has done anything negative.  Cons 360 antivirus hangs more often than not.  When I try to invoke a manual scan on a file or folder, the window starts to open then stops.  I've given it 15 minutes and it doesn't continue.  360 didn't catch a Trojan in a file that I was suspicious of making it less than 100% effective. And now the worst part; 360 instantly deletes any file it doesn't like including system files!  I bought a new Toshiba drive and on plugging it in, 360 deleted the autostart file without warning. Now the backup software that came with the drive won't work.  It's deleted other perfectly innocent files that I've scanned with Microsoft, McAfee and AVG too. It especially doesn't like portable programs.  So to summarize; 360 deletes uninfected files and may still leave you vulnerable to attach.  That makes it worth less than $0 to me.	-1
Crashed my computer when I tried to  install it. Some wierd comment about  Microsoft Dot-Com error. Had to reinstall windows to correct problem. I have used this product for years with no problem.	-1
I have always used Turbotax and been totaly satisfied, but this year has proven that Intuit can ruin even a great product for some users.  First, it saves major time in transferring data from prior years' TurboTax-prepared tax returns (as far as I can tell) with impeccable precision.  But for the first time, TurboTax fails to transfer and translate many foreign currency transactions, just plugging the foreign currency as US Dollars. This was not the case in any of the past 10 years - or at least I hope not, or the IRS is going to send me to jail for life for tax fraud or some other pretext.  Also for the first time, Turbotax 2012 will not transfer data from a two-year old Quicken (2010) program, the license of which is valid for 2012, forcing the user either to upgrade to Quicken 2013, an horrifically sub-standard and under-tested piece of software, or manually transfer the data one account at a time.  I did a family member's US Domestic tax return with absolute precision and ease, transferring Quicken 2011 data with ease, so if you have no foreign entanglements you should find this program a joy to own and use, and I highly recommend TurboTax.  But should you have a Sheckel or a Pound, an Euro or a Baht, an Yuan or a Ruble in your accounts, you will have to carefully ensure you don't transgress the US Tax Monster, taking every precaution  - because the Intuit developers have not.  A bloody shame.  ++++++++++++Further Comments 28 Jan 2013 +++++++++++++++++  Almost every time TurboTax is opened, it asks if you want to check for updates.  Updating today, TurboTax Premier is replaced by TurboTax Basic, and the message is "your configuration has changed, please re-install" - so, obediently, I try. No Go. Have to re-download from Amazon. Okay, there went another fifteen minutes down the drain. Then: "There is another version of TurboTax 2012. Please uninstall." More minutes. Finally, after more than three quarters of an hour wasted, the new program is installed, all the "check here" boxes checked, and it too only 46 minutes - oops, had to check for updates again, one more update, then at last TurboTax opens! Total now 49 minutes to open file. $%^&*!!!!	-1
First, let me say that I love TurboTax.  I have been using it for years to do my taxes and it has made it relatively painless.  Up until now, if you purchase the Deluxe version you get free Federal e-file, because the IRS does not charge for this service.  Remember when they did?  TurboTax used to charge a fee.  But, now they don't because the IRS doesn't.  So, the State of California sent out notices this year saying that they have free e-filing.  I assumed that when I did an automatic upload of any changes to the taxes this year that TurboTax would also upload the fact that the State of California has free e-filing.  However, they still charge an extra $20 for e-filing the State return.  I looked at their community question and answer sections , and it appears that many states now offer free e-filing, and other tax payers also assumeD that meant TurboTax would file their state return for free.  However, TurboTax just takes the $20 out of your tax refund.  So, if they don't change things next year, without increasing the price on their software, I will no longer be purchasing TurboTax.  If I have to fill out the same information a second time on the State of California tax website, why do I need TurboTax?  DOWN WITH THE $20 FEE TO E-FILE THE STATE!	-1
...especially if you have to pay the full retail price.  Office 2013 does not offer enough improvements to take on the hassle of moving to the new version (which I deliberately did not call "upgrading"). If you are already using the Office 2010 suite, deliberate carefully about both the expense and the subsequent tweaking it will take to get you back to the customization you like.  Two stars if this is an upgrade path from Office 2010; three stars if it's your initial Office installation.  I installed Office 2013 Professional on an Dell XPS420 computer with a recently installed Windows 8 Professional OS, a dual-core 3 GHZ processor and 4 GB RAM (32-bit environment).  At installation, I was promoted to first remove my existing Office 2010 suite. After doing so, installation of Office 2013 took approximately 10 minutes. Although cosmetic changes appear in the user interface (mostly in a "flattening" of controls on the toolbars), the overall presentation will be familiar to users of Office 2010.  Hint: if you have many commands placed in your Office 2010 applications Quick Access Toolbars, export them before you uninstall. You can later import them into the 2013 programs. Why this couldn't be scripted into the 2013 install process (along with removal of the earlier version) is another question.  Microsoft claims an array of new features in Office 2013. The biggest one that is readily apparent is that Microsoft would love for you to join them on the cloud via its online SkyDrive and Office 365 subscription services. Oh please. I already bought the productivity suite, and could have done without the additional marketing. Plus: every single time you look at the Office Ribbon, the big "Sign In" button will be visible on the right side. Bad idea, Office team: please don't add clutter to an already complicated user interface.  Newly installed programs installed in a recently refreshed operating system should work flawlessly. The user experience while working with various Office suite data files (primarily Excel, Word, PowerPoint and Access for me) is basically the same as with 2013. Immediately after installation, every time I closed an application, Office offered a "...(application name) has stopped working" and the usual MS prompt to check for solutions or close the program. Of course it stopped: I just closed it. Online searches, including at Microsoft, have presented nearly a dozen options, most specifically focused on add-ins. I accepted the "search online for solutions" option during a Word shutdown. Apparently Office found one, and the remedy took place across all applications. However, this error was *NOT* part of the user experience in the Office 2010 suite that I uninstalled 10 minutes before the switch to 2013...and users shouldn't expect the latest version to contain more annoyances (which is what this is) than its predecessor. Very unsatisfactory.  Office 2013 claims increased ease of handling graphics and editing .pdf documents. I've experimented with both, and in my opinion, the jury is still out.  I am extremely lucky in being able to obtain this product under an academic license via my employer for fraction of what "civilian" users must play. For the deep discount I enjoyed, this behavior is an annoyance. If I had paid full price for this, "annoyed" would be far too mild a way to describe my reaction.  This is a version suited only for users who insist on having the latest version of anything. If you want to continue to use your productivity applications in way you are accustomed to, I'd stick with 2010.  If I were running a Windows 8 computer with a touch screen, I'd start to consider this worth advancing from Office 2010. Check with your employer, professional organizations, non-profit or educational institution you may be affiliated with; they may have volume licensing arrangements with Microsoft that can make this much more affordable.  And, as always, you may be able to get the vast majority of your Office-like functions completed (including creating and editing Office file types) using the open-source --and *free*-- LibreOffice.	-1

No built in support for Avery paper apparently! WTF!?? Totally pissed.	-1
I've generally been bullish about the new features that Microsoft has added to each new Office version over the years. Sure sometimes they were smaller, but particularly in Excel the enhancements aways ended up being nice values adds (Spark Lines, enhancements to pivot tables, etc.). However this ground to a halt in the 2013 upgrade. The UI took a turn for the worse... it looks extremely bland, flat and empty... almost like a half build prototype than a polished product. The new licensing program is a terrible step backwards and should give most purchasers a great pause. The push into office 365 and cloud data is a confusing blur from Microsoft... even going to the Microsoft website and trying to find this product and what's in "Professional" versus other packages is a challenge.  Because of the licensing changes and the dumbed down interface it's hard to recommend this product.	-1
Hard to tell if I would actually recommend this upgrade/install option to someone.  I don't use everything in Office, so this will be a limited review  Pros - MS WORD: -I love the new look for the software - the full screen operations - looks nothing like standard Windows applications - very Windows 8. -Love the live layout and alignment guide to help you create a more professional document. -Love the table editing options (I've always hated table in Word). -No use for searching online videos or images as I use my own, but the smart art is brilliant. -Love the integration of screen capture. -Love the drop down history for levels of undo, but would prefer that it had an option to keep the future steps in case you selected one level too far back. -Like the option to use the comments when working on a document with another team member.  In Excel: -Love the Flash Fill -Love the Quick analysis -Love the recommended charts to save time in representing data  I could go on and on about the software, but at the end of the day, since this new license forces me to get a second copy for my laptop -- which I only use 12 weeks of the year -- I could easily do without all the bells and whistles and stick with my 2010 version or use Open Office.  In my mind, if MS is that concerned about shrinking margins or marketshare, then at least offer a $10-20 option to put on a second system instead of making the legitimate customers who actually buy the software go the route of buying a second copy.  Seems like one small step for MS and two backward steps for its customer base, as they walk away from their loyalty.	-1
If you have a touch screen computer then I would consider adding a star and making this a 3 star product, otherwise, Office Pro 2013 is only a 2 star product in my book.  First - the graphical interface, what we users see, is awful.  Someone decided to return to the stone ages in terms of screen contrast. Those with vision issues will likely find this software horrible to use due to the lack of visual contrast.  Second - the pricing scheme is awful.  Check with your employer to see if their mass quantity licensing offers a deal for a 'home use' edition,through the Microsoft Home Use Program (MicrosoftHUP - google it!)  In those cases you can usually find the legal and legitimate sourcing of this software at $9.95 - for up to three systems at home (if the rules haven't changed in the past couple years.) The Home Use Program is often available to employees of the federal government and larger corporations.  (Microsoft - what about the rest of us? We're the ones who NEED special programs for home use!)  Third - if you've already spent good money on this software (or got it cheap through the home use program), why should we have to pay extra for cloud access? Why are we forced to stare at a marketing logo within the valuable ribbon real estate? Again poor choice for us power users.  Fourth - why should I need to buy the software then rent it again in the cloud as Office 365? Microsoft - take notice - Many IT people are refusing to use cloud based programs. Many of us will remain with older, outdated programs than migrate to cloud based apps.  Fifth - There are ample open source Office type programs (such as open office or libreoffice or free office, etc.. there are quite a few legitimate options - again, google it!) as well as 2010 and 2007 still be available and very appropriate desktop solutions. For most home office use it seems wisest to use the free versions such as open office then upgrade to Microsoft when you *need* the extra features included in MS Office suite.  Sixth - what does 2013 really bring to the table that was not available in 2010 (or 2007 for that matter?)  Other than much improved touch screen support, nothing substantial was brought to the screen. Or the desktop. Except the cloud - which many of us do NOT want or cannot use due to our employer policies.  All in all until I truly need the improved touch screen capability I would avoid MS Office 2013 and stick with the tried and true Office 2010 (or 2007 even!), at least until another version or two have been released. If I didn't have access to those programs then I would opt for the freeware / shareware versions instead of spending a small fortune on 2013.  But if you must go with Office 2013 for whatever reason, then the install is pretty straight forward.  Go to office's website /setup, login to the MS account (or create one if you have not before) enter in the product key (found inside this box when purchased).  The install process is quite lengthy, but you can do other things (like update this review) while the humongous software package downloads and completes the install.  Plan on a solid hour that the computer will need to be powered on and attached to the Internet (a factor for us laptop users to keep in mind!)	-1
Microsoft Office is the leader in pro office suites. However, the licensing for 2013 was horrible, and for the most part, you can do all the important things with Google apps for absolutely free.	-1
I was never able to get this product to work. I attempted several times to set it up, but to no success. The product appeared to be a trial version. A horrible one at that. After several failed installation (which by the way crashed my operating system twice) attempts I finally got the product to install. And then it wanted the product key. I entered the product key that was provided in the package. The program said the product key was incorrect. I verified it and reentered it. It said it was wrong again. I re-verified and reentered the provided product key a 3rd time. The message "the product key entered is incorrect" presented itself again. I shrugged it off, re-verified the key as correct and reentered it. A message appeared stating that I have activated the program on too many devices and that I was no longer allowed to "install" the program and that I would be allotted 30 days as a trial period after which I would have to purchase a key. In the end, I never got the product to activate. The trial version was absolutely horrible. The program appears to be primitive and highly limited in its ability to function. Eventually I removed it as it loved to crash my Windows 7 operating system. On a scale from one to ten, I would give this product a negative eight. The only reason I didn't give it a negative ten is because it came in a fancy, pretty box	-1
I have been using zip software for years, all the way back to the DOS based pkzip. I started using WinZip a few years ago and found it quite pleasant. Along the way, though, I felt like WinZip was getting a bit annoying with upgrade prompts despite choosing NOT to have it do that. Nonetheless, it had features which I liked and needed (e.g. ISO file extraction) and I have stuck with it.  When I originally was given the opportunity to try this version, I did not catch it was the "Standard" version. I previously had the "Pro" version 16. My first problem came when it uninstalled my previous version and became confused with the licensing (which the whole way of activating & obtaining is ridiculous to begin with). After getting through this, it was then I discovered I had the "Standard" version and did not have the email and backup options. I looked up the difference and was surprised to discover this version runs $40 - wow, for that price, you ought to have everything a utility program such as this has to offer.  Needless to say, I have uninstalled this version and have gone back to my previous version and do not plan to upgrade again unless required for a newer OS in the future, or perhaps find an alternative product.	-1
First of all, if you are still using Windows XP or Vista you need not apply. MS Office 2013 and its component parts are not compatible with Windows XP or Vista. Windows 7 or Windows 8 are required for you to install this program.  While MS Publisher does have its quirks and limitations, I have used the 2010 version successfully for a couple of years to publish four-color newsletters and bulletins. It generally has a less steep learning curve than some other programs such as&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Serif-PagePlus/dp/B006PJIETE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Serif PagePlus</a>, and you can be up and running in a reasonably short time.  One of the advantages of Publisher was that it allowed you to print as a composite CMYK document which could then be sent to a print shop for four-color printing.  With version 2013 this feature has been removed and printing houses can no longer use a direct MS Publisher file for printing. There seems to be no workaround for this problem.  In addition to removing this feature and the HTML feature another reviewer commented on, the program is more of a pain to use than before. Just like other Microsoft "improvements" this program requires more steps to do everything than in previous editions. They have also failed to fix previous shortcomings, such as the ability to create keyboard macros.  All in all, "new and improved" is neither with this product. If you have an older version of Publisher that continues to work with whatever operating system you are using I encourage you to continue using it. If you have to upgrade, find a copy of Publisher 2010 (which is compatible with Windows 8) and leave this dog in the doghouse.	-1
The only device I wanted to use this on I wasn't able to so while I do like their computer antivirus products this one was not so great for me.	-1
Installation was seamless and that is all that earned this product two stars.  It was so aggravatingly difficult to make connections.  I ultimately decided that, in the interest of security, I won't access hotspots.  I will learn to work around my secure home and business networks.  Don't waste your money.	-1
I found Norton Hotspot Privacy to be way way too temperamental.  Although installation and setup were painless, establishing connections really tested my patients.  Things worked easily on my secure home network - where I don't need it - but on public networks establishing a secure connection was a real trial.  I nearly gave up as I set out to write this review at my local Starbucks and also when I tried to connect on a business trip stay over at a Days Inn.  I tried connecting to the local wireless network and then starting Hotspot.  I tried starting Hotspot and then connecting to the network.  I closed everything and started over both ways several times.  Nearly always the login for Norton would hang and then after logging in no other web pages would load.  So back to the on and off thing again and after a few more times I was able to get it to work.  Once it was working the overhead seemed reasonable and browsing didn't seem to slow much.  But adding on the substantial subscription price to the erratic connection issues makes me want to explore other options.	-1
I have had three computers brick with Windows 8.  Two were brand new laptops and one was a one and a half year old desktop PC.  All three had the same issue.  When booting up for the first time everything seemed to go fairly well, once logged in things were a little laggy and unstable and required updates.  Once the updates were almost all installed it began doing the required restarts and thats where the problems bagan.  Some of the updates were broken causing an infinate restart loop until eventually (sometimes days later) it would say there was an error installing updates reverting to previous installation.....that was good except for it never did revert and only stayed on the "reverting to previous version" screen forever.  I returned the two laptops for a refund and had to buy a new PC even microsoft support said to return them and they were toast.  Garbage.	-1
This is not merely not user friendly. It is "user hostile." I have been using computers since they first appeared and this is the worst software I have ever used. Period. My wife has it on her laptop and you can't even find applications in the start menu or in explorer. Hello, Microsoft?? Is anyone minding the brain? Just read a few reviews, and then consider a Mac. The term "mind numbing stupidity" comes to mind. I just installed our Office 2010, and there is no way to find the program, either through finder or start? What were they smoking when they created this?	-1
Windows "upgrades" are WORSE THAN USELESS.  I had to buy Windows 8 with my new tablet, and it is absolute trash-much harder to even access your desktop than with Windows 7, and it keeps slamming unwanted applications onto the screen when I try to access my desktop. Very user unfriendly.  When I had to get Windows 7 with a new computer, several programs I owned--including the rather costly Corel PhotoPaint--would not work. In other words, Microsoft essentially destroyed a couple of hundred dollars worth of software for me. The operating system has bugs too, e.g. when I try to select a default program to run a certain type of file, the "always use this program" box is grayed out.  Microsoft Office "upgrades" also are like throwing money down a sewer. The 2010 version of Excel does not do anything substantially different than the XP version, and actually has less functionality in terms of importing other kinds of files (e.g. Quattro Pro) than the XP version. The last thing I want to do is get Windows 8 or higher and then discover that Quattro Pro, which I have to use for my financial records (because I can't import the files in Excel) won't work any more. There are other problems as well, e.g. "Search my computer" NEVER works for the Help function in Office. It is clear that Microsoft is running on name recognition only rather than the quality of its products.	-1
I upgraded to Windows 8 because my Windows 7, which I generally liked, was repeatedly breaking down, possibly because of innumerable updates over the years. Windows 8 offered a brand new start and purported to also provide security enhancements. Since someone had also invaded my Hotmail account and was using it to send marketing pitches to others, I thought Windows would solve all my problems. Instead, it brought innumerable new headaches and frustrations, thanks to its confusing and difficult to learn interface . (I greatly prefer use of a keyboard and mouse instead of a touchscreen.)  Using Windows 8 is akin to decades-ago games such as Super Mario where one was constantly hunting for hidden coins or secret passages; in Windows 8 those coins/secret passages provide the means to access important screens and options. Unfortunately, they don't reliably appear even when one knows exactly where they're hidden. On the plus side, it is now easier to rid one's computer of Bing and replace it with Google, once and for all. Another negative, while hardly important, is that the new Solitaire is less user-friendly than the one that came with Windows 7.  The really good news is that I soon learned about Windows 8.1 - a much simpler and intuitive version that allows those used to desktop procedures to make use of their computers again without having to constantly refer to a 'How to' book.	-1
Even if you are upgrading from Windows XP, it makes very little sense to buy this.  If you are upgrading from Windows XP you can buy a new computer that is 20 to 50 times faster than your old computer and has enough memory (at least 4GB) to run newer programs more efficiently for 300 to 600 dollars.  You get Windows 8 included!  If you are upgrading from Windows 7, you actually lose the functionality of Windows Media Center since it is not included in Windows 8.  You would have to buy Windows 8 Pro Pack for another 89 dollars to get that functionality.  Since Windows 8.1 will address the Start Menu fiasco and will make keyboard and mouse navigation a little bit easier, you could buy this.  I would wait for the Black Friday and Christmas season for specials on Windows 8.1.  There will also probably be promotions after Windows 8.1's release around October 17th.  I do not recommend Windows 8 or 8.1 as an upgrade until Windows Media Center is included as part of the system.  I run two home entertainment computers and without Windows Media Center, they are useless.  Since you are actually losing functionality if you upgrade to Windows 8 from Windows 7, the only real benefit is an "arguably" slightly faster operating system and a few stray benefits such as Skydrive.  The tiled look is fine for phones and tablets, but you want productivity and an operating system built for a pc, not one built for a tablet or phone.	-1
Windows 8 is the poor and inferior OS (Operating System). I will describe it in detail below.  First of all, when I turned on my PC, a strange unfamiliar screen was displayed. Additionally, speed of my mouse was too fast. So I wanted to change the speed. But, the control panel did not exist anywhere. And then, I entered words "control panel" into search bar. But, there was no search result. Similar faults exist very much. It is unbelievable. It is no longer OS. By the way, control panel was hidden in the deep and deep back.  Additionally, the notorious interface "Ribbon" (adopted into Microsoft Office series) was adopted widely. For example, explorer.  Other contents are as same as Windows 7. In other words, Windows 8 is aggravated edition of interface of Windows 7. I bet that Windows 8 never spread from now on. Windows 8 must be steadily falling like Windows ME or Vista. So, you should not purchase Windows 8. I downgraded Windows 8 to Windows 7 quickly.	-1
I usually don't do OS upgrades, but I wanted to give this a try to see if Windows 8 would breathe some new life into my laptop. The installation was not difficult, but it did take awhile. Once it was done, I was confronted with the new Metro interface. It was mostly downhill from there. It goes without saying that Windows 8 is geared more towards tablets than it is towards desktop PCs. That is not the biggest issue that I have with Windows 8 though. The main issue that I had was that it seems that for some reason they made tasks that were easy to preform in Windows 7 a pain to preform in Windows 8.  Getting to the control panel is more of a challenge than it should be. It used to take only two clicks to get there. In Windows 8 it takes considerably more effort. In the old Start Menu, you could simply type the name of the program that you wanted to open in the search file and folders field. In Windows 8, one you use the "charms bar" to get to the search field. The search field is divided separately into apps, settings, etc.. This means that you can do a search for a setting (like backup for example), and you will get no results. You have to select settings from the search options for the correct items to show up. This means that you could miss a setting or an app if you don't have the right option selected. That is a big change from the unified search that was in Windows 7.  I hear that Windows 8.1 will fix a lot of the usability issues reported in Windows 8. I sure hope so. Otherwise I would not recommend it to Windows users unless you got it by default in a new PC purchase.	-1
By now we've all heard about the horrors of Windows 8 and I'd have never bought it.  But... I got a chance at a free copy so I jumped on it.  It took a while for me to warm to Windows 7, I thought maybe the same would apply to Windows 8.  I first played with Win8 on a Microsoft Surface tablet PC.  It seemed like Windows reworked for a tablet form factor.  OK, that makes sense. Mostly though, I found it annoying because I couldn't find things.  Nothing was where it was supposed to be.  Configuring and setting up was a pain.  I loaded this version onto a small desktop and tried to use it.  It loaded easily and runs fine, I guess.  The problem is that I don't like to use that computer.  I know where things are in Win7.  I have a working relationship with Win7.  Why oh why did Microsoft decide that I needed to learn yet another way to get things done?  Why did MS decide my old work patterns should change?  I'm hoping that Win8 grows on me.  Maybe it will.  he problem is that I don't -need- to shift to Win8.  Five years ago, I had to stick with whatever Microsoft did.  Now I think I have options.  For example, I'm currently writing this review on a chrome book using google docs.  Years ago I'd have fired up MS word.  Anyways, I'm going to try using Win8 on that computer and I might get to liking it.  Someday, but certainly not now.  I'm sure Win8 is wonderful for someone's first computer, but I'm all trained up on previous  versions.  Using and learning Win8, to me, reduces my productivity.	-1
I won't summarize all of the problems with Windows 8. Many of the other reviews have already done that. The interface is needlessly cumbersome and really adds nothing to the experience. I'll just mention a few problems that have come up when using Windows 8 on a Mac with Bootcamp.  First, the screen is set to an extremely dim mode. When using Windows 8, you can barely see the screen. There is a way to fix this in the Control Panels option (you have to disable auto-brightness), but the fact that nobody at Microsoft even thought that a barely visible screen was a problem is worrying.  Second, there are no drivers for wireless internet with Windows 8 when used on Bootcamp. I can't even connect to the internet! Again, given the number of people who use Windows on a Mac, this seems like a major oversight. There is a way to fix it, but it's pretty complicated and frankly it's easier just to restore Windows 7.  Overall, do not upgrade to Windows 8, especially if you're using it on a Mac!	-1
Windows 8 is an absolute disaster.  The desktop is now a confusing morass.  There is simply nothing about this OS that is an upgrade over Windows 7, and in many ways it is far worse.	-1
Sadly, Windows 8 is probably more maligned than it ought to be. In situations that call for more limited input and minimal multitasking (like a tablet or HTPC), Windows 8 actually works fairly well. The issue comes when Microsoft basically forced it onto the desktop workspace, and the fact is that Windows 8 just isn't a desktop OS. The start button is gone, the desktop that we're used to is neutered (really what makes Windows, well, Windows), the native Windows 8 apps are full-screen affairs and as far as the UI goes, it just seems like a major step backward for those who actually work on a PC. Windows 8 basically makes you take a hop, step and a jump where would cold just turn and step in Windows 7. Productivity takes a hit. This is why the businesses aren't adopting it, and that's why Windows 8 is failing.  It works well enough on tablets and HTPC's (IMHO), but I had to dock it an extra star because I've had nothing but bad luck with it. My HTPC was running Windows 7 Pro, so I opted to use the upgrade there. I had to basically erase everything and start fresh with the upgrade, but that's frankly how I prefer to do it anyways. The upgrade process went smoothly and was less time-consuming than I would have guessed. All but one driver was installed, and the OS was running well. I started to install my apps and standard desktop programs without a hitch. So far so good. The next day, I fired it up to continue downloading some things and play a game on Steam only to have the system bluescreen on me. That isn't that big a deal, in and of itself (not my first rodeo with Windows OS'es...bluescreens are almost a certainty at some point), but the options available to deal with it are vague at best (guessing the "Refresh" is akin to the Repair Install in Windows XP, while the full Reset is a more traditional Windows reinstall since it gets rid of whatever you have on the PC). The fact that none of them worked is also disappointing.  So here I am, with a nonfunctional PC that had been fine for a couple of years using Windows 7. That in and of itself isn't a condemnation of the Windows 8 OS (again, kind of used to it by this point), but the fact that the OS itself is so NOT compelling that I'm strongly considering going back to 7 probably is. As it now stands, I can't really think of a single compelling reason to upgrade to Windows 8, especially on a traditional desktop or non-touch-enabled laptop. Windows 8 simply wasn't designed with those platforms (the vast majority of the PC market, mind you) in-mind.  UPDATE: Ultimately, the issue that I was having was due to a bad hard drive, so I can't fault Windows 8 for that. Once I received the replacement from Western Digital, I reinstalled Windows 8, and this time all went well. Well, that's not entirely correct...everything went well until activation. It wouldn't work...at all. I searched and saw that this has been an ongoing issue since Windows 8 was in public beta, and it still has not been resolved. Luckily for me, the (overly) tedious phone activation did work, but that shouldn't be necessary. And yes, my wireless network adaptor and router are working properly (it also wouldn't activate over a wired connection).  The PC worked well enough, until this morning. Steam works, Diablo III installed without a hitch, all of my standard apps. As far as compatibility goes, it's been great. I turn on the PC today, only to see that it needs to restart due to updates. Ok...that's typical Microsoft there, so I restart. Nothing. The system posts, Windows 8 begins to boot and then goes to a black screen...that's it. Apparently this is another ongoing issue, and after pressing F8 to go into the repair process, Windows tells me that my system is unable to boot properly (thanks for the tip...). It tells me that it's going to do a restore, and it does. My system starts. That's all fine and good, but I'm growing a bit weary of hoop-jumping. It's obvious to me that Windows 8 isn't ready for prime-time. It's got all of the typical bugs that typify a Microsoft OS. Once those are out of the way and once Microsoft repairs the neutered desktop, Windows 8 might be something to consider, but as things are, you'd do better to wait. Unless you really, REALLY like the Modern (Metro UI) and/or half-baked apps, there's no real reason to upgrade to Windows 8.  UPDATE: I'm done Microsoft. The PC had been running normally until this morning. Upon booting, I notice that I have no connectivity, so I go to troubleshoot my wireless connection. Windows crashes...hard. The PC restarts, and I can tell something is wrong, because it's taking forever. Long story short (and three hours worth of repair attempts later), and I've made my decision to go back to Windows 7. The repairs don't work, the new "frowny" BSoD's give precious little information (no error codes, just Microsoft's condolences and a vague error message telling me that my system configuration information was bad...yay). I just want a computer that works, and the only thing I use this PC for is gaming and the occasional movie (have it in the living room). So far, Windows 8 has been a nightmare. Maybe I'll give it another chance once Blue/8.1 hits, but until then, I'm reverting to Windows 7 for my sanity's sake. And that drops my rating to one...same as any other product that can't be used as-advertised.	-1
Its bad...very bad.  The User interface is a total split personality mess.  The start screen apps do not have any communication or sync with the desktop versions at all, making the app versions just useless compared to the full version on the desktop.  The whole tile thing on a PC is just ugly to look at and disorganized.  Again the app versions are useless and unneeded as you have the fully functional versions on your desktop so who the hell wants the half baked, limited phone app version with half the features.  Why ahve two versions on internet explorer?  Well the desktop version sucks and you will be seeing "internet explorer has stopped working", script errors and bugs ALOT!  If I want to watch youtube for example I will use the app version of IE simpky because it lasts longer before crashing than the desktop version.  Windows defender has been improved which is a good thing, there is a malicious software detector scan that you can use from microsoft.com why it wasn't included in the OS is beyond me you shouldn't have to go to microsoft.com everytime you want to scan..?  There is no DVD/blue-ray playback support or player, you will have to download a third party one which is beyond stupid, I installed Windows Media Player but it takes forever to load and crashes like nascar.  The upgrade process was decent and it preserved my files like I asked it too, the new charms bar is very weak and unless you have a touch screen you will have no need to use it, it just makes windows phone like and harder to navigate.  Windows 10 looks like it might be ok but again they just stuck the useless start screen in the start button menu now rather than get rid of it and the half baked useless app versions of your already installed programs on your desktop....so it still has the split personality complex going on.  Overall not as buggy or unstable as Vista/ME but a mess of an OS.  I have had three computers brick with Windows 8.  Two were brand new laptops and one was a one and a half year old desktop PC.  All three had the same issue.  When booting up for the first time everything seemed to go fairly well, once logged in things were a little laggy and unstable and required updates.  Once the updates were almost all installed it began doing the required restarts and thats where the problems bagan.  Some of the updates were broken causing an infinate restart loop until eventually (sometimes days later) it would say there was an error installing updates reverting to previous installation.....that was good except for it never did revert and only stayed on the "reverting to previous version" screen forever.  I returned the two laptops for a refund and had to buy a new PC even microsoft support said to return them and they were toast.  Garbage.  *Update:  Windows 10 is the worst os ever made, if you have Windows 8 go as far as 8.1 then stop..  If you see updates with Diagnostics or windows 10 in them check them and for the most part do not install them as it will only add Windows 10's spyware to your Windows 8.1/7 operating system.	-1
I do not recommend the Windows 8 upgrade because :  (1) Before upgrading to Windows 8, it is recommended that you download and run the Windows 8 Upgrade Assistant. It scans your computer to provide a compatibility report etc. There are different versions of windows 8, like RT(on PDA and tablets), 32 bit, 64 bit etc.  (2)You may have to spend money to upgrade your computer's components to meet the minimum requirements to run Windows 8.   (a) 1 GHz or faster processor with support for PAE, NX, and SSE2   (b) 1 GB (32-bit) or 2 GB (64-bit) RAM   (c) 16 GB (32-bit) or 20 GB (64-bit) hard drive   (d) DirectX 9 graphics device with WDDM driver   (e) Screen or monitor that supports multitouch to use the touchscreen features.   You may also have to download and install new drivers for different components. It is easier and usually less expensive to buy a new computer with Windows 8 installed, for around $250, than to upgrade different components and software.  (3) Too many bugs in Windows 8, leading to too many and too often updates, over 110. My computer is downloading and installing updates every few days. Imagine you boot up to try to use software ZZZ, but the screen says it is checking for, downloading, installing, configuring updates and restarting, the hard drive is spinning, you can not do anything but wait for it to finish. It can be 30 minutes to almost 2 hours. I am disgusted and turn auto-update off.  (4) Parts of many software that run on Windows older than 8, may not run properly on Windows 8. Many software simply do not run on Windows 8 RT and Windows 8 64 bit. That means you must spend more money to upgrade to the latest versions of application software, assuming they will run in Windows 8 without problems. Adobe Flash Player 11.8 crashes in Windows 8, but not version 10.3.  (5) The new internet explorer on the tiled Start Screen is full of bugs. You encounter disappearing address bar, screens, sudden zoom in, zoom out etc. I end up using the old x86 internet explorer (32 bit) on desktop, or Firefox. Many software included with Windows 8 like Internet Explorer, Paint, Wordpad etc are full of bugs and exclude nice options like "Undo", available in older versions of the same software.  (6) I am a computer programmer. I notice some of the menu choices do nothing when clicked on. In the past, I have been told to put a lot of menu choices or options on the screen even though the codes to execute those options are not included because they have not been written or do not work as yet. Many companies do that to mislead consumers into believing that their software can do many more tasks than they actually can.  (7) To shut the computer down or restart, you have to move the cursor to top right edge of screen. Click on settings bar on right when it appears. click on Power when it appears. Click on shut down when it appears. That involves 4 steps. It also takes longer to shut down.  (8) Devices that work with older versions of Windows (XP, Vista,7) may not work properly with Windows 8, causing freeze ups, non-recognition etc.  (9) Parts of many websites like [...] have frozen up, did not work and so on.  (10) Need at least a few weeks, to learn to do the same things in new ways etc.  (11) Wait until year 2015 or after to buy, give Microsoft, software and device manufactures time to fix the bugs and update the drivers for Windows 8.  It takes time to research these information. Please click "Yes" below this line if this review was helpful to you.	-1
We have 3 Windows 8 systems.  A Dell 8500 Desktop and Asus notebook were purchased with Windows 8 and a Sony Laptop was upgraded to Windows 8 from Windows 7.  After about 3 months of work in my spare time, my opinion is that Windows 8 with Outlook, Hotmail, Live Id and Microsoft Account are totally unusable.  We were very happy with Windows 7 and MSN email.  It has been impossible for me to get our three systems to provide the same usable function that the Windows 7 Systems provided.  Because of the password security system, and its unpredictable results when interfacing, I have had to restore the Dell Desktop, and Asus notebook to factory defaults.  Even after doing that, I spent about 6 hours trying to get an email system to work on the notebook.  We still do not have a workable email system on any of the 3 systems.  The contact list is there for only one email address.  My wife is so frustrated that she is in tears every time she tries to do the three simple functions that she wants on her Asus.  I have tried to reinstall Windows 7 on the Sony but it would not install.  Most of the comments on the internet do not recommend installing Windows 7 on a System that came pre-installed with Windows 8.	-1
I was FORCED, that's right, FORCED to rent this software.  The word, "forced" means slightly different things to different people. To some, forced means that you are being threatened of being dropped into a live volcano. To others, forced means there are no viable options.  The latter definition is what I mean.  I had been successfully using Office 2011 on 3 different computers.  I purchased a physical disc, (always the best way to buy software) from Amazon. The disc that I purchased included 3, Installs.  Shockingly, (and uniquely) if you upgrade, or otherwise must change your hard drive on your computer that counts as a NEW installation to Microsoft!  So, when my mechanical hard drive started showing signs of difficulty I replaced it with a solid-state drive. This only takes about 30 seconds on a Mac Pro tower.  About 40 different applications all worked perfectly and flawlessly after installing the new hard drive, EXCEPT for Microsoft Office.  ONLY Microsoft asked again for my software key. I have this key, but it would not work.  I spent about 2 hours with Microsoft trying to get the key to work.  I was told I had to RE-PURCHASE Office.  With Apple, once you purchase their software you can reinstall it as needed over and over again without limit.  With Microsoft, any repair or upgrade to your computer is likely to result in your software becoming useless.  Also, with subscription-based software, you are totally dependent upon the company's existence, and support of that software in order to continue using it.  Also, after installing Office 365 I learned that it defaulted to saving MY files on Microsoft servers. For security and privacy reasons I do not want to use the cloud at all. It appears, there is no way to shut off my Microsoft cloud account. (Yes, there is a way to save the document locally, assuming you remember to do this.)  I am aware of the various free options to Microsoft Office.  Some people are happy with these, others are not, I did not consider this to be a viable option.  I consider Microsofts installation policy to be anti-consumer and hyper unfriendly.  I purchased Office to run on 3 computers, Microsoft is not allowing me to do this.	-1
It's so hideous as to be practically unusable. Anything else it offers is moot. Acres of bland, white wasted space. Do they think everybody has a 4k monitor?? Did they forget how to utilize the colors offered by graphics cards made in the last 25 years?	-1
This is a software for you to rent each year instead purchase for permanent use. I know some tablets, such as my new Surface 3 came with 1-year free promotional Office 365, but I still prefer to use Office Professional 2010 and 2013. They are not subjected to annual payment and work as good as Office 365. No one is going to use office software on 5 devices so this might be good for cost share family members. That's why 2-star instead of 1-star is rated for the product.	-1
My employer just upgraded to this and it's absolutely awful, I'm going to have to see if I can convince IT to let me go back to Office 2010. I didn't like the ribbon interface when it came out and after all these years I still find it cumbersome but at least it doesn't make my eyes hurt. Office 2013 is full of glaring white space wasting huge amounts of screen space. There is practically no contrast anywhere and it just looks like a sea of text on a drab white background. Has Microsoft lost their mind? I've seen better UI designs on beta software and open source junk from 15 years ago.	-1
If you have to pay the full retail price, Office 2013 does not offer enough improvements to take on the hassle of moving to the new version (which I deliberately did not call "upgrading"). If you are already using the Office 2010 suite, deliberate carefully about both the cash outlay and the tweaking it will take to get you back to the customizations you like.  I installed Office 2013 Professional on an ASUS laptop computer with a recently re-installed Windows 7 (Home Premium) OS, a 1.3 GHZ processor and 4 GB RAM (64-bit environment).  At installation, I was promoted to first remove my existing Office 2010 suite. After doing so, installation of Office 2013 took approximately 10 minutes. Although cosmetic changes appear in the user interface (mostly in a "flattening" of controls on the toolbars), the overall presentation will be familiar to users of Office 2010.  Hint: if you have many commands placed in your Office 2010 applications Quick Access Toolbars, export them before you uninstall. You can later import them into the 2013 programs. Why this couldn't be scripted into the 2013 install process (along with removal of the earlier version) is another question.  Microsoft claims an array of new features in Office 2013. The biggest one that is readily apparent is that Microsoft would love for you to join them on the cloud via its online SkyDrive and Office 365 subscription services. Oh please. I already bought the productivity suite, and could have done without the additional marketing. Plus: every single time you look at the Office Ribbon, the big "Sign In" button will be visible on the right side. Bad idea, Office team: please don't add clutter to an already complicated user interface.  Newly installed programs installed in a recently refreshed operating system should work flawlessly. The user experience while working with various Office suite data files (primarily Excel, Word, PowerPoint and Access for me) is basically the same as with 2013. Immediately after installation, every time I closed an application, Office offered a "...(application name) has stopped working" and the usual MS prompt to check for solutions or close the program. Of course it stopped: I just closed it. Online searches, including at Microsoft, have presented nearly a dozen options, most specifically focused on add-ins. I accepted the "search online for solutions" option during a Word shutdown. Apparently Office found one, and the remedy took place across all applications. However, this error was *NOT* part of the user experience in the Office 2010 suite that I uninstalled 10 minutes before the switch to 2013...and users shouldn't expect the latest version to contain more annoyances (which is what this is) than its predecessor. Very unsatisfactory.  Office 2013 claims increased ease of handling graphics and editing .pdf documents. I've experimented with both, and in my opinion, the jury is still out.  I am extremely lucky in being able to obtain this product under an academic license via my employer for fraction of what "civilian" users must play. For the deep discount I enjoyed, this behavior is an annoyance. If I had paid full price for this, "annoyed" would be far too mild a way to describe my reaction.  This is a version suited only for users who insist on having the latest version of anything. If you want to continue to use your productivity applications in way you are accustomed to, I'd stick with 2010.  If I were running a Windows 8 computer with a touch screen, I'd start to consider this worth advancing from Office 2010. Check with your employer, professional organizations, non-profit or educational institution you may be affiliated with; they may have volume licensing arrangements with Microsoft that can make this much more affordable.  And, as always, you may be able to get the vast majority of your Office-like functions completed (including creating and editing Office file types) using the open-source --and *free*-- LibreOffice.	-1
Office 365 is a kiddie cartoon not a business set of applications.  The people who developed this have no idea of how a business operates.  Many subtle but useful features have been removed and it takes longer to do simple tasks.  In today's demanding environment we need fast efficient programs, not cute multiple mouse click let's remove the keyboard short cuts cartoon programs.  I was a huge Microsoft fan but they created a nightmare with this.	-1
This is old, old, old software marketed as new stuff.  I've been ripped off. This, like everything else Microsoft touches these days, from the Ford Fusion's sync, through Windows 8, etc, is nothing but junk peddled on the rest of us so Microsoft can survive economically.  It is a has-been company as far as I'm concerned. :-(	-1
I recently was "upgraded" to Office 2013 and I wanted to post my evaluation for anyone considering such a move.  I primarily use Outlook, Excel, Powerpoint, and Word on my work laptop.  Outlook is slow and buggy.  Problems I've encountered are lock ups as well as odd issues like my signature sometimes not working correctly.  Excel seems largely OK but certainly no better than before.  Word is a bit harder to use than before as they constantly feel the need to move stuff around.  Powerpoint is an absolute disaster.  I've had more Powerpoint crashes since "upgrading" than my lifetime total prior to the changes.  Stability is clearly not a priority for the Powerpoint team.  Funny enough I was told by IT that this is a known issue and they sent me a link on how to fix it on the Microsoft website.  The link on Microsoft's own website to the "solution" was broken.  These guys are clearly a joke.  If you can avoid this "upgrade" I'd highly suggest it.  For my personal laptop I continue to use LibreOffice with no issues and it's free.	-1
The software itself may be fine (I've used the Professional version on my own home systems and have no real issues with that product) but the lack of any -- as in none, zero, zilch, nada -- customization options during the install of this product and the incredibly frustrating process of activating (the activation process) for this particular version (Home and Business 2013 - Retail box) of Office make it NOT RECOMMENDABLE for anyone's purchase and use, most especially not for use in an environment with multiple systems.  Sadly, it seems that Microsoft absolutely intends this product for use for a HOME user, or a small business user who is working from home -- which, uh, tells me that they don't quite understand the meaning of the words "and Business" when they use it as part of the product name.  Apparently they are, yet again, apparently trying to change the meaning of the words here.  Any BUSINESS, and especially any CORPORATE user should be looking into the mystifying world of Volume Licensed products and the joy that is getting those products installed.  Hopefully it would be easier than the nightmare that this particular retail packaged offering includes.  Until Microsoft digs their head out of their nether regions this one goes to the top of pile of products to avoid, at least as packaged here.	-1
Office 2013 has the annoying requirement that one must have a Microsoft Account to install it. This feels like an intrusion. The lack of a CD version is an alarming omission. Many other reviews have mentioned licensing to one system which finally got changed somewhat. All these things make purchasing office less attractive and subscribing to&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Office-365/dp/B00DG6IW3M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Office 365</a>&nbsp;more so by comparison.  I feel this is the a strategy to migrate Microsoft's purchased software model to a subscription only model. That way we subscribe and effectively purchase a new copy every 2 years or less via the monthly subscription charges.  The product itself is a continuation of the MS strategy toward touch and tablet oriented interfaces which started with the "ribbon" in&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Office-2007/dp/B000HCXKKS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Office 2007</a>, continued in&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Office-2010/dp/B0036Z0NZI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Office 2010</a>&nbsp;and now is further along with office 2013. For me the ribbon takes up more screen space leaving less for my documents and is a "busy" interface compared to menus making it more difficult to find what I want among the clutter. I don't care so much for the ribbon but I have come to peace with it.  As for getting things done - word, excel, outlook, powerpoint, etc. all work and accomplish their tasks. It's not a lot better than office 2007 or later. Building a new system I'd get office 2013, but I would not bother upgrading.  A particular point of trouble is Outlook. Each version of outlook and even patches break our some 3rd party plugins and connectors. This is very annoying and we hate this. While it may not be the actual case it feels like a MS strategy to make exchange look better than some very good 3rd party groupware while pretending to be open.  I've tried alternatives like open office or wordperfect and still always come back to office which is entrenched so deeply in the marketplace. Like an annoying habit I'm stuck with MS office and it does get the job done so 2 stars - it almost okay I guess.	-1
Crappy software for a crappy Operating System that is Windows 8. Too buggy, can't search correctly, won't save sometimes, won't highlight cells sometimes, keeps crashing and making me lose my data.	-1
Looking at this product and Windows 8 things are really going a route where the buyer is force fed the Microsoft diet. This product makes your every day work more difficult. If your hard drive goes and you need to download this thing even on a fast connection good luck. It took us over 90 minutes on a high speed connection in NYC to get the full download. The pricing is ridiculous. The installation gives you no options.	-1
IMPORTANT UPDATE 5/23/13  OUTLOOK HAS SUDDENLY STARTED DELETING EMAILS BY ITSELF.  MOVING EMAILS FROM THE INBOX TO A LOCAL FOLDER CAUSES THE EMAIL TO DISAPPEAR, NOT GO TO DELETE FOLDER, BUT GONE FOREVER.  WE HAVE LOST CRITICAL DATA.  DO NOT TRUST THIS PRODUCT!  Had to upgrade my wife's office from XP to win 7 (NOTE: Win 8 is NOT business friendly, WAY too steep a learning curve).  Had to upgrade from Office 2007 to 2013 pro too.  WORST MISTAKE EVER!  Office productivity is at an all time low because NO ONE can navigate through the suite due to unintuitive command grouping and placement.  The color scheme (white, light gray, medium gray) is giving everyone headaches due to eye strain.  I get 2-3 calls daily asking for help with what should be basic stuff.  Microsoft Team: If you read this and dare to reply be advised that you have dropped the ball with this one.  Don't you dare try to tell me that you really improved this product because 5 out of 5 people in my wife's office agree that after a month of enduring this software they despise this product and wish we could go back to Office 2007.  If possible I would give a negative 5 rating.	-1
I've always been excited about new versions of Microsoft Office. This is a big exception. In this version Microsoft stripped out the Windows Aero graphic effects and replaced it with minimalist white space and ugly modern art icons, so the menu labels appear lost and disorganized with harsh contrast. A lot of people say it even causes headaches. Did Microsoft perform ANY user testing on the butchered user interface? Previously Microsoft Office 2010 was my favorite software, but I hate this version. I ended up uninstalling Office 2013 and going back to Office 2010.	-1
Fist, there is not much new here and it isn't worth the price in my opinion.  I run both 2007 and 2010.  The licensing terms are so poor, no one should consider buying this.  It is for this reason, I switched my business to Google Apps.  They just work, they are inexpensive and they are constantly being enhanced.  Why Steve Ballmer still has a job is beyond me.	-1
I have a new laptop computer that does not have MC office on it yet. I went to Amazon to purchase a copy of the Home Office for $114 for one download on one machine. This is the new 2013 edition, since my wife is a teacher I want her to stay in front of the technology curve. The long and the short of a 12 hour saga is this: Could not download product from MS server, about 4 hours. Involved, e-mail MS no response. Email Amazon for help, email I received back from Amazon told be to contact MS for assistance. (Starting to sound familiar) Amazon said they would have someone from MS call me, since this was not their problem, which both Amazon and MS had someone call. I am sorry the gentlemen from MS I could just not understand and he could not understand me and kept misunderstanding letter sounds in the product key, we had to go through this experience for at least 6 trials. In frustration I must admit I gave up to keep my composure. It is now back to Amazon, since they were acting as a Micro Soft agent at the point of sales. Will one of these large companies make this "right" or just say its only $115 what the heck, let's go have a beer Omar ?	-1
If you are still using Office 2007 or older then this is a upgrade to consider but there are a few issues with this version of office. The installer seems to run in silent mode so you may find yourself trying to run the installer more than once.  Also, when applications start up they are SUPER SLOW.  Probably because they are connecting to the web.  Bit it can be annoying.  There are a lot of usability tweaks that make this much easier.  A lot of the bigger software company's including Microsoft are moving to a Monthly/Yearly subscription licensing model.  So this may be the last version of Office you can buy outright.  Other than being able to edit PDF files, there aren't a lot of compelling reasons to upgrade from Office 2010. If you are considering buying this for your kids to use for school I think it's a decent investment because they will probably use this software once they get to College and the workforce.  ===========2013 Issues ===========  ===========2013 IMPROVEMENTS================  * Toolbar Style improvements to make the menus less distracting and consume fewer computer resources * Saves to SkyDrive by default do your files are saved online (see tip to change below) * Touch-screen and tablet PC friendly * WORD 2013 -> "Read Mode" lets you read Word documents like a e-Book Reader (how come they didn't think of this sooner?) * WORD 2013 -> Save and Edit PDF files.

Once again those monopolistic marketing weasels at M$ are trying to pull a fast one.  One-time purchase for life of PC.  What this means is,if you buy for your older system and say in a year or two you upgrade because it broke or was stolen,you can't reinstall it because it is locked to the original hardware.  M$ wants to force you into a subscription model now.  As the saying goes ,a rat is a rat is a rat.  This monopoly should have been busted up when they had the chance!	-1
I have, until now, purchased each new edition of Office Home and Student for our 3 computers.  That ends with this edition. No way will we buy 3 copies.  We will be using the old 2010 Office and free Open Office programs from now on, or, possibly, switching to Apple products the next time we buy computers. The Apple is more expensive, but applications much more reasonable with family-friendly sharing.  Microsoft seems determined to keep losing ground to their competitors.  By the way, if you haven't tried Open Office (<...>)or LibreOffice (<...>) an almost identical free program, give them a serious look.  You can do just about everything you can do in MS Office and save it in MS Office formats.  Since it is free, you can also save a document in the Open/Libre Office format and send it to friends who can also download the free program to read and edit.  Open/Libre Office also includes a database and drawing program in addition to the usual word processing, spreadsheet, and presentation programs.  Both programs are also available for Mac computers. Google Docs is another free option for simple documents, but doesn't offer many formatting or custom options.  It is, however, great for interactive collaborative projects.	-1
I do like the product but the upgrade has been less than stellar.  I already had Norton 360 on my account and supposedly the remaining 87 days would be added to the 365 of this license.  Did not happen, just have the 365 days.  My backup, which was working fine, no longer works.  When I try to activate it, I get an error message than my account is not available.  Busy now, but if the back-up does not clear up I plan to delete and re-install and hope that will fix it.  But you wouldn't think an upgrade would be this difficult.	-1
I ran the basic scans, and then ran a "quick" defragmentation.  After the computer rebooted, it became completely unusable.  It's hard to imagine how a product could be a bigger failure!  Since Amazon insists on not being mean with these reviews, I would strongly advise consumers to look elsewhere for their software needs!!!!!  (Was that too harsh for the censors????)	-1
Customers should be very careful with this product.  It has some very handy features but they come bundled with some nasty surprises.  I consider myself to be a long-standing highly-experienced computer user.  I starting building home-brew computers in the mid 70s.  However, I did not anticipate that this version of Norton Utilities would wreak such damage to my computer settings.  Of course, many cookies are intrusive and dangerous and should be deleted.  But many cookies are extremely valuable -- on a secure home computer.  This version of Norton Utilities deleted every cookie (good, bad, and in between) without ever asking whether I might want to keep any.  In addition, it added an extension to my browser that slowed it to a crawl.  The resulting page would have no formatting.  If I refreshed the page the formatting would appear.  Also, my Quicken passwords have suddenly disappeared.  I have taught thousands of university-level computer science students.  I am embarrassed at the number of my C students who have graduated and are now producing commercial software.  However, this version of Norton would not get a passing grade.   Quoting Dante: "lasciate ogni speranza voi ch'entrate"	-1
I never ordered this!	-1
I installed Norton Utilities 16.0 from the CD and the install went fine. Then, I ran the 1-click system optimization/health thing... it found some registry problems, as I expected and had it fix them. Unfortunately it also decided that some things I did not want deleted should be... all histories from all applications, etc. I like to use my 'recent' files selections in many apps. Well, they were all gone. Not just internet browsing history, that would be fine. But last files used in Photoshop, in Word, etc. NOT okay.  Then it said I should defrag the HDs, and when I said to do that, I got a popup warning that 'speed disk' (which I assume is defragmentation??) will delete ALL Windows System Restore points. So, I said, stop. There is NO reason whatsoever to delete system restore points, rather, it should CREATE them before running any sort of fix. I couldn't find any way to do a defrag without the deletions.  I tried the 'find duplicate files'. It was totally indiscriminate, finding files which are shared and parts of applications. It found thousands. No way was I going to go through that list to see what should be removed and what should stay. And there was no way that I could find to do an advanced search - to exclude certain types. There was a minimal search modifier, but it was grossly insufficient.  I suppose this might be good for someone who has no idea what to do with their computer, and doesn't really use it much. But for anyone who is a heavy user (I work on my machine from home) this won't do the trick, and in my opinion, could actually make problems worse if you don't have knowledge that is NOT provided with the utilities.	-1
Back in the day I used to love Norton Utilities.  It has been about 10 years since I tried it and I was thinking that my startup was getting slow, so I decided to buy it. I found out that it didn't really help any with my startup and it was a pain in that it would delete all of my internet settings everyday.  This had some weird impacts such as my shopping sites losing my information, my browser losing my basic settings, being constantly asked if I would like the site to remember my settings, etc.  Anyway, I could extend the time between "cleanings"  but this was the only thing besides defragging the hard drive that I could discern that the program did.  It isn't worth the trouble.	-1
I used Norton Utilities regularly until about 5 years ago.  I got this and installed it.  Not sure what it did exactly, except it slowed my system horribly, and disrupted my browser (IE8).  I couldn't tolerate it anymore, so I uninstalled it.	-1
I've used various Norton products since the 1990s and have used their utilities/tools packages before.  However, their software became increasingly demanding on system resources and sometimes caused problems for other programs.  So I started trying other products, like Registry Mechanic and iolo lab's System Mechanic.  I was interested in trying this latest version of Norton out after using competing products for the last several years.  It didn't win me back over.  I find the iolo System Mechanic interface easier to navigate, and their software doesn't cause any problems.  Norton's package, on the other hand, sometimes seems to go too far when it cleans things up, causing problems.  For example, I set Norton's latest loose on a three-year old build recently.  (I build my own PCs.)  It's an AMD Phenom II 965BE-based machine running Windows 7 Professional.  I allowed Norton Utilities to make some of its suggested changes.  Then various programs stopped working.  Norton deleted several .dll files that it contended were extraneous.  However, programs needed them.  Adobe Reader stopped working, among others.  I had to repair several program installations after allowing Norton to savage my system.  I never had a similar problem with System Mechanic or Registry Mechanic.  Worse, I have a SSD (solid state drive) in that build.  Norton Utilities wants to defragment it!  You don't defragment SSDs.  iolo lab's software recognizes SSDs, treats them appropriately, and can even perform proper optimization on them.  Norton, on the other hand, wants to treat SSDs like mechanical hard disks.  Bad news.  Norton badly needs to improve their software to address newer technologies.  The Norton software doesn't seem as resource intensive now, but it just doesn't compare to other products I've used recently in terms of general trustworthiness.  Burn me once, shame on you.  Burn me twice, Norton, shame on me.  Install at your own risk.  I'm going to be removing this software from my PC promptly, hoping that it didn't do more damage than what I'm already aware of.	-1
I installed Norton Utilities on my computer after using CCleaner for a few years. I can honestly say that Norton does a much more detailed job of cleaning things on my computer then CCleaner didn't get. However, there are things that I lost that I can't get back, including some of my passwords on websites that I forgot. I don't think I could recommend Norton Utilities, because I feel that there can be some improvements.	-1
This was my first time using such product. It was a good learning experience. This is very easy to use and not much advance skill necessary.	-1
Some say that this is the best anti virus. That may be, but the program has huge deficiencies: The website makes it impossible to register. If you have succeeded, it won't work. I bought the bundle for 3 PC's, but there is no way to install them, even though you have the serial number. It has missed a couple of Trojan viruses on my PC. Avoid.	-1
Don't buy it. You will be sorry if you have to reformat your drive or re-install the operating system. You can't re-install Kaspersky a second time. so you just flushed the price of this questionable program. I had the program installed for 3 days. Due to a virus (that Kaspersky missed) I had to reload the OS (windows 8.1) to the factory settings. Which of course erases all the installed programs. So now I try to re-install Kaspersky. Nope, cannot be done. And search their web site, trouble shooting, forum and support,...nothing.  It will not activate with the original activation code supplied. Well, you can still get some use out of the disk. It makes an excellent $40.00 Frisbee for your dog to chase around. Especially one that has the habit of eating poop.	-1
Horrible, and I've only had it for 24 hours.  Summary:  Kaspersky "total" allowed vicious malware from Filezilla, an FTP program that now contains malware which prevents you from using Google!  I spent over an hour online with 3 different support people, and the last one said it would take 24-48 hours to fix it!  Internet research shows this problem has been around for 3 months  Details:  I was setting up a brand new machine from Dell.  In the first day, when I installed FileZilla, from FileZillas site, it puts this evil malware called Vosteran on your machine that takes over as a search engine.  Even if you go into Chrome to remove it, it adds itself back in.  Vosteran is evil, and FIlezilla sold out in Sept of 2014, as Wikipedia shows.  Simple problem, and 3 months old, but Kaspersky didn't stop it.  Even after creating an account at Kaspersky, you cant make comments on their web page (find out later you needed to verify by email, but they don't tell you that up front).  Called Kaspersky, and the woman spoke softly and couldn't understand me due to her accent, so I asked to speak to someone else. She wouldnt let me speak to someone else!  She couldn't fix the problem, and said shed send me an email about how to fix the problem, because for some reason, they don't put the solution online.  Of course, they also allowed the malware onto my machine.  The next person told me that there would be an additional charge if their technical support had to solve the problem (that they originally caused because their Total security didn't stop the malware).  Amazing.  The email didn't arrive, and she hung up on me.  The next guy didn't speak English well either, and said he sent me an email.  By this point, Id gotten about 8 emails from Kaspersky, from their forums that I tried to sign up for which were sending verification emails, which they never said they were sending, which was the reason that they didn't let me make comments, and finally, one from the previous woman, which came about 15 minutes late).  The 2nd guy escalates to a 3rd woman, who says I have to run a program, send them a log file, and then wait 24-48 hours to get a response.  Just got an email  THEY CLOSED MY CASE, and its still not solved.  Total time wasted SO FAR trying to get rid of malware Kaspersky should have prevented in the first place: THREE HOURS	-1
Excellent review and very true. Gone are the mighty and high Kaspersky days. Pure user for few years now, but with recent upgrade to Win 8.1 it has been nothing but headaches and licensing issues - 3 months without protection until they released a patch in late Dec 13, and they will not even have a courtesy to extend the previous license which did not work for 3 months. They spam my email everyday to buy at some f'in exorbitant rate. Seems like they have become greedy as they have grown, a sure sign of downward slope for such companies. I now started hating Kaspersky products and their licensing practices. To all Kaspersky users out there, let this be a warning / caution.	-1
I should have known there was going to be problems with this program because I build many computers a month. Many months ago when I did my first install, I could not activate the software after I entered my product key, because there was no activate button. I had to call customer support to find out how to activate the software. I had to hit the ALT key + N, then I could not close the activation screen. I had to call them back,only to find out that I had to hit the ALT + F4 key to close the activation screen. This is not a major problem then, but is now, because about 6 months has passed, and it is still not fixed!  I know this, because I recently downloaded the latest Version of Pure, and the same problem still exists.  Thereafter my installations on my laptop and desktop and many new builds, I noticed my WIFI on my laptop had an exclamation point and limited connection (NO CONNECTION AT ALL). This has gone on for months, and I went through 2 Uverse modems, and several calls to HP, and a new Ralink WIFI card, to no avail. I finally got lucky in a Google search late one night where the guy had the same problem until he disabled the Kaspersky NDIS 6 filter in WIFI Properties. Kaspersky sent me new settings which they said would fix the problem, and of course it DID NOT! They then sent me report maker to send in a report about my system and their Virus program, which I did. Then I get this email from them wanting to close the ticket without a fix, because they had not heard from me. It was Kaspersky Support - Follow-up: 315405243. Well that is not the end of it.  My desktop is hard wired to the network. I brought it out of the sleep mode only to find that wonderful yellow exclamation point on my hard wired connection. Of course, I knew immediately that it was the Kaspersky NDIS 6 filter, which I immediately disabled, and that ended the dropout problems on both computers. I have been installing this program on many of my new builds, and now I have to go back and correct this problem on all of them, because Kaspersky can't seem to find a fix to either of the above problems, and I do not know what exactly it is that this filter does. Because of their poor customer service, and their total lack of interest, I do not recommend this program to any user running both Windows 8 or 7. Kaspersky, you have lost a long term customer. I have switched to Vipre Internet Security 2014, totally because of your lack of interest, poor support and no fixes for long term problems.  This is a copy of my answer to their last email to me.  Subject: Re: Kaspersky Support - Follow-up: 315405243 From: Dale xxxxxx (xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx) To: customerservicesolution@kaspersky.com; Date: Sunday, November 10, 2013 8:57 PM It really does not matter to me now if you fix the WIFI dropout problem with your NDIS 6 Filter, and having to hit ALT +N to activate the Pure software, and because of your lack of interest in repairing these issues, I have uninstalled the software and switched to VIPRE. So as far as I am concerned, you can close the ticket, and you have lost a customer for good. You know, these issues have gone on for months with no resolution, and I build 20 to 25 extreme machines per month.

When I installed this on my computer and entered the Activation Code. It will not Activate it so I contacted Kaspersky and they checked out the code and they said that the Activation Code is no good and it's a fraud Activation Code. And Kaspersky can't Activate it because of that.	-1

works but  it updates demands upgrade and I  have only had it a month	-1
I sorely needed my registry to be repaired, and my computer optimized.  This software destroyed my registry, removed needed files and did all sorts of other damage. A $300 computer repair service included reinstalling Windows 7.  Stay away from this software.	-1
Well I guess its my own fault for not reading everything but at the time that I picked this on my vine list the information on it wasn't very clear. I thought I was ordering a external DVD drive. And it was probably more wishful thinking since I really need a new DVD drive for my laptop. Since it's a program and my DVD drive isn't working I cant install it right now. So for now I cant use it and since it is a Vine item I cant send it back. Once I get a DVD drive or get a new laptop then I will be able to install it and test drive it. Then I will come back and update my review.	-1
It works well - it removed a trojan from my old Year 2007 Celeron Laptop and they claim that they keep their virus signature updated.  My only grip is with the performance.  My old laptop was running Kaspersky (Free edition) and the performance impact was acceptable, but the moment I installed Avira - it slowed down things.  Another thing which I did not like is the fact that they updated my browser home page and installed a toolbar.  CNET does stuff like that, but never expected a packaged software like this to behave so badly.	-1
Qualities I look for in a competent internet security suite are ease of installation, simple setup, no installation of unwanted adware, ease of use (works silently in the background), and light on the system resources.  The Avira Internet Security has managed perform below par on all accounts.  Like: >Loaded with the whole gamut of protection for PC, internet, parental supervision, with extras such as security for Android devices, and Antivirus for Mac.  Dislikes: >Not a smooth installation: must uninstall remnants of competitors' internet security suites (which I've already done) and any other anti-malware/spyware programs. >Installs even after selected not to: Ask.com toolbar (adware/malware), changes homepage, and redirects from default search engine to AskJeeves when using the SafeSearch function. >Unnecessarily complicated program interface for setting up user preferences. >NOT seamless protection running in the background; plenty of hiccups and stalls using the Avira firewall for routine web browsing compared to other brands like Norton 360, Kaspersky, AVG, Zone Alarm, etc.  Overall: I've tried the free online version of Avira a few years ago, now I'm rudely awakened by why I uninstalled it after only one day.  History repeats itself.	-1
I didn't like this Avira security software at all. It took over my computer, and changed my homepage even after I chose for it not to. It slowed down my computer, and locked up a few of my other programs. Especially my photo and video editing programs. This software is good for 3 computers, but I'm so glad I didn't put it on any of my other computers. I run Windows XP, and it kept giving me error messages. I think this is the worst anti virus software I have ever used. I went back to Norton.	-1
These days one expects Internet Security software to run fairly seamlessly in the background.  Stop the action when a threat is detected, otherwise don't remind me you're there if possible.  This software wants to pop up and tell you what it's doing.	-1
Software that is supposed to keep up with the latest in security threats, should also be able to keep up with the latest in operating systems. Without explicit Windows 8 support, it's hard enough to trust this thing to keep my computer problem-free, but when users need to refer to migration documents to upgrade form the older version, it makes it that much worse.	-1
Although I've been a business owner for nearly 25 years, I'm a recent convert to accounting software. For most of my business life I used an accounting system that I wrote myself. Worked fine, but no one other than myself could ever figure out how to use it.  I put in Quickbooks a few months ago and have been very pleased with it. It did take some effort to get it up and running, but the ability to pull out reports has been very helpful. I was interested to see how this "higher powered" system would work in the hopes that it would give me even more capabilities than Quickbooks. As a plus, it allows for up to 3 users.  Installation was straightforward. The screen layout is rather cluttered and presents a lot of information at once. That can be good once you're comfortable with the program, but it can also be somewhat intimidating at first. This is written for an accountant, not a business owner that needs to do day-to-day accounting. However, that is a necessary trade-off given the ample reports and capabilities of this program.  Given the time spent setting up Quickbooks, I was really pleased to find out that this would import my Quickbooks accounts. Well, that's not really the case. Some came through fine, but most would not. So, I called tech support in the hopes of getting that resolved.  I got through relatively quickly, but found out that the "free" year of support is predicated on me providing them with a credit card so it would auto-renew at the end of the year for a fee. That didn't set well with me at all. Yes, I could cancel the auto renew before it occurred and get my year of support for free, but I saw this as an obvious attempt by Sage to count on me to forget to cancel, and be stuck with a bill for support.  Now, support does cost money to provide, and I am willing to pay for it if the support really does help. In this case, it did not. The person didn't understand the specifics of the problem, and used the support call as an opportunity to try to sell me more Sage products. That really rubbed me the wrong way!  If you're starting from scratch and don't need to import accounts from another package, this may be worth considering if you need a deep toolchest of accounting and inventory reports. However, if you're a Quickbooks (or some other accounting package) user, think twice about using this as a means to upgrade. Sage 50 may have more raw accounting power, but the company appears to be more interested in keeping their hand in your pocket rather than providing a solid accounting package that is backed with effective support. Also, keep in mind that if you do go the Sage route, don't count on being able to import past work.	-1
After installing and trying out this product for nearly a month, I'd have to say stick with Quickbooks.  We found it just too much of a pain to set up and figure out.  Plus it felt like I was getting blasted with ads.  Are you serious?  No thanks..	-1
Junk--old junk.	-1
Horrible, absolutely horrible.  About one time out of 25 tries, this program will load and I can use it.  Other than that, it just does nothing when I try to open it, or it takes 30 minutes to load about 950 songs that I have in it.  This is on Windows 10.  I have quit purchasing music from Amazon because of this.	-1
There are major bugs that were not present in previous versions of this software.  Beware your music may not display properly when it accesses you music files that are your hard drive (like cover art may not display and you may not be able to scroll through all your albums in a category). It worked fine before the "update", I wish Amazon hadn't "upgraded" it--my motto is if it's not broken, don't fix it.  I may uninstall it from my PC and just stream from the Amazon website until a better version of the software is made available.  I am using Windows 10--people with other versions of Windows may not have the same problems.  The version for my Android phone seems to work okay, but I've not used it very much so I can't properly judge it.	-1
Could not load on my BB 10 phone	-1

Not so happy. The song never downloaded to my computer. The download went on for thirty five minutes. I still didn't get the music. I have broadbans so what is the problem here? Shane	-1
Not intuitive, bulky, and slow. I installed it to download some music I bought and had to uninstall it. My 6 core desktop (I-7 980) behaved erratically while updating with my music in my hard drive, took too much band-with as well. I am a remote consultant, and need every bit of my bandwith while working, which rendered this product unusable to me. Why did I install it? The old music downloader would not work any more, so I had to do it. Sadly, had to call and cancell the digital purchase because I was unable to download it. I do not use the cloud, nor do I want to. Frankly, not what I expected from Amazon. I've been a loyal customer since it was a mail order company for books only.	-1
I want LOSSLESS music... not 256 kb/s.  Lossless.	-1
it doesn't work on my pc	-1
While billed as working with Windows 8, it doesn't work on a Windows 8 tablet. You can't scroll the lists in the "Your Library" area, making most of your music inaccessible.  Customer service told me that it's not compatible with Windows tablets.  Perhaps this bug will be fixed in a future version.	-1
I have a collection of 50,000+ songs. The online Cloud Player works fine, but Amazon has changed it so you have to use the PC version to download music and the thing is the PC version flat out doesn't work. I will type in the name of a song I want to download, and sometimes up to 30 minutes will go by before the song appears. This is ridiculous!  I just want to download the music I buy but instead I have to keep buying CD's, rip them myself, then throw the physical discs into the garage because Cloud Player flat out won't work.	-1
I just want to download songs. Its nice that it works on roku. But I just want to download my song and own it	-1
As of early November 2013, this is not ready for prime time. With a library of around 10,000 songs, it is a very frustrating experience. The app is very slow to respond. Spends too much time obsessing with thumbnails and syncing and refreshing and other things in the background and does not prioritize music playback and user input. Especially when you are in the "Computer" tab. If I want to play music that lives on my actual computer, it should be click and play immediately. Not wait for syncing and whatever else the app is doing before it lets you play music.  Part of the problem is that it only has two library viewing options, and they are both graphics heavy. It should have an additional option that is a plain list of albums and songs. You pick an album and play it. You know, a music player! Not a gallery of pretty pictures. The left pane keeps refreshing or doing whatever it is doing, adding to the frustration and unpredictability of the program.  I thought iTunes was slow and bloated, but after using this, *shock*, it gave me a new appreciation of iTunes. It's that bad.  To add insult to injury, the "download" option of the web browser version of the Cloud Player now sends you to this desktop app. The desktop app makes the browser version of the Cloud Player look like a work of art. If a browser version of an app outperforms the desktop version, you have a problem.	-1
The whole package of the Amazon Cloud, your digital library, and this player are all woven together, but the product isn't complete, and as a result there are some problems that--when Amazon addresses them--will make this product an excellent option for your music collection.  Until then, these are what I would consider to be show-stopping issues, and you should probably be aware of them up front.  First, whenever you purchase music from Amazon, a digital copy is already automatically stored in your library for you.  You are given a limited amount of storage that you can use to upload MP3s of your own, and Amazon will put them into your library.  For a small fee, you can increase the amount of storage to a whopping 250,000 songs.  So far, that means my entire massive CD collection, which I recently re-ripped A to Z, would fit perfectly online.  All well and good.  But then we get to that task of adding music.  The Cloud Player has an option in the menu to add music, but it launches a browser page where you have to manually manage the upload process.  Not a huge inconvenience, but a bit awkward, as it also requires the installation of the Amazon Music Importer, a separate application that really just acts as a go-between, from the browser to your computer, solely for the upload process.  The act of uploading appears to be a two-step process: - if Amazon already has that album/song in its Cloud, then you get it added without having to manually push your copy from your computer up into your library.  It's like Amazon makes a note that this belongs to you and lets you have access to their copy of it. - if Amazon 'can't match' the file, it simply won't upload it.  The criteria for 'can't match' are pretty hazy.  On the one hand, I see in the instructions that your MP3s need to be a certain range of quality:  not too high or too low of a bitrate when you ripped them.  I haven't had anything rejected for this reason though because my music is a Continuous Bit Rate 256Kbps.  But on the other hand, I get a response from the uploader that a song was rejected because it 'couldn't be matched'...and it doesn't seem like it should be.  For example, I have a clean rip of an album, but tracks 3, 8, and 12 couldn't be matched, so just a portion of the album was uploaded.  Confusing.  Using the player has been a great experience:  it's not hard to drill down, I get the (weird-looking) idea that searches blur the entire app screen while I'm typing, then bring me back to the results.  I can easily figure out how to make playlists, drag things back and forth, sort and filter by artist, album, etc., and getting the player going is a no-brainer to anyone who's used a media player of any kind.  But then I've gotten tripped up by DRM (and believe me, I've discussed this with Amazon).  The Amazon Cloud Player allows you to 'register' up to 10 devices to be able to use the service.  That's a pretty fair number, and despite how many phones, tablets, consoles, and computers we have around the house, even if for some reason I went nuts and tried to make everything run the Cloud Player, I'd still come in just shy of 10 devices.  If 'register' were really a device-specific operation.  Unfortunately, there are two huge problems with managing your devices:  1) "Registering" can happen at any time, more than once, and the player treats a re-occurrence as a new device.  I installed this on my laptop and it Registered:  so my device count went up by one.  At some point later in the day, it Registered itself again, and now the laptop counted as two.  The next morning, I turned on the laptop and it said I had exceeded the limit, because it tried to Register yet again, and now my laptop counted as three...and I was over 10.  I thought that was weird, so I logged into my account and discovered that related Amazon-items, like my phone and my daughter's phone, were not only registered as potential users of the Cloud Player (because they use the Amazon App Store), but that all my devices had gobbled up the number of Registrations by being on the list more than once.  2) "Deregistering" imposes a 30-day penalty:  if you need a new slot, you need to deregister a device, wait 30 days, and on day 31 you can now add another.  But at some point you can expect that device to have to re-register itself and take up another slot in the 10-device list.  I've had to communicate with Amazon on this situation a couple of times, mostly because even when I name a device, if it re-registers itself without telling me, Amazon makes up a name and it's hard for me to tell which device 'forgot' who it was and re-added itself.  The solution they suggest to me is to Deregister everything and start again.  You can click a "Deregister All" button, but if you do, you need to read the fine print:  at the bottom of the page it tells you that you can only do a "Deregister all" once per year.  Why?  I've yet to understand why any of this works the way it does.  But at the end of the day, I've paid Amazon money for a year of storage, reached a certain point in uploading my library, and had all my slots arbitrarily used up.  The support answer was to remove everything, and now I'm waiting a month to use the service I've paid for, knowing that unless Amazon fixes this weirdness, it'll break again and something will have to go without for a month while I wait for permission to return to the cloud.  The Amazon Cloud Player has the potential to be great.  In the meantime, expect some awkward problems.	-1
I've been having some problems trying to get this program loaded into my Android tablet.  It has given me a ton of hoops to jump through to the point that I no longer care to have it on my android.  It requires entirely too much personal information to be freely accessible to google and McAfee.  I just do  not feel comfortable in allowing them access to all aspects of my android.  I will be curious to know if anyone else has been required to basically give up all privacy to google in order to have this program on their android.  I don't know if the same goes for installation on a pc, but this has been entirely to invasive for comfort.  Until I know that this is a safe program I cannot recommend it, at least for androids.	-1
I started installing this program. Then I got an error message. This program isn't compatible with the latest version of QuickTime. In order to run it, I would need to delete the latest version in order to upload an older version of QuickTime that is compatible. Really? Why on earth would I want to switch an improved version of QuickTime for an older one?  This is old out-dated software. I'm sure most kids would prefer to use an animation app on their Android or Apple devices, and those range in price from five dollars to free. Why would anyone want to pay more for outdated software? But if you do, check the system requirements to make sure it will work for you.	-1
I had high hopes for this program when I requested it. I had used Corel products before and appreciated their versatility, especially for modifying photographs and clip-art. Unfortunately, this product was a major disappointment in more ways than one:  First, it was not compatible with Windows Vista, the operating system on my computer, so I had to install Corel Painter on another machine. Second, there were samples on the box of what the program could do, but no instructions in how to make it happen. I tried looking at the tutorials online, but they were not much help.  I tried playing around with the program and experimenting with the various features, but could not figure it out, as I have other Corel and Microsoft products. Maybe I was not daring enough and didn't have the advantage of a touch screen or stylus to make this program work. At any rate, it's not for me. I'll have to stick with my freebie and cheapo programs.	-1
Questionable. Hard to believe that every 5 seconds there is 321 problems that need to be fixed.	-1
I used Tune-Up for years and loved it. AVG got it and they use it to for a cheesy marketing scam to force you to buy their paid anti-virus program. Every day you get an upgrade popup and when I called their support department for instructions on how to turn that off, they LIED to me.	-1
Found it to be an agressvie program that takes over  your computer. I would not tell anyone this is the right choice for people like me who like to control their own computer.	-1
First let me state that my computer met and exceeded all of the requirements for this software.  I have installed many anti-virus programs in the past and I didn't expect to have any problem with this one.  However, I just couldn't get it to work.  When I first tried to install it the program wanted me to delete my current anti-virus program.  Okay, I get that, so I uninstalled it.  Then the installation program asked me to restart the computer, that's when I started to run into problems.  When it restarted I still had the disk in my computer and when it restarted it was in the Kaspersky recovery mode.  It was frustrating and took me a while to get out of it.  Now, when I try to install the program I get an error screen.  It has happened every time that I have tried it.  I have tried restarting my computer and I have tried to use the "Help" feature. I have even tried to contact the company via email but to no avail.  I try not to judge a program by my inability to use it when others have had no problems.  However this time it feel that I need to share my disappointing experience.	-1
When I think android, I think Samsung. Unfortunately, this product would not install on either of the two Galaxy 4 phones I tried. It did install on my semi-luddite brother's no-name emergency only pay as you go Android. But when confronted with the extensive and daunting  list of permissions demanded by a multi-national corporation based in  Moscow, I chose to cancel. While I understand that some of these are necessary for the program to operate, it seemed overly invasive. I have tried other Kaspersky products and have generally been satisfied but this one has installation issues and generates privacy concerns. Pass.	-1
It was a bear to install on my S4 and get it working, and I'm not sure why or even what I did right to finally get it to work. Then again, it didn't really seem to do much... or anything for that matter. Android isn't really known for being susceptible to viruses, but I figured "why not be prepared when somebody figures out how to attack them?" It didn't seem to slow down my device, which is a good thing. However, I noticed all the rights it required. It wants access to EVERYTHING!!! And that rather worries me. I uninstalled it because I think I got more scared of this than I did about a Virus.  Don't get me wrong, Kaspersky is a very trusted name, which was the reason I got this in the first place. I get this type of software to make me feel better about my devices, and if I'm worrying over this then it isn't helping me relax, which is why I uninstalled it.	-1
I have tried on multiple occasions to install this software. It downloads just fine, and installs (I tried all ways, none of which are consistent with the instructions on the software card), but I am never able to set up a Kaspersky account, which is apparently needed to set up this software.. I follow all instructions and it will never proceed beyond my entering and verifying my account password. I have given up on this and can only give it the lowest rating. It may work well for you, but I could just not get it installed...	-1
I have the cheapest full Android phone that is available with no contract on the WalMart TMobile plan:  the Concord.  I am not putting specs, but if your phone is of a similar line, then you know who you are.  I was not able to install Kaspersky Lab Security for Android, because I did not have enough free memory on my phone.  I went through each application on my phone and deleted as many as I could, and I still couldn't install Kaspersky  I only got my phone about 4 months ago, so I would expect anything to run on it.  My version of the Android operating system is compatible with Kaspersky.  That is not the issue.  Instead, the issue is that Kaspersky wants more free memory.  And, I am unable to go on Kaspersky's website and find a full requirements for a phone.  The install process, in a perfect world would go as follows: -  You order this and get a card in the mail with the serial number for your license. -  The card tells you to and you type a URL on Kaspersky's website into your phone.  Then your phone downloads a file, but Kaspersky's website does not pop up any sort of confirmation message, so it's up to you to check downloads. -  You go to your downloaded file and try to run it. -  You get two options for how to run it:  through the Play Store, or from the file.  I tried the through the Play Store option and got nothing - no reaction from the phone.  I think tried from the file, and to do that, I had to turn off my phone's security setting which was set to not allow installing apps except from the Play Store (so that I can't just browse to a malware site and accidentally install software). -  Then, for me, my phone said not enough memory, free up memory.  So, I looked on my computer to try and find specs for phones to run this.  All I could find were "Android 2.3 - 4.2" and "Minimum screen resolution 320 x 480".  My phone has that.  What my phone is lacking is memory.  I opted to give up, rather than try to uninstall other apps or modify settings without knowing how much memory I had to free up. -  Rather than continuing the attempted install, I went back through my phone's security settings to not allow apps to install unless I get them from the Play Store.  Overall, if you have a high end newer speced out Android phone, you can probably count on Kaspersky installing.  If you are the unwashed masses, with a low end low specs Android phone, don't count on it.	-1
I don't think most need android security software. Those who just download a few games from the official play store here and there don't have much chance of running into a virus (in the US at least). I'm a computer tech and have seen phones that were dying. I've seen phones with misbehaving apps causing trouble. I've seen android or ios corrupted. I've seen dying SD cards and most every other problem you see with phones. And I've never seen a phone virus.  And on the Galaxy S3, I found this software acted quirky. I had glitches and freezes with the software installed that went away once it was uninstalled. My phone is encrypted and I see another review mention that might be where he got glitches. I hate blaming a normal feature built in to android for causing issues with a big name security program. I don't really know what caused the problems, but they went away when I removed the Kaspersky software.  Maybe some year, people will really care about phone antivirus. But they don't now. So as a computer tech who would tell you you're an idiot for running a windows computer without malicious software protection, I would also tell most that I don't think they need virus protection for their phone. I don't think it's worth the slight phone slowdown and possibility of glitches from a unneeded security program!	-1
This is the version where Intuit changed what the program does for including K-1's; they ended up upgrading for free after so many complaints, but it still was a hassle	-1
Eh...	-1
Won't buy it any longer, got from Amazon, computer crashed lost pass words and could only use for a month.	-1
The ONLY reason I purchased this is because Quicken ceases supporting their 2011 version.  there are no significant changes in this program that are readily apparent to the user.  The "upgrade" was simply a scam to extort money from folks who are committed to using this program for banking.  I would switch to another program in a heartbeat if there was was a competitor out there that wasn't horrible.  The program does what Quicken does as well as it ever did.  No real changes to functionality or interface.	-1
Intuit is overreaching, invasive and greedy.  2014 version will not allow you to use "One Step Update" unless create an Intuit account where under you must provide private information. This cannot be a perquisite to using all the features of Quicken, which I am entitled to use upon my payment for the software. Buyer beware.	-1
Not bad but not great either. Switching to mint.	-1
Unstable.  Slow.  Difficulty with cut and paste - intermittent failures.  Happier with 2013 version.	-1
Got Quicken for years now in hopes that I can use it to log everything and just upload to TurboTax come tax time while getting a handle on my financial profile, but alas, I just cannot seem to get things started. Hope you have better luck!	-1
Quicken 2014 is full of bugs.  In addition, if you wish to run an update you must first log into Intuit website first. It is not enough to know your bank accounts password, first you have to get intuits permission to access your bank.  This is a self serving economic ploy by intuit to keep you tied them.  It used to be a great program.	-1
I have used Quicken for so long I don't even remember when I started.  I do have data files back to 2000.  I used to update every year and then every two as there was little difference between versions.  I started to update last year until scared off by the terrible reviews.  I have checked the reviews often since then and it appears to be improving but still buggy.  When it comes to finances, buggy is UNACCEPTABLE.  I am surprised Amazon even sells a product that scores so poorly.  So now the 2014 version is released and off to rocky start.  I am really getting antsy as I've read Intuit will obsolete my 2011 version after three years.  The only PLUS I see here is that Intuit is now bothering to read and respond to the reviews.  Maybe there is light at the end of the tunnel.	-1
Pros: good accounting program insofar as it works.  Cons: 1. will not update to send and download transactions and thus is useless as a online banking program.   2. customer service is not competent to remedy the problem.	-1
I have used QuickBooks for my business all the way back to 1995 and it's worked great, but Quicken 2014 needs lots of help. I want my money back Intuit	-1
Gets worse with every version	-1
I have been a Quicken user for over 25 years. I was very satisfied with this product until last year when things began to unravel, First, I couldn't balance my checkbook and my credit card accounts. I first thought that it was my fault and started doing the calculation manually. After many months, blaming myself, (although my manual calculations were correct) i tried to get help from Intuit. They now don't have  a fee-for-service telephone helpline anymore - only a chat-line. In my case they made an exception and a person from India called me. He was pretty arrogant to start with and after an hour, he declared that my database is corrupted (as if it was my fault), and that I needed to start anew. Starting anew on a portfolio with hundreds of stocks in 3 brokerage accounts (personal, IRA and 401),  2 checking accounts and 3 credit cards is not easy. But I spent the time to do it, just because I have had luck with this program for 25 years! I had paid for their annual new releases for 25 years - Over $ 1,500.00 so far. Guess what happened: under the new database I created as advised by this Quicken rep, I couldn't reconcile a credit card account again. I am now totally convinced that Quicken 2014 has a problem. They won't even admit it. And Now, I am pissed. UNTIL THEY FIX THIS I AM NOT GOING TO BUY ANY OF THEIR UPGRADES. IF YOU ARE A NEW BUYER DONT EVENT THINK ABOUT IT. I am also in the process of converting to Mac. I would appreciate any advise for me from other users.	-1
No effective customer support from Intuit on Q 2014. No telephone support.  My product stopped updating. I have researched all the forums and all the net but there is no posted solution. Q 2014 is now worthless to me.	-1

Stupid upgrade pushed by Intuit.  Less useful than previous version.  Especially with regarding attachments to transactions. I am looking for an alternative.	-1
...but not significantly better than making you own excel spreadsheet. Very labor intensive set up. New version does not seem to keep track of payees / categories as well as older version, leading to vast overuse of "uncategorized"  budget component - manually updating (eg "Giant" = "groceries" ) no longer guarantees that in the future Giant will be recognized as groceries, not uncategorized. Probably the least bad offering in the category, though.	-1
There are so many frustrating bugs that I'm considering giving up on even tracking my finances with this kind of software.  The investing reports give random and useless values.  Transfer transactions cannot be deleted.  It crashes regularly. And often when I shut it down, it leaves files locked so that I have to reboot before I can run it again.  Considering that they add no noticeable enhancement each year, it seem that even a slightly competent development team could have fixed these issues by now.  I can only imagine that everyone at intuit is completely apathetic.	-1
Look up the Q2010 and/or Q2008 products, where I posted detailed logs/diaries of the endless bugs, errors and frustrations I endured as a Quicken user.  Here's a permalink to just one of my earlier, quite detailed Amazon reviews of the Quicken product: tinyurl.com/AmazonQuickenReview  I owned Q2008, Q2005 & Q2002 and I used them daily. During that decade, I observed no significant product improvements, just the aforementioned continual increase in software bugs, eternal peddling of affiliated products, etc.  In August, 2010, I finally migrated to the Moneydance product and--after the migration and learning curve issues--I find it swims slick as an eel. I wish I'd done it years sooner.  Since at least 2002, Intuit has been using Quicken as a pure 'cash cow' - a product to milk revenue out of, but making no investment in it - while it continues to toy around with other new product developments toward future revenue streams ... ... Quicken Loans, Quicken Credit Cards, etc.  The history of the Quicken product doesn't suggest a bright future for Quicken users. Don't get suckered into starting up with Quicken. Go with Moneydance.	-1
I have been a long time user of Quicken and never gave much thought to how good it was. It just worked. However, Quicken 2014 is a disappointment. The problems  started when i tried to register on line:  I couldn't!. I had to call support and spent 2 hours on the phone before I was able to use it. Still, it doesn't work very well. It's buggy, crashes, locks up and generally is a pain. I can  get it to work only by Ctrh-Alt-Del, several times before it will complete One Step. This software is a mess and Intuit knows it. (It's all ready had 7 revisions.) I have always liked this software but can't understand why a company would risk their reputation with this update. I really can't recommend this software and I wish there was an alternative.	-1
Update Nov 2016 I continue to wonder why Intuit made the budget changes they did. I'm now forced to use some data from Quicken coupled with a lot of manual calculations and external data. It's just a mess. Why oh why doesn't some other company come out with a competing product.  Update Feb 2016 I HATE Quicken budgeting. Even after using the 2014 version for over 2 years I still find it a royal pain to deal with. All I need is one simple change to make it much better for me. That would be to show the total budget column on the right side of the Budget Details display. Without that I have to switch between two screens and use a calculator for each row of my budget. This was SO much easier in the 2011 version.  Original Review: I have Quicken 2014 Premier. I've used Quicken since about 1991. The previous version I was using was the 2011 version which was fine and worked much like the previous several versions. But in 2012 Quicken radically changed the budget feature (I mean really why do you use an individual tool like Quicken - budgeting right!) and broke it totally. User complaints were loud and clear demanding Intuit change back to the 2011 format. All Intuit did was continue to tweak the newer, less appreciated, format.  I managed to hold onto Quicken 2011 until recently. Quicken forces updates every three years by cutting off your bank downloads when your Quicken version is older than 3 years old.  It took me several hours to tame the new budget format into something I can use, but it is still very frustrating for me. Generally what Intuit did was remove manual user control over budgets, which killed budgets for most people that use Quicken. They then began to add back in features they had removed, but still in the new less useful format.  Today I can get budgets to work for me but every single day I have more effort involved than I did in Quicken 2011. I'm forced to switch between two or three different screen displays to do what I could do with one display before. I also have to have a pen and paper on the desk to write down some numbers between screen swaps. In some cases I have to have a calculator available too. For me it's a mess.  I've turned in feature / bug reports but hundreds of others have as well with no results. Intuit is just going down it's own path and ignoring customer inputs.	-1
I updated from 2011 to 2014 because they stated that they wouldn't provide downloading service after March 2014.  I went through all the steps required to update and everything seemed fine except when I went to Reconcile.  I had a charge account with very few entries.  I have done this proceedure for 15 plus years and always was able to Reconcile without problems.  I reconciled with 2014 and was off by -$30.67.  I triple checked my results and could find no error.  I contacted Quicken, which is a daunting task in itself, and told them of the problem.  They wanted me to manually check my results.  I told them this was a simple reconcile.  I asked for the next tier of service and they begrudingly sent me a link.  The next Customer Rep I sent Windows Screen Shots of all my work and then they paid attention.  They had me check all sorts of menus and could find nothing.  The only thing they said was to sign up and do an electronic download of the account.  I don't like to do this because I don't want Quicken to know my acccounts or anyone to hack Quicken accounts and get my records.  In the end I made an adjustment to my accounts to bring the balance to the correct amount.  I will see what happens next month.  In the mean time I reconciled another of my accounts and I ended up on +$60 this time.  If Quicken wants to charge me for downloading my information then just charge me a fee and let me keep my old version !	-1
I've used quicken since the late '80s and loved it. I really loved when they added the ability to attach documents to a transaction. Now when you attach a pdf document, you get an icon on the screen, you can't see if it's the correct attachment. Worse, when you go back to check information on your attachments, you have to open quicken, open the transaction, open attachments, then click on the attachment to open the document reader to see the attached document. If you have more than one attachment, you have to open each one separately until you find the one you're looking for. The mobile app would be really nice, if it worked. I used it fine, with most accounts, for a couple months; then the new year turned the calendar and quicken wanted me to upgrade to something I'd already been using for months. It wouldn't sync until I did, problem is, it wasnted me to sign on with the old account, but when I tried to do that, it wouldn't. I lciked for it to send me the password, even though I know what my old password was, but it wouldn't send me the necessary "code", so I resent, which was my only other option. well that errased everything from my phone app. I tried contacted tech support, first via online chat. I was 32 in line and waited 45 minutes for the count down to me being next, then got a message that no one was available to try again later. So I submitted my question to the call option and they sent me a number to call. I waited 1.3 hours, and never got anything but "we will be with you shortly". So I guess, as bad as the new quicken is, the CS is the worst. I'll be looking for something else after more than two decades.	-1
I have been using Quicken for almost 20 years.  Since I upgraded and transfered my old files to the new version I cannot get my statements to reconcile.  They are always off a few dollars up or down.  Over all the software is very slow and updating  investment accounts is slow an inaccurate.  Let us keep are old working versions and charge us a fee to download financial information.  They have tried to include more and more in the software and it just doesn't work anymore!	-1
I have used Quicken since Microsoft abandoned MSMoney, On a Windows PC. Sick of the PC crashing, freezing, fluttering and otherwise giving me the finger, I bought a MAC. No freezing, crashing or security issues ! Even runs most PC software ! But not Quicken. Just something called Quicken Essentials, made for people who don't bank on-line, don't invest, don't have options or IRAs or 401k accounts. In other words, made for the folk who buy "Lotus 1-2-3 for Dummies".  So, I make do with a PC Laptop for accounting, using the LAN of my MAC to download, and have on it Turbotax as well, all the while cursing the Intuit penchant for outdated technology.	-1
12/14/13 I have to update my review.  The 1st review was on the check register, this review is on the investment register.  Horrible downgrades they have made to this software.  Like several others I am seriously considering going back to my previous version and forgoing any connectivity with stock updates.  Transactions don't enter when accept them and it reenters a previous one.  it takes so long to register that you think you didn't click and you enter the transaction again.  And, OH the developers are oh so much smarter than the user.  Give me a break, and give us back control of the software.  12/12/13 I hate software that thinks it is smarter than you.  They have made changes to the renaming rules that are completely annoying.  My bank names all checks as CHECK.  Quicken wants to apply one rule to CHECK and won't stop bugging me about it.  And the ignore rule does not work.  Every check is now a multi step process to code with the correct payee.  Then it wants to compare transactions that have absolutely nothing in common.  Bottom line, don't upgrade to QUICKEN 2014 unless you have to because you are at  the 3 year limit they have imposed for getting stock quotes downloaded.  I haven't seen enough positive changes in the software to justify buying it.	-1

I finally gave up and decided to upgrade, hoping that the new version doesn't have the same bugs as the 2011 version (I had no real hope for upgraded customer care). After a very long morning on my computer and on the phone with the company, it turns out that my new Quicken Deluxe wouldn't read my old password protected 2011 files. Of course the new version also uninstalled the 2011 version. Right now I'm having problems re-installing the 2011 files, which basically mean that THREE YEARS OF INFORMATION ARE LOST. The company's solution seems to be that I would send my data files to the company. Seriously. Good luck upgrading.	-1
I cannot believe amazon people are still buying quicken after years of bad reviews.  Quicken 2014 seems no different.  I still have quicken premier 2010 for windows and refused to be forced into an upgrade.  I now reconcile my VISA account manually.  someone at quicken needs to be fired.  do you think apple would put up with horrible product quality.  quicken loans got a jd power quality award.  I wonder how quicken software would fare.  wait 6 months before buying and see if anything improves.  do not be the first  to get arrows in your back.	-1
I've been using Quicken since the late 80's.  I switched to Microsoft Money when it came out - a far superior product - but was more-or-less forced to revert to Quicken when Money was discontinued.  In the early 2000's I switched to mostly using Mac computers, and started using Quicken Mac, but Intuit rapidly begin stripping essential features from the program, so I had to go back to the Windows version.  I just upgraded to the 2014 version, and like every Intuit product upgrade I've ever had, it's extremely buggy.  I'll just mention a couple of items, but there are plenty more.  First, if you use flags to identify particular transactions, you can expect them to be lost when you convert.  Gone, like the wind.  Second, when working in the "Unreconciled" screen using that filter, the program constantly crashes, and has to be reopened over and over.  Third, and most annoying to me personally so far, whereas you simply had to enter your password vault password to download transactions from your bank and other financial institutions, once you do that now you're prompted to log in to Intuit with your Intuit password.  I have no interest in logging into Intuit to download transactions that are none of their business.  I've long wished there was a suitable alternative to Quicken, as I've come to avoid Intuit products like the plague (some of you may remember when the company foisted it's C-Dilla copy protection scheme on purchasers of Turbo Tax one year, until consumer outrage forced them to back off).  I'm going to redouble my efforts to find something else to track my finances.	-1
This software Quicken 2014 Deluxe does not work on Yoga 2 Pro. No help on quicken community. I bought it and I am stuck with it.  If you have Windows 8.1 and a high resolution screen beware. Looks like  Mobu for me.  I have been a long time user of Quicken and this version is horrible.  Will go back to Version 2013 for now.  Buyer Beware!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	-1
Intuit has never been very upgrade friendly. This upgrade is no different. The cloud updating feature is faster, but that's about it. In all respects it looks and acts just like Quicken 2013. Come on Intuit, provide your customers with a real upgrade path. $60+ for this is nothing but a money grab. Unless you really want to increase the speed of your android cloud interface, walk away form this upgrade until Intuit gets real with its pricing.	-1

Since at least 2002, Intuit has been using Quicken as a pure 'cash cow' - a product to milk revenue out of, but making no investment in it - while it continues to toy around with other new product developments toward future revenue streams ... ... Quicken Loans, Quicken Credit Cards, etc.  The history of the Quicken product doesn't suggest a bright future for Quicken users. Don't get suckered into starting up with Quicken. Go with Moneydance.	-1
I just installed 2014 as an upgrade from 2011.  THE ATTACHMENT "VIEWER" IS A *JOKE*!! On a 24 inch monitor it shows a picture of a check about ONE INCH hi by 2.5 INCHES WIDE! If I want to READ the contents I have to click on "open".  It then loads the item into my GRAPHICS EDITING PROGRAM!  A PDF of a receipt is WORSE! When I click on the paper clip to open the "viewer", it just shows me an Adobe Acrobat icon.  I then have to click on the icon and it opens in Acrobat.  And now I tried clicking on another check attachment and a SMALLER window popped up with a check image about THREE-QUARTERS OF AN INCH HI and 1.5 INCHES WIDE.  GUESS WHAT -- *I ALREADY KNOW IT'S A CHECK!!* How is THAT useful by ANY stretch of the imagination?  GET A CLUE, INTUIT!  Software is supposed to be USEFUL.  Users don't want to have to go through a whole series of clicks to do ANYTHING. And we don't want to have a FINANCIAL program sending things to all sorts of other programs.  A VIEWER should show a USEFUL VIEW.  UPDATE: I WOUND UP UNINSTALLING 2014 AND I REINSTALLED 2011.  UPDATE RE REINSTALLING 2011. Just a warning about THAT. For several months I continued using 2011 and it worked the same as always. Fortunately, I have two copies (same computer), one under Win 7 and one under Win 8 -- using the same data files. I have mainly been using Win 8. A recent auto software update on the Win 8 copy CHANGED HOW 2011 WORKS. Now, for PDF's, even 2011 automatically opens the system's default PDF viewer. It's definitely a software update because I tried the copy installed under Win 7 and that one doesn't do it.  (What I'll probably have to do is uninstall and reinstall the Win 8 copy and make sure I only run it off-line so it can't reinstall the update.) (Don't blame Win 8 or the "Metro" interface. Both Win versions are set up with Classic Shell menu, boot directly to the desktop and look and work almost identically.)  RE GOING BACK FROM 2014 TO 2011:  This is to clarify some reviews saying people who went from 2011 to 2014 can't go back.  IT DEPENDS. When I initially installed 2014, before doing that I made two complete copies of my data folder on a different hard disk as backups. To go back to 2011, I just renamed the folder that 2014 converted from "Quicken" to "Quicken 2014" and then copied one of the two backups and named that back to "Quicken". I reran the Quicken 2011 installer. Everything installed, and when I opened the program it even immediately found the data--it didn't even ask where it was located even though I don't store it in a default location. Although you can't CONVERT 2014 format to 2011 or open a 2014 data file with 2011, it is NOT true that once you install 2014 it is impossible to use 2011. Of course, if you "jumped in" and didn't bother making appropriate backups -- it's your own fault for being careless.  I only use Quicken to keep my checkbook and I download the QFX files and import them from my computer, so I probably really won't need to update.  TWO SUGGESTIONS FOR THE DEVELOPERS:  1) Put back a viewer like in 2011, at least as an option. People don't want either to see a microscopic image or having files open all over the place in a bunch of different programs. A file viewer that can display PDF's and the common image formats--GIF, PNG, JPG, TIFF--isn't that big a deal.  2) PLEASE change Find and Find and Replace to allow for TWO search parameters. For instance, for years I have paid one place $67 a week by check. It would be a HUGE timesaver to be able to put [Amount exactly 67.00] AND [Payee starts with "Check"]. Instead, I have to search for "Amount exactly 67.00" and then scroll through HUNDREDS of entries where I already changed the Payee name.	-1
Piece of junk.  I get a white screen when running the program.  McAfee has all these sorts of fixes and the like, but none of them work.  They variously claim that its: (1) a windows issue, (2) a IE issue, (3) a java issue, and all sorts of other issues, but just blame it on the customer.  RUN as far as you can from this crock of junk.	-1

Installed just fine on my first computer, which already had an evaluation version, as did the other two. Sadly, it wouldn't install on my other two and getting tech support was futile. This program also adds some extremely annoying software that takes control of your home pages in Explorer or Firefox.	-1
My HP came with Norton antivirus trial, and I installed McAfee 2013, which seems to have worked.  Norton still had residual components, but I can't recall whether this is due to Norton or McAfee removal processes.  When I tried to update to McAfee 2014, I expected to simply enter in a new code-- maybe 5 minutes.  Instead, the process turned in 70 minutes.  My McAfee 2013 ran for an entire year, and now this 2014 update needs to remove Norton residual components?  20 minutes wasted.  Then I contacted McAfee, who wasted another 25 minutes before their asking for a fee for removing Norton.  Huh?  I thought this issue was resolved in 2013.  Furthermore, I expected McAfee would just advise me how to remove Norton, if not remove it for me.  So, I searched Norton and found a removal tool.  Wasted 70 minutes roughly.  I thought McAfee should have sent me a link where the Norton removal tool was located, insted of wasting 70 minutes of my time.	-1
Let some stuff in including a Trojan, will change this year	-1
Needs 100% of cpu just to run an update, which can go on for several minutes. Don't plan to get anything else done then. Norton updates are much less cpu intensive.	-1
I have used previous versions of Kaspersky with great success. This version is toatlly different from past versions. It is complicated to find and figure out ANY settings. They went to a new format for setting things up, everything is now in a hidden file, different page, obscure setting with abstract abbreviations, technical descriptions and many unknown features and what they do or how to set them. I had it installed for about 4 months, downloaded a malware, the malware destroyed all the settings in Kaspersky, It infected my computer, I had to use Malwarebytes to rid it of these maladies. While the malware was removed, it left crumbs everywhere, my computer was starting while it was in sleep or hibernate, would start programs without being seen while I had it on, Kaspersky sat idly by and did nothing. As I got into the program, I found that Kaspersky was reset to allow incoming traffic. There was no warning, it just let it come in. Very disappointed by the letdown. Am now looking for a new program to replace this one.	-1
Continue to find it's shutoff - and I have to reenter the activation code... over and OVER and OVER.  Works when it works, but fails to be on just randomly.  Pick something else - I have a year left and just might be forced to switch.	-1
This is year 2 for me for Kaspersky.  Love the software, it works fine and is much less of a "resource hog" than Norton I.S. which we used for the prior 10 years or so.  That's the good news.  Here's the bad news.  The support from Kaspersky is subcontracted to Digital River and their Manila call center.  If you buy from Amazon, they will ask for your Kaspersky order number.  No Kaspersky order number, no assistance.  Period.  So, you are getting "Support-less" software when you buy it here.  I found this shocking.  My only question was where I had used 2 of the 3 seats or all 3 seats, since I had recently bought a new desktop, installed the software, but returned it due to a defect in the PC.  NO ONE AT DIGITAL RIVER COULD ANSWER MY SIMPLE QUESTION.  NOR DID THEY SEEM WILLING TO HELP.  So, the bottom line is that Amazon needs to look into this situation, because Kaspersky has instructed their call center not to assist customers who buy KIS software on Amazon.  It's as if it were counterfeit software.  So, IF YOU THINK YOU MIGHT EVER NEED SUPPORT, AT ANY TIME, then pay a few $$ more and buy this on the Kaspersky website, or get Norton Internet Security instead.  Meanwhile, I hope that Amazon Customer Service will look into this issue.  It is simple to verify what I have stated, just call the toll free number for Kaspersky support and ask them.	-1
I have used Kaspersky for a couple of years and this is a truly disappointing product. The main issue is that all the extra features (Smart Money, Anti-banner, Virtual Keyboard, etc) do not work with Mozilla! These features do work with Chrome but I do not like that browser. And my biggest complain is that this new software seems to be slowing down my system. In the past I had never had any of these issues. I am definitely going to look for new anti virus.	-1
I was with Kaspersky for many years. Until I ran into severe problems. My license was ending and I bought many in the pass. I try to enter them, but they where expired. I still had 1 month left on my actual key. But even that wouldn't work. I called support they send me a file to remove kis 2013, but I had 2014. I tryed it. Then when I rebooted after installed. I lost the keyboard. Long wait with tech support to really help, their answered was to reinstall Windows 8.1 from 0. I ended up fixing it myselve. Then I reinstalled 2014, entered my actual still working key, I reboot. My mouse and the keyboard was dead. I believe they do that to punish people that try different key #. But I owed all those I tryed. I then really had to refresh my pc. Oh, I just lost all my programs installed. But I lost 2 weeks reinstalling and troubleshooting.  Goodbye Kaspersky, never again.	-1
If you already have Windows 8, you can certainly try out this upgrade but be warned that there is no 'Windows Experience Index' or 'Windows Backup' feature.  However if you are on Windows 7, please do not buy Windows 8 or 8.1 to replace your Windows 7 machine. Along with the lost WEI or the backup you lose the start menu, Aero effects, native DVD playback and several things have changed to make the OS more troublesome to use.  If you are running Windows XP and wish to upgrade to a more current system i suggest getting&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Windows-7-Professional-SP1-32bit-Full-System-Builder-OEM-DVD-1-Pack/dp/B004Q0PSMK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Windows 7 Professional SP1 32bit (Full) System Builder OEM DVD 1 Pack</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Windows-7-Home-Premium-SP1-64bit-OEM-System-Builder-DVD-1-Pack/dp/B004Q0PT3I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Windows 7 Home Premium SP1 64bit (OEM) System Builder DVD 1 Pack</a>&nbsp;instead. I will note that you should buy from Amazon directly, not from a seller as it is easy to buy from someone who is not selling a genuine copy.  Those are OEM system builders and while these OS's are tied to the same motherboard i suggest getting these instead of a W8 machine or a copy of W8. Your best bet is to build your own machine, there are tutorials on how to build your own PC and you will have a good chance of saving yourself from a headache, i mean unless of course you happened to like W8 or 8.1 in a store promoting that. I am offering an alternative for those that are too scared to use Windows 8 or 8.1.  There are a few good things about Windows 8/8.1 like multiple apps running side by side, new task manager, and a fast boot. You can also tweak the OS so you can have a start menu by searching for 'classic shell' or 'start menu for Windows 8'. Be aware though that it is not 100% safe as you do not want to download any programs without having an Antivirus protection and listen out to the negative reviews as they can be helpful in making the decision of sticking with Windows 8/8.1.	-1
I build professional extreme computers, from 10 - 20 per month. I have loaded all of them with Windows 8 pro 64 bit system builder. I have actually grown to love it. After one of my builds, I decided to try the final version of the beta 8.1. What a joke! So you get the start button back. Big deal. It is not functional like the older versions of windows. Additionally, 8.1 is app oriented, and I use my computers for business and gaming, and maintenance on other computers, so the apps other than Skydive are not a big deal for me.  If you are young, and like the apps in Windows 8, then maybe it is for you, but not for me. I ran the 8.1 for about 3 hours playing with it, and frankly I liked the original version better. Additionally, I was unable to download the 8.1 update from a local Windows 8 account. I had to sign into my Microsoft account, which is a load of crap. I am also a Microsoft tech partner, and I have posted about 20 different important fixes on forums regarding Windows 8 pro, and as bad as you Windows 7 lovers are going to hate this, I love Windows 8 pro, just the way it is.  It works well, it is very fast, and has no driver problems!  8.1 is a joke. I ran it 3 hours, and I reformatted the SSD and did a new clean install of plain Windows 8 pro. In my opinion, Windows 8 is a good operating system with a very fast interface. 8.1 is all about apps and the Windows store. It is more marketing hype than it is functional. Obviously it is as are all big corporations; about making more money selling apps, and not about making the O/S more functional. So if you are not an app hog, you will not be happy with this update. I personally, cannot recommend this update to anybody that is happy with Windows 8 or 8 pro, and if your computer is used for business, 8.1 is not necessary, nor does it fix anything, because if 8 is properly loaded it will work trouble free.  I have about 80 machines I have loaded with 8 pro, and not one return, not one blue screen, and no calls on how to use this or that. One really good tip. I you have a question about Windows 8, Google the question and read. Most of the fixes through Google are actually better than the fixes offered by Microsoft, and some of the Google searches will actually take you to the Microsoft forums where the fixes will be accurate and good. If you don't have Primo PDf download it for free. Then you will be able to print those fixes to PDF and save them to your computer info file or a file you create.  If you do download International Primo PDF, you will also have to download the older Net Framework versions for Primo to work. This creates a problem with disk cleanup, because there is no restart to configure those older Net Framework updates. The fix is easy.  Run Disk Cleanup, check all the boxes, and when you hit the delete key it will hang on the windows update cleanup. Let it run for about 10 minutes in that position. Then go to your power button in Windows 8, and restart the computer. You will get a light blue screen which says preparing to configure Windows do not turn off your computer. Believe me, don't turn it off or reset it, or you will ruin you load of Windows 8 with log file errors. Let it run, and it will take from 50 minutes to an hour and 1/2. Whatever you do, do not touch the machine until it reboots. When it reboots, you will have all of the updates configured properly, and an error free machine. you can then confirm that by opening the command prompt in the administrator position, and type sfc /scannow. This will run the system file checker and let you know if you have an error free load of Windows 8, and if you did it right, you will.  Dale in Texas	-1
At 199 dollars, this is not a good buy.  You can buy Windows 8 Pro - Upgrade for 99 dollars.  Windows 8.1 (the update) is free. So if you own Windows XP or Windows 7, why would you buy the full version?  Be aware that even with Windows 8 Pro, you don't get Windows Media Center included.  So if you upgrade from Windows 7, you have to pay an additional 10 dollars to get this functionality that you already had under Windows 7.  You now get a start button, but not a start menu with Windows 8.1.  You are for the most part still stuck with the tiles.  There is a lot of hype with the improvements to Windows 8.1, but you are still getting an operating system that is primarily oriented towards tablet and phone use, i.e. a touch screen interface.  If you are using productivity software such as Microsoft Office and an email program, you will probably be much happier with Windows 7.  You can upgrade from Windows XP to Windows 7 for a lot less than this and you get Windows Media Center without having to pay an extra 10 dollars.  There are still thousands of Windows 7 upgrades out there that you can obtain for less than half the cost of Windows 8.1 Pro.  I cannot recommend Windows 8.1 to anyone who is looking for ease of use on a desktop computer.  Windows 8 and 8.1 are Microsoft's hybrid operating system which is trying to standardize the operating systems for computers, tablets, and phones.  As you look at Microsoft's share of the tablet and phone operating system you can readily see that this all in one approach with premium prices is simply not working.  If Microsoft gives Windows 8 users the ability to effortlessly switch to either a touch style (tiled) interface or a classic Windows start menu, they can win back the confidence of their customer base and sell a lot more copies of Windows 8.  Microsoft must also make Windows Media Center a part of the operating system once again.  Otherwise, any customer who is currently running Windows Media Center on his or her home entertainment pc will have to jump through hoops and pay a premium just to get the same functionality already available through Windows 7.  Save yourself a lot of headache and stay with Windows 7 until Microsoft gives a true option for a classic Windows desktop interface and restores Windows Media Center as part of the operating system.  At 199 dollars and still not including a full Windows classic desktop option or Windows Media Center, this software is drastically overpriced and under-featured.  UPDATED INFORMATION:  Below are quotes from a CNET review of Windows 8.1 concerning the tiles, the start button and the classic Windows 7 interface as well as their observation about Windows 7 vs Windows 8.1:  "The split between the touch-friendly tiles and throwback desktop mode is still awkward, and the OS is hard to use without a touch screen. While welcome, the new Start button doesn't behave like the classic version..."  "What you're left with is an OS that still feels like an awkward compromise between the traditional "desktop" Windows and the touch-centric, tablet-optimized future that looks and feels exactly like Windows Phone."  "If you have a legacy Windows 7 system and haven't taken the Windows 8 plunge yet, there's still no reason to."  Full review is at [...]	-1
Windows "upgrades" are WORSE THAN USELESS.  I had to buy Windows 8 with my new tablet, and it is absolute trash-much harder to even access your desktop than with Windows 7, and it keeps slamming unwanted applications onto the screen when I try to access my desktop. Very user unfriendly.  When I had to get Windows 7 with a new computer, several programs I owned--including the rather costly Corel PhotoPaint--would not work. In other words, Microsoft essentially destroyed a couple of hundred dollars worth of software for me. The operating system has bugs too, e.g. when I try to select a default program to run a certain type of file, the "always use this program" box is grayed out.  Microsoft Office "upgrades" also are like throwing money down a sewer. The 2010 version of Excel does not do anything substantially different than the XP version, and actually has less functionality in terms of importing other kinds of files (e.g. Quattro Pro) than the XP version. The last thing I want to do is get Windows 8 or higher and then discover that Quattro Pro, which I have to use for my financial records (because I can't import the files in Excel) won't work any more. There are other problems as well, e.g. "Search my computer" NEVER works for the Help function in Office. It is clear that Microsoft is running on name recognition only rather than the quality of its products.	-1
We decided to update the Win O/S bootcamped on my wife's Macbook Air, as the Win 7 install had been corrupted during an automated update.  What a huge mistake to jump to Widows 8.1 !!!  The O/S no longer played well with the Air.  Support of OpenOffice was ... corrupting files.  We pulled the plug of 8, and installed 7 ... and what an improvement in our experience.  Were it not for business apps my wife has need of running, Windows would begone.	-1
If you have Windows 7 or XP, you can buy Windows 8.1 Pro (look for the Windows 8 Pro upgrade if you already own XP or Windows 7 - it's much cheaper - you can update it to Windows 8.1 for free).  Microsoft decided to no longer include Windows Media Center as part of Windows 8.  So if you buy this and decide that you want to have a home entertainment pc, you would have to buy the Windows Pro Pack for 99 bucks just to get Windows Media Center.  If you buy Windows 8.1 Pro, you can get Windows Media Center for 10 bucks extra.  If you already have a version of Windows 7, you would be better off to simply install it on your computer rather than this.  If you are updating from Windows XP, I recommend that you find a Windows 7 Upgrade package rather than install Windows 8.1 on your computer. Microsoft has stopped selling Windows 7 upgrades (because they were out-selling Windows 8), so you may have to buy a Windows 7 OEM version to do a clean install of Windows 7 on your computer.  Windows 7 comes with Windows Media Center as part of the operating system and has an interface well suited for use on a standard non-touch screen computer.  With Windows 8.1, you now get a start button, but the start menu is still not back.  Even more important than the lack of a start menu, you can either have the tiles or an awkward stripped-down desktop choice.  Microsoft still has not realized that a computer is most productive with an operating system designed for a mouse and keyboard interface and that a tablet and a phone come with a touch screen and work best with a touch interface.  The all in one approach will make some power users and early adapters happy, but an every day user who just wants to run multiple applications in actual windows (instead of awkward full-screen apps), including MS Office, email, and dozens of other programs will be much happier with Windows 7.  Windows 8.1 is a bit friendlier than Windows 8, but it is still an operating system that gives the user an awkward desktop interface instead of a classic start menu and takes away the valuable feature of Windows Media Center only to charge you an additional 99 dollars to get it back by buying Windows 8 Pro Pack.  UPDATED INFORMATION: Below are quotes from a CNET review of Windows 8.1 concerning the tiles, the start button and the classic Windows 7 interface as well as their observation about Windows 7 vs Windows 8.1:  "The split between the touch-friendly tiles and throwback desktop mode is still awkward, and the OS is hard to use without a touch screen.

Full review is at [...]  If Microsoft were to restore the option for the classic start menu and include Windows Media Center as part of the operating system, I would be inclined to recommend Windows 8.1 as an operating system that I would use.  However, in its current state, I must agree with CNET that if you have a legacy Windows 7 system and haven't taken the Windows 8 plunge yet, there is still no compelling reason to do so based on the changes in Windows 8.1.  UPDATE December 3, 2013:  As of November 30th, here is the breakdown of Microsoft operating systems in use:  *Windows 7  46.64 percent of pc's *Windows XP  31.22 percent of pc's *Windows 8  6.66 percent of pc's *Windows Vista  3.57 percent of pc's *Windows 8.1  2.64 percent of pc's  Windows 8.1 is faster and has some improved security features over Windows 7. However, as you can see, even Windows Vista has a larger installed share of the market than Windows 8.1 as of November 30, 2013.  Windows customers are waiting for Microsoft to give them a choice of whether they want to use the tablet (tiled) interface or a fully functioning desktop O/S complete with a start menu as an option.  Although Windows 8.1 made some improvements and I could tolerate it (however awkward it might be), I am staying with Windows 7 because it already includes a friendly desktop with Start Menu and Windows Media Center for recording live tv.  Why should customers lose functionality or incur additional expenses with Windows 8?  The rejection of Windows 8 and 8.1 has gotten so bad that sources say Microsoft is finally talking about bringing back the start menu in Windows 8.2.  See "Microsoft may finally bring back full Start menu with Windows 8.2"  [...]  Computer manufacturers have become so disgusted with the whole Windows 8 and 8.1 mess that they are now talking about selling computers that run both Windows 8 and Android. (Note: this can't be good news for Microsoft!) See "PC makers plan rebellion against Windows at 2014 CES, analysts say."  [...]  My predictions are that we will also see an end to Windows RT.  There will be a desktop Windows 8.(something) and a Windows 8 Phone.  One or the other is going to end up on Microsoft tablets.  Right now there are full versions of Windows 8.1 running on tablets, so it should be interesting to see which O/S runs on Windows tablets in the future.	-1
I used almost every Microsoft operating system since MSDOS. Windows 8.1 is comparable to Vista, Windows ME, and Windows 3.0. All were losers. . The biggest problem was the elimination of familiar functions that existed in the past generations of Windows. When it took me 25 minutes to reset the screen resolution and another 20 minutes to locate the setup for my wireless router, I threw up my hands, deleted the upgrade, and went back to Windows 7. . The second biggest problem was incorporating tiles on a desktop monitor. For small screen tablets, this feature is essential. For a large desktop monitor, it is useless. Most manufacturers do not make touch sensitive features on large monitors.	-1
Based on my experience with Windows 7, including updates (Compattelrunner.exe) that could well be construed as malware because of their effects on computer performance, and also the fact that some of my older but very expensive software didn't work (Corel PhotoPaint) or worked poorly (MathCAD) when I switched from XP to Windows 7, I do not regard these "upgrades" as anything more than an opportunity to pay Microsoft for cosmetic changes and often worse performance. Windows 8 (on my tablet) interjects pop-ups into the middle of my work that are unrelated to my work.  On a side note, Office 10 really has no more features than the previous version of Office (2003) I had, but cost roughly $200. It doesn't really do more from what I can see and, in some cases, it does less.   I just filed a complaint with the FTC because I found, for the third time, Compattelrunner.exe running on my computer, having been reinstalled without my authorization.  "Microsoft updates install a program called compattelrunner.exe on my computer without my authorization even though my update settings say, "Download important updates but let me choose whether to install them." Compattelrunner.exe serves no legitimate or beneficial purpose, and causes serious performance problems (applications running slowly or freezing up); I caught it on my computer this afternoon consuming 71% of my computer's CPU (central processing unit) capacity. I have previously, with considerable effort on my part to identify the problem's source, deleted this program but now, and this is no less than the third time, found it on my computer again. I have posted complaints to Microsoft about this but no corrective action has been taken to prevent the problem from recurring. Isn't there, in the long run, a law against installing unwanted software on somebody else's computer?"  In addition, the second screenshot shows that Microsoft is lying to its customers about the nature of updates.	-1
This is probably the worst operating system ever inflicted on people. Just read the other reviews... My wife's laptop has it and it is a complete pain to try to use --and I've been using PCs since they were invented.	-1
So it is months later and do I like it now? No. I absolutely despise it and the horse it rode in on. I can say that I am more or less used to 8.1 but getting there was a huge productivity killer, so many internet queries, "Where did they put create a system image?", etc. Worse, Microsoft keeps on nagging me to upgrade to Win 10. I spent half a morning learning how to kill their pestering. Do I have anything good to say about Win 8.1? No, nope, nyet, nada, zip.  Getting rid of all the crapware and Microsoft store clutter took too long. There should be a "decrappify my new PC" switch. Apple OS's aren't any better so your best bet is a Linux distro and Libraoffice. I use Knoppix, but for my next machine I might start with UBUTU.  BTW out of the blue office stopped working on my win 7 pc a few days ago. Reinstalling did not help. What happened? It looks like some sort of maintenance failed and corrupted it. Win 10 stuff?   What I wrote when I was first using Win 8.1: Tried it, hate it, a bucket of tar. You can't swim, you can't tread water, you only sink. I've been using Microsoft releases (and numerous other operating systems since DOS. Most were small increments of frustration, new bugs and a few new goofy features, but not Win 8. It is just plain ugly. So what is wrong with those executives at MS? Why do they feel compelled to make us learn a new way to do the same thing every three years? I have two machines, a slow old Win 7 machine and a screaming fast new Win 8 PC. The fast machine has an SSD, tons of memory, fast i7 processor and so on. Boots in a flash and then I try to do anything, and Win 8's new "features" stop me dead in my tracks. I spend the day querying the internet reading solutions from other unhappy Win 8 users. (BTW, I am a computer professional who has used numerous other operating systems. I give this one the prize for being the most annoying.) Does anyone like Win 8 you ask? The Win 8 project manager who should be sent to Siberia? I have a job to do and buying a fast PC slows me down because of Win 8. Often I boot the old Win 7 machine just so I can get my work done. Bottom line, do not buy Win 8 and pray that Win 10 is better or for a sure bet, find a copy of Win 7. Wish I had a spare, I'd blow away Win 8 faster than you can say SSD.	-1
Be ready for major frustration.  Windows 8.1 embeds Internet Explorer 11 which uses Shockwave Flash Object.  When Shockwave Flash Object is enabled, Internet Explorer continually freezes and give the dialog box "Internet Explorer Has Stopped Working."  Sometimes it will recover the webpage, sometimes not.  This may be avoided by disabling the Ad-on Shockwave Flash Object.  However, then, some videos, including some videos on Facebook will not load.  And, some entire websites will not open.  Consequently, one is forced to repeatedly enable and disable Shockwave Flash Object.  Before discovering this problem, my frustration was even greater, IE 11 continually froze up, and I did not know why.  Clearly, Microsoft should have cleared the bugs from Windows 8.1 before taking it to market.  Note, I just discovered that IE 11 would not post this review with Shockwave Flash Object disabled.  I had to enable it to complete the post.	-1
Won't let me install any programs so 1 star.	-1
HORRID GARBAGE  (that's being kind)	-1
Totally blows as an operating system. MS has done more for Apple with this release than Apple ever has.	-1
If I could give this -double infinity stars I would. I want to like it, and it's not the OS. It's what it and hardware advances have done to netbooks. I had a HP Mini 210-1010NR that it sold itself. I saw it and I knew I was not leaving without it, the Windows 7 Premium Home Windows Anytime Upgrade, and a purchase protection plan. It sold itself and I was very happy, until I killed it by happily using it while opening a Dr. Pepper. Windows 8.1 and Bay Trail Atom-replacement CPUs (in the case of the HP Stream 11 a Celeron) took something that was perfect and turn it into a steaming pile and the worst part is that people don't realize what they're using is a new model netbook! Windows 8.1 works as well as it is going to work, which for what it is, is as Microsoft expects, but it replacing the good old netbook with crap that people actually like when I loved netbooks as they used to be with Windows 7 Starter and the Anytime Upgrade to Home Premium and 1024x600 pixel resolution just can't stand. Thanks Windows 8.1 for replacing the netbook with crap!	-1
I hate it, yes, I hate it. Yes its not software but Microsoft store on line right in my face when you start computer. Yes, I immediately  deleted most of the icons. Yes, I hated when Microsoft forced me to open their account like they pay my salary. Yes, the only positive about this is cheaper price for computer. And sure you cannot install Windows 7 without crashing everything.	-1
I have the misfortune of owning a laptop that shipped with Windows 8.1.  It isn't as bad as you've probably heard, it's much worse.  The user interface is completely different and much more confusing.  Installing a third party program, Classic Shell, helps get that back to "normal".  However it is unstable, buggy, and prone to getting stuck in loops where if it locks up it reboots itself... again and again.  I got stuck in this loop after a driver update but apparently this loop issue has existed since Windows 8 with no fix in sight.  Microsoft managed to mess this up even worse than Vista or ME.  I think I'm finally to the point where I wish I'd bought an Apple.  Avoid Windows, they just can't get it right.	-1
I can't stand Windows 8.1!  It really has such a different 'feel' to it, as if i'm using a smartphone or tablet.  It is not as intuitive or elegant as previous Windows incarnations for the PC, including Win 7, Win Vista, or Win XP, which were all a pleasure to use.  Microsoft should offer Win 7 in the meantime for those that are frustrated with Win 8.1!  I am forced to use my older Win Vista or Win 7 PC's, which have the better, more intuitive OS's!	-1
I almost fell off my chair when I tried Windows 8.1, it is so awful.  I have been using Microsoft Windows since version 3.1, 95, 98, NT, 2000, XP, ... and this is their WORST ever. I am going to "up-downgrade" to Windows 7 on this new HP computer that came shipped with Windows 8.1.  It's taking me hours to figure out simple maneuvers, like how to go back to the main tile view after opening an "app"-lication.  Sorry Microsoft, but a tablet interface does not belong on a desktop computer that is intended for serious work.	-1
Frustrating just to look for the regular programs. Why do they want to turn a computer into a phone??	-1
I can't believe computer users all over the world have not revolted over windows 8 and windows 8.1.  What a bug infected POS. I have had it for one year of continuous problems and hour after hour of tech support help.  I am not literate in all the technology to explain the problems I've had (have).  Please, if you value you sanity, stay away from this software.	-1
What would you think if you bought a new car and immediately had over a hundred updates to make it run properly?  Buy Windows 8.1 and you will enjoy several hours of upgrades.  Other features include the system freezing when you run disk clean up.  The system freezing on shutdown.  The new GUI is so difficult to use with all the APP format that you swear you will never buy a PC again.  Windows 8.1 is the best marketing campaign to boost Mac sales.  I am computer literate and find this design counter intuitive.  Others I know feel the same way about Windows 8.1.  There is a free product on the market that allows you to reconfigure Windows 8 back to the previous styles.  The product is called Windows Classic Shell and it lets you choose the GUI format you want to work with, XP, Windows 7....  This is easy to install and does leave some Windows 8 functionality.  You can also easily switch to Windows 8 GUI if so desired.  Bottom line - buy a Mac, their software is intuitive, professionally designed and built.  Best of all, it doesn't freeze up all the time.	-1
Got Windows 8/8.1 for my laptop.  This OS is really designed from the bottom up for a phone/tablet.  The user interface is very much touch screen oriented.  At least with 8.1 it now boots to the desktop  instead of the tiled start screen.  Media player is gone, unless you buy the pro version or pay extra bucks to purchase it separately.  My wife's biggest complaint is that you can not play any of the games unless you are logged on to the Internet.  Even single player games like Solitare will not run unless you have an Internet connection.  Guess I'll wait and see what Windows 9 looks like before updating my desktop computers.  (If I wanted a tablet OS, I would stick with Android based.  It is SO much faster than Windows 8).	-1
So i have gotten the opportunity (unfortunately) to work on some 8.1 machines. (well rather the first incarnation of W8) and coming from a tech this is about as dysfunctional as an OS gets. I have hit roadblocks before in computers, but normally i could find a way out of it, but this you just cant. Microsoft should have been bankrupt by now, but somehow selling 200 million licenses it's hard to tell whether they are succeeding or not with this OS, but with the constant complaints i get on this OS it's a wonder that MS continues on with this W8x metro/start screen nonsense.  To start off, i had questions about how to upgrade from W8 to 8.1. Well the first mistake that MS had made was instead of doing normal service packs in the update section of Windows, they decided to throw the update in the store. This is where there has major complications, every machine that i have tried to upgrade to W8.1 has failed! Every single one of them had BSODs and all attempts to restore W8 has failed. One machine had data corruption causing a client to be forced to start all over again. I myself had a Linux machine where i ended up testing W8 and 8.1 on and my Linux OS disappeared! I don't know what kind of bull MS is doing but they have morons for techs and this should have been expected after all the rave about certain updates bricking some PCs. Every other Windows version had virtually no problems updating and the service packs were installed without a hitch. I'm not done yet. One machine i updated had everything wiped, it was like a new OS had been installed and any attempt for data recovery failed. Luckily that client backed everything up but we both were surprised.  Nothing about this is making any sense and Microsoft is having a death wish because either they forgot to add some drivers in or forget that some people don't upgrade hardware or whatever it was, this is all on MS. It doesn't matter how you install W7, get updates it still works and functions the way it should. However 8.1 is a mess. Not to mention it is not worth getting because of the UI changes. Why would you install 3rd party software before system updates and properly protecting yourself is beyond me. With less than 10% of the market share for W8, MS is scrambling around trying to make users happy this fall by restoring a start menu. However, it will have that metro/start screen mumbo jumbo junk that should just be abolished from existence. I won't ever use this or MS protects in general. I have decided to switch to Linux, a far more secure and stable OS and while that too is a large learning curve, it beats trying to get 8.1 to work without your data being gone or having to go without visiting facebook for a week trying to figure out the cause of the problem. I diagnose this is W8x. Even the developers for it wants to see W8x in a data grave. If you think W8x is the future, well it's a pretty bleak one because sooner or later MS will find some way to annoy you and you too will be going towards a free, open source platform such as Linux. No expiration dates, no having to reprogram your programs to work with the latest and greatest Windows. And best of all Linux doesn't cost anything to use. All it takes is a lot of patience but in the end you will be glad you have switched to a free platform that is truly the future of PCs and will evolve, properly.	-1
Microsoft did not learn much from its earlier abortive Vista release.  Windows 8 is a completely new approach to using Windows and it hampers function for desktop users to assist tablet users.  Windows 7 and XP users will be frustrated and often lost.  Microsoft was negligent and typically arrogant in not providing an alternative choice to select a more intuitive Windows 7 like interface option under Windows 8 for desktop users.  If you are so frustrated with Windows 8  that you are ready to reinstall Windows 7 over Windows 8  or return your new computer for a Windows 7 version, a good application that makes Windows 8 a little more usable and makes it operate more like windows 7 is called Classic Shell and is a free download (another ap is Pokki).  Ironically, Windows 7 computers are not any cheaper, although they are being clearance out, because of the high learning curve with Windows 8 and associated preference of desktop users (as apposed to tablet users) for Windows 7.  On the positive side, Windows 8 is more compact and a little faster and a little less buggy than Windows 7 (why it got one more star than one only).  Those that are willing to retrain and start all over learning Windows with Windows 7 and take the time to customize their start menu, may eventually like Windows 8.	-1
I have been a long time user of this product.  In fact, I have over 17 registered products with them.  This version is incomplete and the basic function of syncing directories between computers does not work UNLESS you buy cloud space from Acronis.  There are many, many folks out there that have reported this and other issues with this recent version.  I did ask for a refund, one of the RARE times I was so frustrated with a product that I went through the effort of asking.  Predictably, I was told because I was outside of the 30 day window they could not accommodate me.  Now, I have a proven track record over the years with their products, there is a wealth of other users that have the same issues I complained about and yet, they would refuse me the cost of their defective product in the hopes that I might stay for the next version or even an update of this version.  So, save your money, look for any of the other alternatives and stay away from the 2015 version of this app.	-1
It is incredible that in 2014 a company can place a product in the market as buggy as this.  Bought 2014 family pack. Installed on the first computer and configured some backups. On that computer even if the backup fails, everything is green on the main dashboard. A simple change in parameters of a backup is not possible without corrupting the other backups. Backup from a network server does not work. TI keeps failing connecting to the server, even if when configuring the backup there is no problem accessing the server. Backup to a network server takes an eternity. Network usage 3%... Random crashes and backup configuration corruption.  This software is unusable. DO NOT BUY IT. Looking for alternatives...	-1
FYI: Im a retired computer programmer of both mainframes and PCs. Not a computer novice.  Ive been a True Image user since version 2008. Since then Ive upgraded and used the following versions: 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2014.  I always I felt the interface was user unfriendly. When 2014 came out I thought, maybe the interface is improved so I purchased the upgrade and have been frustrated ever since. In my opinion 2014 is the worst interface yet. Terrible! In fact, I finally gave up and went back to using version 2011.  I requested a refund for my 2014 but Acronis said I took too long to determine that the new version was the worst yet. I only backup once every month so I exceeded the 30 days. Fair enough but is that good customer support? You decide.  My advice is the same as many others here. Avoid this like the plague and don't even think of upgrading if you already have an older version.	-1

The "Acronis Extended Capacity Manager" which "allows your operating system [sic] support large capacity disks with the MBR partition style" (quoting from paragraph 8.8 of the User's Guide, poor grammar and all) has the "unadvertised feature" of disabling the RAID configuration of a computer.  My Intel motherboard (Model DH67BL) with a Windows 7 64 bit operating system running "Intel Rapid Storage Technology" software allowed me to add or remove backup storage drives (both MBR and GPT configurations) without affecting system operation.  But after adding "Acronis True Image 2014" this feature ceased to work - I had to shut down the computer to disconnect an eSATA hard drive.  I removed the "Acronis True Image 2014" software, was warned in the process that I would loose the "benefits" of "Extended Capacity Manager", rebooted, and then RAID worked as before.  Therefore "Extended Capacity Manager" appears to "manage" hard drives you didn't ask or want it to.  The other big issue - backup filenames - was already cited by previous reviewers.  But, silly me, I thought Acronis may have been prompted by such negative feedback to fix that issue by the time I tried their software.  Not so.  When I did an initial full "File backup", it ignored the backup name I had specified and chose its own.  This can get very confusing when you back up more than one computer and you are not allowed to use your own file naming convention to keep the backups differentiated from each other.  That was bad enough.  But then when I did an incremental "File backup", the Acronis software suddenly decided to use the name I had asked it to use in the first place.  The consequence was another FULL file backup using the specified name.  So, thus far, two full backups and no incremental backups.  I didn't try a third time to see what it would do.  This "unadvertised feature" reminded me of a "one-armed bandit" gambling machine.  When I did a "Disk and Partition" backup the Acronis software also ignored the backup name I had specified.  I didn't try an incremental backup for this; I already had the two foregoing reasons to remove the software.  If anyone wants a recommendation for viable backup software, I have two.  For disk image backups, StorageCraft's ShadowProtect software works very well.  This is sold by the Manufacturer only.  For file backups, Genie-Soft's Backup Manager Professional works very well.  Amazon.com used to carry it and I have a positive review posted for it.  It can still be purchased from the Manufacturer.  Norton/Symantec has lost the edge they used to have in this market since their Ghost 14.0 product.  And Acronis . . . well, who would have thought to invent backup software that tries to reconfigure your computer's previously-working hard drive operation and features a random backup filename generator that actuates when you try an incremental backup?	-1

Having used Acronis for a few years, I find I can no longer recommend it because of the manufacturer's uncaring attitude about the need to fix an intrusive bug that has been in existence for at least two years. It is commonly referred to as the "Operations in Progress" bug. I sense that Acronis regards it as a "feature," not a "bug."  The problem is with the backup scheduler. Often security-conscious people connect USB drives only for the purpose of making full backups; then they disconnect them to keep them truly safe from power surges, fire, viruses, and other catastrophes--sometimes storing the backups in a vault or off-site. Indeed, this is considered a "best practice" in the IT field. So strongly is this practice recommended that a security audit of a computer site will typically call out the operation for not having at least some of its backups stored off-site. Yet, the Acronis backup scheduler always assumes that the backup should be connected. When you attempt to shut down the computer on a day that a backup is set to occur, if the external drive is not connected, suddenly a message will appear during shutdown stating: "Operations are in Progress...Please Wait...." And wait, and wait, and wait.  The message causes confusion because it appears to be a Windows message and is not identified as being displayed by Acronis software. Moreover, it does not state what is really going on. The message means: "Acronis is trying to access your external USB drive and will continue to try forever." This freezes the shutdown process, because the software is so lame that it does not time out. Eventually, you will have to physically power down the computer.  This has messed up Windows Updates a few times, because Windows update activities often occur during the shutdown and reboot processes.  One would hope that there would be a workaround. Why not set the scheduler to "never" do a backup? Tried that, but strangely, the scheduler does not retain a setting of "never"--it actually flips back to a default schedule cycle. It's as if the person writing this code wants to FORCE the customer into having a regular backup scheduling cycle. OK, what about disabling the scheduler process through msconfig? If you do that, Acronis True Image simply won't work. It has to have the scheduling process running in order to do a backup.  A web search on "operations in progress Acronis" will reveal the widespread irritation and inconvenience this bug has caused. Acronis has yet to come up with a solution that actually works.  It is ironic that a company specializing in a computer security product would work AGAINST the safest way of handling backups on a customer's own, variable schedule based on actual need--to disconnect and safely store the backup medium when the backup has completed. Again: the advantage of having a secure backup is eroded if the backup medium cannot be stored in a safe place away from the computer.  Do such catastrophes occur? Yes, all the time. That's why we make backups! I have personally seen cases where power surges have traveled through connecting cables to peripheral equipment and have fried them all. Not to speak of fires, floods, tornadoes, theft, etc.  By contrast, Acronis has done years of backups and several restores without incident, and has a clever disk cloning operation that seamlessly clones to a different-sized disk.  The bottom line is: customers should not have to put up with this. If the code is written well, it should be simple and inexpensive to add a timeout of, say one minute. Or to change the settings to truly allow the scheduler to be turned off. The "Operations in Progress" message could be changed to something meaningful. Or preferably, Acronis should implement all three of these solutions. They could be distributed to existing customers as an update. But it hasn't happened.  If it has not been corrected by the time you wish to make a purchase, look for a different product.	-1
Acronis started out with good software years ago, and the underlying backup software still does what it did originally. But there are still many design flaws, especially if you need to change parameters for an existing backup, or simply want to use the existing backup parameters but start fresh with new backup sets.  The user interface is an improvement over what they had in the past. Surprisingly, it took them years to get their messages comprehensible. The types of mistakes and the way they butchered the language was pitiful. Even though the interface is cleaner, they still haven't done a good job allowing users to upgrade, since the interface gets cluttered with garbage.  If you get things set up properly, Acronis can handle full, incremental and differential backups. But it can't handle a scheme that incorporates all three. Even mainframes did that decades ago. It also has many utilities, most of which are readily available as freeware with other software.  Once you have things established, you can schedule regular backups, and optionally schedule validation of backups. Or you could try to remember to run backups on your own. The problem with scheduled backups is that Acronis put in a potentially fatal flaw that can render your computer inoperable for long periods of time and cause you to lose data as a result. With almost all software, if you try to reboot Windows, the OS will tell you if something is keeping Windows from shutting down. You will then have a chance to abort the shutdown or force a restart. Acronis designed things so that when you get to the point later that you'd see a screen with a message about shutting down, you will instead see a message saying "operations are in progress." It's made to look like an OS message, just as you'd see when Windows tells you it's applying fixes and tells you not to shut off your computer. Indeed there's no way to tell that it's even an Acronis message and there's no way to get out of it. So your computer can remain unusable for hours or longer. If the current operation finishes (such as validating a backup) then Acronis still won't let your computer finish rebooting. It will go on to the next scheduled task and keep going down the list until all of them are done. So if you back up your OS disk, then back up your documents or photos separately, you might have it go through several backups and validations before you can use your computer. In the mean time, if you have activity that can't wait, such as work you must do, or a scheduled TV program to record, or something that needs to access dynamic data that won't be there later, you will be out of luck with no way to make up for it later. Acronis will let itself finish, but it won't let those other tasks happen.  Even worse, you might be rebooting because something's not working properly on your system. After a while you might notice a pattern. For example, every time that Media Center can't play a file and asks you to reboot, you notice the "operations..." message. It won't take long for you to figure out that the problem itself is occurring only when TIB is running. Thus they are causing the problems in the first place, making you think you need to reboot, not letting you reboot, and not letting your computer work until they say so.  For me, this "operations are in progress..." nonsense is enough to keep me from recommending this product. Acronis has dug their heels in so deep on this one that they won't acknowledge that it's a design flaw. Instead, they keep blaming users for not understanding that "it's supposed to happen" because "it's designed that way."	-1

I expected a difficult program, since it is labeled "GMBH" (made in Germany-Having lived there 18 years, I expected it to be difficult.  I was not disappointed.  In order to activate it, you must type 8 blocks of 8 letters and characters.  (8 X 8 =64!!!)!!!  This is more than awful, it is sublime!  I wanted to use the program, that's why I purchased it, not to take typing lessons!!  (I could have purchased a typing program for that..)  I had my HDD crash, and I  reformatted my drive and re-installed ll to have it crash again.  I then replaced the HDD and re-installed, but to have it crash  once again.  So I purchased a new Windows Install disc and wanted to re-install.  My license was used up.  I could not reinstall it.  So I attempted to send an e-mail to Acronis.  My God, it was even worse, they demanded the Country phone code, and practically my life history to send the stinking e-mail.  So I removed the program from my HDD and destroyed it.  I had enough problem getting everything else back on the system and working without having to go through all this.  It may be better than the older version (1 license) that I used 2 times.  But I recommend to anyone and all that if you want a truly frustrating program, purchase Acronis.  If you don't want all the trouble don't touch it with a 64 feet pole!	-1
Having used Acronis for a few years, I find I can no longer recommend it because of the manufacturer's uncaring attitude about the need  to fix an intrusive bug that has been in existence for at least two years. It is commonly referred to as the "Operations in Progress" bug. I sense that Acronis regards it as a "feature," not a "bug."  The problem is with the backup scheduler. Often security-conscious people connect USB drives only for the purpose of making full backups; then they disconnect them to keep them truly safe from power surges, fire, viruses, and other catastrophes--sometimes storing the backups in a vault or off-site.  Indeed, this is considered a "best practice" in the IT field.  So strongly is this practice recommended that a security audit of a computer site will typically call out the operation for not having at least some of its backups stored off-site. Yet, the Acronis backup scheduler always assumes that the backup should be connected. When you attempt to shut down the computer on a day that a backup is set to occur, if the external drive is not connected, suddenly a message will appear during shutdown stating:  "Operations are in Progress...Please Wait...."  And wait, and wait, and wait.  The message causes confusion because it appears to be a Windows message and is not identified as being displayed by Acronis software.  Moreover, it does not state what is really going on.  The message means:  "Acronis is trying to access your external USB drive and will continue to try forever."  This  freezes the shutdown process, because the software is so lame that it does not time out. Eventually, you will have to physically power down the computer.  This has messed up Windows Updates a few times, because Windows update activities often occur during the shutdown and reboot processes.  One would hope that there would be a workaround.  Why not set the scheduler to "never" do a backup?  Tried that, but strangely, the scheduler does not retain a setting of "never"--it actually flips back to a default schedule cycle.  It's as if the person writing this code wants to FORCE the customer into having a regular backup scheduling cycle. OK,  what about disabling the scheduler process through msconfig?  If you do that, Acronis True Image simply won't work.  It has to have the scheduling process running in order to do a backup.  A web search on "operations in progress Acronis" will reveal the widespread irritation and inconvenience this bug has caused.  Acronis has yet to come up with a solution that actually works.  It is ironic that a company specializing in a computer security product would work AGAINST the safest way of handling backups on a customer's own, variable schedule based on actual need--to disconnect and safely store the backup medium when the backup has completed. Again: the advantage of having a secure backup is eroded if the backup medium cannot be stored in a safe place away from the computer.  Do such catastrophes occur?  Yes, all the time. That's why we make backups! I have personally seen cases where power surges have traveled through connecting cables to peripheral equipment and have fried them all.  Not to speak of fires, floods, tornadoes, theft, etc.  By contrast, Acronis has done years of backups and several restores without incident, and has a clever disk cloning operation that seamlessly clones to a different-sized disk.  The bottom line is:  customers should not have to put up with this.  If the code is written well, it should be simple and inexpensive to add a timeout of, say one minute.  Or to change the settings to truly allow the scheduler to be turned off.  The "Operations in Progress" message could be changed to something meaningful. Or preferably, Acronis should implement all three of these solutions.  They could be distributed to existing customers as an update.  But it hasn't happened.  If it has not been corrected by the time you wish to make a purchase, look for a different product.	-1
I found it to be bad.  It doesn't have state-specific language.  And I couldn't figure out how to have an estate as the beneficiary.  So for that reason I give it a low rating.	-1
You can put together a basic will with this, no problem - so long as you get your "what does that mean" dictionary out.  But if you want to be specific about certain things, it doesn't really help you write it in "the legal way" and often doesn't even give you the option.  I guess there is no way around dealing with a dang lawyer for everything... including death!  Great.	-1
I will start by saying if you have very little assets, and are simply looking for basic protection and some simple powers of attorney and such, a basic unencumbered Will (your assets are paid for) then this software might be ok.  For the rest of the population that has children that will fight for there share and  assets that will require disposition before dispensation...well you need a lawyer. I thought this would allow me to do some basic will and healthcare forms and that the online trust software would fill in the other concerns. Unfortunately I found it just to basic. I'd like some assets sold and the money entrusted to care for our animals...and so forth. Not really an option here.  However I did find that estate planing with an attorney was not nearly as expensive as I thought. Around $300 for the will and $500 for trust and estate work. Yes this is not cheap but I'll admit I was expecting more. And given the finite nature of the documents I found the advice valuable and sound...where as the computer program here just did what I told it...	-1
Update 2:  Dropped to two stars die to Win 7 application freeze-ups in Coherence mode.  Choerence mode (integrating Win 7 windows with the Mac desktop) is problematic.  Windows applications become non-responsive, and sometimes will not come to the foreground.  At least  few times each day, I have to force quit a Windows program such as IE, Word, or Visio and restart it in order to force it to the workspace.  Another bug is when a the dialogue box for a Windows program pops open, it sometimes pops open in the background and cannot be brought to the workspace, which jams the appellation too.  I found this out by switching back to the normal Windows desktop view just to see an open dialogue box, or when I have shut down Windows to try to reset the desktop because of jammed applications (when shutting Windows down, Windows asks you what to do with the open dialogue box).  SO, Imust say I am becoming more and more frustrated with Parallels in Coherence Mode.  Next October, I will likely be taking a closer look at Fusion.  Update 1:  After a few weeks of use, I am noticing some erratic behavior when in Coherence Mode.  Coherence Mode allows WIndows programs to be in their own windows like Mac apps (i.e., rather than using the Windows desktop).  The problems I am noticing are: 1) Occasional non-responsive programs.  Word, Outlook, and IE 10 have each started to freeze up once in a while in Coherence Mode.  I have to force Windows to shut down to remedy this.  2) Erratic Start Menu behavior when in Coherence Mode.  When clicking on the Parallels icon in the Mac status bar a the top of the screen, with Start Menu sometimes won't appear at all, or it will appear in pieces and not be useable.  In this case, I have to exit and re-enter Coherence to be able to use the Start Menu.  All of these issues have started happening a couple of times per day.  Maybe it was one of the recent updates, but I'm hoping Parallels is looking into resolving these bugs soon.  --- This review is about the upgrade only.  If you want a review of Parallels in general, check out the many reviews under Parallels 8, since P8 and P9 are nearly identical products.  Rest assured, Parallels is invaluable and a fantastic product if you want to run Windows on your Mac.  I am the only employee out of 350 that uses a Mac as my primary computer at work, so I use Parallels extensively.  In the years I have used it, it has not failed me yet.  Just upgraded two Macs from P8 to P9.  The upgrade went seamlessly and without a hitch.  No Windows codes to enter, no broken links, and all of my Windows programs continue to operate fine.  My favorite mode (coherence) continues to operate the same as it did under P8.  Same with Full Screen and Modality.  The one hitch in full screen is that in P8, I could place the mouse at the top of the screen to pull down the Parallels menu bar; that doe snot seem to be working for me under P9.  I will work on that and update the review as appropriate.  Parallels advertises that the virtual machine moves faster, and that it shuts down more quickly.  I'm not sure that I noticed a performance bump overall, but the virtual machine does indeed shut down (or go to sleep) about 20% faster.  The only other thing I noticed after a week of use at work, is that my cloud drives (google and dropbox) now show up in Windows Explorer as "Google Drive (Mac)" etc.  Basically a shortcut to your cloud drives, which you could accomplish just as easily under P8.  I have found that the set of "new features" in P9 is pretty minimal.  The main reason to upgrade would be if you want use Parallels with Mavericks or Windows 8.1.  The folks at Parallels have a good thing going with the timing of their upgrades...  You have to upgrade Parallels once per year to get the latest and greatest operating systems to work.  I think of it as a $50 annual subscription.  If you don't plan on going to Mavericks or Win 8.1, this is a skippable upgrade.  It's a very good product and I use it extensively, but the upgrade is not spectacular.	-1
Pros: Works well.  Cons: Purchased Parallels 9 and received an activation code in May 2014. Installed program successfully.   Mac crashed September 5, 2014 and I lost the program.   Sept 5 I tried to download Parallels 9 from their website but there was no link to 9. The download only permitted Parallels   10, at a hefty upgrade price.   Support/contact/mail numbers were not functional on their website....I was going to ask for a link to the 9 download.  Net: I had the program for 4 months and was forced to pay an upgrade fee to get 10, if I wanted to use Parallels. My original price of $79.95 was revealed by Parallels to be only a 4 month license. I feel cheated, had, taken to the cleaners.	-1
Unhappy - installed this and after 10 more days of business as usual my system was infected with the ICE virus, requiring me to completely erase my system, files, and all memory after the PC was new and start all over again.  Kinda thought the purpose of this was to prevent viruses and after 5 years of Micro protection I think I'll be searching for a new provided.	-1
i have used bitdefender for years at home and at my business because it was a genuinely good piece of software but no more. with the new year they chose to reward their customers with software that constantly barrages your pc with their popup ads. i have paid hundreds of dollars over the years and in turn i spend more money on the product and get spam, spam and more spam. fyi their customer service reps are horrible. after two days of attempting contact someone, anyone finally got a person by phone(fyi forget about their tech forum their reps ignore you) was told they could not do anything about the popup ads on their new software but would "request" my email that i be removed from the "list." problem is that is as far as the process goes and the popups well they just keep on coming, popping up. i hate to switch but if i am going to pay good money for an a/v suite i deserve to be popup free.	-1
UPDATE 4: I give up.  After months of frustration I've decided to throw in the towel.  Now all Corel does is load and not allow me to do anything.  Everything I click gives an error beep.  I have no interest in seeing if the latest version fixes anything because the version I paid for never really worked at a usable level.  PhotoShop, PhotoShop Elements, gimp, Serif PhotoPlus are much more viable alternatives to use.  It's so sad that such a great product was ruined by a company that puts ZERO care into their work.  Corel should just kill this product or sell it to competent developers.  I'm uninstalling this and never turning back.  UPDATE 3: Despite the adware (which I believe the complaints might have reduced), I decided to try to work with this.  I really think that it's sad that a piece of software that has been around for years and has been put up as a commercial PhotoShop competitor runs much more slow than its open source counterpart.  The UI may be better but all the loading and waiting kills that benefit.  I'm going to try to see if I can deal but at this moment, I'm actually starting to appreciate the lightweight nature of GIMP.  By the way, I switched to PaintShop Pro back in the day because PhotoShop was such a huge hog!  How ironic!  UPDATE 2: I'm sorry, I just had to add that I think it's really low class for software that I *PAID* for to have embedded popup ads in it!  If you want to advertise in software GIVE IT FOR FREE!  I had written the review before receiving two popup ads.  I'm sorry this is unacceptible!  I lowered the ranking one point as a result.  UPDATE 1: I found a way to mitigate the sluggishness of the navigator.  If you only stick to using the "Computer" tab in the navigator and don't catalog any of your images, the performance is okay.  Even so, the navigator is still pretty bad.  For instance, in the image viewer, there is no way to get to the editor.  You have to exit the viewer than right-click the image in the explorer instead.  That's just bad... REALLY bad.  I've also found that X6 can be default to open directly in Edit mode.  While not ideal, it is a step forward.  ORIGINAL REVIEW:  The reason I ranked it three is because while the editor itself has improved, the navigator is just as dog slow as it has been since X3.  It is 100% useless.  The idea is that you're supposed to be able to bookmark folders in the navigator that  you can access quickly for editing and other tasks.  However, the execution of this idea is so pathetic they should have not even bothered.  This software could be five-star but the bloatware really brings it down two notches.  An ideal product would be just the editor and all of it's features alone without this albatross of bad software it is burdened to carry.  If removing the navigator were an install option, I'd gladly welcome it.  Now the editor itself has really improved like I said.  If you saw my X4 review, I had said that the context menus made absolutely no sense and the UI was designed by rank amateurs.  This version appears to have addressed my earlier complaints.  While not ideal, the menus are more sensible and contexts properly applied.  The toolset is pretty sharp, I LOVE adjustment layers, and overall I'm impressed with the improvement on the edit side.  Unfortunately, the excess baggage of the Navigator (Manage Tab) weighs it down.  Just avoid it at all costs.  I really wish there was a way to just rip it out.  It's just that horrible.  To be honest the real reason I bought this was that the price was low enough (thirty) to take the risk given that the previous versions were horribly bad.  I was also getting tired of using the kludgy interface of GIMP.  The extras like FaceFilter and Perfectly Clear add to the value of the package but I would not pay much more than what I paid for it.  So in a nutshell here's why you buy PaintShop Pro X6:  1) Tired of the GIMP UI 2) Adjustment layers 3) Heavy discount  The bottom line is what price you're willing to pay to not have to deal with GIMP's quirks.  You can get just about the same quality of image editing out of GIMP but some of its quirks are pretty unbearable.  PaintShop Pro eliminates that burden at the cost of heavy bloat.  Although it's not as bloated as PhotoShop the mother of all bloatware.	-1
I'm not new to PaintShop Pro; in fact, I've been using it since version 3 when it was JASC Software's shareware. And yes I purchased all 12 versions in between.  The last 7 versions have become increasingly buggy (since Corel bought the program) to the point where 4 times out of 5 X6 won't even open in Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 let alone allow me to edit an image.  I would love to rave about the keyboard shortcuts and customize interface, but it just keeps crashing.  I've spent the last week trying to find work around after work around to fix the issues and have finally given up.  I did manage to get it to stop chasing EVERY time it opened by turning off some "features".  It's still really slow; taking more than a minute to open on a system where Lightroom opens in about 15 seconds. Note; I have no problem with any other graphic intense programs including Lightroom, PhotoShop and GIMP.  If your looking for something cheaper than Adobe PhotoShop, I'd suggest PhotoShop Elements rather than X6 unless you don't mind being more than occationally frustrated.	-1
I could not get X6 to install properly and Corel support told me to uninstall the Microsoft KB2670838 update.  This solved my problems with X6.  Unfortunately, it kills Internet Explorer.  I'm not a big fan of Internet Explorer, but I don't like having to choose between it and PaintShop Pro X6. (X5 runs fine with the update).  Also, you have to disable automatic Microsoft updates, or it will reinstall the poison update.  This situation has existed for 7 months and neither side has solved the compatibility problem.  I have AMD Radeon video and you may have better results with different video hardware.	-1
Here were the ups and mostly downs of this for me.  Ups: -Easy to load -Forms use the traditional quicken approach of making you take a quiz and then automatically filling out the information -Couple of the sample letters and policies were relevant to me  Downs: - Only 2 of the forms were relevant to me running a one-member LLC that I might actually need to use one day - Only 2 of the sample letters were ones I might use one day - Only one of the e-library books included is one I might use one day  Caveat to my rating: I use a service very inexpensively that set up my LLC and does necessary filings for me (e.g. minutes). This may have greater value to a DIY person who hasn't yet started their own business or have a business where they sell goods, hire people and or lease out property.	-1
The Quicken software installs easily enough, and has a lot of legal documents within it. Unfortunately, it didn't have the documents I needed (I needed a Non Disclosure Agreement (NDA) and a Non Compete) but everyones needs are different. It comes with excellent (printed!) documentation, and is very easy to use, but as a small business Contracts and Forms package, the lack of NDA is really disappointing. I would also like to see standard web forms in it (ToS form and a Privacy Policy). With all that it is lacking, I would advise you read the box carefully  if it does what you need, great. But if I quickly found these missing items, what other items are missing that should be there?	-1
I started an LLC last year, but didn't really know if I had done all that I needed to.  And I had a client tell me that I really needed to have a license/contract agreement.  I had been thinking about doing this, but didn't really know where to start, so when I saw this I thought it was the answer to my prayers.  Not only could I make sure my LLC was set up correctly, but I could use its forms and contracts to create what I was lacking.  I was disappointed in this product.  The forms were basic, and if you look online you'll find similar versions for free.  The contracts and some other documents link you to buy the actual forms.  They weren't available in this product.  I'm not quite sure what they think the price you pay is good for, but I expected this to have those things in this program.  In the end, I didn't find much value in this program and I would not recommend it to a friend.  I'm on the look out for a new program that will help me with the license/contract that I need to make.	-1
I love the NOLO book line. I get their book every year called Deduct It or the Small Business taxes book which are really more or less duplicates of one another. When I saw that this Quicken Legal Business Pro 2014 included a copy of Deduct It I didn't hesitate to put in my order. Wow was I disappointed. Deduct it was a version that was several years old. The whole idea of getting the new book every year is that it is updated with all of the latest tax changes. Then I went in to use some of the forms because we all know business is made up of agreements and there was another disappointment. Most of what I was interested in was only an explanation of it, and then an invitation to purchase what I needed. So it was a sales tool in order to buy more things. Suddenly the whole thing wasn't so beneficial after all. Of course I would be over-stating my claim if I said that there wasn't anything beneficial in there, but those two features alone when it is subtitled as contracts and forms was a bit of a disappointment to say the least. I wound up buying the book Deduct It as a separate book which was the latest version. That is a NOLO book that is worthwhile. The money you save in taxes knowing what you are entitled to deduct does a job way better than any accountant can do. Like the book says, "No one knows your company better than you do." So knowing what is necessary and deductible before filing is crucial. Anyhow I can't in a clear conscious recommend this. That is just my opinion.	-1
I was thinking about setting up a business and didn't know where to start and thought that getting the Quicken Legal Business Pro would help. Other than it having some standard forms and templates, I don't really see any value. I would definitely have to consult with someone to feel comfortable to start/set-up my own business entity. Unless you just need some forms and templates, I don't recommend. At $35, it's not expensive. But you can find the forms and templates online for free if you just search for it.	-1
Everything that's here is available on the Internet for free - there's absolutely nothing that warrants paying for this product. The user interface is laughably bad and there's a very basic interview which provides the 'slightest' of guidance of how to complete the paperwork. If the software were a free website, I would be disappointed so being asked to pay for this represents grossly poor value. There are some ebooks but these again contain very generalized advice that you can largely find on the Internet - clearly somebody thought that throwing these into the offering might make the $50 price tag seem more palatable. Overall it's actually a disastrously bad product that Quicken should recall and rethink urgently.	-1
Since it is sold as a Quicken product, I expected to see a decent one.  However, the program is extremely simplistic.  It treats the users as 3rd grade kids.  The user interface is simplistic, the interview is simplistic, and the outcome of the document it creates is simplistic.  You can't use it in the real business settings.  It comes with a few reference books that might be useful occasionally, but the users are not buying this for books.  It's a software, but it's an extremely simplistic one as if it was programmed by a high school kid.	-1
Well, I loaded it up and got an error when the software tried to register itself online.  Not a great way to introduce me to it.  I suppose I'll try again later, but this doesn't bode well.	-1
The Family Tree Maker would not work on my Windows 7 64 bit computer. I had to send it back. I used the ancestory.com online website instead.	-1
I bought 3.  It did not work.  Got 3.5. I now have windows 10.  At first it worked.  When Windows 10 upgraded itself and now printshop 3.5  no longer works.  I tried to reinstall it. It would not reinstall. I removed old 3.5 and tried to reinstall again.  Failure!!! I think that there is Malware on the disk and windows protection will not let it run or install. All my other software runs fine	-1
I'm a Security Software tech, and wanted an AV that would protect me from Ransomeware?- I have a Fast Win7 desktop computer, with a 10k rpm Hard Drive, and 60mbps cable internet.  According to independent AVcomparitives review, my old "Buggy" ESET IS AV did Not protect me! I then tried Norton Internet Security "Premium", and it's backup files option made it SLOW (even when disabled)!  I gave WSA a 2month try, and Hate it!- Webroot SecureAnywhere Antivirus is Cloud based, with No data memory... files on your computer. This means that "every" time I open any program/application..., it has to upload the info..., check it, then download the OK back (big lag time!). I've tried 3 cloud based AV's, and they were All slow!  I then installed Norton Internet Security "Standard (get Deluxe if you want it to also protect your other devices (cell...)", with No backup... It is Fast, and I disabled their useless Search page. It has a fast site advisor, and scans downloads...	-1
good on delivery but having a problem on the install. I have last years on one computer and it keeps telling me its expired but I try to install this disc and nothing happens. I also have an apple and it says it does not expire for 3 months so that is ok but what if in 3 months it will not let me install then? Anyway I need help getting it installed on the first computer with the expired software?	-1
Is taking one heck of a long time to get here, a month is just too long in this day and age.	-1
Where do I begin with their lies and deception?  1) Small size on HD! Not true. ALL of the data hides in programdata/WRData and can baloon up to 50, even 100GIGS on your hard drive. Even quickly filling your SSD's.. Webroot takes up the most HD space of any AV. 2) Small footprint! NOT true. Webroot rides on the SYSTEM process in windows. Often ballooning the system process to 500% over normal. This bogs everything down and is a deception by Webroot who claims it's an 'old bug' (claiming this for 5 years) 3) Advanced technology! Not true. It's a simple karma/reputation and whitelist/blacklist app. It tosses your unknown stuff in a sandbox monitoring it. This requires constant tickets to support for whitelisting with EVERY new version of EVERY software.  Webroot is a product no serious security/IT person would ever deploy. It's a joke!	-1
Beware of losing your remaining days on your subscription.  I do like the product but the upgrade has been less than stellar. I already had Norton 360 on my account and supposedly the remaining 87 days would be added to the 365 of this license. Did not happen, just have the 365 days.  Another reviewer suggested it was because my existing multi-user was Norton 2013 and now I'm on Norton 2014 so the Norton folks feel justified to consider it a new, rather than renew.  When I hit the button it used to say Norton 360, it still says Norton 360 after the upgrade.  So great price, but just hold off on upgrading until you are about to expire on the old version.	-1
I had a bad experience with Norton where they used my credit card with no- authorization. They renewed without my authority and I had to yell with India how they authorized it without my permission. They tried to state I renewed but it was impossible I was upgrading my motherboard and rams on the system where the system was down for 2-3 weeks. What got me angry was I was charged the highest price while there were discounts being offered. So much for customer loyalty. Be careful this was the worst experience I ever had with Norton.  I had used them for years, now I went elsewhere due to this experience.	-1
A message for all Norton 360 2014, 2015 Products: See my previous customer review of Norton 360 2013 and CAVEAT EMPTOR! Let the Buyer beware of this product and how subscriptions are dropped dumped for the sake of increased cash flow and new business. I gave Norton One Star only because I had to assign a value to get my review published.	-1
I downloaded this application, after the installation it shows that it will be active or valid for only 118 days and not 366 days.	-1
I just tried to log into Identity Safe, which I have been using for months, and Norton no longer accepted my login.  I wasted time with Customer Service and I could not get Norton to send me a verification code to send to my mobile phone or email account.  Now I have to look up all my passwords manually.  This is why I just don't trust cloud computing.  Imagine if this happened to all your other information you have on the cloud!!!!!	-1
It's like i was many years ago. It's a memory hogg and slows down my computer to a crawl. Uninstalled and ordered Kaspersky Anti-Virus.	-1
I have been using Norton for a long time, ever since the Norton Utilities and this is something that really irks me, as it would you. I had 41 days left on my subscription, when I clicked on the link in the control screen to renew now it took me to their web site where it clearly states that a 2 year subscription for the product was 59.99. I clicked on the "Renew Now" button and went through all their steps, never being aware that I was being switched to their Premier eddition for 2 more devices and only one year. When it finished I checked the number of days left on the license and it showed only 366. Not only did it upgrade me without me wanting it, but it ate my 41 days. Contacted customer support, which tried to appease me by adding the 41 days, which never happened. I requested to be escalated to a supervisor, and I am still waiting for a call back. They requested 48 hours to resolve the issue! Unheard of! If I treated my customer this way I would not have any customers. Stay tuned for the supervisor response. My advice is to get something else, or instead of renewing the subscription buy a new version from Amazon and install it after your old license expires. Update: Support didn't call back within the promissed time frame, instead they called Sunday morning and sent an email, nice trick, they know most people are not available at that time. What they asked for was the link to the renewal site, I told them the same thing as before, the product has been updated, the link is not the same! As much as I hate to say it, I will be looking for a new product next year, but not McAfee, they have the same issues with support, and it does not work well on a multi-processor machine, it sets you up more than once for the same device!	-1
I think as Norton have tried to add more features, this thing has become too bloated and also too 'vocal' with popups coming up for everything, just like it needs to justify it's existence and expense somehow. I honestly think that the less resource-intensive and free offerings such as the Microsoft offering and even AVG, coupled with taking some care what attachments and links you click on are far better than spending money on this sort of thing.	-1
I trying clicking "spam" and nothing happens.  Has not worked since last update.  Disappointing.  Cannot find a fix.  What am I supposed to do?	-1
I switched to Norton after a decade + with Trend Micro, and I'm not really happy with the switch.  It is, of course, difficult to tell how well any security program is working without intentionally visiting infected sites, which I'm not about to do.  So I'm operating on the assumption that Norton is detecting viruses and spyware as well as Trend, though I have no way of being sure.  My problem with Norton is that it makes everything else run very slowly.  Outlook, in particular, takes forever to open and programs frequently hang.  I have an older PC desktop running Windows 7, but it handles most software without noticeable delay -- or at least, it used to.  Norton also lets a surprising number of pop-ups get through, which Trend never did.  I never realized how many of these Trend actually caught, until it was gone.  All in all, unless someone running tests on Norton verifies that it does a much better job than other programs at catching the nasties, I can't recommend it.	-1
Love Norton but apparently they will not allow upgrades to the newest version with older licenses any more. So if you picked up a 2014 license to use in 2015 you will have to use the 2014 software. In the past they would let you upgrade to the newest version.	-1
There is something wrong about this product. I installed in a computer, and after activation, it gives the message: " you have 118 days left in this product. Usually it should be 366 days(one year subscription), instead you getting only 118 days. Please revised this product download procedures to correct this problem.	-1
I do not recommend the Norton Internet Security 2014 because : (1)The software should still protect the computer using anti-virus definitions downloaded before the expiration date. But that is NOT the case. (2)After the expiration date, the software ceases to work. You must pay for the software to work EVERY YEAR.	-1
This review is being written 4/13/2014 for the Norton Internet Security 2014 - 1 User / 3 Licenses [Download], advertised and sold by Amazon on their website.  Unfortunately, I've seen several instances of virus-infected computers that were protected using this product.  The single most important aspect of this software suite to me is to prevent a computer from becoming infected with a virus - hence the failing grade.  The users of computers infected are adults, and I'm often called in to assist with various general computer setup and usage due to my expertise in this field.  I'd characterize these users as average, and the applications they use include banking, music entertainment, social networking, voice/video over IP communications, and some games.  The vector for infection is in the downloading, particularly of games.  Norton has failed to detect these viruses.  In contrast, I'm also performing the same consultant role with a half dozen people using&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/McAfee-Total-Protection-3PC-2014/dp/B00E6OPDUS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">McAfee Total Protection 3PC 2014</a>&nbsp;and none of them have infected computers.  The profile for this set of users include teenage children all the way up to senior citizens.  Based on my experience with the two sets of users, I don't recommend the Norton product.	-1
About twenty years ago, there was a really popular photo manipulation tool called Kai's Power Tools. If you were a teenager, it was an easy and awesome way to screw around with pictures. Anyone who saw said pictures would know you used KPT, and whether or not that was "cool" depended on the audience.  Why is this relevant? Well, that's kind of what PhotoDirector is. When you first launch it (and for reference, I'm talking about the Mac version) it looks kind of like an early version of&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Adobe-Lightroom/dp/B00CH6ATMO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Adobe Lightroom</a>, but the functionality isn't anything more than what you've already got in iPhoto -- except that PhotoDirector isn't aware of anything in your iPhoto library.  The Adjustment tab gives you a very basic color and tone adjustments in manual mode, and really heavy presets that would make any photo look obviously manipulated... poorly.  The Edit tab gives you functions like "People Beautifier" and "Object Removal", which claim to be image-aware. In practice, they're all badly-automated knockoffs of Adobe's Heal Tool. (It basically guesses at a portion of a picture to duplicate, and uses it to cover what you don't want in the picture.) Even in pictures with low complexity, the tools do an awful job of hiding themselves.  If you have visions of doing anything at all with layers, you can forget about it. Despite giving the impression of Photoshop / GIMP / PaintShop Pro types of editing, PhotoDirector is intent on holding your hand through awful presets.  Slideshow is... a slideshow.  Print is the only tab that seems at least marginally useful, but even that locks you in to weird presets.  So, if you want to take your cell phone pictures and go nuts with the "Eye Blinger" and "Tooth Brush" tools to make people look like Barbie dolls with strange patchy skin tones, or think that people won't notice how the "Body Shaper" tool has caused the background to mysteriously warp around your curves, this is all you need.  Or, if you want to take pictures of that tree in your back yard, make it sepia, and then add a gigantic watermark and copyright to thwart would-be "art" pirates in just a couple of clicks, I suppose you could do worse.  If you care even slightly about photography or realism in photos, stay far away from this product. Considering how closely priced this is (at the time of this review) to&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Photoshop-Elements/dp/B00EOQZB0A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Photoshop Elements</a>, you'd have to be crazy not to choose that over PhotoDirector. Or if you don't want to learn Photoshop, consider&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/PaintShop-Pro/dp/B00EOI2SR2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">PaintShop Pro</a>, which is a similar program that costs less, and works much better.	-1
I'm sorry. If I'm paying money for software, I do NOT expect to see ads in my software! It's bad enough that they pop up. In addition to that, they appear in workflow dialog boxes. This is DISTRACTING AND ANNOYING! This low class feature takes away from productivity and concentration.  The UI is actually pretty decent but until I can disable the ads, I can't in good conscience recommend this software. Sony Vegas is not as obnoxious as this.	-1
Won't let me install any programs so it jets 1 star	-1
Microsoft seems to thing that Windows 8.1 is a platform for Microsoft ads. Keeps pushing windows 10 upgrade ads every day.	-1
How does a company spend billions in research and come up with a desktop interface (Metro UI) this bad?  And then they have the unmitigated gaul to price it very high when others like Linux Mint and Mac OSX "Mavericks" are giving their OS away for free.  The latest MS operating system throws away almost everything you have learned over the last 20 years about controlling a  desktop.  You'll need to be completely retrained to use big, fat, ugly 2-D "tiles" and be constantly kept away from using a normal desktop "file/folder" system for organizing your stuff.  Heckavajob, Microsoft...  What's next?  A mandatory "BIG-TOE" controlled desktop interface?	-1
I bought a $600 HP desktop and I was forced to purchase it with a 8.0 operating system.  After 5 hard disc crashes, I had the motherboard & drive replaced under warranty and I donated it to charity.  Because of the HP design type, I couldn't downgrade to 7.0 or upgrade to 8.1.  DO NOT EXPECT 8.0 or 8.1 to be Senior friendly when upgrading from XP.  Also, I had to purchase $300 in new software.  I ended up buying a new Dell XPS8700 with Windows 7.0 installed.  Lord Billy Gates kids really designed this 8.0/8.1 operating system for use with their toys.  Do yourself a favor!  Avoid being forced into purchasing this shoddy operating system with all its glitches.	-1
What a piece of crap software. And they have no pride in what they do. Miserable useless customer so called customer service creeps actually want to charge you money for help. Somehow I just don't think selling crap software and then making the crummy service provided a profit center is going to be a viable business model. Recommend hanging on to the old PC. Better operating systems will be coming. Either from Microsuck or their replacement.	-1
