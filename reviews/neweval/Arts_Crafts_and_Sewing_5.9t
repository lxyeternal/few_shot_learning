This is a cheap box and NOT acid free.  The lining is black and when rubbed gently with a white kleenex, the black dye comes off on the kleenex.  Over and over again. I finally gave up trying to get the kleenex to stay white. It is obviously a cheap black paper dyed in China. How this CA company can call it an acid free box, I'll never know.  Horrible.	-1
I purchased this to hold and protect and antique postcard album filled with wonderful old postcards. It was just the right size and sturdily made plus attractive to boot, to hold the album. I love the place for the label on the front. Great item for special storage.	1
This box is just the right size I needed for oversize photos and keepsakes.  It is sturdy and constructed well.  It's good that it has a label holder too.  I would purchase again.	1
If you are a scrapbooker you know that all the odds and ends, papers, embellishments etc., have a habit of ending up everywhere!  I ordered one box to see if it was workable with my set up and I am in love with it! I have a rolling scrapbook cart that I've kept papers in. This box allows me to take the paper I need for the project and keep it in one place. I also found that the depth of the box was deep enough that I could put the stickers, embellishments, and photos I am using in with the paper when I was through for the day.  I'm so happy with the box that I plan to purchase three more and store all of the materials for each of my upcoming planned scrapbooks. It will really be nice to just take out a box and work on everything and then put the box back rather than take out all of the paper, folders, envelopes and the like from the closet.  Sometimes something small, like this simple box, can make life so much easier!	1
Love this box...I bought 4 or them and they are really attractive stacked and all the while providing safe storage for baby books and other family mementos.  Love that it's acid free so it's safe to store my most precious keepsakes. The color is very accurate as well.	1
Awesome. Works as it should.	1
Such a beautiful book but the page inserts ruin it because the book is beautiful but inserts need to be made better. Will be returned.	-1
Well made and perfect for family photos!	1
Serves it's purpose. Looks better then others I looked at on amazon.	1
The "leather' is good quality and the writing is stitched on. I really like this for leaving out on the coffee table.	1
Nice quality for the price.	1
A grand album for memories.	1
Beautiful album and an equally beautiful price!!	1
I was looking for a nice scrapbook to put together a scrapbook of my dog that recently passed.  I really like this scrapbook, it is a good size and great quality, and its very classy looking.	1
This is a very classy looking album. It was easy to add pages and easy to use. I highly recommend it to all scrapbookers.	1
This is a very nice scrapbook. I left it on my wishlist and bought it when the price went down to $9.99.. That's a great deal for this. I was at Jo-Ann yesterday and saw the same exact scrapbook for $25. It's a very nice quality, I can feel the weight of it when I pick it up. I am very happy. I would consider buying this again as a gift or myself if I needed another one.	1
Love this book.  The cover is very nice and feels nice and it is easy to add additional pages too. Plus the pages come with paper inside the plastic pages for easy mounting.	1
This scrapbook is perfect!  It looks great and it feels great. Amazing quality. GREAT design. Beautiful!  The slide pages inside feel a little delicate (to be expected).  You can add more pages, the scrapbook has more than enough room for another 5-7 pages.  Shipping: perfect!	1
This book was for my 2015 wedding. We are going to put wedding pictures in it. On the front, A wedding picture of us.	1
My photo albums holding old pictures look very handsome.  A nice feature is the ability to add and remove pages.	1
I've never made a scrapbook before and I am so glad I chose this book to use for my first project. However, I am beginning to doubt I can find another one that is just as nice! The material looks really good and feels soft/smooth/supple like lambskin. The stitching is a nice touch. I love the outside photo window. I enjoyed using the ten pages that came with the book so much that I had to buy refill pages because I wanted those items in this book with this cover. Overall, great product!	1
This is a great scrapbook, a place for a photo in the front cover and many plastic covers to fill with scrapbooking pages. The binding is high quality and the inscription on the front is nice.	1
This book is quality.  The leather is nice quality, the stitching was very good.  Made to last.  Would highly recommend.	1
This scrapbook is sturdy and very cute.  I removed the posts and replaced them with ties.  These seem to hold up just as well as the posts.  This is a good buy for the money.	1
Awesome album, very good quality. It exceeded my expectations and wish I had ordered one for my son and daughter. It's really a great album	1
This velvet is excellent, opaque, plush.  The price is very good for the quality.  I received my order within 2 days, which was great. If I need more fabric, I will definately order it from this company.	1
Perfect fabric really black for jewelry display! Great price quick delivery and was PRIME!	1
This stuff is great!  Used at a school carnival, it went on so easy and smoothly.  It made me a star!	1
On hell of a server. Ive used a few different sergers in my sewing classes and this one hands down is the best one Ive used.  The machine is an animal, it will overlock your fabric with ease.  It doesnt have a problem with the thick fabrics that Im usually working with.  Setting the differential or thread tension is easy along with threading. Its not self threading but you can thread the machine fairly easily once you do it a couple times.  Most of my work is finishing seams and this machine makes it pleasurable to overlock your seams.  Oh, the title says portable but my machine looks like the same size as the other sergers Ive been on.  So, I don't know why its marked as portable.  Comparing it to my sewing machines, it is smaller than bother those machines.  They are the brother se400 and singer heavy duty machine.	1
This serger is the best! It blows my old singer serger out of the water! It's quiet, smooth, and easy to use. By far the best value for the price.	1
Amazing serger, I really love the speed and also it's narrow roll hem!	1
I really like this machine and am very pleased with my choice.	1
I have never gotten this to even sew. I should have sent it back.  Sergers are often difficult, I understand that, but this one has never worked right. I regret this purchase. Even after multiple videos and other instruction, this sucker just isn't as good as I wish it had been. I wish I had gotten a different machine. It collects dust on a shelf right now.  Maybe I'll spend the 80 bucks at the shop to have it professionally adjusted since the adjustments recommended by the manufacture are useless.	-1
I'm new to serging. This machine is not too hard to thread. It's not noisy, either	1
Absolutely recommend this serge amazing! !!	1
I love this serger so much quieter than my brother 1034d	1
This machine works very well . Easy to thread and easy to use	1
Wow, this machine is so wonderful. I have small clothing business where I work mostly with the cotton lycra, rayon lawn and silk chiffon. This serger cleanly and easily powers through my heavier fabrics and my soft and smooth silks. I have experience with lots of sergers and this is by far my favorite. I used to have a Siruba serger. While it was a great machine, it really couldn't handle the amount of use I was putting on it. It was constantly coming unthreaded and I had to adjust the timing a little too regularly. I had to purchase a machine that could handle my work load. For a pop up shop I recently made over 100 cotton lycra crop tops with this machine (using wooly nylon) in a matter of days. My Juki never faltered. I was super impressed. Handles well with poly thread and the stretchy wooly nylon. All around a great machine and good for moderate to heavy use.	1
Very nice quality.	1
I sew costumes...about 300 a year and this machine is the best...this is my second MO644d.....the first one lasted several years before needing a repair	1
This is a nice serger for the price. I wish I could have gotten on with a closing stitch. Why can't I find a serger, sewing machine, and closing stitch all in one. That would be cool. The next model up is better because it threads easier, I would have liked that one better. Judi servers are the best, I love the honeycomb threading and it always makes a nice serger with easy to switch over to hem.	1
Amazing home serger! Very beginner friendly. The manual explains everything so well. I studied the manual and learned how to thread it rather quickly. I searched and searched for a video to help me, but did not find a good one. Here is one I made that slowly shows you step by step how to thread the juki mo644d serger. https://youtu.be/RnGWaAEf6AM  The manual and color guides help make it a simple process. It serges wonderfully, no rattling or vibrating on the table even through layers of thick fleece. Worked great with woven, light to heavy knits, flannel, and fleece. Up next is canvas and denim! I highly recommend this machine to all! Beginners, don't be afraid! It is not difficult to use this serger. Check out what I've made with it.  http://sewfannyhandmade.bigcartel.com/	1
I don't know if it is just me, but I have a heck of a time serging in a straight line! I have tried really hard and had some seasoned seamstresses try to serge in a straight line on this machine - though unsuccessfully. I attribute it so far to lack of familiarity with it. I am hoping my work improves. The manual is concise and not hard to use to trouble shoot. Set up wasn't hard - but wasn't easy. Probably true of any serger. I have asked others how my serger differs from other - possibly more expensive models and have been told by several friends that this model is nicer than theirs. Not sure exactly how though. So far - so good - though not great.	1
Awesome home machine! It's a great replacement for my studio's old huge heavy loud industrial machine. I bought it on recommendation from the Katwise sweater coat tutorial.	1
I have finally got my Juki! And I love it.	1
I've made several garments with my new JUKI Serger and I'm ecstatic about the machine... wondering WHY didn't I get one years ago!  I love that I can take it anywhere!	1
This machine was recommended to me by a family member, and I trusted their advice.  It is amazing!  Easy to thread, it sews wonderfully and is reliable.  I would strongly, strongly recommend it.	1
Threading this is no picnic however, once that is done it is a piece of cake. We are VERY happy with how it works and makes our pieces look a good deal more professional.	1
EXCELLENT..:-)	1
It's the best buy I could have done, so far I've been using it and its very easy.  I'm certain that all the other stitches are also easy as pie	1
THIS IS MY THIRD SERGER...I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD BUY ONE ONLINE, BUT ONCE I GOT IT THREADED, IT WORKED BEAUTIFULLY.  IT'S MADE WELL AND YOU CAN FEEL IT'S A  STURDY MACHINE WHILE YOU'RE SEWING.  WAWAK IS A FINE COMPANY TO DEAL WITH. THANKS, SANDEE	1
Love this. My first serger. It was a little intimidating, but the instruction booklet, the labels are easy to follow. I'm a manual reader, so it took me about an hour to read along, thread it, fix the tensions, before serging every piece of scrap I own. I use all 4 threads, but you can only use 3 if you want.  Good for a beginner.	1
Thank you	1
Love these for school pictures	1
Very elegant. I'm glad I found it after spending so much time browsing for an album that was not dotted with flowers and girly nonsense. I needed it for my son's communion pictures and I'm happy to say it is great for thus purpose.	1
I was so glad to still be able to get this album. I got my first one for my first grandchild 7 years ago and have added two more in other colors for the next two. I love that this has rings that open to add pages instead of posts.	1
I love this album! It's a great size and good quality. You can fit a lot in it and the color is gorgeous.	1
Gave as gift.  Looks nice.	1
These are the best scrapbooks ever.  I've bought at least twelve if not more and am going to order more of them. I'm 76 and have saved everything through the years.  Now I've gone through boxes of birthday cards, Mother's Day cards, letters from Christmas cards, birthday party invitations from the grandchildren, etc., and sorted them out by which child they are from and then organized them in these scrapbooks and given the books back to the children, who appreciate having all of this again. Then I undertook an oral history project and used these scrapbooks to place historic photos, articles gleaned from newspapers.com, etc., starting from 1900. I made 3 duplicate scrapbooks for each set of years researched. Presently I am using six of these scrapbooks for photos and misc. literature that my daughter has from a three week European vacation this fall. Love how the top comes down and ties and makes it into a box. They stack really well that way. Can't say enough good things about these.  Highly, highly recommended.	1
Beautiful book very sturdy, only complaintis that I wish the pages were reinforced where the holes are.	1
Love it.  Excellent product and will buy more.	1
Beautiful album. Well made.	1
So beautiful. Ordered a second one.	1
These are my favorite scrapbooks!!!  This is my 5th one, I am scrapbooking for my first granddaughter from birth on. They hold a lot and are nice to look at. I will keep buying these as long as they are available.	1
I use these books to put momentos in of my girls birthdays each year. love that the pages are basically in a box so that I can make the pages bulky and they still fit.	1
Great product. Wife does a lot of scrap booking and has about a five of these ones. Over the years they have held up great.	1
I got mine for my senior memory book! I love it!	1
Love-It	1
Just what I wanted!	1
Good quality. Perfect for a 'Confirmation' scrapbook.	1
Love! Ordered two, going to buy another I fit my six standard scrapbooks into two of these babies and they're pretty darn good looking, they're three ring binders and come with full page scrapbook sleeves and white paper  Update ordered a third! Bought the Amazon warehouse deal and it said it had 'damage' (small) but I was pleased to find it was in perfect condition.	1
I was surprised by how nice this binder is for the price. It has a very nice finish and feels very solid and sturdy. It's quite satisfying when you have it filled because it feels substantial.  One minor complaint is that the picture window in the front could be bigger. The rings in the binder worked flawlessly and I've been opening and closing them frequently. They come with plastic page protectors and I found them to be of good quality as well.	1
I love this! I would buy it again. Has great storage capacity and i love that it ties to close. Large size and very professional looking it.	1
great product	1
Love it	1
brought as a gift for my daughter and I weekend get away	1
Perfect	1
Beautiful album..Once all the pages are filled, though, you really can't add more pages.  Which is no problem because there are lots of pages.  Perfect for a gift..	1
So nice and elegant	1
its okay	1
Bought this on amazon because they were sold out in Joann. Great product.	1
These are wonderful albums.  Very high quality.	1
These photo, scrapbooking albums look amazing.  I have never scrapbooked before, both of these albums are perfect. For the price the quality is amazing, they are both beautiful!	1
This is one of the nicest scrapbooks I have ever seen. Its very heavy duty.	1
Love it, exelent material!	1
This is very well made and it shipped exactly on time.  An excellent buy.	1
excellent	1
Very nice , picture doesn't give it justice !!	1
Gave to a friend.	1
I really like the way the scrapbook looks. However, I got the brown one and it shows fingerprints really well and I can't seem to wipe them off. I might end up getting another one because of that. But overall good quality and very durable. It's pretty big, I have 25 sheets in there and there is still plenty if room for more sheets.	1
This scrapbook is very high quality. I have actually purchased 3 of these total and plan to buy another one soon. I really like the D ring instead of having to screw in the pages. Makes adding and taking out the pages a breeze. I also love that it ties closed.  This is a good quality scrapbook!	1
This is a beautiful well made album.  I love the color and quality.	1
I used this album for my son's wedding photos.  Everyone who sees it remarks how nice the "box" album is.  By the time I finished, the album weighed about eight pounds!  The box has held up under all that weight.  Prior to this, I had only used Creative Memories albums; however, the ease of inserting pages into the ring binder has convinced me this is the wave of my future scrapbooking.  I will be order several more of these in a variety of colors.	1
The front of the book began to lift and separate from the body within a month of purchasing this. Otherwise-the design is great-its like a box so its nice to keep documents and things in one place!	1
Used for our wedding, great size to hold multiple things, easy to find more pages to fill in.	1
I got this for my secret santa person and was more than happy with the product and timely arrival of it, more than exceeded my expectations ive purchased another in other color and still love the price	1
This is the most amazing scrapbook! You can put a multitude of pages in this book and because it's in a box, your pages don't move or break away from the binder from the weight of the extra pages! Love this!	1
This scrapbook is even more beautiful than I thought it would be. It's got a very solid feel to it and is "box" style, meaning the lid lifts off and there's a binder within, but the sides are raised so the pages aren't damaged by any outside source as long as it's lovely ribbon is kept close. My husband and I are creating a scrapbook of letters and pictures from his dad's friends and family because he has cancer and we wanted something for him to be able to hold on to in the hospital, and this scrapbook has a great feel for a grown man who was a Marine and is a man of culture. I can't wait to have this put together!	1
A neighbor has used this binder - I love that all the sides are enclosed - keeps contents dust free - would pay more for upgrade on lining - picture on front is so fun - very satisfied - highly recommend!	1
This is such a beautiful and professional looking scrapbook. I am so impressed and so happy that I ordered it.	1
I did a lot of research looking for the perfect scrapbook album for all my wedding momentos, this is absolutely perfect, not cheap looking at all, with plenty of space	1
It is beautiful! Quality is better than I thought. Made a beautiful wedding scrap book with pictures. Closes up and looks like a pretty box. Bride absolutely loved it.	1
I have been purchasing this style of photo album for years (ever since I started scrapbooking). It is by far the best album on the market!	1
I really like this leatherette scrapbook.  I made a scrapbook for each of my grandchildren.	1
This is perfect - has a frame on the front so one knows what the scrapbook is about, plus it ties to keep all lose papers together.	1
I prefer the 3 ring type scrapbook since it's so much easier to add pages. This book does get harder close if you put enough in it, but it holds a lot before that becomes an issue. Very nice cover, worth the price.	1
I ordered this to keep a historical accounting of our Quaker Meeting.  It fits the bill perfectly.  I love that it's folded in a way that it makes a box so the edges are protected.  It's simplistic but it's also elegant.  My only concern is that the outer edge is tied with a ribbon and if the ribbon breaks it could be a problem.  There is a fairly good supply of sheet protectors and white pages so you have all you need to get started with your project.	1
I'm very pleased with this album.  I bought it to use for my daughter's scrapbook and it will work perfectly.	1
I purchased this as a gift to give my friend for her bridal shower. We used it as a guest book for the actual shower, and then we made a quick photo album in the same binder. It's good quality and very heavy, substantial and nice book. I love that you can add additional pages and make it fit your needs, will last her a very long time and lots of happy memories!	1
this fit my needs and exceeded my expectations.  I bought this to keep art work and paper notices or certificates from my son.  It holds a bunch and I like how it ties shut.  It looks pretty and is a very nice quality.  It wipes clean very easily if it gets dusty (i leave it out on the shelf)  Definitely worth the money.	1
These Pioneer albums are the best.  Have purchase in pink, brown, black, red, and blue. Like that they hold a lot of pages too.  The fact that it ties for closure is another plus.  Highly recommend.	1
Bought it as an additional wedding album, good quality, holds lots of pictures and the size it's just perfect. Gives extra protection thanks to the possibility of closing it as a box.	1
I ordered the ivory for my wedding photos.  Heavy duty and very well made book.  Fast shipping and way better than I expected for the price. Highly recommend this product.	1
i realy y y y loo o o o  vee e e e e ee e e e e it.!	1
I purchased this scrapbook for a Christmas gift for my daughter and son-in-law who got married last May.  I filled the scrapbook with over 250 pictures and artifacts.  I love the pocket in the front where I placed my favorite picture of the two of them.  This really is the perfect scrapbook!	1
This is a good option for someone living in the digital age, yet caught needing a keepsake album. I don't do 'scrapbooking' and have snickered, for years, at anyone who tried to sell it as a hobby. Give me a photo album and I'll let the artwork do the talking...which is why this album-box is PERFECT. It's well made and the perfect size. It's not a large album (realize that before you order) and it does not come with many insert sheets. I guess that's the only downside; in order to use it as a photo album you'll need to order more photo sleeves. Still, what a terrific option for an event keepsake. Mine will be a wedding album, with no satin bows or kitschy gold borders, that can also hold a few wedding cards and letters, even DVD's.	1
This Pioneer scrapbook is the epitome of praticality. It's got it all:  - Lots of space - Sturdy sheet protectors - Rings, so you can reposition pages as needed and add regular-size sheets - Box format that doesn't fall apart, is easy to carry, stays closed - Great quality - Many of color choices - Reasonable price  I buy one every year and use it to make a scrapbook for my son that includes photographs, pictures of his artwork, birthday letters, etc. Why stop after the baby book? Every year deserves its own book, and the Pioneer scrapbook makes it really easy.  The only cons...really heavy once it's full. I can't picture us moving anytime soon!	1
there were two tiny cracks/splits in the leather cover where it was folded around corners. Compared to other albums I have looked it seems that is not too big of a deal. All together very well made.	1
I love this album because its so easy to use.  No more taking the whole spine apart to add or rearrange pages.  I love the easy rearranging with the 3 ring binder system.  And I love how I can add bulky items to my pages and still have a nice neat album due to the box system.  I also love the album cover window.  I used to have to take my albums apart after they were filled then ship the album cover to a vendor to have the album title embossed on the cover but no more.  Now I just make my own title and pop it in the album cover window.  Its so easy.  This album meets all my scrapbooking needs - love it.	1
Both I and the client really loved the box style of the scrapbook. The edges were peeling in some places and I had to re-glue them down but overall good scrapbook.	1
This was the hit of the presents that I gave my sister for her wedding! She cannot wait to fill it up!! The price was great, and the packaging was great! Thanks!!!	1
Our local scrapbooking store only carried this scrapbook in baby blue and I wanted different colors for my other 2 children.  These scrapbooks are amazingly made and very beautiful.	1
Arrived on time.  Works great.	1
Had trouble with the first one, no hassle replacement and it works great.	1
Excellent.	1
The product description states "After punching and without letting up (do not shift the paper) give it an extra push for the crisp embossed edge you want."  When the directions say 'give it an extra push' they ain't just whistlin' Dixie.  I stood up and pushed down so hard my feet left the ground, and I still didn't get a very good embossed image.  I was punching ordinary 80 lb. card stock.  The corners punched are also quite small--too small to look good on an A2 card.  Use the punch for small tags and push down as hard as you can if you want your corner both cut and embossed.	-1
Nice beads, color is great.  Can't wait to find the time to start my next project!  Exactly what is advertised.	1
Pretty colors although there were almost too many of 1 or 2 colors and very few of others. I've used them regardless.	1
Beautiful	1
These are NOT Delica beads and they are not all 11/0. I realize it's a mix so cannot complain about colors but if you want at least 1/2 of them to be clear don't waste your money. These are regular round beads not the same sizes (11/0 & 15/0 I'm guessing) and like most cheap random beads the shapes are all off. And lastly there are not approx 900. Will not recommend to anyone	-1
Definitely as advertised. I enjoyed them very much, they look great for the project I used them for.	1
So disappointed! I got 2 grams of crap plastic primary color. It looks like a kindergarten room sent me a little tiny teeny doggie bag. My walkjg distance, high-end, bead store wouldn't have charged more than $1.50 tops for this rip off. The colors in the pic's included are no joke - the earthy, seaglass tones depicting the brads is in no way what I recieved. I just hat being ripped off for any kind of money.	-1
Received the package a couple days ago, well ahead of the estimated arrival.  Not quite as nice a color variety as the picture. I was also very disappointed in the size of the beads. Uneven edges on many look like someone cut up bugle beads. They are very noticeably much larger then other size 11 delicas I have ordered. No way to use them with my other #11 delicas.  I will still find a use for them as its not worth the time or trouble to return them.	-1
I really do like these beads, and the color mix is fantastic.  HOWEVER, I have other 11/0 Delica beads and they're quite a lot larger than these.  I think they sent me 15's instead.  That's fine, I used them for a different project, and it worked out fine.  But the ones I received were not 11/0, no matter what the package said.	1
beautiful beads.  nice color mixture.  i thought i was getting a 'small bag' of beads, instead it was a 'small tube' of beads.  so i was a little disappointed in the quantity, but the quality is excellent!	1
I recently had the pleasure of purchasing these pens from a local store (sorry Amazon). As a beginner manga artist, I was amazed at the quality of the pens and the difference they made with my drawings. The ink dries rather quickly and pencil lines can be erased without fear of smudging.	1
Love these pens!! I use them for my zentangle/doodle artwork. I will definitely purchase them again in the future!	1
Very nice drawing set.	1
Good purchase, these are had to find in stores with a good variety. I love the thick pen tips of 6 & 10 mm, but the chisel tips (new to me in this brand) were a pleasant surprise. They're stiffer than a few other similar tips out there, which is nice for their use. I enjoyed playing around with all the different styles here and liked nearly every single one from the first moment.	1
These are perfect......at first I didn't realize that it had a mechanical pencil and eraser(black eraser which I love), but the pencil has been quite handy actually.	1
Gift	1
best you can buy	1
I've used other pens before with my markers and I've always had issues with the ink bleeding or leeching into the other colors. These are great and have very very minimal bleeding even when used with watercolor and alcohol markers (let them dry of course) like prisma and copic. I'll keep these in my arsenal for sure. Tips are VERY durable (unlike other brands) and these are pretty much ALL the sizes you need for anything you'd be doing. I can't love these enough.	1
(Written by the daughter of the buyer, AKA the one who uses them) Perfect pens coming in perfect sizes! I love to do traditional art and these are perfect for lining. They rarely ever smudge, and they have a perfectly sized plastic case that they come in (sometimes if I'm bringing my art supplies to a friend's house, I put an eraser in the case and it fits perfectly!)	1
Niece  loves them she is a budding anime artist.	1
Nice	1
Love these pens	1
Husband enjoys these pens on a daily basis.  He draws for a living and swears by these.	1
perfect for drawing and will buy again when needed	1
my mom bought these for me for christmas and i love the results of my art	1
cant go wrong with these pens. my son uses them all the time. never a problem	1
First time using these pens and I was not disappointed.  I always read the reviews before making purchases and anticipated that these pens would be good but I can't put them down.	1
Nice pens.	1
Insert a standard review here :-)	1
purchased for my daughter she loves these	1
Love this set	1
love it !	1
Fantastic set of pens to draw manga or anything else.  Comes with an eraser and mechanical pencil.  Packaging is reclosable so they are easy to travel with.  Small guide to drawing comes inside.  Great!	1
Arrived quickly and in good condition. These pens are exactly as good as I was hoping they would be. No bleeding, crisp lines, and no smudges. I can finally create the tiny details in my drawings that I need to. I would order these again.	1
very nice pens	1
good	1
was a great after thought gift	1
Great product!  This was a gift for my son, and he absolutely loved it!	1
These are great for beginner artists who want to try their hand at pen art but are not sure if they are going to stick with it. They work very well to give the artist a free flow of ink that does not blot on the paper. I gave them to my nephew who is an entry level surrealism artist and he has not put them down since I gave them to him.	1
Given to my artist son who loves these pens. Wanted to know where they were all these years!! Great to work for his sketches and stay on his paper. Clean & precise. Fast delivery & packaged well.	1
I don't often use markers nor draw anime or comic related material, but I've been using these Sakura markers for other things and they're still some of my favorite tools. These six piece set is truly excellent and versatile; if you need a variety of black markers in a piece, this one gives you four different options in tip sizes!  Here's the deal: 1. The pencil that is provided in the set is excellent and the lead is neither too hard nor soft. For the pencil alone, I love this set. The eraser is of good quality and has the right texture to avoid shredding delicate paper if you get a bit too energetic with it.  2. The different sized tips are for specific jobs in creating comics (lettering, tracing, detailing, etc.) and I've found uses for all of the in my work when I want to add splashes or bits of true-black to my pen drawings. The extra detail and good quality ink makes a world of difference.  3. The pens aren't to thick when holding them, they're light weight, and they are very fluid, so you don't have to press hard to get what you want. Comfort is an underrated quality with art supplies, and these markers have it.  These markers aren't overly expensive and very few, if any, drawbacks compared to more expensive markers. I'll be buying more and you should too.	1
That one word meant Daughter 'had' to have these. She keeps them in a Nightmare Before Christmas mug and prizes them greatly. Good lines, smooth ink.	1
These pens give you the dark lines and textures that you need to create solid looking drawings, that will wow a crowd. This is great if you are an artist. And it comes with an eraser and mechanical pencil? If you don't have any pens, Pick these up right now.	1
I am an artist, and this set is probably by far my most favorite piece in my supply collection. I received this set as a present for Christmas, but even if I were to buy it for myself it would be very much worth spending any amount of money on it. This set includes a Sakura eraser, a mechanical soft-graphite drawing pencil, and four varied thicknesses of manga pens. The thicknesses vary from .3 mm, .4 mm, .6 mm, and 1.0 mm. To be honest, these pens are not exclusively for manga use only. They work for all my art purposes. If you draw something with a pencil, then outline with one of these pens and then use the eraser (after giving the pen a short minute to dry, it does not take long) there is NO SMUDGE. This set is ideal for any artist who uses such things on a daily basis. This set will not fail to please you. Would recommend to any artist.	1
these were great my son loves to draw and these are great I would buy them again my son loves them	1
I bought these at Michael's and I wish I bought them here... they were 16 dollars at Michael's.  My favorite out of this set was the .04 pen. It's the right size for sketching. It has a different tip though, which I found strange, but it feels great.  The .03 is great for coloring in small corners, though it's really thin and you have to be gentle with it.  The .06 is like a medium sized marker, good for coloring or making lines thicker.  The 1.00 sized is basically like a sharpie marker and good for making lines thicker and coloring big spaces. It's a really dark black too. IT DOES NOT BLEED EITHER! I am really impressed.  My only beef is that you have to be gentle, but that's just me because I'm abrasive lol. But also I was messing with them and they seemed to have run out a bit quick, or the pen tip got a little messed up and started to create a line within the marker. It started to make a streak. So I would have a huge thick line, and then a tiny other line because the marker tip (this happened with the 06 and 1.00 marker) had like, a little residue. It doesn't dry instantly, but it's not slow. Maybe blow on it and it dries instantly.  But other than that, these are nice solid black pens and markers.  I didn't really care much for the sketch pencil or the eraser. If anything, any type of artist should get a KNEADED eraser. Less mess, and is great for shading (if you use different types of pencils, but that's a different story).	1
I'm glad I got this product! It's been very helpful in my anime/manga/cartoon drawing. It's priced just right too. I've once used cheap "Dollar General" pens, but no more! These pens are the ones I buy all the time and that will never change.	1
I've been using this set for quite some time and I gotta say that, it has been great. They work good, don't fade away fast. I recommend this set for Beginners.	1
I purchased this as a starter kit, as I had no manga markers. It contains a decent range of sizes that are smooth and dry quickly. The pencil is very basic, but if you lack a good set of drawing pencils, will do in a pinch. I would highly recommend looking for a better pencil if you plan to draw on a regular basis. The eraser that comes with it is fantastic - I use it over any of the other brands I have found, as it quickly erases nearly every hardness of pencil I have without a lot of rubbing and does not make a lot of mess.  Who this is best for: beginners and advance level artists who want an inexpensive kit for drawing manga or for a basic sketch kit.	1
I ordered this set because I didn't have a lot of dp needles, needed a size I didn't have, and also wanted to try the bamboo.  I have been knitting the sleeves on a wool sweater using them, and I am VERY happy with the way they work.  I'd tried plastic dp needles before, and the yarn kept slipping off.  These needles cling every so gently to the yarn and make it much easier to use them.  Some people had mentioned they thought the points weren't sharp enough, but I do not have that experience at all.  I find the points perfectly acceptable.  I'm returning to knitting after many years off, and find these an excellent addition to my knitting tools.	1
This was perfect for me! I'm a new knitter and I was finishing up a hat when I realized that I didn't have any double pointed needles. This had EVERY size I could possibly need and I don't have to keep running out to the store to find the right ones. Lets face it, learning to read those patterns takes time and if you're anxious like me, you tend to jump ahead of yourself. It's nice to have these when that happens. It took time getting used to the bamboo as opposed to the aluminum needles, but I like that they don't slip as easily. Making a baby blanket now. Love it!	1
Oh how I wished I had known about these and the other bamboo knitting needle sets before I spent a small fortune at craft stores purchasing other bamboo needles individually! These circular needles are fine quality. The connection between the bamboo and the plastic cable is oh so smooth! Not like the interchangable sets where the work gets hung up at the join between the needle and cable. The needls come bundle wrapped but each is in its own reclosable pack. The only thing that is lacking is the there is no size indicator on the outside of the needle's individual pack (one can easily write the size on the envelope). All the needles are stamped with its size but the smaller needles are more difficult to read. This set includes a great range of sizes and if you expect to use more than one needle out of the set then you will easily break even as opposed to buying them individually.	1
Bamboo needles are the bomb for knitting.  Your work will not stick to them as can be the case with metal needles...as your hands become a little sweaty. Compared to my Takumi brand, the plastic cables are hollow and attach over a small nipple on the ends of the needle.  (Unlike the solid insertion of Takumi).  For the price, the quality is excellent, needles smooth,  If I were a beginner knitter, I would surely recommend this to begin your collection.  Time will tell how long these will last compared to Takumi, but I knit in spurts....and they should last a very long time.	1
This is a get set of needles for the price.  The cord is very fexible and there isn't any cord memory.  These needles are ideal for anyone who is a fan of the magic circle method.	1
This block is all I wanted it to be.  Very comfortable to hold, ink and use.  Arrived in good time and very good condition.	1
Large enough to hold all sizes of stamps.  the scalloped edge allows a good grip and is comfortable to hold even in my small hands.  Has grids on it to help assure your stamps are fully aligned.	1
I use this to smash down my polymer clay. I don't use it for what it is intended. But this works well without my polymer clay sticking to it. It sticks a little but not like when using a block a wood. Even if your polymer clay sticks a little to it, you can gently pull away the clay and it will come off in one piece. So it doesn't stick really bad.	1
very nice good quality easy to use very nice good quality easy to use very nice good quality easy to use	1
Excellent Product	1
So excited to use this block! it's big & perfect!	1
A very good handle for the cling stamps because the perimeter is wavy, allowing a quick pick-up. The handle is also very thick but crystal clear with a grid on the surface to make lining up the stamp a simple matter. And it can hold quite a large stamp.	1
Nice, thick block!	1
That's excellent. Thanks!!	1
Works as expected.	1
Thank you so much not only for the awesome item, but also for the speedy delivery & I would definitely order from you again in the future! Thank again, Lily	1
Very easy to grip, really like these.	1
Great seller; love the product; quick ship; highly recommend product & seller. Five Stars!!!!! A+++++!	1
Great price! I like the shape, it makes it easier to grasp.	1
Works as described. Is Lined for easy alignments. Think this would be considered a Medium sized block more then a large.	1
Good size.  Ex-large is really big	1
Having never used these blocks I was unsure, I purchased one large block as the stamps I ordered were different sizes.....I love it.	1
Extremely helpful in using cling stamps. Worth the investment.  They're durable and clean very easily.	1
Beautiful size, grid marks are clear and even	1
Works great for cling and clear stamps.	1
Good product!	1
i love these inkadinkado acrylic blocks, I bought one in every size as they are all the perfect depth and weight and are perfect to stamp with, especially with the measuring lines, they ensure a perfect stamp every time.	1
I was so glad I bought this large block, the stamps adhere to it easily, and it is nicely visible as to where you want to stamp on paper. It is the perfect size, you can place the stamp in the center or on the edges, and it is easly to hold and clean.	1
Expression vs. Slice There is no comparison - if you can only get 1 machine get the expression - it's worth the extra money...why? I have the Slice - that was my first machine (I got it 2 weeks ago) only because it had the designs I wanted (tags) and also had some cool accessories and it's my first die cut machine. You have to hold it down to use it, there aren't that many cartridges and if you wait for sales - they are both about the same $. If you need a machine to cut a couple of things here and there and go for the slice. (Read my Slice review for more details).  Expression vs. Personal The personal cricut only cuts to 5.5" - and it's pretty much like the Slice - around the same price point as well. It does NOT compare with the capabilities of the Expression. Expression cuts in larger sizes, more feature - the LCD screen is more detailed, it's a far more sophisticated machine (think of composition notebook vs. laptop) - also spoke with a cricut user at a store - she said that the Personal wastes a lot of paper  Expression vs. Sizzix - I didn't even really look at the Sizzix, I get they're cheaper, and they have a lot of cartridges and they're cheaper...there's a reason why the machine and cartridges are cheaper - they're VERY BASIC (it's like comparing 3rd grade education to graduate school), reviews on the Sizzix weren't very "WOW" and if I'm going to invest $$ - I rather get something WOW - the functionality and capabilities of Cricut products (even the personal) is far superior than the Sizzix  Expression Features that makes this machine SUPERIOR: Cuts 1/4" - 23.5 inches (most machines cut from 1/2" and at 1/2" increments - this is 1/8" increments - and about 7" max) Cartridges - very intricate shapes - when you find them on sale - it's WORTH IT! Plus they have the licensed shapes (Spongebob, Dora, Hello Kitty, Disney...) Each cartridge seems to hold ALOT of options and information. There are so many varieties Layering options available (exp - trees - it will cut the "bark" then i set another option to cut the individual leaves - a little bit of spray adhesive and tweezers, BAM - I have a fully functional colored tree) Design is clean, tight and slim, it's very light and portable (not that I intend on schlepping it, but if I had to, I will) you can leave it - program and walk away  What I wish came with the machine: For the $$ - There should have been extra blades + 12" x 24" mat (it can cut up to that, so why no mat?) + spatula! It seems really silly to nickel & dime customers for equipment they need to make the machine useful - I have a spatula from my Slice tool kit (slice doesn't include that either)  What I've done/thoughts so far (I've only had it for 2 days): AWESOME - I can program what I want it to cut and walk away! with the Slice, I have to hold the machine in place. SPEEDY!! It might be worthwhile to buy an extra mat anyways to load your next set of media while you're removing it off the first mat. (This would be important if you're into efficiency) MUST read directions of the machine first! Then load the cartridge and read those directions! YOU HAVE TO SET ASIDE A SOLID HOUR OF FOCUS TO USE THIS MACHINE! There are so many functions/features you don't want to miss anything. Had I read the directions first i'd figure out how to load the paper. It's aligned on the bottom left corner (DUR) You can use ANY size paper as long as it's 3" x 3" - just set the paper size and it'll know and plan for you to minimize waste Cardstock set blade at 3 - pressure at medium - speed (doesn't really matter) Paper - set blade at 1 - pressure low - speed (doesn't really matter) Foam (set blade at 6 - pressure max - speed SLOW) I feel like I need the deep cut blade (another accessory) - the cuts aren't very clean but it works (I'm using the "Printing 101" Cartridge - making alpha puzzle pieces to teach my kiddo letters) Speed - the slower the better it seems like but for thinner media it doesn't matter Make sure to have enough table space - you'll need space behind the machine for the feeder  Projects in the future: Definitely making cards! More foam shapes (Spongebob cartridge) - and letters Cardstock animals to teach my kiddo (same with food / etc). (Animal Kingdom Cartridge) I want to try to use other medium - fabric, adhesive, magnetic sheets, stamp, embossing I want to get the design software to make my own "cuts" Helping my kiddos with their school project - making adhesives to stick on walls Getting sticky textured cardstock to make our own "stickers"  FINAL THOUGHTS: If you get Expression - Buy spatula (unless you already have one) If you plan on doing projects larger than 12" buy the 12" x 24" mat Buy an extra set of mats anyways - it'll help keep your machine cutting while you're working =) Get a set of replacement blades if you intend on using this machine ASAP and ALOT (I've cut 9 foam sheets - 8 1/2" x 5 1/2" and 2 cardstock sheets) and I feel like my blade is getting iffy - or it just might be foam  DO NOT: ...Buy the Cricut bags (except maybe the duffel) most do not fit the expression - duffel will only fit expression if you expand it and it's not really "protective" - and doesn't hold much of anything, but if you're set on getting a bag - that's the only one that will work ...do this if you need silence - the machine is LOUD - think of your microwave running or the exhaust fan ...PAY FULL PRICE FOR CARTRIDGES - I got a ton for 60% off - really reasonable if you're willing to wait I'm going to be making friends with local people who use Cricut and maybe do a cartridge exchange (borrow) b/c not many of the cartridges are repeat use for me - and the ones that are I've bought - I wonder if this is an item that the public libraries have... ...PAY FULL PRICE PERIOD! Most of the national chain stores WILL NOT take their coupons on the machine, but if you are patient, the machines will go on sale - or scope out online venues. Most national chain stores will let you use their % off coupons on the accessories  EDIT 10/2013: I gave away my E1 and got an E2 - I sadly - like most reviewers regret doing so before using an E2. Well the E2 is terrible and had glitch after glitch. I miss my E1. I have over 30 cartridges so I'm tempted to get another E1 - but probably won't. I'll just use that money to invest in more cuts with the Silhouette. DO NOT GET AN EXPRESSION 2 - or you might end up sad like me. However, My E1 went to a school so I don't feel as badly. They love it and are having a good time making things for their students.  I've used a Silhouette for over a year and I actually love that machine more. It's a higher price point but the ease of use helps pays for itself. Silhouette's Design program is so much easier to use than CCR and offers a lot of flexibility. I think Cricut might have lost a customer (at least for their machines). They make the best mats hands down. I use their mats in my Silhouette.

I started out with the personal cutter; within a year, I'd moved up to the Cricut Expression. I purchased (all in one combo pack through Walmart) the black cricut expression, the tool kit in the green pouch, design studio, cutting mat (12x12), a spatula, and plantin schoolbook cartridge, as well as an instructional dvd for something around $285, which was the absolute best price for all I got! I got it site to store, so there was no shipping and handling, although it took about a week to get it. To save money on cutting mats, I had read that you could scrub them with a baby wipe and reglue them with a sponge tip brush and one part water to one part Aileene's tack again and again; I only had to scrub it with a baby wipe and it's like a new mat. I have done the vinyl wall art, glass etching, card making, mini albums, scrapbooking, posters for school projects, posters for girlscouts, ATCs, and probably a lot more that I can't even think of right now. You can purchase the cartridges very inexpensively ($20-$30 max) at Big Lots and Ebay, as well as at the Big Box stores during their sales (usually someone has them $35 or so around every other week: Michaels, ACMoore, and Joanns). I have around 25 cartridges right now, and reuse probably around 90% of them, as even the small seasonal ones have a ton of great images. I can't say enough good about the expression; just wish I had not spent the money on the baby bug and gone right ahead and gotten the expression first. This machine is amazing. You can make lots of beautiful gifts and save a lot of money this Christmas: etched glass vases and water glasses, decorative wall decals, stationary monograms, all-occasion card sets with envelopes. The best cartridges: Plantin Schoolbook, George is a close second; Wild Card; Tags, Bags Boxes and More; and Joys of the Season.	1
As a crafter, I have craft knives, swivel knives, scissors and a couple types of paper cutters. This is one of my favorites.  Because of the shape it can be used with whichever hand is dominant. I'm left handed and had absolutely no problems with this. I use it to cut pages for small notebooks, and have a separate one I use specifically for small fabric projects on a self sealing mat. It's easy to control and for small fussy cuts, it's a lot more precise than a rotary cutter.  It take standard craft blade refills. I really prefer this to my craft knife for small cuts.	1
When I saw this, it reminded me of the swivel knife used in leathercraft or a swivel glass cutter, which give a lot of control and are very easy to use.  This knife is NOTHING like that.  It feels pretty good on your finger, but I did not find more control at all...in fact, I found it harder to cut anything but completely straight lines.  Perhaps if the blade was shorter...I know Exacto has a stencil cutting blade that's at a little different angle, and I'll try that.  But if the Fiskars folks are reading this, please consider making this a swivel knife!  From the other positive reviews, maybe it's just me.  But I'll put my two cents' in...if you see this and remember using swivel knives that look like this...you'll be disappointed.	-1
I use it for my quilt projects. Quickly removes the smallest pieces or touches up an items. VERY HANDY AND EASY TO  USE KNIFE!!!	1
Very easy to handle and use. Even my mother can use it and she has severe rheumatoid arthritis in her fingers.	1
so easy to use! love it	1
One of my favorite paper craft tools!	1
I was highly disappointed in this product. I thought that I would be able to set the blade at any position that I wanted. It is fixed! I can't get my finger into the knife far enough to get a comfortable grip. I have to hold it by gripping it around the handle which makes it a very small knife to hold.	-1
This is a great tool to use for cutting.	1
Love this little guy !  Use it so much! Took me a few mins to figure out the best way for me to use it , but use it all the time now.	1
as expected	1
Now I can terrify all of Elm street with these convenient and travel sized finger blades!!!	1
good size	1
very good	1
Exactly what I expected and very comfortable to use for small hands.	1
. Very good.	1
This was a second purchase of this item. Lost the first and could not appreciate other cutters for my projects. Comfortable and easy to use.	1
Very easy to use. Fast cuts around images on paper. Felt I was in full control of the blade.	1
Very useful tool	1
This thing works great for cutting out stencils to use with my airbrush.  Love it.	1
Very handy, takes regular blades and useing only one fingler reduces back end wiggle for a more sure cut.  Nifty lil gadget.	1
These are great easy to hold knifes.	1
material is not too good	-1
Love this little knife!  I have a silhouette vinyl cutter. I love using this blade to weed and cut away the paper backing from the uncut roll/sheet after weeding the vinyl.  Simple and very easy to use, it's just like a very sharp extension of your fingertip!  Simply point and use a little pressure and it cuts very easily.	1
Great and Handy	1
I now own 2	1
Great item, great price. These are easier to use than a regular exacto knife. IT takes a few attempts to get used to the grip but once you do its super nice and I feel I have better control over the blade. IT takes regular exacto knife blades. I bought a pack of 100 fairly inexpensively.	1
Great transaction, great item	1
great idea but not very controllable for small accuracy.  It works great for large cutting, but would not consider it 'precision'	-1
Use these for cutting, trimming and assembling paper and cardstock models.  Invaluable, esp if you have a self healing backer board.	1
great item. nice to have it in my tool box	1
I have arthritis in my hands but I still do a lot of crafting. This knife made all the difference for me.	1
love it.	1
Functioned batter than normal crafting knifes! Good for long term use, because you are using 3 fingers to control this knife. However, normal pen knives you need 2. Therefor, it is more accurate, easy to use, and save up your energys. AND IT WORK REALLY WELL ON MY PROJECTS!!! LOVE IT FIVE STARS!!!!!!!	1
Works like a charm	1
A new seam ripper!	1
Love these for working with my vinyl when weeding	1
This knife is perfect for cutting acetate for shaker cards.	1
I am an artist and I do a lot of work with mixed media and collaging.  For years I have been using the straight, pencil type exacto knives and have been pleased with them....until I found this.  The control that I have over the blade of this cutter is far superior to your typical exacto knife.  I am very pleased with this product and highly recommend it.  It is constructed very well and the price point is incredible!	1
Great little knife, easy to handle left or right handed.	1
This is an awesome idea.  I inadvertently ordered 2 so I'll give one to my girlfriend who I know will love it as much as I do.  It's so much easier to use because you have control over it better than a long handled one.	1
better to me than most brands that I owned .	1
One of my favorite pottery tools...easy to use!	1
These really take a bit to get used to, I'm not sure I prefer this type of blade over the typical stick blade- though, perhaps with more use I could.	1
All expectations were met.	1
So easy to use & helpful to cut details on small projects. Really like this tool!	1
Great new tool	1
As a costumer and seamstress I sometimes find myself using very odd tools for very different tasks. I purchased two of these craft knives for that exact purpose. I find that this particular knife is easier to use and handle than a long handled knife. The odd shape of the handle allows for me to get better leverage on whatever I am using this for. My only complaint is that I find sometimes the cupplet used to keep the blade in place begins to loosen. Luckily the tool holds onto the blade better than most knives and I can almost always readjust and retighten before any issues.	1
Exactly what I was looking for.	1
Nice, sturdy made, easy to replace blades even when wet.	1
Better then the pen type craft knife. I can definitely control where and what I want to cut better with this fingertip type craft knife.	1
Works well but the blade did eventually come out because the plastic that held the blade in place cracked.	1
Fiskars Fingertip Craft Knife. Great product for arthritis sufferers. Thanks.	1
I have been using this knife for over a decade. There simply is no better way to cut out intricate shapes by hand. The design is super intuitive, and it feels similar to holding a pencil. Luckily, blades are very easy to change. I honestly cannot count how many times I have used this knife for projects, a lot of which were decoupage.	1
This is a very useful single finger knife.	1
Great added control to your cuts when using this fingertip cutter.  Fiskars makes quality products, I have found their Ax, Rotary cutter, cutting mat and various other tools to hold up better and just feel better in the hand.	1
I think the blade dulled very quickly and to be honest, I didn't use very much	-1
This craft knife is great for small projects.  You have very finite control being a small, finger cutter.  Very sharp.  I would recommend for any crafter.	1
Blade doesn't stay firmly in holder. Great idea, just needs more work. Cap sticks and have almost cut myself getting it off. I've only used it cutting on cardboard- got stuck almost every time with the blade out of the holder. I was thinking it was a ergomatic exacto knife. Not so, doesn't tighten down the blade like a regular exacto knife. Will probably find some use for it eventually. Pretty color easy to see.	-1
Excellent Product	1
I work with children and these have been FANTASTIC for them to use to cut out projects (like CUBEES) and yet not cut themselves.  The kids can control where they want to cut much better with the shape of it (how it fits around the finger) which is nice for the craft, but even better to not have any "accidents".  I wish I had known of these before - but I'm glad I do now, and will never go back to "old school pencil shaped" xacto knifes.	1
Wow!  This is the best tool ever created to work on delicate and intricate projects.  The handle comfortably slips over your thumb or finger and on a slight angle to cut out the most intricate pieces without getting hand cramps that are so common from holding a traditional craft knife.  This is the best invention ever for any craft.	1
Works awesome, it cuts and it comfortably nestles on your fingertip for comfortable cutting. It's no different than any regular craft knife blade wise but it's a fingertip knife, how cool is that?	1
Good quality and great for precision cutting in tight areas.	1
I have a tremor, and the ease of use with this small tool makes my craft projects more enjoyable.	1
Love it.  Took a while to get the hang of it, but it works nicely.	1
USE FOR ANY CUTTING NEEDS.  CUTTING TRACING PATTERNS OR FABRICS.	1
Where has this been all my life??!! Great Product & Great Value!	1
Love it!	1
Great, easy to handle and cuts neatly.	1
makes cutting templates very easy	1
Fits comfortably on your finger. It's much easier to use than the other tools like it. You can get the other blades from the knives to fit it which is awesome. If you don't have a steady hand to use the knife then I recommend this one.	1
Love this tool.  Great for left handers as well as right.	1
Really nice to have	1
Very much needed	1
Love it!  I have arthritis in my hands and this design makes repetitive movements easier. Got it promptly and just as described. Thanks!	1
Great hobby knife.	1
I bought this for my wife who makes jewelry.  I have not heard a loud sound that I can easily identify as this product being thrown against a wall, so I can only assume it works as advertised.  I know this does not help, but there doesnt seem to be a button for "I don't want to review this product" so I am doing this to clear the item from "Review Me!" status.	1
I am not really sure about this one. Shipping time great, price great , product isn't as good as I thought it would be. I bought the blades thats for it and they seem to be too long in the shank , and when you press on the knife the blade moves , I have to cut the shanks on the blades so that they don't move in the adjuster	-1
I purchased 2 of these. One for my parents home and one for mine. After giving one to my mom, I later learned my dad hadn't seen it and wanted his own, lol. Needless to say, I'll be ordering a 3rd for myself.  I think this is a great tool! Not only for those with tremors, like in my family, but also just for the ease of use that this provides... It allows for easily cutting in tight spaces and allows swift, graceful cuts when needed to cut a long straight line, easily. The grip provides excellent control and is well made.  If you like this product, I think you may also appreciate this one (see my review here): http://www.amazon.com/review/RRJGH5ALLIVDI/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm  Very happy with this purchase. Smile. Hope this is helpful!	1
It does the job. Sometimes I do not feel very comfortable but.. handy tool.	1
Really Great...	1
Surprised at how great this works. LOVE it.	1
Nice control, good edge.	1
Easy to use.	1
Great product.  I use it for leatherworking.  Only complaint is I wish the blades were compatible with Xacto and some of the other common brands.  Not perfect but serves my purposes well as a leatherworker.	1
fast shipping very nice would buy again	1
Fits finger really nicely.  Great for precision cutting	1
I love this little thing for cutting little detail areas I could not reach	1
Very high quality product, ergonomic and easy to use.	1
works great on my plastic canvas projects.	1
I figure, for the $$ it's okay. Works well but not a super power house. Takes a *lot* of work to clean up.	1
Love this craft knife.  Comfortable and easy to use.	1
These are very awkward and I  find it hard to use on my projects.	-1
I love this. It makes cutting around small areas very simple.	1
Works really well, great for scrapbooking	1
My hand gets so tired and sore using a regular style exacto knife. This saved the day! It is comfortable, refillable (fits the regular exacto blades) and easy to handle.	1
this works well if you have arthritis and are unable to move your fingers after prolonged use. I love the way this fits.	1
Pretty cool once you get the hang of it. And I definitely recommend for left handed people especially. I am a lefty. And it is ergonomically more comfortable than scissors. I use it to cut heat n bond, vinyl sheets & paper ~ You must use this with a cutting mat! ;)	1
The design of this craft knife is pure genius!  When I saw it used on a YouTube crafts tutorial video the other day, I knew I had to get it.  It's so comfortable, while at the same time providing precision control.  Although it only comes with one blade (Fiskars standard blade #11), I'll just wait until I find a Fiskars sale, then stock up on them.  Another great addition to my crafting tools collection.	1
I have used this knife before and found it to be very useful. It is nice for people with arthritic hands. Handy tool.	1
The knife is handy and useful and is pretty comfortable to use.  I  just wish it had come with extra blades!	1
This unusually-shaped craft knife works well for holding an exacto-style blade for cutting. And, it's compact and it doesn't roll off the table. However, I find that I often end up holding it like a normal craft knife, because I can't get the cutting angle I need with it stuck over my finger.	1
This little knife is so awesome and allows you to maneuver many different angles with it.  I love it!  It was really sharp, too!	1
than an ordinary xacto, so I don't get it at all. The blade is overall shorter, too. dot dot dot.	-1
it is the best, to get in close to cut out small items and a neat cut....if your like me you want it to look good. I got it with this. hey make sure you take it off I almost cut my face...due to it feels so easy you will forget you have it on to reach for other things. thank you and this was brought for a great price.	1
My friend recommended me this tool. I still have to learn how to it and get familiarized with the strength I need to you with it. The tool is great for cutting details and inside details of images.	1
It's small and comfortable and I don't run a risk of cutting myself when doing precision work the way I do with a "standard" exacto.	1
I do a lot of intricate paper crafts, and this knife has been a godsend. It really is easier for me to control than those terrible straight metal handles. Perfect if you need to be able to cut small items for hours at a time.	1
The Fiskars Fingertip Craft Knife is handy for it's obvious purpose, but I find myself using it to pick up glue dots and gems for placement on projects.	1
This knife works really well and is very sharp! I use it to carefully cut pieces out of faux fur fabric since using scissors or a rotary cutter cause the fur to shed. Highly recommended.	1
This is a GREAT craft item! I bought this at the same time as a Fiskars soft grip craft knife (which I also love). This little thing allows for great control, and it really is ergonomic. I like that it is easy to find blade replacements for the Fiskars craft knives. I highly recommend this product.	1
very easy to control and compact in my tool box ten more words are not needed to say what I mean.	1
This is great.  It gives great control for when you are trying to go for a precision or tight cut.	1
I'm always looking for items to use in my crafting and this Fingertip craft knife makes cutting detailed items easier than with a scissors.  It fits the finger comfortably and you have more control over what you are cutting.  I keep it right at hand at all times, use it all the time.  I would recommend this item.	1
Though the tips are quite large they provide an excellent line because of the easy flow and coverage.  You will not be disappointed in their performance and the quality of the work you can produce with them.	1
This is an excellent set of metallic markers and priced right.  The color is highly pigmented.  Try them and see for yourself.	1
This is awesome	1
Love these. Arrived quickly. Very happy!	1
Easy to use for 1st grade artwork	1
These are great colors for my card making hobby.	1
I love writing, coloring & drawing with these! I was so impressed at the smoothness in which they glide across the paper. The colors are beautiful and although used frequently show zero sign of drying out. A great purchase.	1
Beautiful color and coverage.	1
I purchased the same markers in fine point. These are great for filling in things that need a lot of color. I also use them on wood and they work great.	1
There are many wide tipped pens, even metallic pens. I find the finer tips suit my needs better, but it is all a matter of preference. I do wish they made more colors of pens though.	1
These are great metallic markers, for an excellent price.  Perfect for any and all types of mixed media, etc.  Beautiful, rich colors and they can mark over just about anything or any color!	1
My daughter loves to draw and really do all sorts of art.  I always try to keep varying media in our art supply cabinet, just to keep her interested.  These are really cool metallic markers.  I would definitely buy them again.	1
I love the way these markers work. They cover smooth and completely. The colors are very nice and bright. I Don't know how long they will last but I'm sure it is like any other will. I feel this is a good choice for metallic pens.	1
For the price, these are nice markers. I bought this due to the price and curiosity about the possibility of metallic markers. They show up well on dark surfaces and seem to be a good product. I am no longer shopping for the Sharpie or Bic ones, until I am sure Metallic markers are going to add to my craft projects. I like being able to try the cheaper option first.	1
Just what I wanted.	1
I do a lot of seed beading and K.O. is the type of Thread I like to work with they make the project look so much cleaner.	1
I love this thread, it's a little pricey compared to the older threads for some applications and it's not my favorite for things like embroidery because it's a very hard thread but for bracelets and other hard wearing pieces of woven beadwork it's my brand new favorite. It's very strong and I've used it single strand in chevron bracelets and had them wear very well. One of my favorite things about this thread is that if you do get a knot in it, it's very easy to untie using the tip of a needle without splitting the thread. I've never seen a beading thread you could do that with before. Highly recommended. I've used it with size 11/o and 15/o Japanese beads. Haven't tried it yet with charlottes.	1
Working with Delica beads requires a good thread.  This one does a great job and comes in many colors.  I will definitely use this in the future.	1
I placed this patch on my vest.  We need to always remember those who gave their all.  I spent 20 plus years in the military.	1
Great looking patch, great quality and at a very affordable price. I highly recommend this patch to anyone looking to patch their cut.	1
This is a beautiful US ARMY patch;  identical to my spouses one from basic training. It's about 2 inches diameter and embriodered not decal. You always need more when the patches get torn.  I am glad I found this amazon seller.  Will buy from again.  5 stars.	1
Good quality patch.	1
Nice patch quick shipping	1
Stitching and colors are good, but lacks a means of attachment. It is an 'iron on' patch only so will have to find some Velcro to iron on then can attach to jacket! Detailing is excellent but that is a function of the computer that produced it!	1
This item rolls around the bottom and sides of the ring and bugs the heck out of me.  Not the greatest accomplishment guys.  Everything else has got to be better than this!	-1
Husband loves his!	1
Great product, ring now fits perfectly.	1
These are for my oversized rings.	1
I've shared these with friends and family.  They love them.	1
There were enough different sizes in one package to fit all my rings. I've been able to wear my rings now. I'm not bothered by the soft plastic ring. I don't remove my rings to shower or wash my hands. The Snuggies work great.	1
There was a warehouse label stuck on the back so we could not read the instructions.  Not sure if we put them on correctly however seems to be working.	1
I have a diamond eternity ring that was getting too loose and I was afraid to wear it. I have tried almost everything but nothing worked like these do. As soon as I selected the size I needed and cut it to size whamo that was it. I am so happy. It is exactly what I needed until I get to my jeweler.  Hope the picture helps.	1
Kept falling off of rings. Would not recommend !!	-1
The best I found for resizing a ring.  Easy to put on any ring.  An the assortment gives you the option for ring sizes.	1
Good price and they work!	1
thanks for the ring sizers came in handy for my rings.	1
None of them fit the person who I bought them for.	-1
Help keep rings  in place	1
Don't really work well. Turn around a lot and fall off.  Do not recommend purchase.,!	-1
I just love these things.  They're just perfect.	1
don't stay on the  ring. hard to get on. won't recommend it.	-1
I don't recommend these.  They are hard to put on the ring and easy to come off, plus they are bulky feeling and uncomfortable.	-1
They fall off all the time. Worthless.	-1
They are OK. Definitely better than the metal ones but I was disappointed that only 1 in the entire package, fit my ring. I decided to use a plastic that melts and put it around my ring. Much better mold and hold.	1
I was very disappointed in this product.	-1
They were too thick and bulky and made the rings way too tight.  Everyone in the package was the same thickness	-1
As Advertised.  Well constructed, well satisfied.	1
I did not like these they did not work for me to bulky and they slide around	-1
Works great for rings of all sizes	1
Works very well to resize a ring that is a little too big. Stays put and is comfortable.	1
Various sizes included in package so you can find the one that fits right!	1
Good value, as described, speedy delivery.	1
Granted, my ring band is a "branch style" so it isn't the same size the full way around. However, I can't help but think these would feel just as foreign and precarious on a standard ring as they do on mine. This type of thing should be a temporary fix for a ring that's going to get resized, but sometimes that isn't possible due to resources or time. The idea sounds good, but in practice it feels like hard plastic pressing into your hand whenever you hold something. It also popped off of my ring on a daily basis. There's a seemingly perfect span of band on my ring without branches that can fit the snuggie, so I didn't think it would pop off. This happens especially when it's cold.  In a pinch, this is a temporary fix. Not great for the long term.	-1
Ridiculous, uncomfortable pieces of thick plastic tubing.	-1
My fingers swell in the heat and need ring snuggies in the winter and these are perfect!	1
husband loosing weight & wedding ring too loose. these worked great, he's very happy with the Snuggies	1
These seem to be made for SQUARE rings. There's zero bend to them. Better off using tape.	-1
Great	1
Ring Snuggies work great. But it is best if you buy variety packs . Some of them can be hard to fit rings.	1
They fall off all the time.	-1
to big an clunky sticks out when on ring. kept getting caught in my hair.	-1
Take up too much room on your finger than expected.	-1
I am enclosing Ring Snuggie with every ring I sell and my Customers love them.	1
Meh, not for me. They made my ring too tight so I gave them to mom. Her size adjuster popped off and was lost forever but she liked it while it lasted.	-1
These really work great.  I would recommend these to anyone whose rings are loose.	1
Got these for my mother. She said they were fine.	1
Works great.	1
I've been making strides in my health and am finding that my wedding bands are none too snug these days. I'm afraid of losing them constantly.  I sought out these Ring Snuggies here on Amazon. I received them yesterday and was really happy to find that even with my wide band- 6mm there was a Snuggie that fit. I've been wearing it all day and it fits perfect- I can barely tell it's there unless I flatten my palm against something. So I'm glad it's comfortable. I would highly recommend this item for anyone who has found themselves in a similar situation- and I just don't want to have them sized yet as my healthy journey continues I might find that I'll need to go even smaller.	1
Exactly what I needed!	1
Waste of $$$ don't work	-1
waste of money is what I can say.	-1
The plastic is too thick and dense to place around the ring comfortably.	-1
Ugly, awkward and clumsy.  Difficult to install.  Near impossible to remove while on finger.&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Ring-Snuggies-The-Original-Ring-Adjusters-Assorted-Sizes/dp/B0014DGXU8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Ring Snuggies - The Original Ring Adjusters - Assorted Sizes</a>&nbsp;Unacceptable product.	-1
Easy to use and comfortable	1
love the variety of sizes.  really works well. there's a size to fit all rings in the pack	1
They work great feel comfortable if you wear it 24/7 as i do you will need to replace it every couple months but it does come with a bunch so not really a problem	1
Didn't work for my wider band. The diff sizes r nice but nothing bigger. Most r just small & medium. So bummed. Really needed.	1
Arrived promptly, good  assortment, work well.	1
Too bulky on finger	-1
The Snuggies really work. I do not care what anyone says, these things do the trick!	1
a little bulky.	-1
keep popping off	-1
Finally got a hold of these ring sizers and they work wonderfully. Thank you	1
You cannot use these with rings that are too thick because the plastic won't fit all the way around the ring. That said, these work VERY well with the majority of my rings. I had several that were too loose on me and this fixed the problem right up.	1
Too bulky, didn't work. Not comfortable. Sorry I bought them. Will resize ring.	-1
I got engaged and my ring was a half a size too big. I ordered these and they were perfect. Obviously got more than I needed but did its job and kept my ring tight until I was able to get it sized.	1
Used these years ago and happy to find again. Works just as good as they did back then!	1
They work pretty well. Some times they work their way around front and you have to readjust. But it is a quick and inexpensive solution.	1
Great	1
Work okay.	1
Good, but not perfect. However, does what I need it to do.	1
Need this for any loose fitting rings.	1
I guess these are better than nothing.	1
Can't beat it for the price and ease of use. My knuckles are swollen with arthritis, so I have to wear an oversized ring. I've been using a Bandaid--not ideal, because it holds water and looks tacky. Or I could pay a jeweler $500 to put a Fingermate device on my ring. Not much of a choice. So I ordered these little plastic Snuggies, and frankly, I love them. They don't hold water, they're easy to slip on and off but they stay on the ring when they need to, and they're comfortable. Also, they're made of clear plastic so they're not real noticeable. Grateful for a cheap and comfortable fix to my ring problem.	1
Just what I needed.	1
Great Product	1
These were just what I was looking for after losing 60 lbs I was wearing different cheap rings instead of my wedding ring. My husband didn't like that.  So I ordered these and I can wear my wedding ring again	1
very  helpful	1
Works great!	1
does exactly what it should and is a LOT less than getting ring re-sized	1
They're definitely not invisible and are a bit cumbersome and uncomfortable to wear -- your best bet is just to get your ring sized by a professional jeweler.	1
Very happy with these-- lost one when drying my hands but didn't realize it right away--- my own fault--- bought 2 pkgs just for that reason!!!! They are great!!!!!!!!!!	1
They don't work very accurately	-1
easy to use. I have to remove it to take the ring off, but that's easy to do.	1
Some days, I really need these SNUGGIES to securely wear some of my rings.  If your hands swell occasionally, the rings might fit well, and other days, these are indispensable to secure the rings my mother left to me -- her fingers were so much smaller than mine.  I've lost 3 favorite pinkie rings over the years, just because I didn't take this extra precaution.  I rely on my Snuggies to resize a fashion ring that I bought for my thumb, index or middle finger so I can wear it comfortably/safely on your my finger.  Now, how smart is that?!	1
The ring snuggies popped off after one day wearing and it is uncomfortable.	-1
The ring size adjusters work as advertised.  There are a variety of sizes to fit different rings in the package.	1
Very nice product! I'm one of those that is glad I tried these! I read the many negative reviews, and it honestly looked kinda Mickey Mouse--eee to me, but they were cheap, so I tried 'em. And they work great on my rings! Keeps them rock steady--even my giant 10 carat emerald solitaire ring with a itty bitty 1.5 mm shank--the QUEEN of rolling rings! My rings mostly slide on and off with the snuggles on, but what I did was to take some household silicone (glue) and a tiny eyeglass screwdriver. I then put the snuggles on my rings, and then smeared and gently pressed a TINY coat of the silicone down into the snuggie's long slit opening. I held it closed tight for a few minutes, and then moved the Snuggie's around to make sure it did NOT glue down to the actual metal surface of the ring, and then let dry overnight, off of my fingers. This has sealed the snuggie's shut wth a nice flexible glue, and now I can rip my rings on and off all day (I never get them wet) and the snuggies are always in place around the shank. GREAT!  I enjoy my rings SO much more now that they are rock steady. Particularly my big huge Columbian emerald ring that with it's teeny shank used to roll and roll and roll back and forth. Not anymore, thanks Snuggie's!	1
Perfect for what I needed	1
I can now wear to large rings!	1
UNCOMFORTABLE TO WEAR	-1
Good for most rings , but not for wide width rings.	-1
Cant use them. they don't stay on any size ring even tried the different sizes.	-1
These are not as comfortable as I had hoped they would be, but they keep my ring from sliding off or turning upside down.	1
Perfect	1
This product was badly needed by me as my wedding set is a bit to big for me. However, I downgraded it by a star because after wearing it for a month or so (regular normal use) the split used to get the plastic band onto your ring spread open to large and would fall off my ring. Now I realize this is a multi pack but I was hoping I would get more use out of one. They do work and there are a multi-pack of them.	1
work as expected	1
great and helped me size my rings I cannot cut down.........	1
plastic too hard. can't get it on with the ring already on. Getting it off so your ring will go over your knuckle is almost impossible. Totally not worth buying. Way overpriced for what it is.	-1
Waste of money	-1
It's ok.  I have to watch it because sometimes the plastic pieces slide off.	-1
do not fit well	-1
A cheap alternative to better products.	1
stops rings from turning, give it a try.	1
Package give you different choices as to what size to use.  Like that they are easy to fit to the ring and are easy to clean.  Great buy.	1
These were good in that they came in several sizes so you could have two rings together and you could put one on two rings. Unfortunately they are a little thick. So if you are only needing a slight fit adjustment they might not work. They were to thick for the ring I needed them for, but I have a couple of other rings that they will work on as those rings have gotten loose due to some weight loss. Now I will be able to wear them again. They are clear enough to make them hardly noticeable. If you really look hard at the hand in an up position you will see it, but seeing as how most people don't sit with there hands palm up, it will most likely not be noticed.	1
works well.	1
I loved	1
Do not buy. Terrible and too  thick. Not at all like pictured. Buy ring noodle instead. Have used these as well and are much better	-1
The "snuggies" rolled around and were uncomfortable to wear. I would prefer something more stable, the rolling was pretty distracting and annoying.	-1
Absolutely terrible. The description says "assorted sizes" but what I got was a box of Jumbo snuggies that are 3x the circumference of a jumbo drinking straw. Completely useless. I would have to use on a ring 10x too big for me.	-1
I have to vote no on these. They just don't sty on.	-1
Good product. As described and does what it says it will.	1
Great solution for large knuckles like mine!	1
These work, but they're a little bulky. And you can catch them on stuff. Please don't smack anyone while you're wearing one of these, I'm sure it will leave a mark. :-( Note: You shouldn't be smacking anyone anyway. It makes Jesus cry. ;_;	1
They come off.	-1
It is hard and catch's on things	-1
They fall off	-1
I love it fit great on my wedding band	1
These are to thick and uncomfortable on your finger. :(	-1
These fall off too easily and kind of pinch. I wasted my money on them.	-1
Just what I wanted, not easy to find. I have some others and they work great, don't hold bacteria like tape does.	1
I've purchased these snuggies several times. They are so easy to attach to my rings and ensure that they won't fall off my fingers on cold days. Then there are times when the weather is hot and my rings fit perfectly without a snuggie. Sometimes, a snuggie might accidentally fall off, so I make sure to have plenty of spares to replace them. The old fashioned metal adjusters are so flimsy and don't last long at all. I love these little guys and wouldn't be without theml. Thanks Springdale, you've got a great product here.	1
Great	1
I was skeptical about ordering these as I had recently bought some metal ones from a different sellar. But I must say that they were easy to put on and since there were six to a pack in various sizes I was able to use them on all my rings! Great product at a very reasonable price and will definetly be ordering more should the need arise	1
Purchased this for my daughter, who is an avid photographer,for storage of her photos. These boxes seem to work great for what she wanted, as well as, being acid free. Received them quickly thanks to Amazon and their supplier. Great job as usual!	1
I have 6 of these, each holding 2 12x12 scrapbooks.  They make storage quite easy and are attractive enough to leave out on open shelves.  The label holder in the front is a little tricky to use as the tag can fall out the bottom if it isn't thick enough card stock.  Note: some 12x12 scarpbooks are about 1/4" too wide to fit the boxes but the majority of the ones I had did fit.	1
These work like a charm, but they keep rolling off my ring when I wash my hair or change clothing. I need to have bumps put into my ring but am waiting until summer to see if my fingers swelling will cause my ring to fit tighter.  In the meantime, these suit their purpose and my ring doesn't slip around my finger.	1
I was very happy with these ring size adjusters.  There's a great selection of sizes for any type ring that cannot be sized by a jeweler.  They are comfortable to wear all day and easy to use.  I recommend them especially because they are so easy to wear.  The only slightly negative thing is that you can see them on when your palm is face up, but my friends and family say it's only noticeable to me	1
These work extremely well on rings that are too big.  There are a variety of sizes & are clear so they cannot be seen.	1
Wonderful boxes for storage of archival documents.	1
This were very uncomfortable to wear and make the ring rather bulky and I think it looks quite unsightly as well.	-1
Great storage boxes.	1
love these for storing over sized documents	1
I bought these to store my artwork in. They work great so far and I can't be happier.	1
Perfect for storage, fits on the closet shelf well.	1
Thank you Pioneer for a fine product.  Well made.  Attractive.  The perfect size for scrapbooking.	1
Great for photo storage.	1
Lots of storage here- I got 4 of them for storing scrapbook collections that go together. They shipped very fast.	1
Very nice large storage box for vintage photos.	1
Perfect, very sturdy. I actually use them for keepsake storage...cards, letters, etc. and I can label the front (Mother's Day, etc), which I love.	1
Product was exactly as described and the perfect color! Fast shipping!	1
The item arrived scratched on the lid.  I was going to return, but felt it would be too costly and take too much effort.	-1
I have three of these boxes and might buy more. They seem sturdy, look neat, and work well for storing 12x12 scrapbooks, pads, and papers.	1
I needed something to store my cross stitch materials - scissors, thread, 10-inch and 8-inch embroidery hoops... This box is the perfect size to store three of my projects at once. It is also cat-proof (my cat is the reason I needed to put away my thread in the first place). The color of this box in real life is slightly lighter than in the photo, but pretty close to what is shown online. The box did not smell bad when it arrived and was brand new (not like IKEA boxes and plastic boxes which both stink when they are new). My only complaint about this box is that the quality is just so-so - if you want the seams of the box to be perfectly flat, you may not like this box.	1
It's just a box. Perfect for holding stuff. The label in front is sorta useless. One complaint is that it's kind of expensive for just a box.	1
I don't like these because they are so uncomfortable. I just tried 2 of them and they are in the drawer now.	-1
Although these do exactly as they say, they are extremely bulky and make it uncomfortable. It has a tendency to still twist up the side of your finger or just falls off.  Won't be buying again.	-1
I was hesitant to buy these because of the mixed reviews. I am glad I did though. I recently lost 30 lbs and my wedding ring was flopping all over the place. I was afraid I would lose it because it could fall right off. I had this ring sized right after I got married and it was quite pricey! I didn't want to pay for it to be resized in the winter either because it might be too small in the summer. They are a little gaudy and unattractive but it keeps my ring where it needs to be. My engagement & wedding ring are fused together so the band is pretty thick. Two of the sizes were able to fit without a problem. Once I got used to the Snuggie I couldn't tell I had it on. I wash my hands very often and water an soap gets trapped in the Snuggie so I do have to wash it with a Q-tip on occasion. I will use this until I finally give in and have the ring resized.	1
I am very pleased with my purchase. The snuggies slip easily onto my rings that are too large and now they fit nicely.	1
These are way too bulky for most normal lady fingers, so I shaved one down a bit with a stanley and that worked for a bit, but I found after a few weeks, the ring still spun and now I had 2 annoying heavy bits to contend with, it was like I had a stone either side and they spun in unison, It didn't grip or stay put at all, so I wouldn't recommend.	-1
I don't feel like drop 1G to get my wife's ring resized by 1/4 of a size right now. Especially since the holidays and we've all beefed up an additional 5-10 lbs. So this was a quick fix so that my wife didn't lose here 10k ring. It's worked thus far, and she hasn't complained about feeling it.  So - so far - so good.	1
My ring is maybe a half a size too big and I thought these would help. Maybe if I needed a whole size smaller but not just a little unfortunately  I will not be using these!	-1
I bought these...I thought ok...I can wear my wedding ring again. I've lost a considerable amount of weight, so my wedding ring is exceptionally loose...too loose to wear safely. I bought these thinking they would help...and every single size I tried came off...and was uncomfortable before it did. Same situation with my husband. He's also lost a considerable amount of weight so can't wear his wedding ring. So we tried a couple of the big ones on him. Well, turns out it wasn't that I have wacky fingers or something...they did the exact same thing with his as with mine. Definitely not something I would recommend.	-1
These do exactly what I needed them to do, fix the fit on a ring. They come in multiple sizes that should fit most rings. They are only for rings with a slim band however, as the hole for the band is rather small. No wide band rings would work!	1
I know some feedback on this item has been that it is difficult to add to ring, but I found it to be relatively easy.  It is about expectations, I think.  But, if I had arthritis it might not be easy.  So, keep in mind that it will be the same as sewing.  It is certainly much cheaper than paying for a ring adjustment, which may not be permanent (if you are like me, my ring size fluctuates with my weight :(  argggg.  But, this is a great solution.  Wish I had more in the packet.	1
This product has allowed my to delay sizing my recent diamond ring purchase.  The jeweler made it slightly too large and I wanted to take it now, come back later.  I have smallish hands and find that the tubing is too wide to wear comfortably, so I cut them in half width wise and it works fine.  Another plus--it keeps the ring from slipping and circling around the finger, diamond side down.  One negative--I wear my diamond rings stacked and can only use it on one ring or they look oddly spaced.  Otherwise, nice product.  I wonder if buying some tubing from an aquarium store or pet shop and making a slice in to allow it to go around the ring would do the same thing?  That's what I would do if I needed to buy again.  Still, good product, great idea.	1
Sellers are fine but the product is awful, just awful. It's tubing and I lost it first day I wore it. Why bother with another, and even being tubing, it's only a few tiny pieces of this. It's a rip off. If you want to get the product okay, but feel ripped off----buy it.	1
These things are really hard to get on and off, so unless you sleep in your rings every night (ie, rarely take them off) they are simply impractical. Only wore for two days. They are comfortable. Only worked for two rings - was not able to get it around both bands and the engagement ring.	-1
uncomfortable. Falls off. pinches finger! I would rather wrap a string around my ring 40 times to make it fit rather than wear one of these. I returned it 2 days later.	-1
This little piece of tubing that fits over the back of the ring works amazingly well to keep the rings in place and they do not come off. The plastic tubing is a little bulky but the ability to wear the ring makes it worth while.	1
These are pretty awesome. I was a little apprehensive about them because they look cheap but they're pretty awesome. I've been using bandaids as a crappy substitute and this is so much better! They're comfortable and they fit really well. I would definitely buy them again.	1
This package comes with about 6 different sizes in the package.  They are clear pvc and are flexable.  The perfect size for my ring was not included but there were a couple that were close enough.  They will work as a short term fix as I lose weight so that I don't have to get my ring sized to keep from losing it.  They are not something you would want to use forever because they add bulk to the back of the ring and aren't as comfortable.	1
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN ALMOST 3 YEARS I CAN AGAIN WEAR MY WEDDING RING, THANKS TO YOUR PRODUCT. IT IS A SHAME TO WASTE THE OTHER 4 PIECES; TOO BAD YOU DON'T OFFER INDIVIDUAL SIZED PACKAGED, WITH 5 OF THE SAME... PERHAPS SOON...LOVE IT.	1
Just spend the money to get your ring properly sized... I found this item to be irritating and just silly.	-1
Problem is, like any mature market fragmented by captains of industry and their desire for profit, even Staedtler has been bought and sold. I believe Papermate or Rubbermaid owns them now. You can feel the palpable dedication to artists and designers fading at the while mention of those two conglomerates....  Without getting too negative, the German-made Lumographs are fantastic wood-cased pencils. The wood is fragrant cedar that sharpens in fine ribbons, and the lead is silky, smooth, grit-free, and doesn't break even at grades like 6, 7, 8b. The designer grades of F, H, H1, H4, etc. are equally impressive: they hold a fine edge and never feel gritty.  I still prefer the Staedtlers to Derwents, but nothing beats a Graf von-Faber Castell HB wood-cased pencil. I am stocking up on Tombows, too, because I don't think the Derwents are up to the quality they were 10 years ago, despite "being made of the finest Rexel Cumberland graphite on the planet."  Other fine pencils include the American Dixon and the Triconderoga, as well as the entire Czech-made line of Koh-I-Noor drafting wood-cased pencils.	1
Great quality pencils, with its own set of pros and cons. Use this if you want to make clear consistent lines that you are confident of.  Since it is mixed with carbon instead of being pure graphite it not have that shine that appears with regular graphite pencils when you shine light directly on it. But also because of the carbon this makes the pencil slightly harder to erase with than regular graphite pencils. Using eraser on the darker pencils can actually smudge instead of completely erasing so be careful.  I recommend using lighter quality pencils like 2H or 4H for initial sketching before using 2B, 4B, 6B, or 8B for drawing and rendering the picture. Useful addition for any artist.	1
Greats Pencils!..	1
This is one of my favorites pencils sets! they blend nicely and most amazing thing is.. the price <3 i highly recommend it.	1
Great product. Thanks!!!	1
Really good quality pencils. Good price. Shipping is a little slow but this product is very nice!	1
I've been using Derwent for years but their consistency changed and I was having many issues. I tride several brands from random art stores before getting this set. I could not be happier. Well worth the money. You get exactly what is expected from the labeled hardness. The graphite itself has been very smooth and consistent and no scratching. They have worked well from high detailed graphite drawings to just sketching.	1
This set offered a nice range of pencils, and the metal tin they come in is great for keeping them organized. Absolutely recommend.	1
If you're an artist, you may never use the harder pencils (3H, 4H), and you might want even softer ones than the 6B, but these are excellent pencils anyway. The degree of hardness is clearly printed on all six sides, making them easy to locate when they're spread all around the desk ... ahem ... and you gotta love the tin they're in.	1
The best pencils I've ever used	1
I decided to venture into decent drawing pencils. I picked these because of another review on some other pencils.  They are great. The different types make a bit difference from sketching to shading. Its well worth it.  The metal case they come in its nice enough but not padded. The tips, if tossed in a bag could easily break. I got a wrapping pencil holder and keep them in there.	1
Good product.	1
nice	1
I really like these. Long lasting, great for detail and shading, no breaks so far. I've used several other brands, and I decided to try these based on some reviews I read. I recommend pairing them up with a good long point sharpener such as the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Kum-AS2-Two-Hole-Automatic-Long-Point-Pencil-Sharpener-Mfg-Part-Number-1053021-extra-lids-not-included/dp/B003G560JQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Kum AS2, Two Hole Automatic Long Point Pencil Sharpener, Mfg Part Number 1053021 ( extra lids not included )</a>.	1
I needed a full set of pencils for an art class. These pencils have been a staple in my art box for several years. I recommend these for any graphite artist!	1
I love this album	1
Easy to add pages and is wide enough to continue for a few years worth of scrapbook pages. Sturd for heavy paper projects.	1
Very nice album, i always use the post-bound and wanted to see how the 3 ring albums were and i really like em,	1
Good quality needles, the wait time to receive them is worth it.	1
Fast delivery!!!! I will order again.	1
The needle is fine. I used it in my antique sewing machine, a Davis New Vertical Feed. I usually use a size 12 needle and found the due to the nature of how Vertical Feed machines work - by moving the fabric along with the needle rather than with feed dogs - that these thinner size 11 needles bend and I couldn't use them. I want to make it clear that there's nothing wrong with these needles, they just don't work in my machine.	1
Very good needles	1
t's fit my singer sewing machine.	1
These are high quality sewing machine needles in a 10 pack. You get 10 for a really decent price, and they are long lasting. They don't tend to bend or break nearly so often as other brands.	1
I bought these for my new brother sewing machine and will be using them to try out all the stitches on my new machine.	1
I use them in my Bailey quilting machine.	1
Not a lot one can say about needles. They do the job and, so far, have not broken. I do wish there was a distinctive mark on the needle to differentiate these from the ball kind, so I've taken to using a bit of nail polish on the top shaft for that purpose. Using the right needle is as important as using good material and good thread. Using the right needle can also reduce strain on your machine.	1
Perfect just what I was needing.  I ran out needles and honestly didn't know I needed a heavier needle until I went to this  products page.  Fixed everything.  No more broken needles.	1
Great sewing needles. Great value	1
Good product. Very happy with these needles.	1
Very Good.	1
Sewing machine needles work.  These seem to have nice sharp points, necessary as I sew a lot.	1
perfect my machine	1
These are Organ brand needles are of the highest quality and are excellent for heavier weight woven fabrics. I highly recommend them.	1
I was having trouble with my very expensive machine skipping stitches, and tried the Organ brand.  Love them, my machine finally acts like it should.  I'll never buy the ones that are sold by the 5 pack in the fabric stores ever again.	1
Perfect for both my new sewing machine and my 51 year old one I was given at age 12. Love that I found these at a more reasonable price. It is the price that brings me back to buy more. We do a lot of outdoor and heavy fabric sewing so need the larger sizes. Well return for more in the future as I do go through the needles.	1
I bought this machine a few years ago from Wal-Mart because I was learning to sew.  I quickly became too frustrated because of the jamming of the thread and gave up.  Fortunately, I decided to try and try again but the reverse lever popped off and I never found it. I  bought another machine that was $199 - the difference was night and day!  That machine is in for repairs; so I've borrowed my in laws' Singer Simple to finish a project.  It started sewing great, but the bobbin thread keeps breaking because where it comes out of the bobbin is so sharp it shreds the thread (Gutermann).  It's also jammed more times than I can count, and now it's somehow stuck on reverse.  It's NOT worth the trouble.  If you're on a budget, get a machine at a garage sale.  I'd rather have a machine from the 50s that's quality and take it to be tuned-up than this plastic piece of junk.  It's like driving a car to work that breaks down every other day.	-1
i have owned 2 of these machines over the years (gave one to a friend) and it has endured a serious life of abuse. i've sewn plastic, denim, paper, vinyl, and TONS of fabric. it died after 4 years and then was revived by a repairman who i think just oiled it up for me. keep your machine oiled! it is a great, easy to use machine and i would recommend this machine VERY highly to anyone who wants a simple, cheap, durable, contained machine that will do everything you need it to.	1
I have been sewing for over 50 years.  Have had singers before but this model is horrible.  It does not perform as other singers.  Thread bunches up, breaks uneven stitches.  Very light model - whenever I am doing a lot of sewing I end up having to take it to repair shop because it just quits, locks, bunches threads etc.  Threader works when it feels like.  Go figure.  Do not waste your time buying this.  It is the most stressful experience for me at least.	-1
My niece sent this to me to attempt to correct the problem.  The stitch selector is jammed and doesn't budge. From searching for solutions after removing what plastic covering I could manage, I discovered plastic gears which are probably fused. This jamming is apparently a common problem.  Over the past 35 years I have collected older machines, and I will likely give her one that has metal gears....one you would be hard pressed to break, even if you tried. Don't bother with the new lightweight plastic covered, plastic geared machines. Go to second hand stores and yard/garage sales and get a real sewing machine that is heavy with metal throughout....without the computer bells and whistles and selective stitches over 8 or 10. If you can find one with cams, even better. It's the presser feet that are the actual tools you need to invest in with the basic straight and zig zag stitch machine.  Kenmore 1341 8 stitch is a work horse. See also online auctions or sales.	-1
This is a good quality mannequin, easy to assemble and move around only draw back I can find is I cannot use straight pins in it . However I just use clips instead.	1
Great item for the price. Worked for modeling clothing for sale. Sturdy and shipped well packed.	1
Simply the best!	1
The form is as described, except mine came with 2 dark stains on the white form. The item has a strong chemical smell that I hope will dissipate after airing out. I wish there was a way to contact the seller since the item came stained but there isn't. I will use this for personal use but would not use in a store because of the stains.	1
Nice form for the price. Easy to assemble. Super fast shipping.	1
Love it. Perfect for taking photos of my knitted items.	1
Easy set up just what I needed. I will add photos soon. Works wonderfully and is light and easy to move . The hole for the pole to connect the body to the stand was a little small but with some twisting and pushing it went in. That was the hardest part of outing it together. KidsNKrochet.com	1
used a lot	1
Charming dress form! Easy to assemble.	1
Great dress form. Good quality. Looks great. Easy assembly. Great seller. Great communication. Overall excellent. Highly recommended	1
Great item! I am so glad I ordered this dress form. Great value! Love the adjustable height and ease of moving from one area to another. Helps the items I sell look more professional. Easy assembly! Thanks for a great product and a great price!	1
I gave this to my wife for Christmas and she almost hit the floor, she loved it so much!  It arrived quickly and was super easy to put the stand together!	1
just as pictured - great for working on a sewing project	1
nice and comfortable to work with.	1
This is perfect for my needs.  I wish I looked as good as this shapely item, but I'll primarily be using it as a display or photo mannequin. If I use it for sewing, I'll put a duct tape double over it, since the only adjustment is the height. It has a sturdy wood base, and it looks like the jersey covering is removable for cleaning.  It went together in minutes.  What I didn't remember in the description is that the base of the torso has 2 positions for the pole placement - one in the center and one off to the side in case you want to fit pants.  It would be kind of a pain for sewing, since you have to pull the torso on & off the pole to put the pants on it, but at least it's an option.  I'm very happy with it!	1
Very nice product, fast and careful shipping, excellent price - thanks!	1
I purchased this for my granddaughter's 13th  birthday. She's interested in fashion design. As soon as she slipped it out of the box, she was pleased and immediately put it togetherwith no trouble.  It's sturdy, and it looks great. She was thrilled.  It's a good quality for the price. I would order from this vender again with no reservations.	1
I just received my dress form and was so excited to put it together.  Shipping was quick, received all parts, in good condition, the cloth covered part was wrapped in plastic and was clean.  Assembly was quick and easy.  I will be using this to display handmade clothing items for sale online and it's going to work very well.  I may order more sizes!	1
This is such a fabulous piece.  It's chic with the gold ribbon around waste. I love the wood on it.	1
I ordered this mannequin to display items for online selling.  It looks great and is as expected.  Since it is lightweight, it is easy to move and dress.  Assembling was a breeze and it is working beautifully.  To see it in action pop over to my etsy shop. "StyleNarkVintage"	1
I got my body form when I was told it would arrive, and it was easy to set up and exactly what I need! Just like the picture. Beautiful form, adjustable height, and easy for designing/pinning on! RECOMMENDED.  -Abby from NYC	1
I love this dress form, has made making my own clothes so much easier. I ordered padding for dress forms to make it my size (I am quite a bit larger than the dress form) and it works perfectly. Thanks so much.	1
This is a very basic form.  I ordered by measurements, NOT by dress size, and the measurements are true.  It's very sturdy and looks nice (I have a scarf draped over the shoulders when not in use).  Naturally, since it is not adjustable, you can only design using it's measurements, but it's good for determining draping and hemming.  I highly recommend it if you're looking for a well-made basic form.	1
It was promptly delivered and I had no issues with it! it was easy to assemble and it is great to display my finished sewing projects! it is exactly what I was looking for.	1
I received my dress form in the mail and I am very happy with it. It was easy to put together, it took a few seconds. I wanted to give it an antique look so I used coffee to do just that. It looks fabulous. It will be used to display clothing and jewelry at craft shows. the perfect piece... Thanks	1
Well, there it was on the Amazon wish list -- this dress form is something I wouldn't have thought I would be asked for Christmas.  I will never regret buying it.  My daughter was so absolutely thrilled when she opened it.  I did my window shopping and nobody even came near the price and the quality was excellent as well.	1
is easy to assemble and not heavy. A good choice for use in the home is easy to move anywhere and takes up little space	1
Ordered two mannequins to use for display purposes at a party.  I checked high and low for a good price and found this one.  It was delivered very quickly and I was impressed with the quality of the mannequin for $74.00  The high gloss wood finish is beautiful.  I didn't expect that.  It went together like a breeze with the exception of one wooden top (for the neck).  I contacted customer service at mannequinhub and got a response within minutes.  It was so fast I thought it was an automatic reply saying they had received my email.  Minutes later I was able to put the wooden top on the second mannequin and they both look terrific.  Please note:  These mannequins are for display not for sewing.  They do a great job at a great price.  I have passed on their link to my party planner to use in the future if she needs inexpensive, good quality display mannequins.	1
These are so welcome back in my home!!! My children had peeler beads 30 yrs ago. Now my 5 grandchildren are inventing figures now which they have to use their brains&hands so that is good. Yes,they are easy to spill,but easy to sweep up! Hours of fun every day! Thank you for bringing them back better than ever!	1
Didn't come with common animal patterns.	-1
I can tell this is a great set. You do have to mix some of your own paint colors. My set is expired by about 4 months. Some if the paint is a little thickm but I am working on it bow and it is doing okay.	-1
Some leaked...	-1
I had not beaded more than 10 pearls when the mechanism that is held inside the plastic handle came out and oil started dripping out! Not only I had a brand new useless tool, but a few of my pearls were stained. There is no way of making it work properly now. I am returning it and looking for another brand. Suggestions are welcome!	-1
Still haven't figured  out what/how to use it  haha	-1
Its Crap	-1
Never have figured out how to use it	-1
Poor quality!! I expected more about the product!	-1
I purchased this as a "new" product but the packaging was open when I received it.	-1
hammer part is fine, but had to sand the handle just to use.  Part of the handle was not even lacquered and the part that was has large bits of something green stuck into it as well as smaller black bits of something that is very hard and jagged making it very unpleasant to even hold the hammer on ones hand.	-1
I had a friend who raved about the enveloper, so, of course, I had to have one too.  I find it difficult to use, the tool cuts the paper, and the directions leave a LOT to be desired.  I'll revert to my old envelope creator with the plastic templates, thank you.	-1
Had to return this item because the workmanship was poor. The metal edges were unfinished which would cause uneven lines, and the screw knob was not fitting properly.	-1
I used this pen once and the tip separated from the handle. The handle is very light-weight plastic and the pen is not very sensitive to line width adjustment. It is just not worth the money. I did get it right on time and it came in good condition and, of course, Amazon made it very easy to return but I think the seller should consider discontinuing this item. It is poorly made.	-1
The lines on this mat are thick and blurry, most of the numbers are illegible. It is impossible to get precision cuts for quilting with this mat. The picture shows the poor printing quality of this Matt compared to a Olfa mat. I tried to save $ but for quilting this mat is a bust.	-1
The product was bent and had to be heated to straighten  all because the package box was too small..absolutely unacceptable.	-1
Unless you have the grip strength of Superman...or at least Wonder Woman, you probably won't have much luck with this.  I conditioned my clay, loaded it into the extruder and squeezed. And squeezed.  And squeezed.  Well, I TRIED to squeeze, but almost nothing would extrude.  I even tried putting it on the floor and stepping on the little side arms without much success.  Polymer clay, no matter how well conditioned, is just too stiff for a mere mortal to force through this device.  Sculpey makes many wonderful products but unfortunately, this is just not one of them.  There are other extruders out there that are much easier to use.	-1
Disappointed in product's self-healing qualities although Gingher/Fiskars customer service is great! They've replaced the mat a couple of times because it's covered under the warranty. However, had I known about this subpar quality ahead of time, I wouldn't have purchased the item to start with.	-1
I bought this through Michaels so the verified thing will not show up. This is very disappointing yarn. in one skein there were 9 knots tying it together. NINE. I understand that in the yarn making process that is sometimes required. But really nine? Also, 4 of those 9 knots came undone when I was trying to work with this yarn. The colors a beautiful (I got 3 of the red ones) but it may not be worth the hassle. The other two skeins had only 2 knots each.	-1
I'm gonna be straight up here. I'm a guy and when I first decided to give crochet a shot, I knew nothing about yarn. All I wanted was yarn that had same day delivery and so I picked this stuff. I worked with it for a while and then experimented with many other yarns. I'm much more experienced with crocheting and yarn now and I gotta say this is the worst yarn I've ever used. It's difficult to work with, comes undone easily, the color is ugly, the stitches are ugly, I don't like anything about it.	-1
Small small small!!!	-1
to small	-1
Please take heed.  I'm happy that a number of people loved this so much they gave it 5 stars. I don't think it's really fair to give it 1 star because it fits together well and is easy to sew on, as several people point out.  But so many people indicate that it's too small and I wish I'd listened.  It's bad advertising to label this for cloaks or capes because it's just not sturdy enough.  Even if you sewed on 5 close together, upon not much movement, I can see them all unclasping. You see: the hook part doesn't grab on very firmly.  Like you, maybe, I was attracted to the picture which makes it look huge...2" sounded about right.  But it's not. And I hate it when shipping costs about as much as the item.  Look around for better choices.	-1
Needles very short, from the picture I thought I was getting regular sized needles but these are so small that I shall be unable to use them, maybe for someone who wants to make miniature items but not for me.	-1
I've never actually used this. I ended up using a belt to keep the sweater closed in the front so I would stay warm.	-1
Disappointing purchase . This was thin and not what I expected. Can't bother to return it though.	-1
If you are truly interested in calligraphy, do not get these.  I cannot do calligraphy, and got them just to make the writing look a little nicer. These did not do that trick either.  They don't write on glossy paper, the ink just beads up. So I couldn't use them at all for the project that I purchased them for.	-1
I was expecting "Sharpie" but this is water based and smears if you use any paper other than bond.  Bond will smear if you don't let it dry as well.  Even on bond, it absorbs so there isn't a definitive "line" that is necessary for calligraphy.	-1
They did stick	-1
did not realize how small they are..should have read description .will use them in the future I suppose	-1
Too small and they do not stick very well.  ended up going out and buying the strips at a local store.  Waste of money.	-1
Velcro is NOT durable. I used it for my wallet and after a week, the velcro doesn't even stick to each other. Not worth your money.	-1
Not for me. They break too easily just like regular crayons do. Don't know any more about them. They're sitting in the box.	-1
Having made a crayon quilt years ago, I decided to try these for the quilt my adult class is making.  I was quite disappointed-these did not print on fabric, even though I thought I covered the original well.  I returned them.	-1
I had no idea that the entire stencil was 3 1/3 by 2 1/4 inch I thought that was the size of the letters.	-1
These letters are super small... maybe 1/4 in..Wasn't what I expected.	-1
The amount of water that sprays out of the valve on these tubes is way too much.  They need to redesign this so that it comes out as a much finer mist, especially if you are using this to spritz a water solution mixed with their perfect pearls powder to give your project a shimmery effect. The "only" purpose for which I feel these misters are useful for is when I squish their distress ink onto a craft sheet and then add water with this spritzer so I can use the Ranger Distress Inks to paint with using a paintbrush.  Also, the location of the nozzle is really hard to see, at least with the clear color misters which are the ones I purchased, because there isn't a different dot of color at the nozzle, so you can easily accidentally spritz water in a direction you don't want it to go (ie. on a nice piece of paper on your work surface).  If you have any empty Tattered Angels "glimmer mist" bottles, keep them!  The nozzle does provides a lighter mist, which is much more effective if you want to spritz the water/perfect pearls solution.	-1
These aren't terrible, but they're not the best either.  They don't hold much water.. so you take 2-3 mists and you need to refill.  It's a nice, clean spray, no huge droplets.  However, I wouldn't purchase again.  A cheap dollar store spray bottle would work better	-1
One of the misters didn't work at all. I would have contact the seller directly, but there was no option to. Shame.	-1
They do the trick. Then they break.	-1
This pen takes forever to 'activate'--and there are two different directions: leprechan sized on the pen itself (read w my mag light) and one on the box. The box says you are supposed to shake it well (25 seconds) upright, the pen says then depress the point upright to let the 'pressure' escape? Huh? The box says not to 'overpump' the tip to fill it with paint. The TEENY print on the pen itself says to HOLD THE PENTIP DOWN  on the paper UNTIL INK FLOWS. Then of course  the pentip is supposed  'fill'  with white paint.  Well, after carefully following box and the teeny pen print directions and 15 minutes of nothing, I just held the point down on the page forever, threatening to drown it in itself, taunting it to "flow you bastard". It finally filled with white paint. Aha! But when I lifted it off the scrap paper, the tip fell out, the white went all over, and I !@#$%^. I tried another one thinking they must be old or a defective first try or I was clueless (actually I bought 2). This one blobbed all over so I used a teeny brush to pinpoint eyes on tiny drawings and on and on. I had another one in a box so I tried that one and had the exact same results. One use with a tip brush from the blobs is all I got from THREE pens. WORTHLESS. Try the gel marker in white by pentel or zig instead. Even clothes markers or china markers work if they are sealed well after or waterproof clothes markers with a decent tip. Or old fashioned fountain pen ink in white. BETTER than this waste of $. The reviewers who got them to work must be employed by the company. Aloha	-1
There is nothing wrong with the plate, per se, and I have a feeling it's my own ignorance that is my problem here, but all the same, I thought I'd share. There are no instructions on the package about how to use a C plate with your Cuttlebug. They mention on the back how to emboss using the A and B plates, but nothing about C. So I turned to Google and Youtube, but in my attempts at following other crafters' instructions, I cracked my B plate. At that point I just gave up and opted to return this. I will say that the refund process was super-easy - props for that. I just wish it had come with some instructions for those of us for whom these crafty endeavors are not second nature.	-1
I knew these would be small, but not this small! I was disappointed with how little use you can get out of one bottle before it was empty. The fine spray mist was great, but the bottle could easily be twice the size.	-1
I really love EK products, sadly it takes 2 month that my order arrived to my city in Honduras and I can't return this item, one part doesn't cut the paper!! How is that possible?? I mean it's supposed is a high quality brand.	-1
DCWV usually are nice products but these don't pass muster.  I am just not too fond of these.  The stickers crease easily not making for a nice finished product.  And the sentiments are limited in variety and originality.  Instead, try their rub-on's for a cleaner and more pleasing affect.	-1
Warps cardstock almost immediately with a thin coat applied with a quality paintbrush. Not adhesive upon application so that you can move the paper around to position, I get that part, but it dries warped. Maybe I got a bad batch or everyone else is using a special card stock. I have held off on writing a review until I had a chance to use it more than once. I wanted this to work, but on multiple types of card stock, results were poor.	-1
Too thin and too slow drying.  I knew the title was a con just to get one to purchase it.  The BEST paper glue is tubes of Karen-Marie Klip Glue from Denmark!  By far, the best glue for paper EVER, & I have a huge box of tried glues that did not pass the test.	-1
Product didn't work for me.  I applied it to the back of paper and pressed it onto card stock.  It's not holding.  After 24 hours the paper came right off the card stock.	-1
I bought this product before realizing that there were other silicone putty products on the market that came in larger sizes and cost much, much less per ounce.  Pros: You can make you own custom molds. The molds stay flexible allowing for easy removal. The molds can be used for a long time.  Cons: Small quantity and high cost. This product does not work well with resin as the resin looks frosty rather than shiny and clear but it works fine with polymer clay. Set up time is too short, about 1-2 minutes, so you have to work very quickly or it hardens to the point where it cannot be used.	-1
This glue seems to bear no relation to the glue other reviewers have written about. I used it to make a card and envelope out of a medium weight paper. I applied the glue sparingly and spread it out into an even coat and the paper buckled and rippled. Not happy. Would thinning it out yield better results? I will try that with some scraps. Don't think I'll buy this again though.	-1
The dots work just fine, but getting them off the paper is a nuisance, and even though you can use the backing paper as additional dots, I find that there is too much waste product per sheet and not enough dots.  I'd rather use other brands.	-1
Too difficult to pop out	-1
lovely stamp, a bit small, didn't feel it was worth the price for the size it is. x x x	-1
I expected these dies to be bigger as it said in description approximately 5-5 inches but nothing is that measurement not even the packaging. I already had Sizzix dies the same size.	-1
I liked this item but after a couple of uses, it fell apart and I had to throw it away	-1
I sprayed this on several different types of items and it doesn't show up at all. Waste of money.	-1
Hate this stock...I'm going back to the Glitz glitter stock.	-1
I read all the reviews and am confused that so many people said they love this product.  I sprayed 2 x and could still barely see the glitter sheen.  What i saw was what a card looks like after it got wet. My card was lumpy and ripply  Once the card dried i hoped the glimmer would show more but it didn't.  I don't think that I'm using it wrong, it a glimmer spray you spray the paper and thats all there is to it.  I actually was going to give the product the benefit of the doubt and ordered a darker color thinking it would show up more on my card.  It didn't show up any better and it to made my card lumpy and ripply also.  I would not recommend this and would return the product if it weren't such a hassle, plus i would have to pay return shipping on a product i didn't like	-1
doesn't cove very well, and shine is not apparent	-1
Doesn't spray smoothly, leaves droplets on the page, no matter how much I shake it before spraying.	-1
I know it says half ounce, right?? What it does not say is that the bottle is so tiny it is difficult to hold to apply or guide the glue where you want it to go.  I feel robbed.	-1
Hard to find storage for 12 x 12 designer paper - so I bought these.  Although Cropper Hopper is always a good choice, I was disappointed in that the slots/slits made to insert plastic labels just are a struggle to use.  I had to try to cut them open w/a knife in order to use them.  So, not happy for that.  But had to use them anyway.	-1
I put these stamps into my basket....so I could think about them.  Next thing I knew they were thanking me for my order.  Even though I had decided NOT to order them......here they are.  I was not pleased.	-1
2 stars: These are WAY bigger than the size that's posted in the description. I have no idea what I am going to do with these 15" by 15" hanging file folders. Such a waste of money for what I needed them for :/ Company needs to update the size description on these.	-1
These weren't what I was looking for so ended up sending them back.  They were good quality	-1
ZERO stars if you are looking for a folder for a normal filing system. I bought these to use in the Iris scrapbook file box.  These will not fit.  I think Amazon should point this out.  Now I have to pay $7 plus  to send them back.  Amazon has always been my favorite vendor by far, but they missed the boat on this one.  BTW the folders are very nice if you have a system that can use them.	-1
Would love  these if I could find a hanging file that fits them. Sadly it's proving very difficult.	-1
should have known that PHOTO mentioned in description was the big hint that this is a very small corner. It just takes off the sharp corner. Will keep for photos but I bought for crafting cards. Will not cut more than one photo/piece of light weight copy paper.	-1
These really are horrible.  They smell bad, they are messy and the paint gets everywhere!  It's hard to get the paint off your hands when they leak and every one of these that I've tried leak paint everywhere.	-1
This pen has a nice small nib but the construction is so poor that as soon as I primed it...it leaked its entire contexts onto my page. It's an awful pen. The right idea...but very poorly built. Run from it!	-1
Only works on very specific surfaces, like over slick surfaces. As for art uses, I can only use this on straight-up, cheap acrylic paint with no texture. Even then, the line is quite a bit fainter than expected from a white pen. Sinks into all other paper and is useless for me. If I need to write on smooth surfaces, Sharpie paint pens would be my primary choice.  Priming this pen is horrible! None of my other Deco color or similar paint pens leak like this one does. Just not find of it.	-1
The feeling of these blades are okay, I liked the one that my Fiskars 12 Inch Portable Scrapbooking Trimmer (196920-1001) came with because it was easier to grasp with my fingers, these blade handles are too short.  Although I do like the arrows showing where your blade is cutting down to.  Honestly I thought that the blade I got with my trimmer was great the first few months I had it, however then I started noticing that the blade was making the paper fray a little, so I thought it was time to get new ones.  I bought these blades and they are no better, I'm actually thinking that the old blade frayed even less than these new ones.	-1
I must warn you that this product broke after less than 30 uses in less than a month.  I had to fix it myself and it never worked properly, so I gave it to my little next door neighbor girl.	-1
It didn't work.  I had to return it.  It wouldn't punch anything.  I ordered a different brand and it works just fine.	-1
the tip of my pen came off and paint everywhere	-1
Worked as Needed! Will not purchase again.	-1
Color is definitely not lilac, it is more of a dull grey.  I would not have purchased it had I seen it first as it is neither pretty nor soft looking.  I would like a lilac album but this isn't it.  Will probably give it away as it doesn't fit in with the others I have given its light-sucking quality.  Disappointed.	-1
Couldn't use it.	-1
This board is completely useless.  The indentions where you are supposed to place your coiled paper strips are so shallow that they cannot prevent the coils from unraveling.	-1
These pens are horrible.	-1
Did not adhere to fabric and I resorted to regular Elmers glue...so disappointing....	-1
The flowers AND buttons are disgusting.  They look like rummage sale rejects, a throw back from St. Vincent DePaul's 5th hand store. You know, the rejects that set at the back of the shelf for 10 years before they are finally given away for free.  They are NOT the pretty pastel flowers in the picture.  I would have been happy with them if they had even come somewhat close to pretty colors. The felt looks old, the buttons are dull.  Most of the flowers and buttons are an ugly, dirty, pea green, like the carpet in Section 8 Housing.  There are a couple of polka dot flowers I'll be able to use, but the rest, not a chance.	-1
These are so small they are very difficult to use.	-1
While I know I will be able to eventually use all of the pieces in this set, I was disappointed that the colors I got are not at all like pictured. The colors I received are much darker. The blue is more of an ugly aqua green. The majority of the flowers in mine are felt, not paper like is shown. This was definitely a disappointment because I went by the pictured colors because they were the exact colors I needed for a project I am working on. Now I will have to look elsewhere.  I also feel it is important to note that quite a few of the paper flowers in the kit...the main kind I use...mcame mashed and mangled beyond use. Also, several of the buttons were stuck together and required extraordinary measures to pull apart.  Overall I would not recommend, mainly because you do not get at all what the website says you'll get. You don't even get the proper colors, even though the box they come in is labeled Lemonade Blossoms just like the title.	-1
i got these for big bottoms, i only got ONE big pink bottom and rest are random, i cannot believe they gave so few bottoms. sadddddd	-1
I usually trust Tim Holtz products but was disappointed by this. The tip was not very sharp and not at all sturdy. I sent it back and bought a Martha Stewart Craft Knife instead.	-1
I find the handle to be flimsy, but I do like the retractable system.	-1
I was expecting bigger safety colored pins.  A total waste of my money.  the size is not clearly stated on the website.	-1
don't work	-1
I bought these to stick posters to the wall at our school. I had an issue with the posters coming back down. I tried using more dots to no avail. I wouldn't purchase these again. I might opt for Command strips instead.	-1
prefer my dollar store glue stick.  Dry and hard to spread.	-1
The only thing it managed to glue were my fingers. I couldn't get the glue to work for my lace on my scrapbook. I wish I hadn't listened to those 'raving' reviews.	-1
This was my first foray into stamping. The colors were as promised but I was just a little disappointed in the size , I thought I was getting much bigger pad of card stock... Like younger find at a Michael's.	-1
I am giving this one 2 stars because of how it was worded.  I had assumed (bad on my part) that these were standard cutting pads for the Sizzix BigKick.  They are not.  These are for the original Sizzix.  I received them quickly... which is another reason why I order so much from Amazon, but these are small.  Very small.  So if you're looking for cutting pads to fit your BigKick, these are not them.	-1
it says standard cutting pad. be aware it is NOT for bigkick or bigshot!	-1
Big disappointment.  This is not as described... not the standard size needed for the Big Shot.  I failed to read the reviews, but now know better.	-1
I don't like it at all!  The product has strong plastic/chemical smell and many of alphabets came with finger prints on it.... The product seem new since it package well; I just do not understand why many of alphabets has finger prints on it.	-1
We bought this product and we liked it, although it wasn't without its faults.  You have to cut slowly, can't cut too many pieces at once, and just have to be careful.  Great if you're only doing a few little things but a problem if you're working on a larger project.  Then the "self sharpening" blade started tearing the paper.  What's the use of a paper cutter that's tearing paper?  We tried to find out how to replace the blade and/or the piece that sharpens it (which we now see has been bent but we can's say how this happened).  There is no way to contact this company and I see many--too many--questions regarding replacement pieces from customers on their facebook page.  Other people have left reviews here on amazon saying that there is poor customer service.  Poor customer service wouldn't matter with a high quality product.  But when you create something that's cumbersome to use and does not live up to what the packaging says it is then customer service matters.  We will never buy another product from this company.	-1
I purchased this paper trimmer because of the magnetic ruler. However the magnet was removed from the ruler. I would appreciate a magnetic ruler replacement. If this would happen, the review would be great!	-1
This cutter was a complete disappointment.  It cut crooked and the rotary blade squeaked something awful!  My husband suggested lubricating it (the blade assembly) with W40 or the like...an idea I rejected because I'd be cutting craft paper and wouldn't want anything to get on it.  I used it once and returned it quickly!	-1
This paper trimmer leaves a ragged edge on all the paper I try to cut. I bought this "used like new" but did expect a better cut since it was so highly rated. I contacted the manufacturer and purchased a new cutting assembly for $14.99 but this only improved the cut marginally. I would not recommend this paper trimmer, I feel like I wasted my money.	-1
Beware! These plates are not the replacement plates for the Big Shot. Only for the RED SideKick. Not for the white or Tim Holtz SideKicks. Amazon sells the aqua colored plates that are thick enough for this machine to cut the ever popular thinlits or any wafer thin die.	-1
REAL MINI CUTTING PADS It wasn't what I wanted, the item is listed as standard and it should say mini, this isn't standard and I can't use it on my Sizzix vagabond. If only it said mini I wouldn't have made a mistake. I am not the only one that this has happened too.  Please correct that so others won't  order wrong item.  Thanks	-1
Watch out Buyers !!!!!! To say these are standard cutting plates is very deceiving. They are small plates for very small dies. The size should be in place of the word standard.	-1
Item was not what I thought it would be, advert says STANDARD cutting pads, but these were miniature	-1
When I received these plates I laughed for a long time. I could not believe my eyes that such a thing happens. This child plates))))	-1
I was mislead, thinking these cutting pads were for mysizzix. They are so tiny, I can't use them.... Buyer, beware of the size and do not make the same mistake that I made	-1
Not at all what I was expecting.  These were little bitty cutting boards 2x2 or so, I was expected the normal sized boards but these were nothing like that.  I just threw them in the trash.	-1
I love we r memory but this is a doozy. These new tips do not work well at all. Hard to control and will not evenly heat through. I use my fuse daily and never had issues with the regular tips.	-1
Can't say they're useless but definitely for beginners. The pliers and cutters are mainly for wires. You can't create or fix anywhere near sophisticated jewelry. All this kit is good for is bending and cutting thin wires.	-1
It was a return for me. Didn't like the quality of the set.	-1
When it arrived, the box was dented up. Then I opened the actual case and the pieces were all Willy nilly in the case and I think things were missing as there were like 3 extra slots where it looked like tools were supposed to go. Maybe it was a returned one repackaged? Then I actually tried using them... I have arthritis in my hands, and the only wire this would bend and cut was extremely thin wire I could bend myself with my arthritic self. Thicker crafting wire, where one would actually need working tools bent them side to side and would slide off and make a loud snapping noise. Don't even get me started on the sniping/cutting tools. I just had to laugh at the situation. I don't have the time or patience to send them back. Don't waste your money unless you plan on using strictly thin wire. Also the before nose are too thick to get any detail. Please save your money, unless I just got a completely jacked up set, I would never even think of buying again or recommending to anyone. It's just cheap junk.	-1
I only had this kit for a month or so before the wire cutters went completely dull. We did not even cut much wire so that's not saying much. I would definitely pass on this and never buy it again because I do not like buying things that I have to replace once a month.	-1
It's okay, but if you're a serious jewelry maker, get a better set.	-1
The quality of the tools are of inferior quality. I should have returned it when I received it. The wire cutters would not work.. Perhaps a good kit for an older child.	-1
The pouch is really the only good thing about this buy in the long run.  The blue handled tools were extremely greasy from manufacturing.  The other tools are useful, but I didn't need the clear containers and after feeling them, I don't have a lot of faith in them standing up to use.	-1
It does the job and the case is nice. However, the handles of the tools are disgusting. They smell and are slimy, I have to wash my hands after using them.	-1
got it less than a month befor it started to rust	-1
This set is truly cheap. First of all it smells low quality rubber. The handles are sticky. When you use them, your hands get a black oily residue. The flush cutters are not well aligned and they get damaged after 2-3 uses. The pliers are damaging the wire... not sure why such a bad set has such a high rating, which is why I am leaving a review.	-1
I bought this for handcrafting purpose. I want to immediately toss this kit away after the first use. I only used the scissors for making bow hair band. All I need to cut are some ribbons. The scissors did OK with regular ribbons but when it comes to ribbons that have very, very thin wires in them, these scissors just cannot do the job anymore. They get jammed a lot and I needed to use great force to cut the wires. People who always deal with ribbons know, those wires are thin like hair, and the fact that these scissors can't even cut through that makes me really regret buying it. I would give 1 star but I should have know better because the price is really low.	-1
I bought this to start with as I didn't know if I'd like beading. Well, that's all this is good for. The wire cutters had to be replaced right away as they hardly ever cut. When they do it's a very rough cut. The other tools are fair. Buy this if u r just starting out and u need to learn. U will know soon enough what's good and what isn't.  I paid $10.99 for new wire cutters which was more than this kit. Who knows maybe u will have better luck than I did. To anyone reading this have a very Happy and Healthy New Year!!!	-1
These tools are very low quality, they have rough edges which damaged the wire. I would not recommend them at all.	-1
I ordered the brown, was sent the black. This case supposedly holds 120 pencils? No way. Instead of using this for my colored pencils as planned, I'm using it for my graphite pencils and micron pens, so I'm using it, but there is NO way I'd recommend this, especially when compared to the Tran Deluxe Pencil case I'd also purchased. While I admit it's well made, the design doesn't allow you to see all the different colors at once and I really can't see it holding 120 pencils.	-1
It holds 80 pencils, and questionable if it is leather.	-1
I bought it to organize my colored pencils while using them, I cant use it for that as it is a little short for new pencils. The new pencils fit in the case, but it looks like it would be easy to damage the soft points of Prismacolor premier pencils. The case looks cheaply made to me, and I think I wasted my money.	-1
My main complaint is that the sticks holding the beads fall very easily out of the slots. This would be a very useable product if there was some type of way the stringing pins locked into the rack so that they could not move around. Otherwise, this is useless.	-1
I asked for 2 items, only arrived one, in a way, it was good. Aleene's glue does not seems a metal glue, it takes long to dry, it is not as resistant as a normal "All fast Glue in 30 segs ", and I must say that is a bit messy, I do not plane to order it again. I attache a photo after a day and a half, the glue is not dry yet.	-1
Didn't stick metal to metal. Just made a gloppy mess that I had to later pick off so the pieces could be repaired properly. Maybe this is designed for costume jewelry repairs that aren't visible, but I don't see a difference between this and Krazy Glue.	-1
I hate crazy glue and this is no different than crazy glue. The only difference is the price! Crazy glue is a fraction of the cost of this jewelry glue. The smell is unbearable- gives me headaches and the glue dries milky white.	-1
It didn't work for me. It peeled right off the metal and didn't stick. It dries cloudy too.	-1
I had bought this glue to fix a metal headband I ordered online that arrived broken. Unfortunately, this glue was not strong enough to fuse the two metal parts together for some unknown reason. Despite the description of "metal glue" in its title and all of the positive reviews advocating how strong this glue is, it didn't work for me at all. I'm sure it can glue other materials together but it did not work for the purpose I had purchased it for. Oh well!	-1
This is advertised to use as a jewelry glue, but it leaves a cloudy film on ALL of the rhinestones I attempted to use it on before throwing it away. A waste of money. I wanted to give it a try because the e6000 glue I was using oozes out of the tube, and I waste half of it when I use it every time in between uses. But, I suppose wasting half the tube is better than using something that destroys my work. I'll go for the more expensive, but better E6000 glue from now on. Also, when you get this glue on your hands, it is like super glue. The E6000 glues can simply be rubbed between your fingers and comes off because it has a "cure" time where it will be tacky before finally settling and holding firmly. This is NOT a finger or stone-friendly glue, unlike it's competition- E6000.	-1
leaves a chalky white residue	-1
Not a book, just a thin box with only one compartment, so it wouldn't hold all my items. It was well made and keeps metal in place, but I would need multiple boxes.	-1
Nothing to write home about.  Gave to my grandson and I don't think he was all that thrilled with it.	-1
Sorry, I would not buy this item again.  First, the rubber is pushed all the way over the glass stopper preventing any suction.  I pulled the rubber top "up" thinking this is just what they do in production.  The suction is horrible.  I tried 3 droppers  out of the package moving the top rubber piece to multiple positions on the glass dropper.  I finally discarded them.  Very disappointed.	-1
Have you ever been frustrated trying to get thread through a tiny needle? That's what this tool is like. Unless you have a magnifying glass, you are constantly trying to guess where the tiny slot is. Forget using this on thick paper or several glued strips. The depth of the slot is also very shallow so having paper any wider than 0.25" will not fit.	-1
Extremely watery. Ripples paper.	-1
The hook itself is so sharp it kept catching my yarn. The handle is in a place that caused a blister on my thumb. The manufacturer wouldn't accept a return probably because it was priced low but because Amazon has such great customer service, they provided the refund! I probably will stay away from this manufacturer and stick with Boye and Etimo for my beloved crochet projects.	-1
This is different from other Susan Bates hooks I have.  There are sharp pieces that are catching the yarn.  It looks like finishing was not completed.  I also note the throat of the hook is not as deep making it feel awkward for me to use, i.e. thicker yarn does not glide as smoothly.  I have arthritis in my hands and wanted to see if this would help but made it harder for me.	-1
Opened bottle only to find it had dried completely up.	-1
I Couldn't stand how tacky the surface felt after the product dried. I used this on an air dry lay sculpture  that I wanted to hang on a hook in our garden. After allowing the product to drive for several days it was still extremely tacky although waterproof. While I was placing my sculpture outside I accidentally scratched it on the hook I was going to hang it from and the finish scratched ripping it right off.	-1
Mod Podge is a stable in my crafting supplies, I use it for about anything. I purchased this product to seal two flasks for fraternity mixers. However, two days after sealing these products one of the flasks was removed from the pocket of jeans and it was ruined. I know that this product works on paper crafts and indoor wood projects, but I would not give this a positive review for outdoor use like the description/title indicates.	-1
Bought this with high hopes but two of my outdoor projects, covered in multiple coats of ModPodge Outdoor were ruined after just a bit of rain.  Very disappointed and won't buy this product again nor recommend it to others.	-1
Stays tacky and doesn't seem to protect things it's used on in outdoor weather	-1
This formulation is like the fabric mod podge and it just never really dries. It stays tacky. It has a bit of a tint similar to the antique mod podge.	-1
This was  dissapointing, bought it to fill some tubes for a project. Melted the gelly wax in the pot as per instructions, could never get it to the liquid consistency so that it would pour. It took forever to get everything clean. When it boiled some splashed on the skin and cause a lot of pain- more than boiling water- and it was difficult to get it off the skin.	-1
I got these pins only because they were small and could be ironed over.  However, they are so small they bend too easily to use on multiple layers of fabric.	-1
I've decoupaged in the past and purchased this to cover an ugly box with fabric.  I followed the directions according to the package.  However, I was disappointed to find after 2 days of "drying" time it left my project sticky.  I have not ever had this issue before with the original formula of Mod Podge.	-1
despite living in a dry climate, the two coats of this applied over fabric (applied a day apart to ensure drying between coats) remained slightly tacky. had to go over it in a third sealer coat with liquitex gloss varnish to finally fix the issue. will not be buying this again unless I want to use it as a glue that will be between layers of something.	-1
This did not work well with the fabric I was using. I would never buy this again.	-1
A bit on the flimsy side.  They bend too easily to be anything more than purely decorative.  These are not meant to be real hat pins, but I still expected them to go through layers of fabric without a battle.	-1
My daughter, who was in character at a living history ranch, needed a hat pin and chose these.  We ordered them and the order was canceled by the vendor so I am not sure why Amazon is asking me to rate them.  They LOOK good on the screen and the price was right but the order couldn't be fulfilled.  She found one somewhere else.	-1
Theses blocks are thick enough for stamping, but they are small.	-1
You get what you pay for. These look a little on the cheap side and are not made in USA.	-1
Doesn't work hard catching beads	-1
I CAN'T FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE IT WORK ANY BETTER THAN A STRAIGHT THIN HARD NEEDLE.	-1
This is the absolute worst.  Sticky water with a slight yellowish color (if you look at a puddle of it).  This won't work for anyone, no matter what color your hair is.  No wonder there's not even a brand name on it.  We bought 2 cans, and it was like throwing money in the trash.  Luckily, we found a year-old half-used bottle of the Snazaroo brand yellow hairspray - a year old and half-used, and it worked.  My son's dark hair coated banana-yellow for his Ed Elric costume.  Next year, we'll plan ahead better.	-1
I bought one of these from another store only because it was the last one left in this size and I needed it right away. As I suspected, the handle is a huge pain. A quite literal pain. I completed my project with it, but I am exceedingly sore because of working with this hook.	-1
The needles are way too cheap and break easily.	-1
Did not fuse well for me, was coming off before stitching was completed. Very difficult to work with.	-1
I used these to try to do a project where I painted on some glass mason jars...Whenever I would remove the stencil, it took the paint right with it...So all in all they didn't work well	-1
needles are too small.and need a magnifier to thread. other wise its looks o.k.	-1
don't like  not very strong material ,or perhaps I was expecting something else. Thought they could be used for hat boxes.	-1
I wanted the box to paint and as I did they started to bubble everywhere underneath.	-1
These can be a little clunky, not in width, wish we could find really wide width cable needles, but they are clunky because they flip flop and make it a little harder to not flip your cable stitches.  These are not a preferred cable needle, but will keep them as a backup to my rounded hook shape ones.	-1
The image shows nine pairs of clasps, the description says you will receive nine clasps, and the package you'll get will have five clasps in it. Only order this product if you want five clasps for the price. I wish I had not..I thought I was getting a good deal. :-(	-1
Not long enough for me. But I will use them  for something. if you are already a good knitter they would love them	-1
These were too slippery for me and dis not have enough of a curve to keep the stitches secure.  I bought some plastic  ones that worked better.	-1
Wasn't what was expected	-1
I have used the larger sized buttons from this brand and I loved them.  That being said, I HATED THESE.  The backs were impossible to pop into place and once you thought you finally had them together, they would fall apart minutes later.  It was the biggest hassle of everything I had put in to party planning.  Spend the extra dollar and get the bigger size.	-1
much thinner than advertised and unravels easily	-1
Cheap ribbon	-1
Don't get too excited about how much easier things will be by using 606 spray!  At least for my business, it fell short compared to using regular fusible webbing (I wanted to get away from extra cutting since I'm not cutting out squares).  But after trying this twice, following the directions carefully, my item fell away as if it was never fused at all.	-1
So upset! This ribbon is NOT the same size. Really want my money back for this. The ribbon I received was very very smaller then this picture!	-1
I guess you get what you pay for.. this was definitely a cheapo item, and would have been better paying more for something better.	-1
I'm relatively new to quilting and bought this as my first rotary cutter. I will say it worked well at first and since I hadn't own a rotary cutter before, I thought highly of it. After less than a week of quilting and cutting fabric, boy did the blade dull quickly! It was so difficult cutting, I had to use my hands and knees to push down with my weight just to cut and even after cutting, I had to continuously go back to use my small scissors to cut the pieces that did not cut through. I only cut 1-2 layers and even with one layer, it did not cut through all the way. Quite annoying so after a week, I was determined to buy a new rotary cutter. I did my research and bought the Olfa Quick Change 45mm rotary cutter. Talk about a world difference my new Olfa rotary cutter made! Now I know the difference between a good and bad rotary cutter. The Olfa one literally glides across fabric(s) effortlessly compared to this one--even when it was at its best. Had I known how crappy and quickly this one would dull, I would not have bought it. I would not recommend this product if you're going to use it repeatedly.	-1
You have to use very thin paper or the front will not clasp on. Contact paper is too thick. And DO NOT buy the 2.5 paper punch they advertise with it. The front of the button may be 2.5 inches but 2.5 inches of paper does not nicely fit inside it. I had to trim every single one.	-1
These needles are acrylic so "stick" to the yarn. My hands ended up aching after only 30 minutes of use. Luckily the knitting goes relatively fast since using super chunky yarn for an afghan. If it weren't too late to return these, I would since I don't ever want to use them again, because they stickiness and hand cramping.	-1
Broken.	-1
These are NOT 14" long as stated. Plus the point is way longer than my other 50 needles, which makes them even shorter.  I'm returning	-1
The buttons are 2 1/4 not 2 1/2. Bought a 2 1/2 inch punch and printed 24 circles to fit the punch never thinking the buttons would be too small. also,very cheaply made...would have still used if the picture would have fit. What a waste of time and money	-1
I was working on a project (making a lampshade) that required a good clear fast drying glue that would work on fabric.  I bought this item hoping to fill that need.  Well, it does seem to dry clear, but it's a crummy glue for my purposes, and, I imagine, for anyone's purposes.  Apparently, my idea of "fast drying", and theirs is totally different.  I was expecting it to tack within 30 seconds or so, a bit like super glue.  It took more like 30 minutes to stick, but even then, it didn't hold very firmly.  To make matters worse, after waiting several hours, the two pieces of cloth just sort of fell apart.  This is some weak and worthless glue.  I really don't know who'd find this useful.  I mean, I guess it'd work on paper or something, but it's supposed to be fabric glue!  If you just wanted to glue some paper, there are cheaper options out there for glue...  Well, my overall opinion on this glue is that it's crap and you should just keep looking if you need a good strong fabric glue that actually works.  I'm personally going to try out some Beacon's Fabri-Tac and see how that goes...	-1
What ??? I got this to work with some nylon (the backing on an outfit) fabric ... glad I had a hot glue gun on hand cuz this was complete garbage and did nothing at all. And thanks to these people selling garbage that is useless I didn't have time to wait for another adhesive or something to use to sew the outfit and I wasted $50 on what I was doing and it's probably ruined thanks to the purchase of this worthless garbage. Thanks! Jerks.	-1
First off, do not buy the punch they advertise to buy with it, as it punches circles that do not fit into the button.  I needed 90 of these, so I used the punch suggested, then ended up having to cut the circles smaller and it was a disaster!  Second, the buttons are cheap, and don't stay connected.  Definitely not a good product if you plan to actually use them!  I am very disappointed.	-1
Meh.  Pretty thin and sharp edged. Like a low-budget or knock-off of the original acrylic blocks of many years ago.  :(  PRO: clear plastic, white grid is easy to see.  CONS: These are EXTREMELY uncomfortable to use due to the thinness of the blocks and the sharpness of the edges and corners. CONS: A waste of money (for me) because I won't use them again. I could grind down the edges, but I can't make these any thicker.	-1
I had hope for this glue. I used it to glue some ribbon to a t-shirt. At first it worked, everything held together. It did dry a little more opaque than I would have liked, but it held. Until I washed it three or four days after the glue dried. It totally fell apart and left residue behind. Craptacular.	-1
they cut up my fingers while using them	-1
Needs to include instructions on how to best use these with gel stamps. disapointed.	-1
I don't use these as often as I thought. They are kind of a pain to get the wire in place to loop it.	-1
I do not recommend this to anyone!  Also it is not true 6 strand and not good for anything you might need for cross stitch or even embroidery!  Maybe for children's crafts but that is about it!  Also the name they use is not good because it is not real DMC Product so DO NOT BUY IT, AND DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID!	-1
These are sold as DMC but it beats me where the floss label says it. I am leery of any other brand. I guess I'll try a sample and see if it is any good but I sure don't know where to put them in my DMC book. Took awhile to get to me.	-1
This product although has grid guides on it, it however is not edged into it, rather it is printed on . It does come off . Mine came already with some that has came off. It is also fairly light when compared with the rest of the blocks on the market.	-1
Very thin and skimpy compared to others I've had.	-1
Shrank badly.  Ran to get more at local walmart and they had the same brand etc. for $4.97 for 6 yards...same brand.	-1
This product looks natural but they sent white.  Had to use the white because I needed it that weekend for a wedding backdrop. Also had to order more to add on to it and made sure i ordered so it would match. What a pain.  Also there were brown spots in a few places that I didn't catch till I was working on. The project. Sigh I wish more companies would do better on quality control.	-1
I wanted the box to paint and as I did they started to bubble everywhere underneath.	-1
don't like  not very strong material ,or perhaps I was expecting something else. Thought they could be used for hat boxes.	-1
I might have used this product wrong, however, I put on a thick coat and barely saw any crackling on the surface unless I held the surface at an angle and even then it was not that impressive. (I applied it to chipboard covered with a water based spray on ink).  I was pretty disappointed.  If you look at the applied surface straight on, the only result I saw was a shiny finish. I think this Rocky Candy just crackled up a bit on itself, rather than crackling the paint underneath. Perhaps you need to apply acrylic paint first?	-1
I have many Susan Bates hooks which I really like, but when I got this 10mm one, I think it's badly designed cuz the tip is so round & blunt, making it so hard to go between the stitches.  The 8mm is barely a bit sharper so not as bad.  I regret my purchase & am disappointed in this hook.	-1
Left lines in my blending work.  And yes, I know all the tricks for working with this blender and still...lines. I will go back to a sponge brush for blending.	-1
They are smaller than stated. They are at least a 1/2 inch smaller.	-1
much too small for what I needed.	-1
The packaging is deceiving. The board is not 34 inches long which is why I bought it. It's approximately 10x13.5 inches. I thought it would be great for designing longer necklaces. I have not figured out how the number system works on this. Most likely I will give this away.	-1
This Bead Board is quite cheaply made.  Arrived cracked: bead cups have some cracks and small holes.	-1
I unfortunately bought not 1 but 2 of these birds for a project. DO NOT BUY as I'm sure you can find a better bird embellishment else where. The picture looks cute but when I received these I was SO not happy. Both birds were not completely painted (specifically the neck area and parts of the face were missing the blue paint...it was as if whoever made them ran out of paint but decided to ship them anyway. The breasts of each bird are an ugly construction site orange color not the light golden yellow depicted in the picture. I know not all monitors are the same but the coloring is really off for a blue bird. A lighter orange or a golden yellow color would have been much more acceptable.	-1
While these do exactly what they are supposed to, I cannot justify spending $11 every time I run out.  I have tried over and over to reuse my cups, but the resin just sticks in the bottom, and it affects the measurements on the side.  (If there's 1/4" of dried resin in the bottom, then all measurements relating to those printed on the cup would be completely off)  The sticks are ok, again, nothing of this is worth $11.  The brushes were useful, the one time, each, that I got use out of them.  Again, once resin is used on them, they are then 'resin-ed'.  Rendered useless.  The other thing, these cups are HUGE!  I make medium size batches of resin items at once, and never once needed anywhere near this volume.  I make jewelry FYI, so that obviously has a factor in it, that I don't need a 1 cup volume of resin at any one time.  **  I could primarily see this size being useful for an artist covering a large art piece.  **  Instead I buy a multi pack of medicine cups.  It's 100 cups, they are the perfect size.  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IFBFXI/ref=wms_ohs_product?ie=UTF8&psc=1  And then a huge pack of popsicle sticks, either online or at my local craft store.  (I get the skinny ones, about 1/4 wide.  I found these perfect for mixing in the smaller cup). These both work perfectly and are MUCH cheaper than ET's product.  I'm also very sure that you can find bulk cheap brushes, but really a stick will work to spread this better than wasting a brush on it, plus won't leave brush marks. Will not buy this again, and won't recommend.	-1
Wish I would have only bought one.  I bought the medium, large and extra large so I could nest the cuts over each other.  But the cut takes place so close to the edge of the paper that this is basically impossible.  Wish I would have found something else.  :(	-1
Smells horrible!  I don't know why but it has a strong oil/gas odor.  Never had hemp cord like it.	-1
Bought them twice and both times it broke. Was not trying to cut with a thick paper either. Great idea, poor product.	-1
I did notreceive my purchase. Amazon.com did not explain why.	-1
Not as good as another applique product,that is now back on the market.	-1
Truly terrible- has absolutely no hold. Tape would be more useful.	-1
Burns very fast, leaves a bad taste, not that strong.  Don't use this as a replacement for hemp wick.	-1
ugh	-1
The hemp is classic low-grade hemp, as in it smells absolutely foul, it's fraying and has large, unbendable fibers and sticks in it, is very lumpy and uneven in size, and is extremely course and unpleasant to wear. Scratchy. I guess I'm spoiled but I prefer other hemps.	-1
Pure junk.  Do not buy.  I'm sure it is not Lion's fault the the manufacturer has made the main wire that hooks into the curved part  way too short.  So as you are stitching away the "safety pin" part slips right out and all of your held stitches fall right off.  worst product I have ever seen	-1
I wanted to do some applique and waited expectantly for this iron-on adhesive. I've used Steam a Seam 2 Lite in the past but it's been unavailable in the size I need. I expected Thermoweb Heat'n Bond to work like Steam a Seam, but it failed miserably. It did adhere somewhat to the applique fabric but left a hash mark pattern in the fabric. It didn't adhere AT ALL to the foundation fabric, no matter how much I ironed it. I only had a small piece of fabric for my project and it was ruined by the Thermoweb Heat'n Bond Lite Iron-on Adhesive, so I wasted my fabric, my money, my time, my effort and my patience. Project stalled. Because of the hash mark issue, I couldn't use the Thermoweb Heat'n Bond adhesive even if it did adhere properly.  I don't recommend Thermoweb Heat'n Bond Lite Iron-on Adhesive to anybody.	-1
I purchased this for the first time, followed the directions, and Thermoweb stuck on one side of the adhesive, when I peeled and ironed the other side, nothing doing.  Six to eight seconds of heat did not cause so much as a bit of adhesive.  I'm sending this back.	-1
Wow this hemp stinks! I couldn't even use it.	-1
I have used Aleene's Tacky Glue since I was a little girl making crafts with Mimi.  There is something wrong with the gallon I ordered - it does not dry and it does not stick - even after 48 hours.  So disappointing now that I am Mimi - had to redo my grandkid's crafts and they were crying.  Will not disappoint them again becayse we're using anithercbrand going forward.  What an awful waste of time and money.	-1
The lid can only fit one way, due to a swooped design that was not well thought out.  Really, really poor design.  No one should have to use two hands to put a lid back on the glue while working on your project.  Frustrating and stupid.  Fire the designer.  The glue may be great, but not worth trying to use it in this pen!  Into the garbage, or a kids glue box.  Not meant for adults.	-1
My 1960's shuttle broke so I ordered two new ones, also Boys, the metal was so thin it cut my fingers and my thread! These are not what they used to be.	-1
very faint ink. I can hardly see it on any color card stock except pure white and even then it does not appear to be anything but a shadow. Not overly impressed with this color.	-1
I'll be honest I've never been able to figure this out; and I really want to make my own lace. I need to research and find a tutorial for the lessons I so desperately need and want. But, I did keep this shuttle hoping to find the answer.	-1
This Item did not have enough Tack to help me with my upolstery in my truck.  Maybe for other jobs it is good	-1
Bought 4 cans to attach rose petals to aisle runner.  On average out of 100 petals, 20 stayed on.	-1
For use on my Cameo Silhouette cutting mat this product doesn't cut it. I'm so tired of it coming out like Silly String & then gumming up my paper to the point that I have to throw away everything it touches! Not cheap!!	-1
Not what i expected. I thing it would stay "tacky" after drying, but it's a permanent adhesive. The name is misleading. I was looking fora temporary adhesive	-1
Horrible product. Leaves a white residue after completely drying. Not as advertised where they say it dries off clear. Also the glue is not strong after it dries. It's more of a sticky resin than glue. After 24 hrs of drying the shiny white residue is sticky to the touch. Used it for an arts and crafts project to stick colored  rice to a design. This spray glue does a bad job unlike the original Aleenes tacky glue. The picture below was a test before I used it on my main design. As you can see it left a white glitter like residue after 24hrs of drying. Rice is clumped like I used some honey instead of glue. I do not recommend this product. Will be returning mine for a refund.	-1
I expected a product that was easy to use in my crafting projects. Unfortunately, it did not happen. It was difficult to use and clogged up making it difficult to use. I would not use this product again.	-1
Not loving this at all!  After using it only once (worked great then) the end gets stopped up and surgery has to be performed to get the dried glue from the inside of the tip.  NOT worth it!  I bought several glues at the same time to test.  I was in search of a good glue/applicator for intricate dies.  The best of the bunch is the " Mono Multi Liquid Glue Carded, 0.88-Ounce" here: http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000XAOSHS/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pd_S_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&colid=BJ1NRD2Q2OUY&coliid=I26GJ84QWOH650&tag=class017-20 ... it is now my go-to glue for intricate work.	-1
Didn't realize the colors were variegated.	-1
Squeezing the handle to expose the blade is of poor design.  You squeeze with the index/middle finger.  I like the Olfa much better.  All of your fingers are used to expose the blade and better control.	-1
If you're a casual user this will probably be an OK rotary cutter, but if you use your rotary cutter professionally, hundreds of times a week, there are multiple details that quickly become annoying, especially if you're familiar with other, better rotary cutters such as the ones Olfa offers.  First and foremost, the blade deployment system with the Fiskars rotary cutter is very hard to use one-handed.  The lever action is in the front portion of the handle, so you end up using the same fingers to deploy the blade that you want to use to lock it in place.  By contrast, the Olfa that I normally use has the lever action at the back of the handle, so you can use your pinky and the finger next to it to deploy the blade, leaving your index finger free to push the locking button into place.  Second, the screw unit that holds the blade in place is missing a critical piece:  A small, bowed washer that puts pressure outward on the nut that tightens the blade into place.  This pressure prevents the nut from unscrewing and making the blade loose while working.  This Fiskars unit does NOT have this, so multiple times a day I have to tighten the nut to keep the blade from rocking around loosely.  Third, the big orange "button" that holds the blade against the blade bed is too small, and if you apply even a little too much pressure when cutting the blade bows and warps.  Not good at all.  Fourth, the blade is not far enough forward when it's deployed.  Because the blade deploys basically straight down you can't tilt the handle up when cutting heavy material like leather.  This means that instead of using gravity and the weight of your arm to apply natural pressure downwards on the blade, you have to use your index finger to apply pressure.  Not only does it get tiring fast, it's nowhere near as confidence inspiring as being able to tilt the handle up and use your whole arm to apply downward pressure on the blade.  +1 star for being affordable, and again if you're a casual user this will probably be ok for you.  But if you depend on your rotary cutter dozens upon dozens of times a day, this one isn't the right one.	-1
I'm very disappointed in these pins.  I only bought them on the advice of another quilter.  These pins are so dull, they won't even go thru my quilting sandwich.  My quilts have 1 layer of cotton, 1 layer of batting and 1 layer of the quilt top.  These pins didn't even perform.  I'm so sorry I ordered them.  Will not recommend.  Sorry.	-1
Purchased 4 packs of these for my shop where I make party sashes. Received negative reviews recently because this batch of pins were not sharp and they damaged the sashes. Not able to return because I purchased back in January.	-1
I thought I was getting a nice size pin for quilting, but these things are huge!  I don't recommend them for preparing a quilt for quilting.  They leave big holes in the fabric.	-1
tear easilty	-1
This is not cordless like it says in the description!!! Don't waste your time buying this, if that is what you are looking for. It doesn't even work well. Garbage. Maybe mine was just a bad one? But I doubt it.	-1
This glue gun isn't cordless when the description says that it is. I was very disappointed.	-1
Not reusable, not very good sized (super small!), didn't transfer onto glass well... Much detail lost. Don't recommend.	-1
I was unimpressed with this glue gun. It was most likely just 'this' particular one, but the trigger didn't push the glue stick through and I had to do it manually for the craft I started doing. I sent the glue gun back to Amazon.	-1
I wouldn't buy it again.  Heats up slow, feels very cheap in the hand, has issues feeding new sticks, and it's leaking hot glue out around the applicator tip.	-1
The gun wasn't working at all it kept melting the sticks, very disappointed	-1
I had this same gun for 2 years but I thought it was time for a new one once the front turned black from heat. Well, this new one didn't even make it a year before the glue leaked into the gun, cooled around all the wires, and glued the trigger solid.	-1
I had  to spread the slot in the tool to use.	-1
I got this glue gun for the 2 temp setting and as far as I can tell that's the only good thing about it.  The glue drips from the tip constantly leaving strands of glue streaming from the nozzle when I move it away from my project and continuing to make a puddle under it when I set it down.  The nozzle is much thinner than my old gun and glue doesn't come out in an even stream. It might be good for delicate projects (cannot say from experience) but this isn't what I need it for.  As far as I can tell the "cordless"  feature is just ridiculous because it is like saying my curling iron is cordless.  In other words, it stays warm for some time after I unplug it - imagine that.  The feature is actually that the cord unplugs where it connects to the gun so that you can use it "cordless" while it cools down.  I found it more of a nuisance than anything else.	-1
barely any glue came out no matter how long i let it heat and eventually oozed out the sides,  not a good product.	-1
This glue is toxic acetone based. It is highly flammable. I hate this product. And warning! It cannot be shipped back!!	-1
I have no idea what to use this for. Threw it away and then decided I would try to figure out a use for it. It does not really adhere anything to anything  and is messy to use. Really wanted this to work.	-1
This is over all fantastic.  But the clay "tears" far easier than normal playing clay so stretching can result in tearing far too easily, but it just means being far more careful and gentle with it.  The real problem I'm deducting a point for is after it hardens, which it does after a day or so, (which is fine) and sits for a couple of months, it further dries up.  The color fades slightly and... hmmm, imagine having chocolate sit on the counter for a few months.  The material feels & sounds hallow and brittle after a few months.  It took a couple of more points off after having bought several more packages.  The two extra points I took off were for: 1)  All the extra packages that I bought hardened in the package before I opened them, rendering them useless (though after months). 2) The end product shrinks and doesn't hold the exact shape that you made it.  I used the black to cover up the speakerphone area on my desk phone since it was super loud at its lowest setting.  A month later the color is a lot less "black" and it is no longer covering the same area.	-1
would love to like it....but it leaked into the bag covering it, about 1/3 of the contents is forming a perfect seal around the tip  , so I can't get to it	-1
Is just a little bit better than marking with a color pencil a white fabric. Nothing extraordinary... I can't mark Lycra because it sticks in it , and when I mark a non stretching fabric I have to press hard to be able to mark it. So, what's the point??? I bought it so a could make fine lines when needed but I'm afraid it does not compete with a regular tailor's chalk.	-1
Revised Review: Don't buy it unless you plan on using the entire bottle in one craft project in one go. I tried this glue and it seemed to hold well and dry clear.  So, based on other reviews, I gave it 5 stars.  After opening the product, using same and genuine experience - I am very disappointed.  I opened the bottle, kept it capped  and now have a solid dried wad of hard glue in the bottle rendering this product unusable.  I am very disappointed.  Original Review: Honestly I am basing this review on but one experience to date and mainly on the great reviews of others. My single use was entirely satisfactory.  I became a paper crafter just over a year ago. Since then I have suffered bouts of "underwhelm" and "down right disappointment" with several types of adhesives. I began an odyssey of adhesive discovery several months ago.  It will be in progress for some time.  As a crafter I want my art to last.  The thought of giving someone a home made card that falls apart does not appeal.  Nor do I want to create home decor or a scrapbook layout which separates within a year or so.  I bought Beacon 3-in-1 Advanced Craft Glue based on its good reviews.  I am entirely happy with its clear dry and fast tack abilities.  It claims to be acid-free so it is safe with my papers and photographs.  Many reviewers with more adhesive experience give this Beacon product high compliments. I can't but do likewise for lack of contradictory evidence.	-1
They're screwed together too tight, made cutting hard.	-1
I think I got a bad pair because the motion of cutting is not smooth. The blades like get stuck and don't glide smoothly. It hurts my hand after awhile. They are so comfortable but if they don't cut properly there's not really a point in comfort.	-1
I have wanted to write a review about these scissors ever since the day I received them. I have been sewing for 50 years on a daily basis, it's what I do for a living. These are the worst scissors I have ever owned, so incredibly uncomfortable on the hand. In under a minute my thumb has a huge dent in it. They are also clumsy and are very hard to manage. They don't glide along like other scissors do. I have owned Gingher's for years and just love them. I will be making the switch back as soon as possible. Don't waste your money if you are a serious sewer!	-1
Too small to be useful	-1
Looks like nice quality but way too small for even for my eleven-year old daughter. And because of ergonomic handle contour only for right hand users; left hand is impossible.	-1
These are sharp and nice, but they are extremely tight and hard to open and close. I hate using them for that reason.	-1
Unfortunately even on my irons highest setting, it did not disappear , and did not stay, it looks as though I used elmers  glue on it, and had to cut above the original seam and sew only. I could have possibly got a poor batch. Not sure. Very disappointed	-1
Ink okay Arrived with major leakage and just too much trouble to return	-1
was not a god product	-1
Today's caligraphy is often not the one of yesteryear.  Wtih refillable cartridges and pens that are modern I have little use for this shellac.  Perhaps I'm missing something, but this product sits on my shelf, unused.	-1
I'm a professional colored pencil artist and I just want to pass on that these may be nice to use for general practice but they have been rated as some of the worst lightfast pencils on the market. Most of the pigments used will loose color when exposed to light over a short period of time. This has been posted for a while on these by the Colored Pencil Society of America and its a worthy tip to pass on if your doing fine art projects.	-1
Blah, boring, dull colors.  Waste of money.	-1
doesn't work any better than my fingers	-1
I don't care for this so I am sending it back. Too small for my use.	-1
Not good, Go for a Bause and Lauber. Worth it	-1
Not as comfortable to view under as I expected. You have to hold it at a specific length and position for it to work. Very small viewing lense.	-1
The hook came out of the handle the first time I used it. I will not be buying anymore of these hooks.	-1
too hard rubber	-1
I bought these to use on double pointed needles that I use as single pointed needles for small projects like wash cloths.  But they fall off all the time.  I finally stopped using them and just wound rubber bands on the ends of the needles.  The rubber bands aren't cute, but at least they stay put.  Used to keep stitches on regular needles while not being worked on, where they are just laying there and not rubbing against anything, they'd probably work just fine.  But not for my purpose.  Bummer.	-1
Sticky, too soft, EXTREMELY messy, burns easily, doesn't keep it's shape while molding solid items or items with weight and gets dirty far too easily. Should I say more? Only upsides for this clay is that there is no heavy plastic smell while working with it and small items bake fairly hard so maybe it would be good for small marble type pieces or background decorations for a larger piece. Pretty much every other Sculpey product is a magnitude better than this clay. Don't fall for the trap of its cheap price, it's a block of crap.	-1
This is not unusable but just about. I had gotten some of the gray, which was a bit hard but softened up with handling. This stuff just crumbled. It took a very long time, over an hour, to even get it warm enough to stick together. I had opened the second pack hoping it was better but both packages of white crumbled, not acting like clay. Maybe it is old but as these were unmarked, I have no way to know. I MAY try it again but return the new stuff, if it does this again I'll return it.	-1
I tried baking it as instructed and one of two things or sometimes both happen, it doesn't cook enough and feels very brittle and breaks super easy I mean way easier than any clay product has any right to, it's like a dried leaf in it's fragility. The other thing is it burns super bad despite it not being cooked all the way through. I even tried to go online looking for other methods of using this clay and tried their suggestions and each one only succeeded in keeping the burn off, but it still is super brittle still not baking all the way through no matter how I adjust the time or temp. I thought this was what I used to use as a kid and had no problem cooking this stuff in a toaster oven, did exactly what it was supposed to, but this stuff I can't even get it to a point where I could paint it, much less if I wanted to use it to add to something like charms, jewelry, or even figures, but for some reason it doesn't do that anymore, you can sit this stuff out for days and it still feels like it didn't set up and brittle as a dry plant. Would never get this stuff again, don't know what I am going to do with what I have since I can't get the stuff to set up.	-1
Definitely not the best clay (which I already knew) but I sometimes mix it with Fimo or Premo.	-1
Wife say's : this clay is way too sticky, it warms up very quickly and is hard to sculpt with because it's sticking to everything then after I add some kind of starch or something to keep it from sticking to everything then you have the issue of it not wanting  stick to itself etc... very similar to chewing gum. It's not even warm in my house my hands aren't hot so I know the clay is not above 70 degrees or 68 degrees. I'm very disappointed with sculpey will not purchase again.	-1
These are difficult to get to stay on the needles.  The idea is great, but needs a little tweaking to work better.	-1
Did not stay on. Do not recommend.	-1
Bought these for addiClick Turbo Size 10 Circular needles.  No matter how hard I push the needles in, these do not stay on.	-1
I really wanted to like these. For my single needles I use the jumbo protectors and think they are great. I tried these on my size 15 ChiaoGoo stainless steel circular needle and they refuse to stay on. I'm so disappointed. Perhaps they will work on smaller needles.	-1
I know this is good oil pastel, I have many for my art students. But I purchased this set as a gift. And when I opened the box it looked like it has been badly handled. Pastels were all bunched together to one side. I had to put them back in order but All colors were mixed together and looked messy. It was not in a condition to be gifted. I felt so embarrassed to give it as a gift, but had no time to purchase a new one..	-1
The colors are great, and on a budget I was excited to receive all those colors for the price. The reason for two stars is the smell!!! Extreme chemical smell!!! I am not one to be affected by unpleasant odors, as I am a man, and not the most effeminate man in terms of hygiene, however, laying in bed with the windows closed was a dizzying experience in the most unpleasant way. I threw these away within two days because of the odor.	-1
I was hoping these would be more like artist-quality pastels, based on the other reviews, but they really aren't any better than other children's quality pastels.  There is a huge variety of color, but I think I'd prefer to have a smaller variety and better quality. I felt they laid on very sheer.	-1
I just didn't like the way the oil pastels looked. tried them once and put them in the grandkids basket of art supplies	-1
These are dried up and  awful thougjt they were  described  like  something  different  thier just cheap crayons	-1
Kinda cheap and crayon like.	-1
Heavy chemical smell but I'm new to pastels so maybe they all have it? Don't blend very well. Will try mineral oil as suggested in another review. Colors are vibrant but probably won't use them much due to odor.	-1
Buyer beware.  The photo for this item shows the thicker oil pastels.  I thought that was what I was ordering.  The pastels arrived, but they are about half the thickness of the other pastels.  Compare their photo to the photo of the actual product.  My daughter used a few of them already so unfortunately I cannot return the item.	-1
Many chipped and broken pastels in the tray.	-1
Quality of oil pastels is poor. In other words when you apply a pastel to paper or other surface it should easily transfer to the surface. Nope not is formula of oil pastel which is really hard to understand. So I using these pastels and when used up I will look at Winston or an in the store source because this overseas source is not worth cost or the effort to return.	-1
Ergh, these did not excited me.  The application was greasy and not easily blend-able.	-1
Well I finally tried these pastels.  When I try to blend colors together with my fingers, there's a lot of rubber like debris that forms.  It's the pastels just balling up under my finger.  It's very frustrating.	-1
Save your $ or buy another brand.  This little box had lots of colors in very small sticks.  They go down on the paper smoothly but won't blend out with a water brush, finger, paper stump or wet wipe.  Was a waste of my $ and my time in making a swatch sheet because they won't blend out.	-1
When it arrived, it had ink or dye, dark blue or blackish, that has yet to come off the spool.  I have used about a third of the thread so far, and still the 'ugly' remains.	-1
They would be perfect for me since I sew for a living and organization of my sewing supplies can be a huge problem.  I probably need 3 but I actually have to return the one I did order because it came cracked at all 4 corners. The acrylic is just too delicate.  Back to big bins of cones for me. Bummer.	-1
Okay, 1 positive: inexpensive and made in Ohio.  Negatives:  - Too long to fit in normal dimensions for storage cubbies, so I just let it hang over an inch and go with it.  - Had to return 1 that cracked as soon as I took off the wrapping.  - Don't fit together securely -- what's with that ?!	-1
If I could put no stars I would. I'm returning this ASAP. Arrived broken, cracked, had to pry off the lid to assess amount of damage. I won't be replacing it.  I liked the look and dimensions of this spool holder, but am very disappointed with product construction. This plastic is very clear, yes, but equally as brittle.  More pliable, less breakable fragile plastics are available. This is just plain cheap and I'd be upset with the quality even if I'd only paid $3 for it.	-1
its ok, but it needs a lot of room to store and the lids are difficult to get bon just right....Oh, well nice try anyway	-1
After hunting through the store's selection for this product, I finally found on that wasn't cracked  or shattered in the corner. I loaded it up with my threads, stuck the lid on, and then realized that the lid doesn't snap on. It just sits there. I can foresee myself carrying a bunch of things and then the bottom drops off and my threads go rolling everywhere. No thank you! I returned the product.	-1
Not very useful or practical.  I am a long arm quilter and hooked these up but they were more in the way than anything else.  Didn't help at all.  Waste of $$$	-1
WORTHLESS!  The instructions say that these can be used for sheer to drapery weight fabrics.  I made curtains using medium weight. cotton canvas with the header folded 4" over light interfacing.  These cheap plastic grommets CANNOT be sealed over anything heavier than sheers!  So now my fabric is ruined and I will have to add a new header and either find a place to install metal grommets or try a pleat or add a tube to run a curtain rod through, all because of false advertising.  In addition, it should be noted that you cannot iron, tumble dry, or dry clean your curtains if you use these grommets.  WHAT!  WORTHLESS!	-1
Plastic	-1
I saw this item (or similar) demonstrated on TV and thought I would love to use it.  But, it is no where as easy to use as the demonstration showed.	-1
It is in the mail to Clover Customer Service in Ontario, CA, to be replaced. The left side of the metal housing is malformed, so fabric doesn't pull through evenly. I found another one in a local store, and it appeared to have the same problem.	-1
While I like the non-slip surface, I've found that rulers made by this company are cheap.  I've never before had rulers so easily nicked by a rotary cutter that I've had to throw them out.  One ruler designed for cutting multiple layers actually broke when lifted slightly to nudge into position.  Save your money.  Buy from another manufacturer.	-1
Couldn't get this thing to work at all, sorry I wasted money on it.  Disappointed.	-1
What a waste of money, buying this product.	-1
They went on easy enough. They are plastic and not a tough plastic at that. Now that the drapes are up, these keep popping off. Might work better with thin shears or curtains but not tough enough for the weight of drapes.	-1
is not as the picture shown. It looks to be 4x8 and to be used as a guide to cut smaller pieces of fabric. but it is really 1/2 in by 8. guess i should not go by pictures	-1
Did not like this product, I watched some tutorials and it is not very easy to slide the piece of fabric to get a bias. The fabris slips a lot while put it in through.	-1
Maybe there is a trick to this. I've heard people rave about it. But I couldn't get it to work. This bias was uneven and just didn't have that crisp look. I would still have to re-iron to make it look right.	-1
Also a total waste of time.  A lot of fiddling and then the bias strips do not come out straight as the little gadet is so small and flimsy it slides all over the place.  Trying to keep it straight and iron the strip as it comes out involves a lot of fidgeting and fooling around with a hot iron.  It was cheap enough that I can just kiss it off but I would advise you not to waste your money.	-1
Good box, but flimsy. Arrived with crack in the bottom and had to fix with wood filler. Definitely for painting or decoupage, not stain. Very inexpensive and good for a cheap craft project.	-1
This is the worst product I've ever ordered from Amazon.  The top of the box was "two" pieces of wood.  There is no way I could have placed a design on the top of this box and sent it as a gift.  (Grrrr.)  Also the bottom of the box was "three" pieces of wood.  You could see right through the "slats".  This is a very poor quality item and I would never order anything like this through Amazon again.	-1
I dunno.  I'm spoiled. I like 100% cotton.  This is okay for the purpose of learning how to quilt but that was as far as it went.  Now that I know, I only buy the best stuff.	-1
Either the roll that I have been sent was expired or the product is of awful quality, but I tried it on different fabrics: it mostly doesn't stay on the fabric, but in those rare occasions when it stays, at the attempt to tear it off, it leaves the plastic (glue) traces on the fabric that are really not very convenient to remove! Looking at other reviews I guess, I was just unlucky and received a product that lost its qualities. I returned the roll and will not be buying this product again.	-1
I have always had great luck with Sulky brand products until using this stabilizer. It doesn't adhere to the fabric. I have tried it several times, on different fabrics, both unwashed and pre-washed, even tried it using different irons. It just doesn't stay adhered to the fabrics. I hope to find a stabilizer that will work, as I do a lot of applique..and for machine applique using a stabilizer makes the process much easier, and the finished product turns out great. Just very disappointed in this stabilizer.	-1
Not my favorite, I much prefer Vilene to this.	-1
to use in the future	-1
Ok. I have previously loved Sulky products but this one I really really dislike. It does NOT work for free standing lace projects! It is very flimsy and even three or four layers still is very flimsy. Hard to hoop smoothly because it is so thin. Tends to shift in the hoop with the embroidering process which is NOT what you want with FSL! It does have one redeeming quality: it is nice to use on top of thin knit fabrics like t-shirts or thin cotton knit baby blankets, because it dissolves more easily than Ultra Solvy does. But, it did not work for what I bought it for- free standing lace.	-1
As some others have noted, I also received blades that were not Olfa original packaging, but marked with Asian writing.  Recycled or counterfeit, they are junk.  Buyer beware.	-1
I thought it was me --- the blades didn't cut cleanly.  Changed blades several times and things never got any better.  Tried an Olfa blade from Joann's and it was perfect.  So I went back to this pack of 10 and tried them all.  Several have nicks in them right out of the package.  None of them cut well.  What a waste of money.	-1
These "OLFA" blades come in a package from China. They are sharp in the beginning but quickly become dull. I'm disappointed. I think I bought better quality Olfa blades on amazon in the past.	-1
I have only used one blade from the package. They are thicker than my regular Olfa blades, and do not roll or cut very well. They do not feel like Olfa blades at all. I would have returned them, but I missed my return window. These blades are from Japan and do not look like standard Olfa packaging in the US.	-1
What a disappointment! Blades were priced so good and delivery was so quick -- but performance is a zero. In the course of 2 hours, had to change the blade 3 times. Yes, I tried flipping blade sides and even applying a teeny bit of oil, still dull duds. My SOP is a (one!!) new blade as I begin each new project. At this rate, the 10-pack won't last just this one quilt. Will not purchase from this site again.	-1
I think they sent me the oldest crap they had in stock. The gutta bottle is either almost empty or it is dried out. I had four ladies ready to do a project, we had to use Elmer's washable glue from the dollar store. It works better than gutta to me. Easier to use and cheap.	-1
These colors barely show up on paper!	-1
This arrived with the plastic hinge already broken!  The packaging was in perfect condition, so I'm assuming that it was broken when it left the factory.  I've ordered another one, because I couldn't find another that would suit my needs better.	-1
I used the sealing tape but it still leaks. Not sure if its flawed or if im doing it wrong	-1
Very poorly made.  Leaked badly from everyehre.  thought maybe I just had a bad one so like an idiot I bought another one.  Between the two of them and some JB Weld I got it working with only a small leak until I can get a better one.	-1
I had used this Regulator for about 4 days and a couple of days ago I started smelling a really bad burnt odor and none of my airbrushes would work no air or paint so I started to disconnect the hose from the Regulator and it was so hot I couldn't touch it with my fingers upon getting the Regulator off it had left burnt marks on the connector on my Compressor after disconnecting and doing a straight hookup with my hose to Compressor and then to my Iwata Airbrush my Compressor started skipping so I called Amazon and they made everything Ok. I can't tell you not to buy this Regulator I can just tell you mine is in the TRASH and I Will Never Buy This Regulator AGAIN  Mike_Tina 10.13	-1
Not great I have to say.  Threads the needle in about one in every ten attempts. Would not buy again.	-1
This simply does not work. Used regular hand sewing needles just like it suggests,	-1
Thank you	-1
This doesn't work.  I have tried several times.  Still can't seem to make it connect.	-1
The description is incredibly misleading.  <<Simply drop your needle in (any needle except tiny quilt petites) rest your thread in the slot press the button and you will have your pre-threaded needle>>  Not a single needle in my sewing supplies fits this threader.  It should clearly state that you need very specific needles, of a certain brand, within a specific thickness range to use this tool.  Why isn't this vital information clearly stated in the description?	-1
I've seen this used in many videos but it doesn't work they way they show it!  IF you have the right size needle, it works fine UNTIL you take the needle out at which point you lose the thread.  I'd tried and tried to make it work and finally realized it was quicker to grab a magnifying glass and thread the darn needle that way.  Great idea but it just doesn't work the way it shows!	-1
This train is not heavy duty at all and in my opinion it's just a quick fix up don't use this for any heavy duty projects it rips itfrays	-1
So, the fact that this thread was not cotton+polyester but rather  polyester+polyester did not really bother me and thanks for the heads up from all you reviewers. I was in an Amazon  buying mood and rememembered I also needed black thread and thought that this was a great deal for TWO threads & no S&H... Yes - I saw two threads pictured and I thought I was getting two threads because, the small details escape me I guess. I called Court Street Office Supplies and asked for my second thread and was informed that even tho two are pictured only one is shipped. I told them that the price I paid was good for two threads but I could do better for one & requested a return authorization. I was told that the return policy on the back of my packing slip (the back of my slip was blank by the way) detailed what the return policy was and that they would be happy to accecpt my return but it would cost me somewhere between $10-$12 to do so. I declined returning the item and told them that the picture was deceiving and they should make it clear that you get ONE thread even tho you see two and I would write a review stating my dissatisfaction.	-1
Did I get a defective one? Cause my needles broke after two uses...I didn't even use a lot of pressure...pen is fine but the needles are Garbage	-1
It was a nice pen and made it easy to hold and control but broke the first time I used it. Amazon did replace it however so I will give it another chance and hopefully be able to update this review.	-1
needles broke after 2nd use when I wasn't even using it. Used them one night, next morning I went to continue the project and three needles were all snapped off.	-1
I didn't find this tool to be helpful at all...the needles are very thin, seem to have no barbs at all, and I would keep stabbing and stabbing and seem to get nowhere.  And one of the needles has broken already.  I tossed it.	-1
bought these for my girls and the needles broke its not durable at all, will not buy again	-1
the pen was nice for holding the needles.. but the needles it came with worked very poorly.. i was  not impressed.  All I needed this for was to make some Dryer Balls from wool Roving.. something Fairly simple and easy.. and the needles were just poor quality and didn't want to felt the wool at all.	-1
UPDATE April 2013:  It appears the blades I am getting from Amazon have a high rate of getting bad blades.  The prices change frequently too.  I guess I better just take my chances and order directly from Pazzles, even though their packages take an entire 7 days to reach me and they cost more. I feel so stuck with this machine because I can't buy supplies locally.  Wow!  I just bought these blades at Amazon on Sept 1, 2011 for 11.99 and they are now $15 in Dec 2011?!  WTH!!  I have come to the conclusion I bought a bad batch of blades.  They are dull!  The blade that was sent to me from Pazzles worked great, but both of the blades in my packaging would not cut properly.  I had to go back to my old blade just so I can get a clean cut (had to do more passes).  I thought just one of the new blades were defective, so I tested it against the old blade, cutting out the same design, but of course a lower blade setting on the new blade.  The old blade cut better.  I tried the second new blade and again the cuts were awful.  I've had to go back to my original blade, but I must get new blades because my old blade has to have a higher setting to cut cleaner.  All in all, I expected new blades, but these were really bad.  I compared one of the new blades (the one I didn't throw out) to the old blade and low and behold the new blade is rounded at the tip and the old blade tip is pointed!!!  I am really disappointed.  I usually don't get defective products sent from Amazon, but this time I did and I don't think I can return the blades.  Money wasted.	-1
I rated this tool low because they do not indicate the size needle supplied with the tool so buying replacement needles is hit or miss. My best guess was they were a 42.  Amazon doesn't seem to have a vendor supplying that fine a size. Big disappointment.	-1
I bought this thinking it would help speed up felting, but it really doesn't help... My single needle works a lot faster and better. The grip is pretty nice though, The needles felt very fragile and unstable while being used	-1
I cannot even use all of the corresponding products I purchased to go with my pazzle machine as the seller was deceptive about it's compatibility.	-1
Very useful basic tool for felting and appliques, but the price seems high, especially considering the construction of the tool itself which seems a bit light and flimsy. You'll definitely want to have a set of spare felting needles on hand, because the design of this tool really only grabs the far bent end of each needle, making it very easy for the length of the needle to flex and eventually snap. The tool for "shortening" the length of the needle ostensibly should protect against this, but really it just hides the upper half of the needles, while still leaving too much room for flexing and breakage. There's about a half inch of room at the top of each need that could probably be "held" in order to give even a little better protection against breakage and movement, but I suppose they wouldn't want to alter the tool's design when they're really making their money off needle replacements.	-1
This Baby Pink yarn is terrible! As I have been using it there are thin strands that are barely held together. There are strands that are totally frayed and I had to improvise as I was crocheting! Very disappointed. I have other skeins in many colors and not one of them is like the that.	-1
I gave a 1Star bc the striped pattern that was created was nice. With that said this yarn split while crocheting making it horrible to work with.  I also saw  this identical name brand and colors in a fav store for half the price.  Not buying this yarn again	-1
not what I expected, I was looking for fuse able seam binding.....so not sure what I will do with 2 rolls of this super thin seam tape	-1
It is very fine. Not as described. It seems more like a thick string than yarn.	-1
Opened package to find yarn had been cut in several places	-1
This is beautiful yarn at a really horrible price.  For $7+ I thought I was getting three skeins and it even said that in the description (or so I thought).  Alas, no.  So the yarn is nice, the price is not.  Don't be fooled.	-1
The cost of this Zebra color is ridiculous.  REALLY......3 times the normal cost.  Just a ripoff.	-1
The yardage,is very deceiving. This is extremely expensive for the amount of yarn in the skein. I was expecting 364 yards many others who ordered it, but the actual skein is 236 yards. I will never order yarn from Amazon again.	-1
This yarn is probably fine for kids' craft projects and maybe some lessons in the most basic of knitting or crochet stitches, but it was a poor choice for crocheting a hat. It's not soft at all, and it's so very inelastic. Even having made my gauge swatch, I ended up with a hat that was too big simply because the ribbing didn't hug in like it was supposed to. It stayed stiff and extended. I made the exact same pattern with an alpaca yarn and it came out beautifully, but the hat from this yarn I'll chalk up to a learning experience.	-1
Not pleased I order three balls yarn for 15 I needed one more and had pay 8. Some bs	-1
I thought that this was the larger size skein because the description said ECONOMY but it turned out being the regular size skein (I didn't know the size by ounces at the time). Just so everyone will know... I would of never paid over $7.00 for what I could of got for $3.00 at Walmart. My bad!	-1
I liked the product but have discoverd it was wsyyyyy overpriced!!!	-1
This yarn should not be called "glow" anything.  It is misleading.  I would not have purchased it had I known it does not glow.	-1
This yarn was way to small for the money	-1
I ordered because it stated it was light grey. It's more silver and does not match a light grey I was already working with.	-1
It was terrible.  It consisted of very rough yarn that was not in one piece skeins - in three or four foot pieces periodically throughout.  Very disappointed.  Have used super saver for years and never bought such inferior yarn.  Will think twice before buying again.	-1
This yarn is horrible! Color is beautiful and the price is good but I found several small knots and it's extremely fuzzy! I have others by the same brand that are fine but this one is awful	-1
I have bought this yarn previously (Aran) and was satisfied.  I recently bought two skein and found them totally flawed.  Consistanly varied as to the width, the twist and one skein was knotted twice.  I will never again purchase Red Heart 4 ply again.  Where was the quality control? On to another brand.  Milli	-1
Very expensive small skein of yarn.	-1
Description said 364 yard., What I received is 235 yards this is not what I paid for	-1
It is not like the color pictured.  I was disappointed.  If you're not looking for a perfect color match it's okay.	-1
Way over priced for one small skein of yarn. I thought it was the jumbo with a charge of over 7 dollars a skein	-1
i was disappointed as both skeins of yarn had some yarn unraveled, and all knotted.	-1
stripes to far apart could not use it	-1
Horrible yarn. Inconsistent from skein to skein; some will be relatively soft and okay to work with, and the next will be much thicker and rougher, which will cause gauge to be inconsistent. The rougher texture will also be uncomfortable to work with. There is good reason this yarn is cheaper than others. Go for a better yarn and you will enjoy working your project much more, and the end result will be far superior.	-1
I ordered 10 skeins of this yarn and every skein has two to three places where they had tied it together.  I cannot use it for certain projects I wanted to because of that.	-1
BUYER BEWARE. Right in the middle of this skein was a knot with frayed ends. As in, they two two length of yarn and tied them together. So, halfway through a piece that was to be a gift, I have a knot.	-1
Not as soft as others I've bought in the past.	-1
Over priced for product	-1
Overpriced for the size, this product can be found at Wal-Mart for half the price, when I read economy size for 8 bucks would have been a good price if it was in fact economy size which it is not	-1
Way too expensive. When I saw supersaver I thought it would be a larger skein. Can buy that in the stores here for half the price.	-1
I called red heart and complained about the inferior quality of this yarn.  Red heart apologized and I am waiting for a new supply of it to come to market	-1
I'm not a fan of this brand of yarn, I won't buy it again, but that is just my personal preference. It snags and unravels a lot more that the yarn I am used to.	-1
This particular skein of yarn was SO thin compared to others of the same exact brand.	-1
I picked this color due to description "Measures 364-yards length" yet only 236. I cannot do the project I needed it for with this yardage.	-1
The color is NOT shocking pink - it's more of a boring mauvey-rose pink.  If I had known the true color I wouldn't have ordered this yarn :(	-1
This is usely a good yarn for price. I pitched 3. The first one was really nice when I started on my blanket. Half way through it was not twisted as well as at the beginning but still it was fine. The other two was separating and catching on the crochet hook. I was making a baby blanket but because of the separating of the yarn I decided to make it a smaller blanket for my grandaughters dolls. I would not buy this again because of the time you lose when it splits on the hook and the stitches are not always smooth.	-1
I have made a lot of afghans in my many  years of crocheting but always used Red Heart wool and I thought I was getting wool this time. The  texture of this yarn was very loose stitches and split a lot.. I need to make another one after this and hope I can go back to wool.	-1
Only 364 yds, for the price($7 +} I was expecting the 744 yd skein. I don't know if this is an error or not.	-1
This comes up when searching for glow in the dark but doesn't glow at all	-1
The yarn came without any protection.  It has several dirty spots on the yarn.  Very disappointed!	-1
This shade was a completely different size yarn than the other red heart super saver colors I bought. Much thicker and coarser. Ruined my project.	-1
I will never buy this again. It continually unraveled and falls apart. You get what you pay for.	-1
Over priced	-1
THIS IS NOT SUPER SAVER ECONOMY YARN LIKE IT SAYS!!! It is the smaller size! Now I have to order the same amt to have enough!	-1
This is the worst yarn I have ever used.  I have used many different colors of red heart yarn, they make great hats, slippers etc.  however this color was so stiff.  The hand warmers I made are rough, going to try washing and drying with a softener to see if they can be used.  I have no idea why this one color or dye lot is so bad.  I can't say don't buy this brand as I use a lot of it every year, just wish there was a way to return it to red heart or at least an explanation.	-1
This yarn is SUPER scratchy & likes to unravel itself when trying to crochet it.	-1
I paid $9+ for 364 yards of yarn!!!  TOTAL RIPOFF!!  These were supposed to be DOUBLE SIZED skeins!!!  I pay $2.50 for 364 yards at local stores!!!  I want a return label unless I get 2 more skeins, one of each color!!!	-1
This yarn is pieced together. When you try to ball it it unravels, knots and the color is inconsistent. Especially the orange colored ones. Red dye is dropped throughout. It actually looks like someone bled on it. Comparing it to other yarns it isn't soft either. I prefer Vannas choice or Bernat. Do yourself a favor and spend a bit more on quality.	-1
They broke within a couple months. Waste of money. Would have bought metal ones from the start.	-1
Very unhappy with this yarn.  Very scratchy and a lot of knots.	-1
My mistake, when I saw glow, I thought it was glow in the dark yarn	-1
The product appeared to have been used.  The Red Heart label was completely torn from the yarn.  The yarn appeared to have been unwrapped from the center (not the pull out end) and to have been cut -- as the end of the yarn was frayed.	-1
Very small skeins, smaller than I expected  for the price but this was the only place I could find some more of the color I needed so I kept them. Wished the description had listed ounces since that's what I am used to working with.	-1
Cheap and ugly, but I should have known that when I bought it.	-1
This yarn was the worst yarn I ever bought! It  kept separating and also cost twice as much at amazon then it does in a store. I ordered it because the store was out of it and I had a project I was working on. I thought for the price it was a bigger ball of yarn. [O	-1
Over priced!	-1
I usually very happy to buy my yarn here but this specific item came to me yesterday and the colors were faded and off...	-1
The color is the shade of teal I needed, but it is not wool, but acrylic. My project is felted and acrylic will not work.  There was no receipt in the package for me to return it.  I continue to save it in the wrapper if I do receive a recept.	-1
Love the way colors work, but yarn keeps separting. Am used to a much better product from Red Heart. Never had an issue before.	-1
I bought this a few months back to replace an air compressor that came with a airbrush kit from Master so I finial have time to use it, when thin an hour it over heats an shuts down like the old one. I wouldn't buy an air compressor from Master you would be money a head just go to menards an buy one..	-1
bate and switch. what I got twice what I received was not what they listed....	-1
Lots of thin spots, frays easily.  Not the quality I expect from Red Heart.	-1
Definitely "economy" yarn!  Very rough and scratchy to touch. Great if you are crocheting patterns like baskets where you need the extra stiffness to hold a shape. Terrible for items you would wear.	-1
Lots of weak spots on this. The regulator has no support, other than a flimsy fitting. those fittings, are non-standard, so if you break it, good luck finding a new one. At least they mention that in the manual.  Its louder than I thought it would be. Not horrible, but on par with my chinese air pump that came with our laser.  Ours came with the reg snapped off and rolling around. Returned, found another compressor on amazon, with a bigger tank and a better noise level ( amzn.to/1oXRkuK ) and with the same reg as above ( amzn.to/1QVxiHL ) we should be good to go.	-1
This yarn is a great color, but the quality isn't great. It's a little thick and course which makes it hard to work with. I didn't expect much better for the price.	-1
It was not quite what I was looking for	-1
Just move on to a better or higher quality unit, and a Quality Seller besides TCP Global. Item is not the same one pictured, bait and switch. Regulator/dryer needed a new fitting from other seller before it would mount right and not leak air, and I still think it reads wrong pressure. Compressor stinks, and gets hot so it will seize in a short amount of time. Package arrived damaged ( outer shipping box, and factory packaging ) So I expect right after TCP Global return time limit runs out, so will this compressor.	-1
Ok	-1
Broke down already. Water trap failed, pushed water straight by trap directly into hose mixing with paint. Cannot replace water trap separately  , so the unit is junk. That's what you get when you buy a compressor for $100.	-1
Yarn is good quality, but from the photo I thought the platoon is white, grey, and black. Instead the coloring was in the beige and brown family.	-1
First, the moister trap does not screw all the way on. There is a leak some wear.  The compressor turns on when your not even using the airbrush about every 2 or 3 minutes. The gauge is wrong. On max pressure the air comes out about 25psi.	-1
Yarn	-1
Bought this to decorate for my sons street art dance hoping for more glow. However there was not a lot of  glowing coming off this yarn. Did look neat latticed across the ceiling but white would have done the job just as well. Two stars for being a great product, strong, well packaged just not much 'glow'.	-1
I cannot use this yarn. It started to shred as soon as I tried to cast off.	-1
Has a terrible feel	-1
