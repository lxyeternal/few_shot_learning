I'm old, and so is my computer.  Any advice that can help me maximize my computer perfomance is very welcome.  MaximumPC has some good tips on computer parts, vendors, and usefull tests	1
There's nothing to say, but if you want a REAL men's magazine, this is it. They have great articles and stories, and I love the bits of knowledge that starts the Know & Tell section, and I love the last page, which has an interview with a celebrity. Just get this magazine and forget all the other mature men's mags.	1
If you're the kind of man who looks at himself in a full length mirrror every morning, this is the magazine for you. If you think the car you drive defines you, the clothes you wear are the measure of your self-worth, the watch on your wrist tells the value of you as a person, and the woman you're seen with is a measure of your rank in society- you need this magazine. Other men- who might value human relationships- may profitably give it a pass.	-1
Nothing to it.  Just an advertisement.  Little article content.	-1
When PC Magazine ceased publication of their paper magazine, I began to look for a replacement, and I found it in this magazine. This magazine covers the latest information in the field of computers and related technology. Some of my favorite sections are:  White paper - In this section a technology is explained. For example, in the last issue I read how AES secures your data.  Doctor - This section answers user questions. I always seem to find some very useful information here.  Features - Presents feature articles on timely subjects.  News - Presents the latest news in the field.  Reviews - Here the magazine reviews various tech gear and rates them with a rating system from one to ten.  Overall, I have been pleased with the coverage of the computer field that this magazine presents.	1
Details is much less indepth / informative as GQ or Esquire.  The articles are shorter in length and not as journalistic. Articles are more about lifestyles and less about sports / women and cars.  With reveiews that are typically a few paragraphs long.  The magazine itselfs seems geared towards a younger male and a more metrosexual lifestyle. The price is right and for $10 it a great investment as you most likely find a few things each month of interest.	1
In my mind BEST PC Magazine for upgrades / hardware info, tips . tricks, etc. Great Price	1
Maximum PC is a magazine for electronics freaks, offering many different articles about electronics; how to buy them, how to repair them, how to get the most out of them, and how best to replace them. This magazine is aimed in one primary direction: Making the most out of the electronic devices available. This is accomplished through the many instructional articles, how to guides, and question and answer sessions.  When Maximum PC isn't offering words of wisdom on ways to improve your life with electronics, the magazine is usually offering reviews of new products. The reviews section is one of the largest parts of each issue and while it does a nice job bringing new products to the forefront, the reviews are often less than stellar. Rather than analyze a few products in- depth, Maximum PC instead prefers to offer shorter reviews of many products. This part of the magazine seems more concerned with quantity than quality, in contrast to most of the remainder of the magazine.  One thing about Maximum PC that isn't to my liking is the technical nature of many articles. Maximum PC likes to get to the root of things (literally), and it is common to find articles talking about circuits, memory, and other boring subjects. This is fine for those who take their technology to the extremes, but I have no interest in learning about the inter-workings of the wiring inside my personal computer or the electronic pulses that cause my printer to respond on queue. This is a little too much technology for me, but I know there are some readers who will relish the depths that Maximum PC goes to when it strips down electronic devices into their component parts.  Overall, Maximum PC is a pretty good electronics magazine for young and middle- aged adults. It loses me from time to time when it gets overly technical, but it still ranks as a good magazine about electronics. The numerous question and answer sessions, the educational articles, and the product reviews make this a magazine worth reading.	1
Maximum PC's slogan is Maximum PC. Minimum BS. Well I think they should make that, Half PC. Half BS. If you buy your subscription on here, you're not getting the CD, which is obviously, the whole essence of the mag. The CD is done just like PC Gamer, but it just has Maximum PC on there, instead of PC Gamer, and this also means, if your PCG CD's won't auto-load, neither will the MPC ones. Since I can't see what the price is for the subscription on here, I cant tell if you're paying the same amount on here for the no CD sub, as you would with the CD. CD sub. price is $29.95. You can obviously look at the top of the page, and see what the price is. The one good thing they have is the Head 2 Head thing they have in the beginning, where they pit two products against each other. This month it was Yahoo! Mail vs. Hotmail. So this really isn't a great magazine, nor a good PC magazine (no pun). If you want a real independent magazine, go with PC Magazine. (And for more on that, read my review...if it ever gets posted).	-1
I love glamour mag. I have read it for over 25 years. The articles are most always good and some of the clothes are beautiful.	1
This magazine has a lower cover price than some of its competitors, and makes up for it with a massive amount of ads. A few ads contain coupons, for those that like to cut those little things out (unfortunately they are hardly ever for anything I want !). The paper is also a lot thinner than the higher priced home/garden publications, and the photographs do not reproduce that well on it. On the bright side, there are many nice d&eacute;cor ideas, and simply terrific recipes. Taking the October 2003 edition as an example, Fall colors and produce are the theme. It has some ideas on how to display gourds, and an article on a community pumpkin patch, from the June planting by 140 neighbors and friends in a 6000 square ft. area, to harvest time. There are numerous articles on remodeling, "Foolproof Potted Plants", on the joys of having hardy succulents in your home, and a lovely piece with lots of photographs on actor Peter Strauss' gorgeous Ojai, California garden. The best article of all, is "The Magic of Soup", and some of these recipes are so good they might end up in your family for generations. They are simple to prepare, with easy to find ingredients, and will make a healthy, hearty meal for those frosty days ahead. Also included with the recipes is the preparation and cooking time, and nutritional statistics. As someone who writes a lot of notes and cards, I appreciate the final page which is about letter writing, and how this vanishing form of communicating is good for the soul. All things considered, this magazine gives good value, and is meant for those of us who do not live in a mansion or have hours to devote to a single recipe.	1
Having the honor of being one of those people that subscribe to numerous magazines, I find that I am the perfect person to review the subscriptions because I was getting such a large amount to my door. I have kept Better Homes and Garden because it is consistent with it's articles, gardening hints and recipes (both pratical and precise). This one is well worth the money, and I know it isn't as expenisive as some of the others that I subscribe to. I also would recommend "Country Living" and "House & Garden" in addition to this one. Happy Reading	1
If you are looking for ideas for that next decorating project, more than likely you can find at least one article each month to inspire you. With a focus on friends and family, gardening, interior design, building, family matters, flood, good health and shopping, you can't go wrong!  I like the "Yours for the Asking" section where you can send away a postcard for more information instead of contacting each company.  For mom's, the "kids project" section will be amusing and your kids will love the ideas.  The cartoons are also cute and I had to laugh at the one that said: "Of course I love you. Didn't you get my fax?"  Something about the pictures in this magazine always remind me of a bright sunny day. The open kitchens and lush gardens are just a treat to see.  The recipe section really has a personality all of its own. The "Petite Caramel Apple" recipe they had in the September 2001 issue was so adorable!  I look forward to every issue!  ~The Rebecca Review	1
I buy this for my husband because he never thinks to buy it for himself since he hates shopping. But anyway, it has articles to help him at the gym, health information from a guys perspective, and workout routines he can adapt for his own use.  I find it entertaining and there is always something you can learn about the way men think and react to situations.  A magazine with a real personality.  ~The Rebecca Review	1
I love the magazine, but the sale adds are starting to take up half the magazine.	1

Great articles .. i like looking at the photos. They are inspiring. Nice variations on same old workouts	1

Husband loves the magazine! Lots of good info, can be repetitive but maybe sometimes we need those reminders	1
Another great magazine. Once again I have not received my magazines since I moved. I put in a change of address.	1
For me, Glamour magazine is one of the best mags on the market today because it always contains up-to-date information in well-written articles accompanied by great photos.	1
The item came in excellent conditions, well packed, very nice NEW, no defect, as i expected. . . . .	1

Great gift for the science lover. Good variety of articles and pictures. Awesome for new technology thats ever changin	1
I've always enjoyed having an "easy read" magazine around the house. I can flip through it while watching TV, etc. I have subscribed to several Amazon magazine deals, and have had no problem turning off the "auto subscribe" choice. We'll see if I have the same luck here. The only reason this didn't get 5 stars was because this mag has a lot of info for parents & about kids. I'm retired, so it doesn't apply to me.	1
For any living space.	1
I get a lot of magazines.  A lot.  Very few get read through completely for obvious reasons; time, many other mags to read, not interested in ALL the content.  This is one I read through each and every month, along with Parents, TV Guide and Readers Digest.  It has great articles that appeal to almost everyone, humor, great advice, etc.  I really enjoy it and usually read it as soon as it arrives!	1
One of my favorite magazines	1
super cheap subscription and easy to read layout on my kindle fire hd	1
This is not a perfect magazine. For one, I was a charter subscriber when it first came out. I get the print and iPad edition. That has been awhile. While I have gotten older the magazine has stayed stuck at the same age. While I am now in an older demographic that its numbers are huge, it is pretty much ignored now. Surely I am not the only fifty year old guy in good shape, or who is interested in being and staying that way. Maybe a mens health plus. Anyway you get used to that sort of thing. One reviewer said all you need is one year of this magazine and it will cover everything. That could be true sort of, but I like it for the ideas, motivation, and it has some really cool food stuff, and recipes. I get mens health, and I got womens health for the misses. The stories and info do not overlap. Most times I find womens health a better magazine. Womens health also suffers from the agest problem. They think their readers don't get older. If they follow their magazines fitness programs they should get older.. right?	1
I love Glamour!  This has to be my favorite magazine of all times!  Granted the ads drive me nuts but I love the Do and Don'ts and all the clothes.  I am a shopping mogul!  This magazine is great for showing new trends and I love layering and almost always they are showing new ways of layering clothes and teaching you how to wear your clothes in a different exciting way.  I also enjoy the articles and life lessons as there is always something that I am interested in.  I read Glamour almost from cover to back!  I rarely skip articles!  If you like fashion and just articles on every life issues this magazine is for you!  **I have noticed a change over the last year in the magazine, but it is not terrible.**	1
Excellent content and diversity in material	1
happy grandmother	1
I have subscribed to Glamour every year! I love the features about careers and relationships most -- although I also do love the beauty and fashion columns. Women in their twenties and thirties should all read Glamour. It is smart, sassy, sexy and entertaining! Subscribe today!	1

I love the magazine and the price is right...When I am done with it; I pass it on to my mom and she passes it to her neighbors....Thank you much for having such a great magazine....We all enjoy it....	1
The Handyman magazine is both my husband's and my favorite wood magazine!!  It not only contains some patterns, it has a lot of articles:  tips on how to make things work better, tips on cleaning things like brushes.  It contains a lot of information that both my husband and I use weekly in some way or another!!  My subscription is good through 2023!!  Love it!!  Thank you!	1
very resourceful!	1
this magazine has definitely had some updates in the last few years, and the style and projects are great. Their website also features some fantastic guest writers/bloggers. I would recommend if the styles featured are your style.	1
Very nice magazine with great articles!!	1

Nice magazine for great ideas in home and my garden!!!  A bit too much advertising...... But otherwise enjoyable	1

Great magazine.  Filled with very pretty pictures and great ideas.  You might not have a home, but it offers great hints for those who would like to make their space feel more like one.  Very happy with this purchase.  You will be as well.	1
This is a throwaway five dollar subscription for me. I take it to the gym to flip through on the treadmill and leave for someone else to do the same with. The pages aren't glossy and pretty like with other home magazines and the articles/ideas are typically a few months behind the better home magazines. But the price is right so I can't complain too much.	1
Lots of useful tips and instructions.  Even though you may never build many of the projects, this magazine is full of ideas, knowledge, short cuts, and useful information.	1
Bottom-Line: I have come to the conclusion the "Men's Health" is not written for me.  The world of men's magazines is festooned with glossy covers adorned with half dressed woman and mostly vapid content geared toward the more Neanderthal and or juvenile among us.  In a world filled with Maxim and Stuff magazines, "Men's Health" magazine stands out as a periodical with some substance, style and intellect, but after reading the latest issue I am certainly not sold.  And what is with all of the lists?  I had been meaning to pick up an issue of "Men's Health Magazine" for quite some time when I picked up a copy--the October 2007 issue--while shopping for a computer manual at Borders.  The cover--as they always tend to do--featured a rather buff Jason Statham and article titles in big bold letters designed to catch the attention of that man looking for advise on Six-Pack ABS, or how to Dress for More Sex, or how to Eat Better and Think Smarter, or (my favorite) read what 1,293 Sexy Women Confess What They Want in Bed.  "Men's Health Magazine," whose tag line is Tons of Useful Stuff, was founded in 1987 and is published 10 times a year by the Rodale Inc.  The magazine began publishing in the United Kingdom in 1995.  Today "Men's Health Magazine" is published in 36 editions worldwide, distributed to 48 countries, and enjoyed a (2005) U.S. circulation of some 1.8 million.  The problem with "Men's Health" is that there is very little useful information to be found with the fold of the magazine despite it daunting size.  Most of the articles are snippets of information stuck between far too many glassy advertisements featuring young male models in clothing I would never wear and probably couldn't afford.  Same for the automobiles.  To be sure there was one rather lengthy article in the issue I read, but it was about dogs of all things!  The article I wanted to have some substance--a snippet on Michelle Ryan, the new Bionic Woman--was barely a page in length; how disappointing.  And yes there was a snippet or two about healthy food, but nothing I didn't already know.  And the lists, there are endless lists of thing we can do to improve this or that, mostly dealing with self-image and sex; there are very few actually devoted to well, men's health.  Has our attention span grown so short that we must now condense or leisure reading into bullet points; endless lists that tell us how to live our lives?  I have come to the conclusion the "Men's Health" is not written for me, a man in the middle of his life, settled, with a family, a regular job, with far too little time work workout, and far too little money to afford the rich life-style pimped by the magazine.  There is little practical information inside the glossy innards of "Men's Health" at least from my perspective.  Perhaps if I were young, rich, hip, the magazine would appeal to me, but I am none of those things, so...By the way what is the deal with all the lists?  Oh I already asked that question, I am still waiting for an answer.	-1
I think it is a good magazine.	1
Love this magazine and so do the two co-workers who got a one year subscription to it. I like the idea of getting a present with purpose that keeps giving long after the festivities have ended. Ordering and adding their individual shipping information was easy.	1
Love!	1
Did not like this magazine, to much advertisements	-1
Love to read the articles and recipes!  Loved to read mom's subscription growing up and now I've given it to my daughters.  Three generations of readers....	1

Just what I was looking for!	1
You can tell a lot about the readership a men's magazine is trying to reach by scanning the first three car ads. In the issue in front of me, they flog the Lincoln MKZ, Range Rover Sport, and Audi A6.  There you have it. We're going for the affluent but not super-rich young guy who won't even become aware that the Lincoln Town Car and Audi A8 exist until he turns 55.  Well, 52 maybe.  But you didn't need the cars to figure out MEN'S HEALTH.  It's about what all men think about and what affluent guys with six-pack abs (in reality or in their dreams) can generally snag: expensive suits, beautiful women who seem never not to pout, and beefy arms to set off those abs.  To be fair, there is actually a fair amount of *health* under discussion in these pages. But I doubt that's the main reason guys pull this magazine off the shelf instead of, say, DOG FANCIERS.  In spite of an irritating habit of treating women as trophies to be won or dupes to be lured, there is a good bit of wit in here about what one might call the manly dilemma in the modern world. And if it really is lack of *just* the right workout regimen that has kept you from getting all that's on offer in MEN'S WORLD, well, there's at least one new workout each month that will cure all that ails you.  Don't mistake this monthly for serious journalism. But you won't need a brown paper bag to carry it out of the store either.  I kind of like it.	1
love the price and its a good magazine	1

Love the print magazine that I have subscribed to for many years and given as gifts.  Now the "free KINDLE " magazine is charging me again? I don't think it's right to be charged twice!!! and to try to get the magazine subscription manager for help is ridiculously difficult. Not worth my time but I am not going to pay for the kindle edition.  I have to cancel all my magazine subscriptions and buy them from the the publisher, Hello Amazon.	-1
Perfect	1
I have been reading Better Homes and Gardens for many years and have always checked the mail for my latest issue and now check my Kindle HD7 first! I have been married 46 years, raised 3 children, taking care of our home for all these years using so many ideas and gaining so much information for all from Better Homes and Gardens. Thank you Kindle for giving me another way to read my favorite magazine!	1
Husband loves this magazine, he looks forward to every month getting his new addition.	1
I have to admit, I'm more into BH&G for the "gardening" end of things, but I always find something in every issue that makes me rethink my aversion to redecorating/renovating my house in a huge way. The magazine is mostly ads, but the content is always interesting, the photos are always beautiful, and there really is *so* much to every issue- everything from home decor to gardening basics and beyond to day-to-day life.  It's one of my favorite magazines, I just wish they had less ads (and pesky inserts- I have to shake the magazine as soon as I get it to get all the inserts out) and MORE of their fabulous content.	1
I love the different aspects of Better Homes and Garden and have it renewed until 2015!  This is a class magazine.	1
great ideas	1
I really enjoy the magazine because of the interesting decorating, recipes and items that are new and you may want.	1
Pleased with subscription.	1
Love the Better Homes and Gardens magazine. Makes me wish I owned a house with a nice garden. But reading this mag lets me dream.	1

Better Homes has up to date, yet practical ideas for the home: decorating, family living, food preparation, gardening, and easy on the budget projects.	1

I order this magazine for me and one of my daughter-inlaws.  We both enjoy the recipes and the decorating tips.  I pass mine along to a friend when I finish and she gives it to a group once she reads it.	1
I still like the magazine BHG; however, I wasn't pleased with your service especially when it came to renewing subscriptions.  It seemed to be too much of my time spent on the computer and sorting through all my subscriptions as to what was renewed, the cost, etc.	1
Have subscribed to this magazine for years.  Now that my vision is poor, I order it for my daughter in law and she looks forward to it's arrival each month.	1
I think that in terms of overall content presented, 'Conde Nast Traveler' is the best travel magazine currently on the market. Some other reviewers have raised some valid points concerning article length, and bias toward upscale properties. I think that there are other magazines that might be more suitable for others, including 'Budget Travel' and 'National Geographic Traveler', both of which I also subscribe to and enjoy, though they both have their limitations and issues as well. So what sets 'Conde Nast' apart? I think it is the willingness to find new and exciting vacation destinations that are still reasonable enough to get to as to make them worthwhile to a large audience. Some of the more exotic magazines have great articles on hiking in Tibet and the like, but how many people are really able to do that (or can afford to do it?) My point is that although it is by no means perfect, I think the editors and writers do consciously strike a balance between the too mundane and too exotic (and expensive) and attempt to focus the majority of the magazine in that area. This is just too good of a magazine to pass up. The 'Deals of the Month' section alone justifies the price. Of all the travel magazines I read on a monthly basis (currently four) 'Conde Nast Traveler' is my favorite and I highly recommend it.	1
I used to subscribe to well over 16 Magazine Publications I trimmed back to only subscribing to 3 in the last 3 years well this one I added recently. Wonderful pictures, articles that are interesting and informative. You can tell when a magazine is good when you pick it up repeatedly to read. I save all of these magazines to share with friends and associates. I don't find it to be on the "high end" I think they have enough information in each issue for everyone. I also agree with what one of my fellow reviewers stated this magazine hasn't been bogged down with advertisements yet, so therefore you are definately getting enough articles, reports, money saving tips and reader comments to fill up these pages. It is well worth the money and I have renewed twice now.... and that coming from someone who is VERY selective of what Magazine publications come to my door is a HUGE Compliment. Respectfully Reviewed	1
Great magazine	1
I love  this magazine!	1
Great magazine for women of all ages. Good recipes and ideas and articles. This was a gift and they loved it.	1
Love this mag and so do the people that come into my work. I see it is often one of the most picked to read.	1
Excellent mag for teen boys.	1
This is a quick read magazine.  I usually get some sort of idea from each issue.  I do get tired of white walls, though (their go-to wall standard in the featured homes) and I'm never gonna be a decorative spend hours on food and crafts kind of mom - but there are some decorating ideas i use.  So long as i never have to pay more than a dollar an issue, i'll keep ordering it.	1
I like this magazine and I am a guy! It gives me just enough tips and ideas to keep the place looking good. I don't use any cooking or recipe ideas as I cannot cook! I love the Amazon auto renewal because I can ignore all the renewal notices that come in the mail.	1
I like all of the articles and ideas in BH&G. There are always beautiful pictures and descriptive articles as well as resources. I also like that they feature many of my favorite bloggers and some new ones for me to check out.	1
One of the most handy magazines that I get!  Every issue is full of tips and ideas that make my home improvement projects easier and less complicated.  I can't tell you how much I have learned from reading this magazine and I just renewed my subscription thru 2017!  Today is September 4, 2014!	1
This has always been a favorite magazine because of it's beautiful photography, good recipes, and decorating ideas.  (Stay away from auto-renewal if you don't like surprises! ) Highly recommended	1
what i wanted	1
I started receiving Better Homes (BH) last year sometime as a free subscription.  I never signed up for it or sent anything in, it just started arriving on a free trial basis for about 6 months.  BH is not something I would normally think of subscribing too, but for free, I thought why not.  However it wasn't long before the magazine would arrive in the mail and it would either be flipped through for a couple of minutes and then trashed, or just trashed outright.  It truly was that uninteresting to me. I subscribe to about 4 other magazines and this is the only one I didn't think was worth it, even for free.  The magazine is thick and heavy, but its all Ads.  I mean this magazine starts out with 20 pages of Ads before you even get to the table of contents.  The other reviewer here that talked about it being aggravating the way you have to navigate through all the ADs, cards, and other offers to find the few articles that there are is absolutely right.  A 3 page article can be spread out over a dozen pages just because of the Ads.  The price of this magazine is certainly cheap enough.  On the surface it appears a downright bargain.  But the whole saying about getting what you pay for applies here for sure.  For some folks it may still be worth it of they happen to be the type that enjoy looking at and reading a bunch of glossy Ads.  If you're one of those types,BH is right up your alley.  For the rest of us that enjoy genuine articles and less fanfare, my suggestion is pass up Better Homes...	-1
Too expensive for my taste!	-1
When I was in my 20's I do not think these magazine would have been for me.  But now that I am a home owner with a family I love to look through it!  I guess different things are exciting now:)  What I like about the magazine is that it has a lot of areas they cover, from recipes, to crafting, to everything for the home.  It is not quite Martha Stuart fancy,more like "the real woman's Martha Stuart!). <a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Voice-Lessons-To-Go-v-1-4-The-Complete-Set/dp/B0019HBVFQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Voice Lessons To Go v. 1-4 The Complete Set</a>	1

Texas Monthly Magazine is a magazine about a state, its places, and its people. This publication covers Texas culture, travel, music, arts, dining, special events, and more. Each issue takes readers on a journey throughout the state and keeps them up to date on the Lone Star State and her people.  Texas Monthly Magazine has more departments than the typical magazine and many of them are fun to read, offering a quick look inside a lesser- known town, festival, or individual that calls Texas home. A good example is the department titled Street Smarts. This short section offers a glimpse inside one of Texas' thousands of small towns along with a numbered list of special points of interest in the city. The music and books departments are fun, too, because they present some popular and soon- to- be- popular media from Texas residents. Another department I like for its pleasant amusement is one called the Manual. It presents something Texas- related in the areas of fashion and style and then offers some advice on the best usage or display of the item based on Texas culture.  Texas Monthly Magazine offers several long, featured articles and they can usually be found starting in the middle of each issue and continuing all the way to about the three- quarter mark. These longer featured articles can focus on most anything, from travel to art to food, to the people who create the art and prepare the food.  There are usually at least a few current event- type articles related to something important in the news while the other featured articles include stories about people, events, etc., that are generally timeless.  Texas Monthly Magazine is a well- written, well- edited magazine and it a nice reference and reading tool for Texas residents who like to learn more about the state and find new places to visit and things to try. I like having it handy, but if I could change one thing about this magazine, it would be the number of ads in each issue. True, all magazines need advertisements in order to generate reveune, but the number of ads in Texas Monthly Magazine is a tad excessive. Each issue opens up with about eighteen pages of ads before even reaching the table of contents. The next hundred or so pages have ads on every other page and the ads only diminish when you get to one of the featured articles. After that, the ads return for the remainder of the issue, with the final thirty to fifty pages consisting of practically nothing but ads.  Going back to the positive points, another reason to like Texas Monthly is the long length of each issue. The magazine is much longer than most, with some issues approaching 300 pages in length. Yes, the ads are excessive, but even if all the ads were removed, you would still have a very large amount of reading material in each issue- much more than found in the majority of magazines.  Texas is a very large, very diverse state with many things to offer and Texas Monthly is a very enjoyable read that helps Texas residents keep up with some of the many happenings in this great state. The ads are excessive, but when all factors are taken into account, this is still an enjoyable publication that every Texan should read and that many outsiders will enjoy as well.	1
Beautiful ideas	1
Really nice so far. Only saw one issue but lots of nice pics and inspiration.	1
I get lots of magazines and I do enjoy this one.	1
My house isn't beautiful but I can dream. This subscription helped me create a nice idea book for the day I can afford a beautiful house.	1
Its a mag.	1
LOVE THIS! LOVE THIS! LOVE THIS!	1
clients love it	1
Got this for my Sister for a gift.  Out of all the magazines I got her, this is one of her favorites.	1
It's important to understand that this magazine isn't about budget travel.  It's for people who travel for business, where a corporation is paying, and for those who can afford to travel luxuriously for pleasure, at least occasionally.  I love reading about exotic destinations, the top spas and bath experiences in the world, and amazing travel experiences.  It has gorgeous photography, interesting articles, and solid information.  Even if I can't afford to take trips like this every year, I still want to read about them.  If I'm going to take a once-in-a-lifetime trip I'll want to know just where to say and what to do.  When I went to Florida I stayed in budget places except for the last night, when we went to the Hotel Fontainebleau on Miami Beach, which was wonderful.  It's important to know and decide when to save money and when it's worth it to splurge.  I almost gave my subscription up because with physical disabilities it's unlikely I can do a lot of travel.  But I still want to dream about it.  I'd love a travel magazine that included information about vacation travel ideas for those of us who can't walk or stand for hours.  So many travel articles urge the traveler to get out and walk, but that isn't possible for all of us.  Conde Nast is a lot less likely to urge long impossible hikes on me than National Geographic Traveler.	1
Conde Nast Traveler is a very good magazine that offers alot in the way of inspiration for some travel places to consider for a personalized travel itinerary.  The following are some of the strong features of the February 2011 issue of Conde Nast Traveler:  1)There is the top 80 cruise ships in the world that are featured such as the Disney Magic (ranked #1 for  Mega ships), the Seven Seas Voyager (ranked #1 for Large Ships), River Beatrice (ranked #1 for River Ships), and the Seabourn Odysesy (ranked #1 for small ships). 2) The outdoors life of Scotland: there are is a beautiful picture of the River Nith. 3) There is a very unique picture of the lodging that is called the Igloo Rooms, of the Hotel Arctic (it is located in Hulissat, Greenland).  This magazine is worth it to get if you love traveling and/or you want to get your creativity flowing on some of the plans that you intend to incorporate for your trips.	1
I love it. It gives a lot of great ideas. thanks	1
I enjoy this magazine very much  And especially this one on COLOR.  My home is a multi-colored...with many rooms having walls with different but compatible colors.  Somehow it works.  As does this magazine.	1
Price is great, but...Instead of the most current issue arriving first, I received back issues more than 2 months after they hit the news stands.  If this counts towards my 12 issues, I will not renew.	-1
This magazine never seems to tire on producing beautiful pictures and ideas for the decorator in some of us non professionals.  The price is so affordable.	1
Informative.	1
Fast Delivery. Great Product!	1
I bought this magazine for my husband and I to enjoy. He loves the magazine and always finds at least one project per issue that he wants to do. Sometimes it's a big project and other times it's a tiny project.  I enjoy this magazine as well, although since I'm less handy, I rarely feel confident enough to make the projects on my own. It's still a pleasant read though, and still has good ideas. Plus, I usually find at least one product mentioned in each issue that I didn't know about before and that I want to locate at a hardware store and buy. So, in terms of making me aware of products that I didn't know existed, this magazine is helpful.  My husband has already requested that I renew our subscription :).	1
Love this magazine and would definitely recommend to anyone who is into interior design. Advice and articles on color furniture. Definitely get excited when this comes in the mail.	1
At the risk of inverting priorities, let me begin this review with a word of disclosure about the reviewer:  I love travel, am on the road half the time for professional reasons, travel to all the continents, have lived on three of them for extended periods of time, and nurture a quiet reservation about people who 'get to know' faraway places by the convenience of a short visit to an affluent resort.  However, I have also seen both the good that tourism has done for local economies and the blinkered understanding of the world too often suffered by those who cannot or choose not to travel. So my reluctance should not be construed as resentment.  OK, enough of that. Given these caveats about high-end travel, Cond Nast can be a fascinating read. Some of it ('Escape from the Airport. Passenger power saves the day', Dec 2006) is valuable for air travelers on almost any budget.  Yet the *real* value of this magazine will be mined by those whose circumstances allow them to travel anywhere they want. For that kind of affluent tourist, Cond Nast can be a gold mine of opportunities that would otherwise be overlooked.  In my judgement, TRAVEL AND LEISURE beats CONDE NAST TRAVELER by a nose in this sector's competition, but either one will do you. If you had, say, five years of high-end travel in front of you, you'd do well to toss in some coins for subscriptions to both.  Frequent travelers on a business or economy budget are likely to hold out for browsing in the dentist office waiting room or - as I do - snagging subscriptions to both via frequent flyer miles.  Bon voyage!	1
Got this magazine for my brother-in-law who is an amazing fix-it guy around the house.  He has told me multiple times how much he loves this magazine.  It gives him an update on products and tools, and directions and tips for different projects.  I would characterize him as an experienced handyman and he still gets lots out of these issues.  He's already asked me to renew his subscription so it doesn't skip an issue when his runs out!	1
This is the best magazine I have seen for great advice for homeowners and common repairs around the home. There has never been an issue that I read that I didn't learn at least one thing. A great magazine for the new homeowner or a great house warming gift.	1
love decorting, and updating the "look" in our home......  this magazine keep my creative mind alive  ..... will keep on reading !!!	1
US weekly is better thanPeople is now.  I subscribed to P for many years.  Then it changed and Ilove this magazine.	1
I have always liked House Beautiful. I got it for a good price so was really happy with this purchase.	1
The mark of a good magazine might be having a good editor. Newell Turner is excellent as an editor! I find myself frequently agreeing with him about almost everything.  I love the following things about House Beautiful: the organization and logical, recurring placement of articles the themes the "I love my Bed" article the instant color palette article the color articles the "I'm looking for a..." article the low price  The only thing I would change would be to potentially print this magazine on a higher quality paper. This stuff is not great for clipping out and saving because it is so thin. However, if this paper keeps the subscription price low, then by all means continue to use it!  To summarize, I am one very content subscriber!	1
Wonderful price for the auto renewal on US Weekly!  You can't beat it!	1
I subscribe to this magazine for my husband and both of our sons.  I also read it each month when it arrives because I like to have a general knowledge of home maintenance.  They all read more in depth. The service however was terrible. I finally canceled it because they couldn't get it right. One month we received 3 copies of the same issue.	1
At first I didn't like this magazine at all, and then I decided to give it another try, and I'm glad I did. This is not a magazine to read quickly. It's not jam packed with pictures and how to's etc... and big bold text. The text can be long and there are lots of smaller images - ie treasures tucked inside that if you skim it quickly you will miss. If you are inspired by images of others' works, you will enjoy this read! If you want something you can just look at the pictures and be inspired - probably not for you.	1
Love it.	1
I team-teach interior design classes with designers and one said HOUSE BEAUTIFUL magazine was considered "the bible" in the interior design business.  I love getting it every month.  It features myriad designers, includes eclectic styles, has a "kitchen and bath of the month" section, includes last words by designers on topics, highlights a list of top 10 furniture pieces every month selected by designers representing different price points, and always strives to stay current and fresh.  It's a great way to stay up to date with design trends as well as having classic and traditional styles.  I always find something I like in the magazine each month and learn from it.	1
This gossip rag is such a fun guilty pleasure to thumb through while on the treadmill.	1
I like the helpful tips and the features they do on different products. The how to articles are great and have easy to follow directions. Many great ideas for any homeowner.	1
clients love it	1
waiting room	1
Great magazine for a great price!!!!	1
Great content - we grew up reading this magazine and it endures	1
High price and plenty of junk in it. Cancelling it for sure for my wife and daughter in laws since none of them like it any more	1
House Beautiful has as much quality to offer the reader as many magazines that are at a higher price range; thick glossy pages, superb photography, and for those who need some inspiration for home and garden improvements, a plethora of useful design ideas. I just received my September 2003 issue, and some of the contents are: The interior: A nice "How to" page, with solutions that will fit your pocketbook, and make your home interesting; "Designer Challenge", a new series where experts tackle "problem areas"; a long article on "The Next Wave", profiling twentyfive up-and-coming designers who are "rising stars from coast to coast"; an in-depth look at 4 gorgeous homes: A sparse but elegant Edwardian house in Dallas, a plantation-style house in Georgia, a classic home in the Georgetown area of Washington, D.C., and my favorite, a minimalist, lavishly comfortable duplex in Miami, Florida. The exterior: "Art Imitating Nature", a Phoenix Arizona garden that uses native plants in a way that blends into the architecture. Food: "Fruit Under Fire", a luscious collection of recipes for grilled fruit, with close-up illustrations that are enough to stir up the appetite. Every issue will spark some ideas on how to enhance your surroundings, how to buy on a budget, how to experiment by mixing styles, and much more. I enjoy every issue, and think House Beautiful is one of the best magazine values on the market.	1
This "Family Handyman" magazine is a good choice for the home woodworking hobbyist and also for those that want to learn how to do basic home repairs. I am not "Joe Fix-It" and seriously count myself lucky to still have all my appendages after some bad attempts at working on projects around the house (my wife actually hid some of my tools after the infamous "Strap Wrench incident of '06"), but this magazine has a good selection of projects and ideas that occasionally fall into my skill range.  The magazine is nicely laid-out and is easy to follow the articles and projects. It does have a lot of adds, which is actually not such a bad thing since I like to see new products.  Very experienced handymen will not get a lot out of this, but it is usually helpful to me.  Recommended!  CFH	1
Good articles--never a boring issue!	1
For the price you cannot go wrong.  Were else can you get some decent real paper  (not on the screen crap) in the mail 12 times year.  Thanks for still have real magazines I can actually hold, like a blanky.	1
I like this magazine. It has interesting articles in it most of the time. I enjoy it & recommend it.	1
Bonnier is not my recommendation for a Magazine subscription provider	-1
Love this magazine	1
Entertainment Weekly is pure fluff, and you can get the same celebrity news off any tv talk show or the E!tv network.  It's fun to flip through at the dentist's office, but the subscription cost really isn't worth the money.  Readers who want useful beauty and fashion tips are better off subscribing to Vogue, Marie Claire or Cosmopolitan than EW.  I got my subscription because I had to spend some air miles that were about to expire.  It's okay to flip through, but there is no real substance, and I wouldn't pay money to resubscribe. Save the $$ and get a subscription to PEOPLE if you want to follow celebrities and you'll get better articles as well.	-1
US Weekly is a good magazine.  I like to keep on all the hollywood gossip.  I would encourage people to buy it  You get it once a week and it keeps you up to date.  Charlotte Swincicki	1
I LOVE reading US on my down time.  It is a mindless fun magazine that helps me relax.  I love looking at the outfits the celebrities wear and trying to re-create them with thrift store clothes.  I used to sit and read these with my grandmother and love looking at the pictures, and I am always happy to see US in my mailbox.	1
Excellent Value!	1
I'm a so-so DIY'er.  I try to DIY pretty much everything around the house, not everything turns out too  well.  So that's where I'm coming from, and my opinion of this  magazine is that it's a lot of fun to read.  Interesting, helpful, fun ideas and articles.  Some good tips too.  Nothing earth shattering but not bad.  I feel like this is what my wife must feel like when she reads her fashion magazines.	1
It doesn't take long to get through each issue, so buy it when it is on sale.  But i always learn something from it.  It also showcases new items.  I feel like they work hand-in-hand with the marketers, but it does provide info that i don't get elsewhere.  And the tips from the writers and consumers are actually very helpful.  I like this magazine and look forward to receiving it each month.	1
If you are considering buying this, then you presumably already know that this is no Newsweek or Time magazine.  If you are considering buying this, then chances are you are looking for a light read filled with items from popular culture.  And that it is.  The glossy pages are filled with pictures of beautiful people: actors, singers, models, and reality stars.  Along with all of the sordid (but secretly entertaining) details of their lives.  If that's what you're looking for, you have found it.  I secretly enjoy the Who Wore It Best and Loose Talk (What the Stars Said this Week) features.  This is a fun magazine to read when you are looking to relax and pass a few hours, like at the beach or on an airplane.  Just don't expect to learn any real newsworthy news.  To be honest, I don't typically read this magazine because I personally find People magazine to contain better writing, a better assortment of stories, and better coverage of current events.  But we subscribe to both because my husband prefers this one for having more pictures and lighter reads.  So, if you are considering buying this, my best advice is to consider People instead.	1

I enjoy this magazine for a variety of different do it your self type items and locations where you can find product.  Interesting book	1
Looks interesting	1
This was a gift last year, that he absolutely loved, so when his subscription ran out I got him a new one through amazon.	1
Thought provoking every issue.	1
Not the old Wired. Seems to be focused on clothing and people. Weird, not Wired,	-1
Advertisements	-1
Great read for tech stuff	1
I've received their email newsletter for awhile and loved it. The magazine is even better and even though I'm not a computer wonk they give me information that is useful and understandable.  I'm setting up automatic renewal.	1
Conde Nast editors at Teen Vogue just publsihed an article promoting Anal Sex to Teens... Do you want to support a company that's promoting this stuff?	-1
I am not really big on celebrity magazines that are really tabloids but with glossy pages like People magazine but I must admit to having a soft spot for US Weekly. Yeah it is pure fluff and nothing to be taken remotely seriously however I get my kicks out of some of the articles that are published there. My biggest beef with the rag is that in the latest issue of US Weekly, it only gives a paragraph each to the passings of Johnny Cash and John Ritter who had passed away two weeks ago while they do an entire bloody article on Bennifer Afflopez, the most overexposed and overrated celebrity couple on this entire planet. I found that quite distasteful. Even that tabloid People Magazine gave a couple of pages to both celebrities. What is just as gross is seeing really unattractive celebs in their bathing suits (i.e Avril Lavigne and her guitar player). However I do love the best & worst dressed pages in the back. I love the snide remarks from the weekly guests. I don't care who is the best dressed, it is who is wearing the ugliest outfits that I care. Another celebrity couple I could live without seeing in the pages of US Weekly for the rest of my life...Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston. Oh lordy. The two most boring celebrities known to mankind. And their acting isn't anything to write home about either. If anything, US Weekly makes for good reading material in the bathroom, otherwise it ain't serious journalism that's for sure.	1
Us weekly is mostly about what the stars are wearing and the latest trend on television.  There are some tabloid style photos which are completely tasteless, and I'm not really sure who cares if Brittany Spears had a latte at Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf on 4th street last Wednesday, but mostly it's a fair gossip magazine.  The articles are all really short and definitely without much depth, but most people aren't looking for that when they read Us weekly.  The fashion police is pretty funny; it's just a bunch of comments about star's clothes from a group of people with no real authority on the subject.  Most are comedians or writers, which is probably why it's so funny.  This magazine is definitely a quick read, and I don't feel any smarter when I'm done reading it, but it does keep me up to date on the Hollywood side of pop culture.	1
So many good articles and great information.	1
love my magazine	1
In the July 7 issue... Teen Vogue just published a "how-to" article on "A Guide to Anal Sex". As a parent, it is unbelievable that they think this is okay and reflects the gulf that separates what I believe is appropriate for my teens and what they obviously think it okay. I can no longer trust what my teens find in this magazine. Beware -- the cover makes it look harmless, but it is a wolf in sheep's clothing aimed squarely at your kids.	-1
My customers love this Mag.!	1
been subscribing to this for years= it's a must if you like fashion!	1
Do you like to keep up with what's going on in Hollywood? Are you a die hard fan of stars like Julia Roberts, Drew Barrymore, or N'SYNC? Do you love collecting quality photos of your favorite stars? Then this magazine is for you. Every issue is packed wall to wall with the lastest news on stars from every walk of life, and it's stuffed with top-notch photos. If you are looking for a magazine that not only is great reading, but can eventually turn into a hot collectible, US is for YOU!!!	1
Have been getting magazine for my daughter for the past twenty years because she really enjoys it.	1
Love this magazine.  It always has such interesting articles & short notes about new advancements in science and technology. Thanks.	1
Perfect	1
Well...I bought this for my 17 year old daughter, ironically enough.  I had subscriptions to this magazine as a teenager.  Well, it has most definitely changed and geared more towards a young adult, in my opinion.  Needless to say, I will be grabbing it from the mailbox before she gets her hands on it and will not be auto-renewing it.  When she is old enough to purchase it on her own, that will be her choice.  But, I will not pay for garbage for my 17 year old.	-1
Fun magazine for people visiting LA for more than a day or two of the usual tourist sites. Also good for locals.	1
cancelled	1
My favorite designer magazine. I have been reading Vogue for over 20 years. Couldn't do without.  Cheryl	1
Nice magazine.	1
Top ratings for this magazines for anyone who seeks the latest nightclubs for excitement and social seekers, restaurants and hotels. Also interesting articles of the citizens and celebrities.	1
good solid info for teens. got it for my gdau and read it first for fun. : )	1
I get to see what is happening all over LA without going to LA from food to architecture to people.	1
Best popular mag in publication. It's a diabolically entertaining techie/consumer delight. From the paper gauge to the leading edge of print and type that are engineered to deliver the articles, there is simply no other mag that delivers a higher level of eye-popping "Wow!" month after month.  March 2018 update: It died. They killed it. It was going so good. Then the mag took political sides and conspiracy.	-1
Covers alot of topics.  Just happy that companys still make real magzines that I can pick up, page through, feel, smell, burn if I wish.  Again good magzine with alot of variety of topics.  One complaint would be the reveiws and advertisements are too pricey for 95% of americans.	1
always the finest items to show !!!... elegant	1
I love having this come to my home.  I used to read it only in doctor's offices and want to tear out pages of information.  Hey, if you live in Los Angeles.  It is great to have this subscription.  The restaurant breakdowns and reviews alone are worth it.  Plus you can always find out about new things to do and see.  It's classy and adult.	1
works good, buy lots	1
The item came in excellent conditions, well packed, very nice NEW, no defect, as i expected. . . . .	1
Always some nice photo shoots, though they tend to go back to grungy a bit often for my taste these days.	1
Vogue magazine has been around along time. I've been ordering the magazine since I was 18 years old which is almost 30 years to keep up on trends and the latest designer styles. Except for the 90's the magazine has always been on the top of it's game as far as fashion.  Just renewed another year. I also receive other fashion magazines but Vogue is the only one that I have renewed continuously.	1
As the CEO of a small tech company, there are a few go-to magazines that keep me in the know of what the near-mainstream elements of the industry are thinking, and Wired is on the short list.  Sometimes a bit shallow, it nevertheless offers timely insights and is read by more people than will admit it.  This is a great resource if you are NOT a techie, but need to work with them.  It's written so that even old managers like me can get a modicum of a clue.  Worth the time.	1
My husband says that this and Popular Mechanics are both very good magazines because they inform the reader of the coming trends in their respective fields. My husband is intelligent and great with his hands. He has 4 degrees. He has also rebuilt cars, as well as staying on the cutting edge in electronics "and all that stuff."  This magazine comes highly recommended from "the one I love". He tells no lies. Read and enjoy.	1
"Vogue" magazine  is an interesting publication that covers the various themes of fashion and film. Anne Hathaway, Emma Stone, Halle Berry and Olivia Wilde are among some of the women featured in the December 2012 Vogue issue. There is even a feature on some of the fashions and celebrities featured in the "Les Miserables" film: Anne Hathaway, Amanda Seyfried, Eddie Redmayne, Hugh Jackman, Helena Bonham Carter, Sacha Baron Cohen, and Russell Crowe. "Vogue" magazine is good to get for those who like fashion magazines with clothes representing various time periods.	1
Too many ads	-1
I have been a subscriber for 5 or 6 years now and I always find each issue to be valuable.  SmartMoney strikes a good balance between investment advice/coverage and information/articles that deal with the other aspects of your financial life.  Among the features I look forward to every month: - Ten Things:  a "watch out" list of 10 things that you should know about the different professionals you interact with (your dentist, your accountant, a real estate broker, etc.).  Always an eye-opener. - Stock Screen:  Paul Sturm is a knowledgeable, value-oriented journalist who puts together a list each month of 8-10 stocks that make it through a rigid screen of several characteristics.  Each month, he features a different screen and he uses a good mix of quantitative characteristics and common sense to generate the list. - Feature articles that profile common people and the serious personal finance problems they have endured (e.g., collecting on insurance, fighting the IRS, traveling overseas). SmartMoney is frequently compared to Money magazine, but Money is often more narrowly focused on investing and it sometimes dumbs down its articles.  I also read BusinessWeek, Forbes and Fortune regularly.  While they all have their place, none provides the depth and common sense focus of SmartMoney when it comes to personal finance.  I have photocopied and saved countless articles and I sometimes refer to them years later.  ...  my advice is to get a subscription now - it's definitely worth it.	1
simply splendid! wonderful im so glad I ordered it. best mag ive seen in years and I LOVE the double issue love it so much!	1
I have only received one issue so far. But what I have read I have liked.	1
what i wanted	1
The magazine is great, but Amazon's price is not. I'm in for 20 issues at $20 - get the insert card in the magazine's latest issue and go to the site listed to charge to your credit card and save the bother/cost of mailing in the charge later.	-1
Does anybody really read this? Or, do file clerks just carry it around on the subway to impress each other?  It takes Vogue 500 pages to say nothing about people and things of no significance in the real world. Innocent trees are being slaughtered to provide endless advertisements.  It's the narcissist's bible.  I like to imagine that the editorial staff really sits around laughing every month about the worthless stuff they churn out -- just waiting for people to realize that this is a hoax. I pray that Vogue is the publishing industry's War Of The Worlds!  But then, I've always been an optomist.	-1
LOVE THIS! LOVE THIS! LOVE THIS!	1
I enjoy all the tips and information this magazine gives for finances, business, investing for both global and local aspects. It is a well-rounded magazine with great information. It helps to have this magazine if you like to help your pocket grow and knowledge expand. Great magazine and worthy of the price.	1
My mom loves w so I ordered this for her.	1
Personal preference, I was looking for more on credit cards, ways to save and handling debt. I'm not really into investing. This is a great magazine for those who are though.	-1
Great	1
great deal	1
This mag has its ups and downs but there is no other magazine with more class and originality. It's an icon all over the world. The editor has inspired books and movies for her perfectionism and professionalism. She and Vogue have gone a long way toward making women strong and independent. Without Vogue magazine fashion would not be a multi-billion dollar industry.	1
If it is in Vogue, it IS in fashion! This magazine, which has existed since 1892, is one of the premier magazines for women. It is an American magazine, but also has Australian, Brazilian, British, French, German, Italian, and Spanish Editions. It covers fashion, beauty, health, fitness, celebrities, movies, art, and other topics of interest to women. Vogue is mainly directed at the Jet-Set, but anyone will find its pages both entertaining, and informative. I have a subscription to it, and I collect it on the basis of its collectibility. Mine arrive in clear plastic bags, which are never opened (unless of course one of my favorite celebritie's is on the cover). I wish all magazine publishers used the clear bag method of shipping, because an subscription label directly on the cover of a magazine is frowned upon by most collectors. So unless you buy it right off the shelf, or it is bagged, most collectors will not be interested in it. Getting back to Vogue, if you want to keep up with what is IN in fashion, this is the magazine to have. You know those $1,000 dresses you've heard about? You'll find many of them modeled in here! Fashions photographed by some of the world's most renowned photographers, are featured in the magazine. If you're someone who enjoys reading about the Elite in women's topics, you'll want to subscribe to VOGUE.	1
Cool stuff to inspire me	1
The clothes are fun to look at too - even though most of us can't even dream about buying stuff by Prada or Carolina Herrera. Maybe that's WHY Vogue is so much fun. This mag evades the snob category by covering very serious subjects in its articles and interviews, and they do slip in affordable fashions for the average woman.  Fun, so it rates a five for me	1
...then you will love Vogue! Vogue is THE fashion magazine -- the competition pales in comparison. This gem does not only supply beauty and fashion advice, it breathes it. I love the articles on the latest fashions, love the profiles on the latest designers and I absolutely love the layouts taken from runway shows in London, Paris, Milan, New York, etc. I shall continue to renew my subscription as long as Vogue continues to maintain my healthy diet of Valentino and Prada.	1
I barely even open it anymore, and when I do it has usually been sitting around the house for weeks by then.  I'm pretty into computers and gadgets.  I like Pop Mechanics, Pop Science, Family Handyman, stuff like that.  This has only been slightly more interesting to me than the Sound & Vision magazine, though not  enough to give a second star even.	-1
LOVE THIS! LOVE THIS! LOVE THIS!	1
I love this magazine. I don't like to travel at all (go figure), but I love reading about traveling, and learning interesting facts about different locations. This magazine definitely caters to the "luxurious" end of travel- lots of reviews and information about villas, private island resorts, etc. But there's also quite a bit about a lot of off-the-beaten-path places, and information about actually making the move to an island, and information about local traditions, customs, etc. It's a magazine that's equal part dreamy-fantasy, interesting information, and actual useful tips for vacation planning.	1
Great buy!!! Haven't found this cheaper anywhere! Excellent info & recipes.	1
I love this magazine. When I saw the offer to renew my subscription for only a dollar I jumped at the offer. I read PS for the past 50 years and have enjoyed a majority of the issues and the stories relating to present and future science related topics.	1
I've subscribed to Smart Money for the last three years. Just received an "Important SUBSCRIBER Notice" advising me that they were automatically extending my subscription into the future ad nauseum. "No more renewals to send back. No postage to pay. No more paperwork -- we take care of all the deatails for you by remewing your subscription automatically each year unless you tell us to stop."  Needless to say, I've notified them to stop. I wish I had never subscribed.  It's worth noting that if you subscribe either through amazon or by using a mail-in card asking to be billed, the magazine will not have your credit card number to bill.	-1
Wired is without doubt the best wider audience magazine in publication. It's consistent quirkiness and unpredictability is on display everywhere (in small print, upside down, etc) and there is hardly a white space in its margins. It's compressed high quality info. Its target audience is technology market "early adopters".  It's an eclectic mix of current technology, trivia, art, techno-society and speculation. It's consistently prescient in its speculation ... the management keeps a tidy score. There are success stories and smoking-black-hole failure stories that push the reader's critical thinking skills.  I don't know how they make money selling subscriptions this cheap. It's an excellent example of an extraordinarily high cost, high quality printing.	1
Great reading for your teen. It's a great Christmas gift that keeps giving great stories, photos for your teen. Glad my granddaughter enjoyed so well, requested it again for her gift!	1
We've renewed this one a couple of times (she loves the celebrity articles and fashion ideas the most); clothes are reasonably priced for a tween so when she shows me something she likes, I hardly ever faint. I will admit on occasion to reading myself, and shopping accessories (come on, I know my limits). Would recommend.	1
Smart Money is a solid magazine about business and finance and I have been reading it on and off again for the past five years. This magazine is a little bit big business and a little bit personal finance, combining together the features of a business magazine with that of an investment publication.  One of the main things I like about Smart Money is the fact that it includes so many different articles each month. There are only a few regular departments in this magazine. The majority of the pages include featured articles and short articles that change from month to month. These articles can cover a wide range of topics from ways to cut your electric bill to the latest regulations in the insurance industry.  Smart Money is an intelligent magazine and its articles are often a little more advanced than those of other financial publications. They don't reach a level that is too advanced to make them incapable of understanding, and that is good. But they are certainly intended for the savvier investor who already knows the ropes and wants some more specific, intermediate to advanced advice on personal finance and corporate happenings.  Overall, I rank Smart Money as a very good personal finance magazine and it is one I will continue to read when I get the chance. It is like a combination of Fortune and Money magazines and its timely articles are often very interesting and helpful. Whether it's an article on reducing your cell phone bill or an article about the profit picture in the oil business, Smart Money is certain to inform and enlighten.	1
I originally got a subscription to Islands on a whim as I hibernated through a cold Chicago winter. I was pleasantly surprised by the stunning depictions of different islands as well as the diversity of articles and islands they chose to feature. Some articles talked about local food, others discussed culture etc. One of my favorite articles in particular was about a European island where people typically lived to be over 100. It not only showed pictures of the island but also had some wonderful writing about the lifestyle, people and history of it.	1
Woman's Day has the feel of a community with its intensely personal warmth. From parenting advice, health, cooking, crafts and homemaking and more, it bonds its target audience together whether you're a single mom, happily married, or even single. I enjoyed this magazine as a teen with my mom and love it even more as an adult. Highly recommend!	1
A real favorite in this magazine is the page of quotes, It is sure to bring a smile or teach you something about life. They also always have cleaning tips, health topics, diet and exercise solutions, true stories, beauty hints, inspirational articles, soul nourishing tips, recipes, recipes and more recipes, family/children, flowers, end of the magazine article to make you think about life, and gardening hints.  If you want to find a cover story fast, they have an "on our cover" section in the index. In Every Issue there is a shopper's guide and a recipe index.  The articles are helpful and in the March 2002 issue they had an article on how to be less stressed. They also had an article on PCOS which is apparently more common than we women think.  The beauty sections show you the newest fashion and you can decide if you want to adapt your style to the trends. Always seems rather chic.  Some of the recipes in the March 2002 issue included:  A luscious Lemon Coconut Pound Cake Coconut Macaroons Peanut Butter Oat Bars Baby Cheesecakes - really cute Banana Salsa French Oven Beef Stew Pasta with Shrimp  The recipes are not difficult and seem practical.  Even the advertising in this magazine is colorful and fun.  A Very "American Gal" type magazine. Nothing fancy, just real life.  ~The Rebecca Review	1
Yes every time you think " I  hate living in this place" just have one of these delivered to your door. I first saw this at my DR office and asked to take it home. The receptionist lit up and said they loved it to and they had actually used it to help define staff retreats. It is worthy of cutting things ut of, reviewing resorts, and they go EVERYWHERE!  I like as a gift for friends who need to dream more or are going through a shift in their life.	1
It's a man thing	1
Wired is an amazing magazine for those who want to learn more about cutting edge tech gear. I find the information accurate and timely.  The products that I have purchased after reading the magazine have worked very well.  Kenneth Haft  Glen Allen	1
Seventeen magazine has been around a while and has staying power for good reason.  It is targeted at 16-17 year olds and stays pretty much on target with its content.  This is a subscription I give for gifts and I always hear back from the girls (and their moms) about how much they love it.  Not trashy -- but current.  Still innocent -- but fashionable.  Content talks _to_ girls not _down to_ them.  It's a keeper!	1
I subscribed hoping for a wide-ranging view of fashion shows and contemporary art.  While there was an interesting article on an aging art auctioneer, several ads featured male and female nudes crouching or huddling in homoerotic poses.  One feature had garish clothes on models posed in front of small suburban houses...how quaint.  Another "fashion" spread had a young woman being kidnapped, a bag put over her head, handcuffed, and finally posed nude facing a wall.  Degrading and violent sexualized images of women.  That's not fashion...it's pornography.  This magazine might appeal to older people who came of age in the 1960s (plastic surgery article, gaudy jewelry ads) who "celebrate" the sexual revolution and don't think much of the dignity of the human body.  I can't see this magazine staying in existence much longer.	-1
Not worth buying, unless you like to look at pretty photos and some articles. I can never go to the places, but looking in a mag. is better than nothing I guess. I am not renewing this mag.	-1
This magazine has been consistently good for years now. As a women, I enjoy reading this magazine as well as my husband ,grandson.. great magazine to cross so many generations and still be popular.	1
Bought as a gift for my husband. He enjoyed the articles and pictures. Good info for the outdoorsman	1
I love this magazine.  It is full of the most interesting array of trivia that you can imagine.  I learn so much reading it.  I highly recommend it to the kind of people who enjoy Mental Floss!	1
Islands Magazine is a must for the travel lover. Each issue features stunning photography, articles from people who have visited various world islands, and advertisements on popular travel destinations around the globe. The articles covered in this magazine usually focus on popular islands for travelers, like the Caribbean, South Pacific Islands, Hawaii, etc. But on occassion, the magazine features other islands, too, including those that are not as popular as tourist destinations like the Balearic Islands, Ceylon, Madagascar, and others. There are LOTS of advertisements in this magazine, and that might not sit well with some readers who prefer more articles and less selling. But the ads are helpful to the reader because they often include bargain prices. There are also classified ads from other readers who have island vacation property to rent. If you like to travel and you love water, then Islands magazine is a great publication to read. The photography alone makes it worth while. It will tempt you to head to the nearest travel agency and book your tropical beach vacation asap!	1
I know a lot of people complain about all the ads,but for me it just gives new and more info for products to check into. The photos are great. The articles are great. It's easily worth the cost!	1
I love popular science.  It is a quick and easy read for places where you don't need a long-read.  You can get caught up on the newest gear and electronics without fetishizing them in a consumeristic way.  Unfortunately, I would bet that if you looked at the circulation figures, half the title is wrong.	1
Husband and I enjoy the magazine.	1
What do fine dining, high fashion, celebrities, beauty tips, travel, exceptional photography, and entertainment all have in common? They can be found in W magazine. A magazine of women's interests, W is a huge publication measuring approximately 9" X 13". Which is one reason I like it, it's like getting a magazine from the 1940's with 21st century fashions. I would put it in the same category as Vogue. Anyone will love viewing W., but it's not hard to figure out who it's mainly aimed at, especially when you occasionally see jewelry priced between $20,000 and $200,000, and when you notice who some of the advertisers are, namely Prada, Calvin Klein, and Armani. W also has superb photography, photography that borders on Art. I have a subscription and share it with family and friends, then place it in my collection( I collect magazines ).  If you like magazines such as Vogue and Harper's Bizarre, you are sure to love this fine publication.	1
I like this magazine for a variety of reasons.  First of all I like the informative articles regarding a paticular food subject.  Cooking shows only seem to high the highlights, but when I want more about something this is a good source.  Secondly this has a section where they feature restaurant recipes, always something that I welcome.  It has information about restaurants.  In addition to all of these things they often share several good recipes each month.  I have always been pleased with their choices.  Overall I give this a 4 because I would like to see more recipes.  While the format is good, I personally like to collect recipes, and prepare new dishes.	1
Quickly shipped. Loved this item	1
Okay I'm a little bit older than 17, but it was a free issue on the Kindle Fire. Looks nice on the Fire!! Guess being 17 hasn't changed much over the years either.	1
When I was a little kid in the 1950s and 1960s, PopSci was the one magazine I looked forward to every month. Each thick issue was full of articles on everything from the latest scientific breakthroughs to gadgets you could build in your basement shop. They commissioned vacation home designs from architects, told you how to build a radio, and helped you maintain your car (anyone remember Smokey's Garage?)  Today's PopSci is 90 pages of brief essays, and there's nothing here you can't find by browsing a few web pages like Engadget, Science Daily, and yes, PopSci's own website. Instructables has more projects than you'll find a a year of PS.  But that's the way the world is going. WIth so many general and special interest web sites out there providing the same information, and often breaking stories the day they come out, there's not really a place for a brief collection of technology stories that has to be assembled several months in advance.  Update: I just received the latest (9/2015) issue, via a free subscription, and it's now down to 82 low density pages. About half the pages contain editorial material, but there's precious little information.there are, however, several full-page portraits of the subjects of a few of the articles, and a double page spread of Neil DeGrasse Tyson in a rubber apron with a goofy look. The "projects" contain insufficient information to build, the articles are superficial, and the interviews ar at most a few hundred words. My copy went into the recycling bin after a cursory look through.	-1
The recipes are great and so is the travel advice for those seeking a good meal while traveling. I get great ideas for presentation and entertaining at home. If you enjoy fine dining, or just reading about it, then this magazine is worth a subscription and would make a nice holiday gift that will keep giving year round	1
I love reading Wired magazine because of the quality in the articles it publishes. Just recently there was an article written where the author attempted to disappear and remain missing for 30 days without being found. Although he was close, the author was ultimately discovered close to the end of 30 days through some sophisticated techniques used by a team of readers. Which reveals the difficulty of remaining anonymous and disconnected from the world in this day and age.  For those interested in gadgets, and technology, I recommended subscription to Wired, as it provides an interesting reach every month with its in-depth feature articles.	1
I am a budding cook. I enjoy it immensely as a hobby. I like to be inspired by as many outside sources as possible. I recently started subscribing to "Gourmet" magazine. While I do agree that there is lots of advertisements, more than necessary and maybe one too many travel articles, I still enjoy reading the magazine page for page. What I can appreciate about this magazine that it is slightly more less high end than its rival "Bon Appetit" which I think over the years has become more geared to the snobby food lover than to those who live on a budget. There are still quite a bit of recipes that are quite fancy but there seems to be a good number of recipes that are simple and basic, not to mention affordable for those on a budget and aren't concerned with the presentation of the dish. I enjoy reading "Gourmet". I wish they would cut down on the travel articles and ads and include more recipes but otherwise it's a good source of inspiration for me.	1
I don't personally like this magazine.  It has gotten pretty rique over the years (i'm amazed what girls "need to know" now-a-days).  I don't like the emphasis on beauty, good looks, and products.  That said...it is what the 7th grade girls in my classes want to read, so i buy it when it's on sale.	1

Perfect	1
Gourmet magazine has fabulous recipes with an accent on travel, and the flavors of the world. It also tours the U.S., and gives an in depth look at the food typical to a regional area; a recent issue for instance had an article on food in Ireland, and how it has improved through the decades, a guide to Australian wines, quilts and buttermilk biscuits in Appalachia, and a "Food Lover's Address Book" in Boston, from burgers near Harvard to spring rolls in Chinatown. They always have a complete menu, down to the last detail, with beautiful photographs that will inspire you to copy it; "Quick Kitchen" with easy to make meals that are also nutritious; "Kitchen Notebook", filled with good tips on everything from new products to a better way to slice thin bread, and my favorite feature, "You Asked for It", where readers ask for the recipes of dishes they have tasted in restaurants, from Bangkok to Manhattan; Gourmet finds the recipe, tries it out, and shares it with us. Some of the most delicious morsels of the month are on this page. If one has the time to spend creating these gastronomic delights, it is well worth it. I have never tried a Gourmet recipe that was a disappointment, and there is always something to learn, and much to appreciate visually in every issue.	1
...I found that Gourmet dealt more on the international recipes than I really cared for. The articles and recipes were good for the reading but when you subscribe to over 16 magazines a month 10 of them being food, you tend to become quite picky on what is worth it and really a necessity in having. I subscribed to "Bon Appetit" as well and these two go hand in hand. As I mentioned in another review I did you can easily get all of these recipes on their website at Epicurous and save yourself some money, but If you like to be swept away to Dazzling places and enjoy the full page pictures of your entrees then get the magazine........ but get it from Amazon, you can't beat their price. Happy Reading	1
If there's one word that captures the essence of Wired, it's "enthusiasm." The writing is consistently vigorous, sometimes excessively, but always enjoyably. The nerd humor is sometimes over-the-top, and interesting subjects aren't always given the depth they deserve. Still, Wired is one of the best light magazines around, rich in playful graphics and quick, cool stories on things you never knew existed.  I think of myself as a recovering ex-geek, having frittered my youth away on video games, but I'm never giving up my monthly dose of Wired. It's an effortless breeze of awesomeness.	1
Great articles	1
Great magazine for anyone who enjoys hunting,fishing and outdoor activities.	1
Price is great!  Instead of the most current issue arriving first, I received back issues more than 2 months after they hit the news stands.  If this counts towards my 12 issues, I will not renew.	-1
"Popular Photography & Imaging" is the photography magazine I most often sit down and read. It is geared to photographers of all levels and generally has more than one or two interesting bits in it for me.  First off, it does have a lot advertisements! I mean LOTS! That being said, I just ignore them unless I'm in the market for products.  The magazine also has good Reviews, a wide range of "How To" features, and well written articles. I find the "Buying Guides" to be very helpful when looking for new gear.  Well worth the subscription price - Recommended!	1
It seems like "Wired" has generally improved over the past few years and is now a magazine that I look forward to reading. Wired covers a wide range of interests including technical inovations in medical, bio-engineering, computers, imaging, etc. Also covers artistic and political issues as well.  The writing is a bit hit and miss, but there is generally enough content that there is something worth reading in every issue. The gadget reviews alone do it for me.  At the low subscription price, this is a real value. Recommended!	1
I subscribe to about 20 magazines and Wired is by far my favorite.  Unlike alot of my magazines that 40% of the content is adds there are few adds and lots of info in Wired.  The stories are not all tech and nerdy like the title might suggest.  I do skip a few pages here and there because the content does not interest me but for the most part i enjoy every page and find the articles to be well written.  This is a great gift for under $10	1
Field & Stream one of the best outdoor magazines on the market.	1
I thought I might like this magazine better than cosmo because it wouldn't have so much about sex in it, but this magazine is starting to contain more sexual content. I've never been much for fashion and make-up either. I just don't like girly magazines!  Update: My subscription expired 1/1/11 according to Amazon, yet I am still receiving the magazine. I am not on auto-renewal (Amazon specifically says 1-year and that it is expired as of 1/1/11) and I never sent in any of the renewal forms the magazine sent me, so as of now I am getting free magazines. They better not stick me with a bill later!	-1
Seventeen is a fun positive magazine for girls probably 11 or so and up.  Helps transition the girl into womanhood with great fashion, stories, and advice.  The magazine is clean and promotes bright women which I think is key to go along with all the fashion and make-up. <a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Voice-Lessons-To-Go-Volume-1-Vocalize-and-Breath/dp/B000297VQA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Voice Lessons To Go Volume 1: Vocalize and Breath</a>	1

love this magazine  !!!	1
I read Seventeen Magazine back in the olden days, and it's still a good magazine today. It's got great advice on fashion, make-up, getting along in school socially and academically -- it's all here!  I purchased this for a family member just starting out in high school, and I know that she will love it as much as we did back then!	1
New to this party, but love this mag. A new favorite of mine.	1
Harper;s Bazaar is a fair resource for couture fashion, but lacks the styling tips that support fashion for women.  The magazine seems geared more toward the very rich and people in the fashion industry.  It lacks the interesting interviews and certainly doesn't include information on style and being on-trend for different income levels that Cosmopolitan, Marie Claire and even Vogue feature in each issue.  I won't re-subscribe.  This is for the one percent of the once percenters.	-1

This is the first issue of Wired I've read. Couldn't believe the variety of articles: 1)Why companies are "selling" product for free;2)Autism from the inside view; 3)The re-floating of a capsized cargo ship..carrying over 4,000 Mazdas by a salvage company..and so on. Had to read it cover to cover..am now a subscriber.	1

The magazine in print form is fine, but on a Kindle, it's terrible. The cost is cheap, but not worth it even at the low cost. Disappointing!	-1
Cheap price	1
I have subscribed to this magazine for over four years.  I like that this magazine is constantly fresh and doesn't seem to get stales.  There are always great articles about what is new and upcoming in techonology, new trends on the Internet.  Some magazines have a lot of filler and tend to be a vehicle for selling advertisements.  What makes Wired extra special is that they don't pander to products that they do advertising for.  Unlike other computer related magazines they write about trends, and outstanding products.  This leaves them more room for good reporting and less veiled advertising.  They often feature articles written by famous people in techonology.  I have operated a cooking website since 1995, so I am familar with the Internet, and how it works.  What I like about Wired magazine is that they constantly write about what's new and upcoming in trends for the online world, and they tend to be very on the mark with where the Internet is and where it is going.  If you are interested in techonology, and what is going on online this is the magazine for you.  Wired magazine is fresh, and is free of pandering to the products they help advertise.  I like that this magazine is high on content and low in advertisements.  Always fresh content about new products in techonology, trends in the high tech world, and a good insight on the Internet make this magazine an excellent choice.	1
love the gift give them to many people.really a great gift thanks so very very very much. Thanks thanks thanks thanks	1
my wife is happy	1
I have been reading this since my teens and really enjoy it. It is a good mix of articles. I love using amazon to manage my magazine subscriptions and they get paid for once per year and I can ignore all the renewal notices!	1
love	1
Wired has some really great articles and columns in their Opinion section (I believe they're in thats section). They had a great feature with the above pictured issue, about the making of a human; and it looks like their newest issue (all about Google) will be great too (if the cover just wasn't so darn bright). I haven't bought it just yet, cause I just subscribed and am waiting for it. Wired is just a really good technology magazine, and of course they talk about other things, but it all usually has to do with tech stuff. Well regardless, it's still a great read, and I think you will like it.	1
Just not into magazines too many ads. But great price.	-1
I've subscribed to this magazine for about 15 years. Excellent publication. Really enjoy the articles, recipes, especially travel articles. Thanks.	1
Fascinating reading for culinary students and budding chefs around the world to try recipes of different cultures and this magazine that I regarded as a historian of foodies and invaluable articles of the world cuisines.	1
Good magazine lots to read.	1

I bought several fashion magazine subscriptions at once after denying myself for a lifetime from spending money in this way. Bazaar was not a favorite. I preferred Self then InStyle later to this magazine. I like to look at what the current styles are, but I prefer magazines that have lots of helpful information on make-up, where to get great buys, etc. I also liked the articles. Short and helpful. Other people may have different taste and want to look at ads and styles that they will never wear. I didn't renew this subscription. To each his own.	-1
Love this magazine!!  Lots of info and fashion advice!  I'm glad that I subscribed to it!  Great read, too!  Thanks?	1
This was not one of my favorite magazines. I prefer others. The articles were not interesting to me. Glad I got to try it for free rather than spending money on something I didn't like.	-1
Great stuff at a fantastic price -- how can you beat that? If you want the latest concepts in technology with a good flair for writing and art, read this magazine. For the low price, just the graphics are pleasing. Full-length investigative articles, great interviews, current games and gadgets.	1
The best thing about Wired is that it has stayed true to its roots over all of these years.  Wired has always had a forward-looking, sophisticated attitude toward technology.  You can tell that every article is well-researched and no feature in the magazine is an afterthought.  In every issue, you will find: - stories about the unsung heroes who are really responsible for pushing the limits of technology - some politically-oriented article that shows the growing interplay between technology and politics - cool digital and electronic gadgets (that usually cost a lot of $$) - fun stuff like Jargon watch, Wired vs. Tired, and even some of the ads (how often can you say that?) Beyond that, I find Wired is the best place to read about things like the melding of human and computer and the progess of technology outside of the U.S.  So, I find every issue interesting.  It's a little less useful to me as an investor in technology stocks, but it does offer me that broader perspective on technology that helps put investable ideas into context.  The clincher is the price - a small sacrifice for so much intriguing and entertaining content.  I once considered discontinuing my subscription, but realized that it's so different from everything else I read and just one decent article an issue makes it worthwhile.  Very glad I kept it.  So, if you've never read Wired, I would give it definitely give it a try.	1
NICE BLEND OF INFORMATION. THIS PUBLICATION IS FOR BEGINNER AND ADVANCED COOKS! GREAT INFORMATION AND TIPS. I LOVE & RECOMMEND THIS MAGAZINE!	1
Great magazine for fashion ideas and I have looked at their sources to find different clothing, and cologne items shown in the magazine. Great value and Amazon keeps the subscription rates low so it is very affordable too.	1
The item came in excellent conditions, well packed, very nice NEW, no defect, as i expected. . . . .	1
I'm really enjoying this magazine, due to the articles, the way the magazine is organized, and what's included. Lots of good stuff here for the price.	1
i love this magazine... it helps me from dressing dowdy, by inspiring me !!.. the photography is done so well and even the advertisements are colorful and interesting	1
Seventeen is still the best teen mag on the market, and for more than its excellent advice on style and cosmetics. The magazine features designer wear, sure, but never forgets that its target audience is exactly that - teens. The articles are fascinating and relevant to issues that affect us all. Over the years Seventeen has covered teen pregnancy, date rape and cults. You don't have to be seventeen to enjoy it - moms who loved it can still enjoy it with their own daughters. Highly recommend	1
The clean, color-themed pages are easy on the eyes.  The Lists, Chic on the Street, Gift Guide, Work the Look, Extras accessories, and Fabulous at Every Age are all artistically presented and united by colors, metals, and gems.  Although I don't like most of the individual pieces, I thoroughly enjoy looking at the way Harper's talented staff juxtapose and arrange them so delightfully. The Beauty section names reasonably priced skin and hair products as well as new spa and exercise ideas for health.  I find Vogue's ugly and decadent look in editorial and advertising pages repulsive and boring, with only occasional great photos. W wallows in kinky deviance. Lucky features inelegant, garish clothes that look like like a catalog of what clothing manufacturers have sent to be photographed.  Uniquely, Harper's Bazaar is a delightful monthly guide to current fashion.  Thank you, Harper's!	1
"Harper's Bazaar" magazine features a colorful collection of clothes and jewelry.  Kate Winslet, Taylor Swift,  Courtney Cox, and Heidi Klum are among some of the famous celebrities that appear in the December 2012/January 2013 issue.  "Harper's Bazaar" is a good magazine to get if you like publications that include a wide range of seasonal fashions.	1
I like the magazine. They have good fashion articles and all the latest bags and accessories. The articles do not directly pertain to me but I like the way they showcase all the new fashion.	1
Seventeen has been around for 60 years, and tons of teenagers have grown up with it. Recently, Seventeen got a new look and feel, with more mature articles and interesting features for older teeens. Seventeen is good for those teens who feel like they've outgrown other teen magazines but want one that will guide them through college and beyond. Seventeen features many stuff that teens like to read about- the latest celebrity news, CD and movie release dates, fashion and beauty tips, love and romance, real-life stories, fun stuff to do, and more. As an added bonus, Seventeen covers more worldwide issues then other teen magazines and gives them to you from a teen's point of view. Seventeen also gives you plenty of college and sex advice, which older readers will connect with. What I love about Seventeen is not only the plentiful amounts of news and real-life stories, but also that it features many bargain items in the Fashion section that are awesome and affordable. Seventeen is a wonderful magazine for bargain shopppers- it features plenty of clothes, make-up, hair products, and jewelry for those with smaller budgets. Additionally, the health and fitness pull outs in each issue are wonderful! Seventeen has plenty of nutrition tips and simple workouts that'll have you seeing lots of results fast. Seventeen is a wonderful magazine overall- highly recommended.	1
For anyone who has read my review on Elle, I feel the same way about this magazine. Few articles, full of ads. If you enjoy looking at fashion photography and fashion ads, then this is a good magazine for you. (Although, I feel like this is a weaker version of Elle.) For the rest of us, skip it and purchase a better magazine. I canceled my subscription.	-1
Got this issue on the Kindle for free so not a bad price, as I am not normally a reader of this mag. Looks great on the Fire though.  Still just a both of advertisements with models who look drugged to me.	-1
I used to read this magazine many years ago and re-subscribed late last fall in large part due to a five dollar a year subscription price. After receiving my first issue I was very pleased that I ordered this title; having live 30 minutes from Manhattan most of my life and now residing in the high desert plains, this is defintely my Zsa-Zsa/Green Acres fix for the month!  I like how they always apply the fashion trends for women of any age - 20's to 70's.  This issue had generous articles about Patti Hansen and Madonna - whether you care for them or not I think they are real legends as opposed to the various Kardashians that always seem to be on every other cover these days. They do give a nod to up-and-comers by including features like the one with model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley.  I don't mind the many ads since they keep the publishing costs low.  A little talk of everything current - art, movies, books and of course the fashion....  While it is mostly high end couture that is beyond my budget, it is beautifully photographed and the trends are a treat to admire - I think of this as sort of long distance window shopping.	1
Great magazine	1
Just stumbled on to this book....I like it.	1
I love Marie Claire because it's got something for every woman regardless of her economic or social class.  It's always current with fine couture - but includes fashion tips and features affordable wear for the average middle class working woman as well.  Marie Claire is a strong supporter of women's rights, and features articles and information on current events and issues women face all over the world.  It's also more affordable than some of the high-fashion magazines. I've been a subscriber for four years and an occasional reader long before that. Highly recommend this magazine for its fashion, social conscious and beauty tips.	1
Are you someone who likes to keep up with the latest trends in fashion? Are you someone who is concerned about health and beauty issues? Are you a person who loves to read about celebrities as well as the latest in music, movies, and TV? Then Seventeen is for YOU!!! In fact, Seventeen has all of these and much more! From recipes to inspiring life stories, from sex to cool celebrity photos, Seventeen is packed with informative and entertaining articles, plus, lots of cool colorful photographs. According to the Audit Bureau of Circulations list of the 100 best selling magazines in the United States, Seventeen is ranked 25th, but none of the ones above Seventeen on the list are directed at teens and young women, thus, making Seventeen the best selling magazine for young readers. It has over 2,000,000 readers to date, and that number is growing. But, not only is Seventeen a best seller, it's also one of the most sought after collectibles in the world! At auctions, I've seen editions from the 70's and 80's sell for as much as [money]each, depending on things such as condition, who was on the cover, etc. And I've noticed that editions of Seventeen do not have to be very old to bring a good price. I've seen editions as little as 2 years old sell for upwards of [money] each. I fell in love with the magazine when I was 17. I was in class when I noticed one of my classmates reading a copy. As I peered over her shoulder, I seen in the magazine one of the most beautiful girls in the world. Turned out, the model would later turn into one of the hottest actresses in film----Phoebe Cates. So I asked my classmate where I could get a copy and she told me I could find them in most any store or get them by subscription. So because of Phoebe Cates, I started collecting the magazine just for her lovely pics. Later, stars such as Brooke Shields,and Jennifer Connelly kept me buying the magazine. Then I began to read the articles and found them both interesting and informative. I can say with assurance that some of the articles in Seventeen have helped keep me looking younger and healthier. So while Seveteen is directed mainly at young women between the ages of 12 and 20, guys can also benefit from some of its contents. It's a magazine that has existed since 1944, and is a favorite among every class of people. If you would like a magazine that is great to read and can be worth something as a collectible in the future, you cannot beat SEVENTEEN!!!	1
I love this mag. I have a collection of 1940-50's issues. I built science fair projects (and won!) from its pages as a kid. A 21st century kid has the same opportunity to experiment with stuff on the cheap with Pop-Sci as the mind fertilizer ... a national treasure still.	1
The above is an actual question posed by the insightful author of a Bazaar article (August edition). For a moment it made me think Bazaar was on the cutting edge of animal psychology... Turns out, the question referred to the current equestrian trend in clothes and accessories... It gets worse: Bazaar "buys of the month" are a $750 pair of shoes, a $3,235 bag, and a $425 necklace...Yes, $4,000 is indeed my monthly accesories budget...(not!)  Over 50% of the magazine pages are advertisements. Bland ones... I buy fashion magazines for the pictures: I may not buy all the clothes, but at least I want to be informed what is current and can figure out how to emulate the looks. However, Bazaar seems to make "impractical and over the top" their mantra. Not to mention that UBER expensive is the only way they go...  The only reason why I am not angry is the extremely low price I paid for the year's subscription... I hope at some point I will see something in the 12 issues worthy of the subscription price...Hence the two stars...But... I will NOT be renewing my subscription. The magazine has gone down hill, compared to years of yore... Shame...	-1
Harper's always takes chances to get noticed. This can be good or bad depending on your tolerance for shock factor i.e. Britney Spears naked, pregnant and with black hair. It's worth a salon read.	1
Decent	1
I bought this and several other magazines for the library in my classroom.  The kids like to look over magazines when they have a few minutes to kill.  They like this one and the price was good on special.	1
The articles are well versed and well researched.  I wish more of the ideas put forth in the magazine would come to fruition though.	1
Maybe you read this while sitting in one waiting room or another back in the 1960s, but Popular Science still is a fascinating read for anyone intrigued by scientific knowledge and technology.  Great addition to the "man cave" or for any teen on the local Science Olympiad team.	1
I do enjoy this publication greatly.  It is not quite as technical and in depth as I would like, but how many people would subscribe if it were readable only to physics PhDs?  I do rather enjoy the 'scratching the surface' approach to the articles. I find that there is enough information to give a good overview and decent scientific understanding of the topic yet it is not so complex that I feel as if I am 'working'.  There are also some interesting nerdy fun articles such as the worst ideas from the DOD (flying humvees, mutant mosquitos, etc...) to keep a smile of your face.  However, the vast majority of the articles are serious and well written.  There is enough variety of chemistry, astronomy, physics, biology, and environmental science to keep most scientifically minded people interested.  I look forward to each and every issue.	1
Just not into magazines too many ads. But great price.	-1
look forward  to each issue	1
Still waiting for my first magazine....  It looks like a good read and has informative articles - can't wait for my first magazine!	1
I am a long time Vogue magazine subscriber, but I watch Project Runway so I decided to try this magazine. I really like it and I would subscribe again.  Very current and up on fashion trends.	1
Excellent articles but I haven't been able to use any of the recipes. If you order this magazine be sure you just want to read what others are cooking.	1
Bottom-line: Popular Science is my new personal science and technology advisor designed to enrich my knowledge of science and technology spanning the globe.  I have always delved into the minutia of how things work.  This natural curiosity grew from, where I don't know where it comes from exactly.  Perhaps it part of the male brain, or perhaps just part of mine; I like to take things apart and see how they work.  It's not enough to know that if I pay my electric bill on time, when I flick on a light switch I will have light; I want to know how the electricity is generated and how it got to the switch.  That same curiosity led me to my current profession as an Information Technology professional.  What started out as a hobby, a need to know how computers worked, has turned into a second career for me.  All of this explains why I subscribe to and read Popular Science Magazine [...], whose slogan is The Future Is Now.  As magazines go, Popular Science is a pretty thin rag, but that does not mean the monthly is not packed with all manner of useful and informative information.  it does mean that the magazine is not (over) burdened with page after page of annoying advertising.  There is of course advertising, a magazine could not survive without it, but is it not overly intrusive and overbearing.  Regular sections in the magazine include:  o Features: feature length articles; o Megapixels o What's New o Headlines o How 2.0 o FYI o Other Stuff: includes Letters, and editor's note.  My favorite section is What's New; I tend to read it first every month.  Each section is filled with six or seven pages of text and illustrations one the latest and greatest new products and prototypes from across the world in the science, general technology and astronomy fields. The latest issue featured a big bold article on the future of police equipment, called Cop Tech; Inside The Police R&R Lab. A flashy title to be sure, but is backed up with quality writing as well as pictures and or images of the equipment and gadgets discussed in the article.  Other articles in this month's (February 2007) magazine include:  o Protect Everything; the future of personal security. o Journey From The Center of The Earth; Popsci Innovator o It Came From The Lab; Uncommon Knowledge o Fly The Friendly Seas; Concepts & Prototypes  The articles for the most part are well written, concise, and comprehensive.  Aside from the feature articles, the most informative portion of the magazine are the one or two page explanation features wherein some present or future gadget is explained, usually accompanied by an illustration.  For example on page 27 of this month's issue under the Headlines section the magazine explains in great detail--complete with illustration--how the Department of Energy is building a greener coal plant, that will extract Hydrogen--called Syngas--from water and use it to produce electricity.  The coal is used in the process and the Carbon it creates as a by-product is pumped underground into a saline solution.  The item was short, but came away from it with a thorough understanding of a process I had heretofore never heard of.  I have only one minor quibble with the magazine: almost one third of the back half of the monthly is given over to adverting.  Not the expensive glossy, glamorous kind, but the shady little, not so sure you can thrust what their advertising kind found is too many other wise respectable magazines.  Subscriptions  Popular Science Magazine is published by Time 4 Media. In addition to the English language edition, Popular Science is also published in China, Israel, Korea and Mexico. Book shelf sells for a cover price of $3.99 US, Canada $4.99, while a 12-month subscription will set you back $15.95 and a 24-month subscription checks in at 21.95. If you are doing the math--and you should--that's a 77% saving off the single copy price. You might be able to find a better deal at one of the on-line magazine subscription sites like Magazines.com, or e-Subscription.com.  Conclusion  Other than that one decidedly minor quibble, I have no qualms recommending Popular Science to anyone who asks.  The magazine is my new personal science and technology advisor designed to enrich my knowledge of science and technology spanning the globe.	1
Saveur is a celebration of authentic cuisine with everything from Food Festivals to very easy-to-make recipes, like Blueberry Pudding. While there are a few book reviews for foodies to enjoy, the writing introduces cooks to international flavors and seasonal fare. Restaurants are also a feature as are gourmet cooking essentials.  While reading you may discover a pastry shop or start to dream of making a recipe like Chicken Fried Steak. Yes, this very gourmet book has comfort food recipes as well as more complex recipes like the one for Olive Bread which actually only requires a minimum of bread making skills.  After reading this magazine I'm normally in the mood to drizzle olive oil over just about anything I'm putting in the oven. The recipe for Stuffed Tomatoes and Summer Squash had me wishing it was October again and the recipe for Fig Jam reminded me of my childhood in Africa where we had a Fig Tree in the backyard.  Saveur is filled with nostalgia, entertaining food adventures and delicious recipes. With Amazon's Gourmet food section, we can now find the ingredients to make many of the recipes in this magazine.  ~The Rebecca Review	1
All the up to date news in the world of Science; written in basic easy to understand English.  I have been buying this magazine for years.	1
If you don't turn off amazon auto renewal, you'll be resubscribed at market price.  Unsubscribing from auto renew is very easy, so not a big issue.  Great magazine, amazing price.	1
This magazine covers a lot of personal info, as well as various other topics, I enjoy!!	1
This is simply a beautiful magazine, printed on heavy, glossy paper. Its pages contain many beautiful photographs of different foods, wines, and the countries from which they originate. It is not only a food and wine magazine with wonderful recipes that are easy to follow, it is also a travel guide of sorts with a great deal of information on other countries, their food and wine, their  restaurants, and their culture. Usually included are some fascinating historical details of how a custom associated with a particular food may have come about. The articles are invariably well-written and offer a wealth of fascinating information.  I am a tea lover, and I love going to afternoon tea with its repast of scones, dainty sandwiches, and light cakes. So, I particularly enjoyed an article that the magazine recently had that focused on tea. It transported the reader to Devon, England with its afternoon tradition of  tea and scones, accompanied by clotted cream and  jam, which is often referred to as a cream tea. Of course, a beautiful bone china tea pot and bone china cups are essential to the having of a proper cup of tea. This, too, is discussed in the article. Photographs of an authentic village tearoom in Devon were included, as well as recipes for making scones, tea sandwiches, black currant jam, strawberry jam, and Victoria Sponge Cake.  The article went on to discuss how clotted cream is made. It interspersed the discussion with personal anecdotes from those who make clotted cream. A guide was included for Devon in terms of where to stay, where to eat, and where to go for tea. The article went on to discuss the differences among the various available tea experiences, detailing what constitutes an afternoon tea, a cream tea, and a high tea, and giving some of the historical underpinnings of each.  I so enjoyed this article! Even if I never physically go to Devon, I feel as if the magazine had transported me there, as it was vividly drawn by so expert and sure a hand. The magazine has these types of articles in every issue, covering regions from all over the world, including those in the United States.  The magazine also contains a helpful section titled, "The Pantry", which is a guide to resources that have to do with food products and kitchenware related to articles in the current issue of the magazine. This makes it invariably easier for the reader, who may wish try some of the more esoteric recipes, to find what one needs. It is little wonder that I love this magazine. Those who are interested in wonderful food, excellent and easy to follow recipes, other cultures and customs, as well as traveling, will simple adore this magazine. It makes a wonderful gift. I know, because this magazine was a gift to me and one for which I am grateful, as it is a gift that one gets to enjoy again and again, each and every month.	1
I have over 16 Magazine subscriptions, 10 of them being Cooking Magazines. Saveur provides you with a different sort of cooking magazine, definately with a heavy intent on the background of food, their articles are more in depth about the locations and even the layout of the magazine is different. If you enjoy this magazine there is a web-site that you absolutely must check out it's called "ethnic grocer" you can find all of the rare ingredients that you find in some of the recipes that are featured in Saveur. I always feel like I've actually walked in the shoes of the writer and the articles are so vivid that you can almost taste the exotic-ness <---- is that word?) LOL of the flavors. If you can get the subscription at a good price, GO FOR IT! A warning though be prepared to want to immediately run out get a passport and travel to the locations that are featured. Happy Reading	1
never subscribed to this magazine	-1
Love this magazine....so much to read.	1
I read a lot of magazines. My roommates sigh everytime they check the mail because they inevitably have to carry home heavy piles of glossy paper encased in plastic wrap. Marie Claire is probably my favorite magazine out of all the ones I read (I read most fashion and women's health magazines) because it provides a bit of everything that the average young professional woman like myself enjoys. Some of its interest pieces about real life people are thought-provoking and well-written. There is almost always a feature article about some celebrity, but Marie Claire takes the time to interview the celebrity and try to get a different perspective on her life. Finally, MC also has all the other fun and frills that any girl wants when she mindlessly reads a magazine while getting a mani/pedi - beauty tips, fashion ideas etc.	1
Marie Claire is a wonderful read, and well worth the money for the beauty tips alone! I have many issues that I keep just for reference.  Marie Claire has it all:  the best fashions on the runway, recommendations for all income levels and body types.  I love Vogue, but more for entertainment value, since I can't afford the clothes advertised in it.  Marie Claire has something for every woman in every background and income level to enjoy.  Interviews, articles and reader input are also excellent.  This isn't just a "mirror, mirror" magazine.  Articles explore social issues and current affairs along with the usual celebrity features.  I bought a two-year subscription, and am already making plans to renew.  Highly recommend!	1
IT'S AS i REMEMBERED IT TO BE.	1
POSITIVES Very traditional magazine with staying power Lots of helpful hints about practical stlye Fashion finds that are very affordable often articles about slimming down, hair care, and skin sometimes there are healthy ideas and articles about diseases like cancer Be happy cooking shortcuts Ways to save money Good read for commuting and realaxing, but not much substance.    NEGATIVES This is not your grandma's REDBOOK Many times the issues talk about SEX and LOTS of CLEAVAGE so would not be appropriate to leave around children    RECOMMEND (with the above noted)	1
This is not a magazine for me. It does not contain information that I was interested in. Will not buy again.	-1
Great magazine. Worth the price!	1
Popular Science is a magazine I have been reading on and off for more than twenty years and it ranks as a science magazine for the masses. As most readers will tell you, Popular Science is a beginner's science publication and is generally intended for those who are curious about science and want to gain a better understanding of science and technology.  Popular Science is more about technology than science and this is evident from the departments and most of the featured articles. Yes, Popular Science does include articles about atoms, chemicals, outer space, physics, etc., but the majority of the articles are about modern technology and its uses and applications. The technology articles are dedicated to subjects such as new vehicles, environmental trends, electronic devices, and more. Articles like these might seem a little out of scope, but one has to remember that the first word in the title of the magazine is Popular. Technology is huge, so it makes sense that the magazine would dedicate such a large percentage of its articles to high tech.  The writing in Popular Science is very good, but as I said before, this magazine is intended more as a beginner's guide to science and technology. This means the articles will be perfectly fine for those with limited science and technology knowledge.  For those with a more advanced scientific mind, some of the articles may be too elementary. However, every issue can be counted on for at least a couple of in-depth, intellectual articles. Also, one needs to keep in mind that the articles are generally short and cover only a page or two. This is nice for those with shorter attention spans and for those who want to soak up as many facts about as many different things as possible.  Learning more about science and technology is certainly a good idea and Popular Science is a good choice of reading material for those who are scientifically curious, want to improve their science knowledge level, and want to learn about the latest technology. The magazine could prove to be a little too simplistic for those with a working or educational background in science, but for everyone else, Popular Science presents a good means to keep up with the latest in science and high tech with writing that is clear and intelligent without going over the top.	1
I have continued to get this Magazine subscription for almost 4 years now. I really enjoy the pictures and the many different ways to do "country". I began subscribing because I was gathering information on opening a "Bed and Breakfast" and I wanted to see the looks that were out there that said "cozy" and "homey". This Magazine has never let me down I find that I enjoy the section that they have called "Real Estate Sampler" as well as the product information that they have in the back of the book. I used to get over 16 Magazine Subscriptions, and for me to keep subscribing to this one speaks volumes(please check out my other Magazine reviews)The other Magazine that I liked about as much as this one along the same lines is House & Garden. Happy Reading	1
Great Magazine!	1
Just wonderful	1
Good magazine	1
I love this magazine. It has short articles that can be read on the run, and I learn something new everytime I read an issue.	1
The item came in excellent conditions, well packed, very nice NEW, no defect, as i expected. . . . .	1
Great magazine!	1
Fun magazine with helpful info.	1
Its a mag.	1
Good recipes and desiner tips. A nice magazine that I have a hard time tossing so I have all of them for the last two years.	1
Beautiful magazine	1
This is one of my favorite magazine. I look forward to it every month. It has a nice balance of all kinds of articles about different issues. It seems to cater to working single and married women.	1
love it!!! great ideas.	1
my wife is happy	1
for waiting area	1
Very informative !	1
Country living is liken to Southern, as being an excellent magazine fir past, current, and future for multiple sibjects, just love it, n keep them to re-read later! The photos is so much better than looking on sxreen, sometimes I just like to go bk n forth from one colorful page to another!!	1
I give Redbook a five star rating I have been reading this magazine for over thirty years.	1
Lovely photos. Nice recipes. Like the animal section as well. Lots of decorating and cooking inspiration.	1
thanks	1
I don't like the "experts" like that Ozborne girl with the purple hair or the black woman who is the make up "expert".  They use too many obese "models" and try to pass them off as "beautiful".  I don't get it.  Probably won't re-order again.	-1
Just not into magazines too many ads. But great price.	-1
great mag.	1
So far have only received one copy of it. A lot of  nice pictures not much helpful reading material	1
Great price	1
I like this subscription for this year, but I probably won't renew.  There are some useful articles, but I like Woman's Day better.	1
This magazine is very HUGE but worth the pocket money. It is highly affordable and a joy to read. Yes, there are a lot of ads but there is a lot of information in there too. Lots of great tips, stories, pictures, fashion advice, dating advice, some gossip, tips on makeup etc. Overall, it is a great magazine for the younger to older adult crowd. I really enjoy reading this magazine by the pool too. It is very interesting and addicting! I really enjoy it and will subscribe to it again when my time is up.	1
I hope this magazine never goes digital-only,. The editorial cartoons are too funny not to cut our & share. Some of the (very long) stories & articles are interesting, but there is a lot of specific NYC info to gloss over.	1
Redbook deserves a five-star rating because it is an up-to-the-minute, forward-looking magazine that for me never disappoints and I have subscribed to it for many years.	1
Great magazine	1
Very informative, lovely photographs and great recipes.	1
I've read REDBOOK since the early 1970s, and am disappointed by the content the magazine has published for the last decade or so.  REDBOOK used to feature housekeeping, literary excerpts, beauty and style.....now it's become another ho-hum mummy mag for a housewife generation that barely exists anymore.  They have the occasional celebrity, but you can get better information on Hollywood from PEOPLE or US WEEKLY.  This is for soccer moms, with little to offer anyone else.  Sad to see a great magazine lose so much of its quality and appeal.	-1
love it!	1
Excellent!	1
some interesting stuff.	1
Good recipes.	1
"How to Make a Baby Without Loosing Your Guy", "My Father the Fraudster", "I Was a High Functioning Alcoholic" are only a few of the disturbing titles from the July edition of Marie Claire, a (fashion?) magazine about 40% devoted to advertisements. The articles behind the titles are something an intern might have scribbled on her ciggie break from a more serious assignement (such as a coffee run). As for the few "fashion" layouts: July magazine received in June, with fashions for the fall (which, in my climate, does not start until Nov/December)...  Still, some of the photographs may eventually prove to be worth the five bucks I paid for a year's subscription...Oh, how sad...	-1
This magazine is very nice and has a lot of good information and tips. It is entertaining and fun to read.	1
nice to use magazines as gifts.. they are greatly received usually and something to look forward to instead of bills in the mail, lol	1
The magazine is good I just don't like the fact that it was renewed so early and automatically took the money from my account.  I tried to correct this very early on with no success!  Very upset with the whole process, not the magazine.  : (	-1
Got this one as a free edition on the Fire and loves the way it looks. I am not normally a Redbook reader but I enjoyed this.	1
I have always loved Country Living and it has never disappointed me.  If you are a newbie, then try it.  It's friendly and filled with great ideas.  You'll love it.	1
In the July 7 issue... Teen Vogue just published a "how-to" article on "A Guide to Anal Sex". As a parent, it is unbelievable that they think this is okay and reflects the gulf that separates what I believe is appropriate for my teens and what they obviously think it okay. I can no longer trust what my teens find in this magazine. Beware -- the cover makes it look harmless, but it is a wolf in sheep's clothing aimed squarely at your kids.	-1
Purchased two subscriptions for two coworkers who love this magazine. The articles, ideas and everything start to finish in this magazine fits their lifestyle. The ordering process was easy and so was the process for entering their specific addresses. I will make my life easier and do this again next year.	1
Too many ads and tabloid style writing make this publication not worth your while.	-1
Marie Claire is a cross between Vogue and Glamour -- it mixes news about the latest fashions with hard-hitting articles about women's prison and the date rape drug. Which makes it one of the most intelligent women's magazines around. If you are a chick that enjoys magazines such as Vogue, Glamour and Mademoiselle then you'll enjoy Marie Claire. I would recommend an annual subscription to this one!	1
GQ?  P-U!	-1
Photographs of beautifully decorated homes throughout the year keep me renewing my subscription!	1
i LOVE THIS MAGAZINE.	1
Love it!  Great Magazine!!	1
my home is a combination of traditional and country.  This magazine presents a comfortable semi-modern "country" look.  It is not your grandma's furniture, or if it is, it has been re-purposed and updated for today's family.	1
Redbook is a great general interest magazine that is useful for the businesswoman, fashionista, interior decorator and shopper in me! I look forward to every issue, and keep them around for months as reference material.  I really recommend Redbook as a gift for yourself or a friend!	1
My most favorite magazine ever!  Beautiful photos, great ideas and fun articles.  Well worth it!	1
very helpfull magazine	1
Great magazine that's given me some fashion tips I use every day.	1
Wasn't familiar with this magazine until recently. So glad I found it! Decorating ideas, recipes, and articles down to earth. Love it on my Kindle. A real keeper.	1
Like all the rest of these mags, the goal here is to create buzz so you "gotta have" the stuff they feature. Beautiful makeover feature? Honey, let's re-do the bathroom in these chic new colors. Garden much? Buy these new improved seeds and plant varieties. It's all so formulaic, and it goes on month after month. Why do I subscribe to these things? Well, they are often offered for $5 per year in late winter, and I am ever hopeful for actual content. In the end I can donate them, or trade for quilt mags.	-1
love it...super cheap and easy to view on my kindle fire hd	1
I really enjoy this magazine.  Have been subscribing for several. Great ideas in every issue, and wonderful pictures.. Try it, you'll like it.	1
Love this magazine!  Last month Redbook had a wonderful workout and great practical recipes that I am acturally going to attempt. I learn something new in every issue which is totally what I am looking for in a publication.	1
When I was younger I used to sneak peeks of my mom's copy of Redbook, feeling like I was really getting away with something devious.  Today, a little older, a little wiser and I still find myself sneaking off with a copy of Redbook and feeling like I'm getting away with something.  Only now it's my own copy and I'm usually sneaking off to soak in a bubble bath and relax while reading.  Not every article interests me, but how often do you really find a magazine that you truly care about every page, cover to cover?  They have a goal to reach a large audience of women with a huge variety of interests, so it's nearly impossible to appeal to every woman with every article.  However, I think they do a pretty darn good job and I have never finished an issue feeling disappointed.	1
I really like this magazine, even if its a woman's magazine.  Often I find these types of magazines filled with advertisements and articles that never seem to fit a real persons every day life.  This magazine features a nice cross section of information on fashion, decorating, cooking, and relationships.  I always find something interesting to read in here.	1
Just beautiful.  The pages display wonderful images that take me back home.  The price is extremely affordable.  I highly recommend subscription.	1
This is a real fun magazine for any men regardless of having a GQ status or not... Excellent snips of everything. Bravo.	1
I love Country Living and th gentle and simplistic style of this magazine and great articles.  Recommend to all gentle souls.	1
My favorite magazine.  I put down all the others and read this one as soon as it comes.  Want to go to a country fair some day,	1
I fell in love with Country Living after I read my first issue at my hair salon. The decorating tips, food and travel features and articles about other American homes is both entertaining and informative.  A recent issue featured travel in Mississippi, with the best restaurant and sightseeing stops as just one example.  Made me want to go there! Antiques, quirky pieces found at flea markets, crafts and trendy bits grace the homes, with advice on how to get the same look for yourself.  If you love Southern Living or Better Homes & Gardens, but can't afford the shocker price tags of their decorating styles, you'll really like Country Living.  It offers something for every style and income level - and goes beyond the "rooster cookie jar and gingham curtains" that most people visualize when they think of "country decor."  I asked my husband for a subscription for Christmas, and will continue to enjoy it for a lifetime! Highly recommend!	1
I have a subscription to this magazine until 2017. I would recommend. They have great ideas on holidays decorating, and so much more. Very inspiring.	1
Egads, what has happened to this beloved magazine??!!  I used to receive it in the mail years ago (mid-80's to I guess early or mid 90's) and it was one of my favorite mags back in the day.  I would pour over each page, salivating over the beautiful country and rustic pictures, and loved the country-themed articles.  Now it's just about rich New Yorkers and other city people with big time money buying their "country" retreats.  This magazine used to be down to earth, but now it's got a snobby feel to it.  NOT interesting at all anymore!  In the older Country Living, there used to be a column written by a woman named Jo Northrop. It was called "Simple Country Pleasures".  It was so good and I always looked forward to that.  Miss that very much.	-1
This is a good magazine with quite a few great ideals and cute updates for around the house.  I would recommend it to all.	1
Love the magazine. always end up letting my daughter borrow it.awesome price for what you are getting. Love to decorate	1
have to pare down money and time issues, so this one lost out, but its one of my favorites, its got great antique finds crafty ideas, i like that, but but verand and traditional home won the toss to keeep	1
Love everything about this mag! From the beautiful and easy to replicate home decor, to the recipes, tips and more! The photography is stunning and I can always find something in this mag that I would love to do in my own home, and can usually do it without breaking the bank!	1
Love the magazine	1
This is a great magazine it is't just about the old country style of years past. It is up-beat and up-dated in both its style and decorating ideas.	1
GQ is a publication that merits the adjective 'legendary'. As a frontrunner in its genre, it takes potshots from many angles but - one thinks of Mercedes-Benz or Oxford University - keeps on doing well what it does well. (This reviewer drives a Ford and attended Cambridge, so I'm trying to be generous here ...)  GQ is actually several magazines bound into one.  First, it is a high-end fashion catalogue. Unless you work your way through a *lot* of advertising pages to the material that follows, you may think you've picked up a catalogue rather than a 'quarterly'.  Second, GQ consistently presents excellent short and medium-length fiction and non-fiction writing. If the juxtaposition of preening male style with superb writing surprises you, well, welcome to the club. They're both undeniably here  between the same covers.  Finally, GQ offers great tips on style in a whimsical, always interesting way. Simply put, you can get edumacated on style by working through this third magazine bound into the GQ format.  As an avid reader and founder of an executive coaching company that includes guidance on how to look the part without spending the kind of money that shows up in 'Magazine A", I read Magazines B and C with gusto.  GQ is not everything. You may want to evade the whiff of pretension that comes from being seen with GQ tucked under your arm.  But if Magazine A, B, or C is what you're seeking, you may want to subscribe to this venerable legend.	1
For anyone that likes the less perfect in life or should I say items with character. I like how they show to use products in unexpected ways and the beautifully comfortable rooms and outdoor spaces that are highlighted.	1
They really seem to have turned around with their new editor in chief, who came on board in the September issue. They have some cool stories, even if some of them do get continued in the back, but that just means (depending on how far along you are), that you have the rest of the mag to look forward to. I don't really like any of the style tips and the clothes, and depending on how big the issue is, you'll have to trudge through about 30 pages of ads, before u get to the first page of the TOC. It's nice to see an Editor's column (or page) now, even though this EIC seems to be just a little too arrogant. Like every mature men's mag, they review CD's and books. I'd say 8 out of 12 issues are usually thick, and I'm not sure if the September issue (their last monstrously huge issue) will be like that this year or not, Overall, it's still very interesting. I love the font they now use on the cover and in a couple of sections of the mag. Very tech like.	1
Very easy and relaxing to read and the photos are always first class. Always plenty of decorating ideas and great recipes as well as a featured destination. A joy to browse through with many useful articles and interesting photos.	1
If you haven't read the New Yorker you should. Insightful reporting, riviting commentary, thoughtful fiction and a NY calendar that can't be beat.	1
Auto-Renewal stinks and I don't recommend it if you don't like surprises!  Great magazine with pretty, creative idea's for the whole house.  :)	-1
This is relatively light reading. Don't expect detailed plans for how to implement any of the ideas shown. However, I usually get at least a couple good ideas of out each issue. I prefer this magazine to Martha Stewart Living, which is more food-focused. Don't get me wrong - there are still plenty of food recipes in each issue of Country Living. However, it's a nice balance between articles on food, decor, DIY/crafts, flowers, and entertaining.  UPDATE: I used to look forward to receiving my issues in the mail. However, the magazine seems to be going in a new direction. One part of that is focusing more on older items, such as expensive vintage items I could never afford to buy. Another part is focusing on rustic items with patina, but to me, the items just look rusty and neglected. Those gruff items are pricey too. I don't want to fill my home with a bunch of nonsense items. That includes the nature-inspired items such as taxidermy. I'm not sure what is going on with this magazine to be honest. It's still somewhat enjoyable to read, but I may not renew my subscription.	1
Great magazines for snobs, college students who wishes to become writers and/ or humorists. I maybe be a bit of a snob but I do enjoy this magazine for great reading and cartoons.	1
This is a wonderful magazine if you are a fan of - as the magazine title says - Country Living. There is bit of a modern edge to it all too, which I think makes it even more accessible.  They refer to the Feb 2012 issue as "the White Issue" with decorating ideas that involve white/neutrals - lots of examples of antiques and replicas throughout the magazine.  just a a quick sample of what's inside -  * Collecting this month focuses on match safes with photos of gorgeous antique versions. * the center layout featuring a beautiful home done in pared back white and warm wood. * more on whites in formal and eclectic settings. * an article on the Coombs maple farm in Vermont with recipes for Sour Cream Pancakes with Maple-Pecan Butter and Tomato-Cheddar Strata.  I like that this is one magazine I subscribe to that I see prices quoted for little splurges that are affordable like simple/functional yet gorgeous custom stamped leather luggage tags for $13.95. This is already the second place in the issue in just the first few pages that highlights women artisans and made in the USA hand crafted goods. This magazine tries to keep things accessible to its readers, quoting sources we can use not just designer industry insiders.  Yes, there are a ton of ads (like pretty much any other magazine) but if the ads help keep my subscription cost to a measly $5 per year then the ads are fine with me!  Pleased with this purchase and definitely recommended.	1
I read some of the previous reviews and honestly I don't fully see where they are coming from. I've subscribed for about a year and a half and while I see some recaps on some similar exercises, they throw in new things a lot. There are a lot of recipes and notes on diets and such that I love, and they only talk about how bad fad diets are and don't advertise for them! Encourages and enlightens. It shows a way to incorporate exercise into any lifestyle and gives you the encouragement to continue an exercise regimen-- no matter how sedentary you are.	1
I love COUNTRY LIVING design.  Now that COUNTRY HOME and COTTAGE LIVING are no longer being published, it is one of the few sources for examples of well-done rural and country/cottage design.  The design found inside is original and there are excellent tips.  I look forward to receiving this magazine every month.	1
I ordered this magazine because it was on sale and I thought it would do well in our medical waiting room. I didn't expect to find 1/2 dozen ideas (many from the ads) in each issue that I could use in my own (Mid-Century Modern) home.  Very well done.  Addendum:  Been receiving this for months now and am always impressed with how interesting and innovative it is.  I love their advice this month to "Choose a contractor who listens to bluegrass."	1
I started reading Shape back in 03 when I went to college and I wanted to stay on a healthy track. It was great and had tons of fitness articles and helped me perfect my form. Since then its simply become all about beauty and fashion with maybe a little bit of fitness mixed in. And the fashion isn't even that good, who wants to spend $100 on a pair of workout pants? I don't. What is most sad is that its extremely repetitive, it shows the same movements different girl maybe on a beach or in a field somewhere. I'm still trying to figure out why all of a sudden the buff toned models they once had grace the covers have been replaced with frail, thin untoned celebrities.	-1
I gave this as a gift plus I've been receiving this magazine for over twenty years myself.  It has changed over the years but so have we, so I'm glad it stays updated.  The colors burst off the pages of gardens we would love to own and you get to meet the gardener.  The recipes are to die for since I've kept so many of them and use them over and over again.  They always take you to a small town somewhere in the U.S. that makes you want to get in your car and go.  It's a warm, down to earth, grab your heart, kind of magazine.  I love it, who wouldn't.	1
If your "Country Living" is out in the boondocks or in the middle of Manhattan, this decorating and country "lifestyle" magazine is for you. The ideas are wonderful, and realistic enough that most of them are truly adaptable to your own individual needs. Yes, there are lots of advertisements, but the advertisements are for goods and services that you would actually use, and much of the information they contain is very useful. I've made purchases directly based on the information found in those advertisements.  Country Living is the kind of magazine that you'll read and keep for reference. It's a useful tool for creating a gracious home -- always an ongoing activity!  Ordering this subscription from Amazon was a mega money saver!	1
This magazine is one of my favorite magazines.  Going through this magazine is like sitting down with my good friend, having a cup of tea, and talking about how to garden, make over my house and eat healthier all in one hour.  The pictures are beatiful. The homes that this magazines shows are usually realistic and always lovely. Many of the ideas are creative ones that anyone with a little bit of talent can do for themselves. The homes tend to lean towards a country charm and a more classic, lived in look than the show room homes typically seen in a magazine.  The minute this magazine arrives in my mail I'm opening it and browsing and looking through to see what interesting articles they have this month.  Well worth the money. enjoy.	1
This magazine has been my dads favorite since I as a kid. He cuts the jokes he likes out and mails them to my brother and I. This makes Father's Day gift giving a cinch.	1
I am a voracious reader of business periodicals.  I subscribe to and read four business magazines and three financial newspapers on a regular basis.  Between Forbes, Fortune and BusinessWeek, I always look most forward to receiving my next issue of Forbes.  Why?  Several reasons: - The articles are generally shorter and more "to the point" than Fortune.  Forbes is also not as beholden as BusinessWeek is to cover the hot news stories. - This magazine is the best of the three for discovering new investment ideas and it is generally more investor focused than either Fortune or BW. - The editorials throughout the magazine are usually thought-provoking and I guarantee you will develop your own favorite columnists whom you will look forward to reading in each issue - Forbes has a politically conservative and pro-business slant (with Steve Forbes as Editor-in-Chief, that should be no surprise). - Forbes offers two supplemental issues, which are quarterly.  Forbes ASAP is entirely focused on technology and many articles are actually thought pieces written by influential executives, investors, and technology visionaries.  Forbes FYI features lighter articles which are thematically aimed at the upper class.  You will probably find some of the stories (and the ads) irrelevant to your life (we're not all millionaires yet, are we?).  But it's an amusing magazine and it's a good break for me from the stream of more business-oriented stuff I read. I do enjoy all three of the major business magazines I mentioned.  But if you made me drop two of them, I'd keep Forbes. The reasonable price is just icing on the cake and gives you no excuse not to try it out.  I bet you'll be hooked.	1
Always a good read.	1
You don't have to live in New York to enjoy the New Yorker. Most of the content in the New Yorker can be applied nationally. The feature articles in the magazine have a depth, research, and accuracy that can not be found in other magazines. I love reading the fiction, and viewing the witty comics. Like most New Yorkers this magazine leans slightly to the left.  Pros - Fact-checking - Accuracy - Fiction  Cons - A little pricey	1
Well worth the money. I have over 16 Magazine Subscriptions and had to look at the ones I wanted to keep and toss the ones I could shed. "Shape" was a MUST have for me. The articles were inspiring, provided alternative work-outs, up to date Work-out fashions, reviewed recreational outlets for fitness. Definately worth every penny. Do yourself a favor if you are planning on getting on some kind of work out kick or just looking for inspiration "TO" start on one. Subscribe to this magazine, you will not be sorry. Happy Reading	1
This review is on the magazine Forbes and not the Amazon subscription or subscription process.  Forbes is a "to the point" magazine.  I appreciate that.  The articles a short, concise and not lacking in information.  While I also read a few other financial magazines, Forbes is the one I will go back to and grab to reread a particular point about a particular issue.  This magazine, while full of ads like the others, offers a great deal of insight between the covers.  Honestly, if I were to be asked to specify just one financial magazine to read, Forbes would be my answer.	1
Very cool and informative. If you like money, this is a good source of information and philosophy.	1
The New Yorker was started by Harold Ross as a humor magazine, and grew into one of the world's most celebrated literary magazines. It never really made money or had a huge circulation, but survived thanks to the generosity of a number of private owners and publishers. I began reading the New Yorker thanks to my mother, who subscribed for nearly four decades. Through it I discovered Berton Rouche's fascinating "Medical Detective" stories, Calvin Trillin's hilarious stories about food and travel, the brilliant writing of John McPhee, and scores of other contemporary reporters and short story writers. Then, in the 1980s, Trisha Brown then managed to completely trash the magazine in only a few short years. Circulation took off- for a time, at least- but the reputation of the New Yorker was sacrificed as it was turned into a gossip magazine. The low point, for me, at least, was a fawning article on poor Erich Honnekar's trial in Germany where he was being charged for ordering the shootings of those East Germans who tried to flee to the west. (Brown's husband, it turned out, had been retained by Honnekar's defense team to do PR work). Old time subscribers defected by the thousands, and the new subscribers, being a fickle lot, let their subscriptions lapse as well once The New Yorker was no longer a hip fashion accessory to be seen on your coffeetable alongside the latest issue of Interview. In recent years the magazine has regained some- but not all- or its former glory. The political analysis is still of the fawning variety (neither the Clintons nor the Kennedys can do any wrong) and the fiction has become even more parochial, but a lot of the good reporting has returned. I don't subscribe, but I do peruse issues on the newstand regularly in case I might come across a particularly intersting story. I suggest you might do the same.	1
I have taken this magazine for about 2 years now, and personally, I enjoy it quite a bit. I am not a native of the New York area, nor have I any affiliations with the fine city. Personally I find the articles to be so well written in the New Yorker it is hard to put down. For me this means the first section of the paper is under appreciated, as its all about New York City, gossip and much more. The articles are of a wide varity of topics and often bring up points that may have had rolling around in your conscious but have never let them bubble up to the top. Fascinating articles can range from politics, famous lives of famous peoples, religious societies, and so much more. This magazine is great if you are a reader. Articles are wordy, and worthwhile. This isn't something your going to be reading just the highlights through. I hardly find myself able to finish a magazine before the next one comes. If you are open minded, and love to read quality articles that will make you think, this magazine for you.	1
Terrific magazine on a wide variety of firms both known and up in coming on Wall Street	1
This magazine is a good read a lot of times. I usually find a good article or two...if not most of the time. I also like the leader board section, esp. the conversation part. However, this has a lot of ads.	1
This is another magazine issue  cover that Im well aware is most likely going to change within 7-10 days. However, the 2015 Investment Guide Special Issue of Forbes Road Map To Riches; Your 32 Best Investment Ideas are also a treasure trove of a variety of information.  25 years of guaranteed income starts on page 108, buying a house in the suburbs page 120,  feature on investors and African economies starts on page 125, a feature on Brazil and their booming beauty business  starts on page 172, and a feature on umberto angeloni listed to be fashions comeback king and based out of Italy starts on page 178. Im also holding a special edition of Forbes that has the listing of the Forbes 400 (listed to be the identitive randking of the richest people in America) that was listed for display until January 5, 2015. Jerry yang is on the front of the cover and there is a feature listed to be a scorecard consisting of men and women who are self-made and those who are silver spoon.  An article on Business Aviation (pages  117-122), pages  130-132 feature the rankings of the 15th to the 19th richest people in America, and pages 168-174 feature the  167th to 190th richest. Forbes also has other special edition magazines such as the 2015 Investment Guide Special Issue of the Road Map To Riches titled Your Best 32 Investment Investment Ideas and listed to Display Until March 16, 2015. The Leader Board (page 32) and 25 Years of Guaranteed Income (starts on page 108) are some of the article features with the Forbes Special issue 2015 Investment Guide. As mentioned in a previous review, I would be fine with being employed until Im at least 85. The only reason why my husband and I are already planning to save enough money to comfortably retire by the late 2030s/early2040s is because of our shared belief that social security in the U.S. will not pay enough for even a cheap apartment  by the time the late 2040s/early 2050s roll around. Additionally, we are both aware that were part of a generation where retirement accounts are our responsibility, self-employment may be necessary and not just a take it or leave it option, and also preparing for the possibility of age related discrimination still existing for both the male and female genders of all races/ethnicities (especially with me being a minority woman).	1
It has been a while since I moved out of NYC, and there are times I wish I hadn't left. The New Yorker keeps me up to date with every aspect that makes New York the most eclectic city in the world. I get the news, political columns, book reviews, and the latest trends in fashion. Also, the New Yorker is one of the few magazines that still publishes fiction. I love reading the short stories they publish! The New Yorker has staying power -- and I shall continue to subscribe to this intelligent and edgy magazine for many years to come.	1
(...)"The New Yorker" does set the standard. I can't agree with every idea, and not every standard they set is worth chasing. However, the sum of this magazine, helped founded by the great wit Dorothy Parker, is a solid thinking, literary, humorous magazine. I won't belabor my review analyzing "The New Yorker" to death, but give it a shot. Read it, and be a better rounded, better thinking person as a result. I fully recommend "The New Yorker." Anthony Trendl	1
I read this magazine for leaderships of companies before I invest stocks. It is important to invest stocks with good leaders and the articles are educational and also warned the investers of companies that are failing or going out of business. I recommended this magazine for anyone who wishes to know the innovative leaders and their companies.	1
I know this will read as a generic review. Truth is I saw I had over 200+ reviews to leave, and as an avid buyer on amazon, I wanted to help my fellow buyers. However, after I spent over 5 hours leaving detailed reviews with a rate of another 72 hours to go, 3 full days, I realized I will prepare some basic reviews to help buyers decide if a product is worth buying.  I hope this helps, and one day when I have more time, I will go back to leaving more lengthy reviews. I will try to be as accurate as I can while brief.  This is a market-leader. I absolute look forward to it arriving in the mail, and reading it from Cover-to-Cover. The insight & knowledge found in these pages are out-worldly. Strongly Suggest	1
The top 4 biz mags in rank order from my perspective are the new Bloomberg BW, Forbes, Economist, and Fortune.  Forbes is fringier in its offerings. Forbes delivers a variety of unique perspectives not found elsewhere and is kind of like a monthly WSJ in editorials and opinion. Of the top four I referenced, Fortune vs Forbes is perhaps the most commonly considered in competition. The winner is a no-brainer - I'll reach for Forbes over Fortune every time.  Amazon has come far in its mag offerings from a pricing standpoint. The subscription manager service that Amazon offers resolves expirations and earlier renewal phishing expeditions by publishers.	1
I agree that it's not as good as it used to be, but it's still the best. It seems that there has been an across-the-board change toward the 30-second sound bites. You only see some of that in Forbes, but it's annoying. If I want that, I can go online to any of the major news networks.  Forbes still has the best financial and business analysis for the U.S. The Economist might edge it out on international issues, but that's not an apples-to-apples comparison. It beats Business Week and the other domestic rags.  The only complaint is the number of multi-page ads in the middle of the story and it being hard to see where the ad ends and the story continues. That may be by design, but it's annoying.  Another good thing about Forbes is that it's written well. It's like the Atlantic for the business world. I currently subscribe to both and have subscribed, at one time or another, to the other magazines that I've mentioned as well.	1
As a subscriber to this magazine for the past two years, I can say without reservation that it is simply terrific. I look forward to each and every issue. Glossy and colorful, it is replete with many well written articles and essays on exotic, little known, or far away places, as well as on off beat or high adrenaline sports. There are also many eye catching, superlative photographs that illustrate and illuminate. If one is interested in mountaineering, rock climbing, hiking, skiing, snowboarding, sailing, or travel to little known places where one may indulge in these activities, then this magazine will be of interest. It is packed with information that will appeal to those who have an active, adventurous lifestyle, as well as to armchair adventurers, of which I am one.	1

I understand that a different months magazine issue may already be available by the time I post this review. However, I admit that I spotted this November 2014 magazine issue of Outside at my job and obviously decided to take a chance on it.  There are interesting articles in this issue such as: page sixty to seventy one titled under Work< Play, Live: This Way Forward An Eight Step Plan For Rebooting Your Career and Finding A Job You Love by Abe Streep. Illustrations are by Peter Arkle and the following are some of the men and women featured: Adam Fetcher 37, Director of Global PR And Communications Patagonia. Fetcher worked on multiple press jobs  in the Department of Homeland Security, he then worked on President Obamas re-election campaign in 2012, and launched a communications firm in Minnesota before being contacted by Patagonia in 2013. Tom Stewart, Michael Charley, and Megan Miller are some of the multiple people featured within the inspirational article. What I enjoyed the most about the story being written is that some of the men and women featured are in their late 30s/early 40s which sends a positive message that a person can experience a career breakthrough later in life regardless of their professional aims and/or what their skeptics think.	1
Bought for a friend who enjoys the content of this magazine very much.  And, this friend is NOT a guy!  So ladies, if you like to know how things tick you will enjoy.  It isn't all about cars, as the title may lead you to believe.	1
Perfect for hands-on people.	1
I subscribe to many outdoor themed magazines and have to say that I have never seen a magazine take such a dive in quality as quickly and drastically as this.  Gone are the great tales of survival and adventure (except in one issue per year).  Instead the magazine is filled with dozens of glossy photos of males modeling overpriced clothing.  Add to this the sheer volume of advertisements and you have very little left for stories or expeditions.  Most of the travel notes are for places that cost terribly much money and would be better represented in Conde Naste or National Geographic Traveler.  For true outdoor enthusiasts I recommend Runners World (it is geared towards running but does feature some great product reviews), Trail Running, and National Geographic Adventure.  Outside magazine is obviously a marketing outlet and I am sure they make big income from the obviously biased product reviews and destination write ups.  I understand this is how the world works... but I will find other sources for my outdoor fix... such as actually going outdoors.  This is not the magazine for true outdoor enthusiasts, but for those who want to dream about buying the gear and never actually using it.  Update:  So I'm not on an auto renewal plan or anything, but I have been getting this magazine for about 3 years now... and it's followed me to my new apartment without me submitting a new address! (Seriously, they are printing my new address - not the post office stickers!).  I think that maybe because I don't really want the magazine, some karmic force out there is punishing me with free issues!  At least my apartment workout room is getting some literature, because it goes from my mailbox, right into the magazine holder there.	-1

I ordered this for my 13 year old son.  He loves this magazine so far.  He has received 2 issues and said he really likes it.  My husband had subscriptions in the past, but we cancelled as he never had time to read it.  He always liked it and now that we have it coming for our son, I imagine he will find time to "borrow" it!	1
Much more objective than the pop-science of  Scientific American which became so slanted that I stopped reading it. The sky isn't falling and nobody really knows for sure what the correct climate and temperature for earth in 2015 is supposed to be in spite of what the pop-scientists at Scientific American say. Good investment.	1
I have been reading Popular Mechanics for years, I find their articles more varied than before and very interesting.	1
Great read	1
I have subscribed to "Kiplinger's" for a number of years now, and will continue to do so into the foreseeable future. The magazine is inexpensive, timely, and authoritative, and conveys complex financial concepts in easily comprehensible terms. The magazine is very in favor of long term, high quality stock market investing, and on a monthly basis covers something relevant to current investment issues in the stock market. It also covers important information on taxes, retirement, paying for tuition, mortgages, and making good car buying (or leasing) decisions. The magazine is a great source of news as it is related to your financial life in ways that are sometimes obvious, and sometimes less so. For instance they have articles on annuities, which you would expect, but also on drug costs, which you might not. They also have extremely useful mutual fund performance charts in every issue, which I find to be among the best features in the magazine. With the passage of different tax laws, "Kiplinger's" writes on the practical implications of the Federal tax code changes as well as regularly looking at state tax issues. There are many personal financial magazines covering many different areas available today. If you want only one that will give you the overall most valuable information per page, "Kiplinger's" would be tough to beat.	1
My retirement plan sends me a magazine, which is so boring that I don't even bother to open it anymore; Kiplinger's isn't at all like that.  The best part of Kiplinger's is that it describes how real people with average salaries, kids, and debts can invest for the future.  There are also some great articles for parents about how to teach their kids to manage their money.  Everything seems practical, but I've yet to try any of it.  The magazine is broken into four sections: `Ahead' short articles about finance news and current event, `investing' about investing mostly stocks, `your money' about ways to invest your money though not as technical as the investing section and more diverse, and `spending' which is basically general interest about new fun technologies and other ways to spend all the money saved or made through investing.	1
Great Mag and interesting	1
My husband LOVES this magazine and you cant beat Amazon's price.	1
Terrific magazine on a wide range of products	1
I liked this magazine for the articles are great and it is ideal for science students who are curious and it is also educational for anyone who reads it. I recommended this to anyone who love to read and learn the breakthroughs of science and medicine.	1
Very Interesting.  Discover articles are always informative, and alwys worth the time to read, and keep for future reference. I always keep back issues.	1
Love this magazine. Lots of good information about day to day items we buy, and how to get the best value for your money.	1

I have bought this publication for many years and am never disappointed with the content.  I would never buy a product without consulting this organization.	1
love the gift give them to many people.really a great gift thanks so very very very much. Thanks thanks thanks thanks	1
It's just disappointing where this magazine has gone. Last month, I had the "pleasure" of reading a bombastic self-description of how a surgeon saved a patient's airway from his anesthesiologist. The article was so narcissistic and the story was so improbable for anybody who works in an operating room, that I'm 100% sure it was never fact-checked, not to speak about running it by an independent expert.  Since then, I don't trust what I read there, and the magazine is too glossy for toilet paper, so I'll just cancel the subscription.	-1
Discover packs a lot of understandable and rather advanced topics into an interesting fly-over mag. It's overall quality as source is improving with time.	1
Perfect	1
I currently subscribe to three science magazines - the other two being Scientific American and Science Illustrated. Each magazine presents the news of science in its own special way.  In the current issue I am reading (all magazines change their format over time), the first section is called "Data" and it covers the latest science news on a variety of topics. This is followed by section consisting of a series of articles each no more that several pages long. A favorite of mine is called "Vital Signs" which usually covers some intriguing, difficult to solve, true life medical mystery. This month's issue was about a 16-month old boy with a lemon-sized mass in his chest. A theme of this current issue is called "The Cure" involving a series of articles on possible cures on the horizon for AIDS, various vaccines for illnesses such as cancer, diabetes and allergies, and a very interesting article on Bio Hackers also known as do-it-yourself biology (DIYbio). These articles provided more in depth coverage of the material.  If you are very interesting in science, you probably will subscribe to several magazines. I would include Discover in that collection.	1
While Popular Mechanics is for a little bit of everything, and Popular Science is great for ideas, Discover is pure science.  Sure, there is some speculative science, but for the most part it is solid and well thought out.	1
Received the first copy way ahead of schedule and as always Consumer Reports does not lie. We don't leave home with it.	1
DISCOVER is an excellent source of scientific information presented in a easy to comprehend entertaining prose.  Kenneth Haft Glen Allen	1
Good magazine.  Interesting articles and advice that I can use.	1
Consumer Reports has been around for years and is one of the best sources not only of product reviews, but also of guidelines for purchasing products.  I don't always end up buying the models they recommend (sometimes newer ones have been released) but I always feel as if I am a better, more intelligent consumer after reading their articles.	1
We have enjoyed "Discover" magazine for several years and have found that is has improved over time. The magazine generaly provides well written and solid articles, geared for the layman. My science minded teens also enjoy it and have used some of the contents as the basis for science projects.  Discover covers a wide range of science and technology related fields, including phyiscs, bio-engineering, medical, space, energy, and more. The photos and diagrams are good and mostly useful, but can sometimes be "hit or miss".  For science and technology presented in clear format for the layman, this magazine is recommended! You might also be interested in&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Seed/dp/B000B7VBOG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Seed</a>	1
This magazine is insightful and thought-provoking. And when I ordered it the last issue was sent immediately and we have received every issue since--great service.	1
good	1
Its a mag.	1
I love Popular Mechanics and Popular Science. So much new information, and so interesting.	1
This is a great magazine, very informative and helpful when looking to buy items. While I don't always pick their choice, it helps to avoid lesser rated items/brands that I might have been tempted to buy.	1
Worth the yearly subscription price	1
The February 2015 magazine issue of kiplingers personal finance features a money question about a mother who appears to love her daughter dearly. However, she does admire her daughter for championing worker rights in garment workers in poor countries, buys trade coffee while using Pandora and Spotify (page 16). Im going to avoid weighing in on the issue because Im lucky to have bought/ and have the chance to purchase cds, some multiple from certain artists/groups/musicians across different genres while also using Pandora and iheartradio. There is a picture of a couple deeply in love on the next page in the spirit of valentines day and a link on where to go for heart healthy tips in observance of February being American heart month.  Starting on page 60, there are ideas on what a person can reasonably do with one thousand dollars.	1
This magazine is as close to the way things should be as is possible given the entirely enormous amount of variations in products, and the hundreds of thousands of types of products there are to be purchased.  And, even though they try to distance themselves from their founder Ralph Nadar for fear of looking political -- his sensibility, transparency, accountability, HONESTY shines through.	1
Love this magazine	1
Excellent Value!	1
Discover is a very successful magazine, and it acheived that success  with a formula that owes as much to the example of "People" magazine as it does to anything. It manages with cover all sorts of cutting edge stories without ever actually getting into the actual science involved. Instead, it concentrates on the people involved, the politics, the history... anything but the science. Here's an example: A recent issue had an interesting piece on the physics of rocks skipping... expect it wasn't on the physics of rock skipping so much as it was on a particular fellow was was the world's champion rock skipper. Yes, there *was* a formula in a side bar that purported to describe the physics of a skipping rock, and some of the terms were even defined... but there was no explanation of the formula, or even any numbers. It was simple "Here's a formula. It's very impressive looking, isn't it? Now on to other things." And there was some history of how people looked at rock skipping, and even some allusions to how the physics of rock skipping had applications in understanding the physics of other phenomena. But what you couldn't find in the entire article was a single sentance that actually discussed the physics involved! So what Discovery really is, is a magazine about science and scientists that doesn't actually have any science in it. And while there's a place for that sort of thing, if you're looking for actual discussions of science and technology that are still presented in a way that the educated non-scientist can understand, you'd be far better off with New Scientist or Science Week. And if a few equations wouldn't scare you off, American Scientist.	-1
Consumer Reports is the main magazine of the largest and oldest consumer organization in the world.  They have other publications and a great (not free) website.  They don't accept advertising or allow companies to use their reviews to market their products.  It's a great magazine to read for fun, and I wouldn't think of buying anything significant without consulting it, as it educates about features and other issues about products.  They're particularly good on new and used cars, and take one through the whole purchasing process.  One aspect I really enjoy is the amazing charts and tables.  And the inside back cover has hysterically funny and ironic 'mistakes' made in companies' advertisements.  One isn't always going to agree with their reviews -- individuals may value aspects of a product that they consider trivial -- but not reading their reviews to learn about what's out there would be a big mistake.	1
When I was an undergraduate, I used to get this magazine every month, and I loved it.  I loved the broad range of topics from archeology to cybernetics and everything in-between.  Then the other day, I picked up a copy of Discover, and I just wanted to put it down.  I'm a grad student, and I read technical journals all the time, so when I pick something up for pleasure reading I want it to be mindless, and Discover is not.  Many of the topics that I know about were explain in more detail than I would have expected for a lay publication. The articles are well written and each is fully explained so that anyone not in the field who reads them carefully could understand them.  I think Discover is great for anyone who is not a scientist but has a broad interest in scientific advances or for undergraduates who aren't sure which field to pursue.	1
I've been a subscriber for about five years now.  A couple of times, I've considered not renewing.  Then I'll get an issue that seems to make the entire year's subscription worth it.  Stuff like washing machines, new cars, computer monitors, even sunscreen.  At a minimum, these truly independent reviews (the organization is non-profit and the magazine is ad-free) focus you on the pivotal issues regarding each product and provide questions to ask in making your purchase.  At its best, it pretty much does your screening for you and all that's left for you to do is choose between 2 or 3 brands.  I also have to admit I get a good chuckle out of the last page, where consumers have submitted ads or product descriptions that are either misleading or just erroneous.  Every issue is not necessarily useful.  I think it's ridiculous for them to review things like cereal or restaurants, which I feel are personal preferences, or detergents, which are pretty similar nowadays.  But think about this magazine subscription as insurance against a bad purchase or as an investment that can pay you back several times over by saving you hundreds of dollars.  Bottom line:  it's worth the money.	1
Another but modernizing standard read.	1
So many good articles. Always has new information keeping up with the times.	1
Haven't got one for a while it is 12 issues missing quite a few but really love it she is only received four of them.	1
An annual subscription provides so many articles and financial tips that you can use, regardless of your financial situation, that the magazine will pay for itself! Taxes, insurance, investments, retirement, home ownership and major purchases.  I really like to gift an annual subscription for friends who are having trouble getting a handle on their finances. They've come back and thanked me for introducing them to Kiplinger's Personal Finance -- and they've renewed their subscriptions.  Our family uses this magazine and&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Consumer-Reports/dp/B000W3MB48/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Consumer Reports</a>&nbsp;to help us make all of our major purchases. We've saved money on cars, TVs, washers, dryers, refrigerators and a gas grill.	1
I buy this for my husband who has rebuilt many a car in his life. We renew every year. My husband had a stroke 9 months after our wedding, and for this reason can no longer work on cars. This doesn't mean that he cannot still enjoy reading about cars though.	1

Kiplinger's Personal Finance is a worthy challenge to Money Magazine for a monthly dose of economic and investing trends, helpful financial tips, and - in KPF's case - a kind of populist advocacy for the little guy investor.  I came to KPF by way of the well-read hand-me-downs of one of Kiplinger Letters (for which, see elsewhere on [...]) that were pressed into my hands by my mother-in-law 25 years ago.  She probably thought that without I'd lead her daughter into the financial wilderness, where we would thirst and die in good romantic fashion.  I eventually migrated up the Kiplinger food chain to the glossier KPF and have never left.  Much of the information provided by KPF (mutual fund and ETF results and the like) are widely available. The same could be said of the investing advice (look for no-loads with low fees, diversify, don't bail under pressure).  Where KPF excels is in the short articles and tips, which have often prodded me to take money- and/or sanity-saving moves. Two fine recent examples: the articles in the September 2006 issue entitled 'Buy a 2006 car on sale?' and '5 things to ask about silk ties'.  Both of these articles provided solid input into two buying decisions I'm likely to make in the new year. What's more, the conclusions reached by these two authors are probably *not* the ones you'd anticipate.  In terms of macro-economic instincts, the Kiplinger Washington Editors run bullish, though not quite so much as Money's more cosmopolitan-posed writers. KPF won't lure you into buying quite as many fancy gentleman's toys either, a fact that is well observed by their authors, who tend to be mutual fund companies rather than designer suit or German auto makers.  Don't get me wrong, I read other financial rags and might not be as enthusiastic about KPF if it were my only source. But KPF's monthly arrival is still always welcomed, as it has been for years. It remains firmly entrenched in my top tier.	1
Anither fav	1
always enjoy GH.	1
POSITIVES Good Housekeeping is a good magazine in the traditional old fashion way with lots of updates. Great gift. Each month there are various topics -- this is not only about cleaning and is about housekeeping a much more general sense for example  -- Nice smoothie recipes, outdoor hints, ways to slash bills, weight loss hints, make overs, cut college costs, cut fat, dieting, hair, tax tips, getting more done quickly, decorating, careers, wellness (health and financial as well as relationships), etc. Lots of helpful information.  NEGATIVES There are MANY advertisements (guess this is how they keep the cost so low to subscribe).  HIGHLY RECOMMEND	1
great mag.	1
Always here on time, always good. Enjoy reading the issues.	1
I grew up reading this supurb magazine. I have only found one other handyman magazine that I also love with plenty of household tips and small projects.	1
So much info.... it boggles the mind. I enjoy each issue.	1
Great magazine	1
great addition for the waiting room	1
I subscribed because I like the magazine. I still do. It comes , I read it. It is informative. Educational.	1
Great Magazine, lots of good suggestions and ideas.	1
I enjoy the magazine	1
Perfect	1
Good Housekeeping is a magazine I have received for over thirty years!!  I enjoy reading it and I will continue on with subscriptions as long as they put the magazine out there!!  Thank you Good Housekeeping!!	1
I love recipes and meal ideas that spice up a dinner! Thanks for a few more successful things to try!	1
I used to get this magazine many years  ago...Its alot smaller than it used to be...But its still a great magazine....	1
Pop-Mech is the necessary bookend to Pop-Sci. Pop-Mech explores the hands on tech as it emerges. It's the tool and tech geek must have to consider the application of innovation to problems. The latest gizmos are dastardly creative! I've lost count of the stuff I've bought and tried over the years after seeing them here first.	1
Awesome magazine full of very household information.	1
Great read. Lots of variety! Super price!!	1
Good magazine!!!	1
If you don't turn off amazon auto renewal, you'll be resubscribed at market price.  Unsubscribing from auto renew is very easy, so not a big issue.  Great magazine, amazing price.	1
This is a review of the magazine and not the subscription through Amazon.  Good Housekeeping, like many magazines if its ilk, makes its money on advertising.  Given that fact, many pages are nothing but either ads or infomercials.  Once past that, there really IS a good magazine hidden between those pages.  I have been an on again and off again subscriber since the early 80s when I returned to the U.S. after a five year stint in the military living in Europe.  You might find it odd but this magazine helped with my transition to the land of consumerism and commercialism.  Good Housekeeping keeps up with trends and ideas for the modern home.  From solar water systems to water heated floors, from pink rose pedals to rose hip tea, GH has been there.  Given the duration this magazine has been in operation, earning a Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval is sometimea a boon to business and that push needed for national recognition.  GH is NOT a controversial magazine.  The editors would probably have coronaries just at the thought of causing controversy.  This is an enjoyable read, cover to cover, once the advertising is overlooked.  But sometimes, that advertising is just what is needed.	1
Excellent!	1
I bought this and several other magazines for the library in my classroom.  The kids like to look over magazines when they have a few minutes to kill.  They like this one and the price was good on special.	1
Great product!	1
worth the auto-renew price for sure.  It's got lots of  different fun & interesting articles.  Sometimes it sits on my table for quite a while before I read it, but it's pretty decent.	1
Good recipes and product info.	1
Too many drug ads.	1
Popular Mechanics remains as unique and creative a magazine as it was 3 decades ago when I was reading it as a kid. The new tech info and gear is awesome.  I love the projects but have little time to complete them. I think the magazine provides wonderful entertainment value and I appreciate the hard work of the writers and editors.

Great Magazine for the price!!	1
Many ideas and very informational to plan family activities.	1
Great buy! Has the best coupons too!	1
Popular Mechanics is a magazine dedicated to mechanics, repair, industry, and technology. This magazine offers timely articles that are often intelligent, thought- provoking, and often fascinating and/or awe- inspiring. They often talk about mechanical achievements, impressive technology, record- setting feats, etc. These articles show what humans are capable of doing and they remain in your memory for some time.  These achievement- type articles are often the best in each issue, however, Popular Mechanics is more than just a magazine about incredible achievements. With Popular Mechanics, you get articles about cars, home improvement, repair, etc., which are more practical than anything. Car enthusiasts often enjoy Popular Mechanics more than anyone, due to the magazine's consistent articles on automobiles and reviews of automobiles. There are, in fact, multiple articles on automobiles and/or automotive technology in each issue and they are often among the lengthiest in the magazine.  Besides cars, Popular Mechanics likes to devote space to the subject of home repair and improvement. These articles are nice because they offer practical advice that can help do- it- yourself readers save a good deal of cash. They are often educational in nature, too. How Your House Works, for example, is a subsection of the Home department and it describes in detail how a certain part of your home functions. It might sound boring at first, but it is often fascinating to learn what goes on behind the walls, under the foundation, inside the appliances, etc. Sometimes, the educational lesson is obvious but other times, the lessons learned are eye- opening and will expose homeowners to things about their home they never knew existed.  Popular Mechanics is, overall, a very nice publication that I will continue to read. I like the articles that emphasize fascinating innovation and achievement best, but I can also agree that the home and automotive articles are very practical and useful. The over- emphasis on automobiles is a small complaint about Popular Mechanics, but the magazine as a whole is very good and very readable.	1
Great magazine for our era of hyperactive technology. Technology is always being updated, and, really, we are still trying to keep up with it. This magazine is helpful in doing so. It covers a variety of topics, and, the content is rich in facts and explanations. This is a great magazine filled with great information for those who love technology and appreciate what is has done for us in the past and the future. Great product, great articles. I'd say buy it if you like the aspect of learning and keeping up with technology and its niches, ideas, inventions and advice.	1
Its a mag	1
This magazine went down the tubes after Disney sold it.  They have half the pages than the old magazines - and about 70% is now advertising.  This used to be my favorite magazine with very little advertising and tons of brilliant ideas. It was mobbed with pinterest type-ideas for families and kids.  Great write-ups on local vacation destinations.  Ways to conquer boredom, etc...  Now, they are all recycled and lack any creativity.  You can see they are in for the advertising.  If you are okay with spending the money on a little pamphlet, then by all means go ahead.	-1
Just not into magazines too many ads. But great price.	-1
In the midst of the feel-good stories, decorating bits and lifestyle tips, are the ads. And the Buy Buy articles. And the Buy Buy articles disguised as decorating bits and lifestyle tips. Buy this new paint color, this nail polish that Michele wears, this facial scrub that takes years off, this trendy chevron rug in nauseating colors, this "slimming" dress with the peplum (!!), and this green cleaner that sounds great but really doesn't clean well. These cards will make your guests feel special ($25 for 5) and we found this costume ring for $150. What a deal!!  And there is a new feature, how families are managing to live well on a miserly $100,000 per year!!! WOW. We do it on 15 since I got laid off 4 years ago. This all makes me want to throw up a little bit. I will say that getting on the email list is good if you like chatty 10 Best Lists. About 2x weekly you'll get 10 Things to Never Eat, 12 Best Skin Helps, 10 Ways To Style Floating Shelves, etc. It's at least fun and they are not trying so hard to get you to buy something. I'm saving my issues to trade at the bookstore for quilt magazines.	-1
started with this mag when i was married 45 plus years ago....  have subscribed on and off and since then..have added...  many advertsing pages now..... seems "old" to me.  i compared it to other magazines such as "real simple" and i have to say i'd go with the latter...  good housekeeping has kept their pricing down, so if this is the issue...  go with g.h.  if not i'd rather read other magazines !!	-1
I didn't care for this magazine at all. I thought it was a cheapo copy of Woman's Day and had less applicable articles in it. The recipes were meh, mostly things that my family would never eat.	-1
Auto-renewal stinks because I don't like surprises on my credit card!  Great, favorite old magazine with good articles, and recipe ideas.	-1
My Dad bought this magazine for my mom and I usually pick up the copies to browse them.  That is all both my mom in her fifties and I in my twenties do browse it as it is a joke.  It is not that special it is chucked full of ads.  The cover stories are dull and boring and many of the articles you would want to read have about one paragraph good information.  I find this magazine a waste of our money.  It will not be getting renewed at the end of the subscription.  My mom has already stated that.	-1

The main target audience of Writer's Digest appears to be freelance writers.  Most of the authors are freelance magazine article writers who have finally `made it', and that is what they write about.  There are a few short articles about writing (usually written by the same people each month), but that is not the main focus of the magazine. A large portion of the articles are about technical topics related to publishing, and not writing.  This magazine is not for people who want to learn about writing; it's more for people who want to learn about how to sell their writing. The advertisements in the back of the magazine are so shady that Writer's Digest actually has to put a disclaimer on each page (think results are not typical in the lose 100 pounds in ten minutes infomercial), and I now get `if you can write a letter like this one, you could make a million dollars a year' junk mail as well.  The best part is the writing calendar with writing prompts for each day.  This is a great resource for writing exercises and generating story ideas.  However, it can be accessed for free from their website.	-1
Like so many other magazines, Bicycling has shrunk tremendously, both in size and quality, since it was the pre-eminent journal of cycling in the US. Gone are the extended articles on training, on doing your own repairs, touring, selecting components, profiles of racers and industry personalities. What's left is a slim magazine containing mostly ads disguised as articles, and justifications for buying disposable $10,000 carbon bike. The bulk of each issue is padded out with very short feature articles telling you things like wide tires are better than narrow ones for gravel,  how to signal turns with your arms, and that when you wash your bike, you shouldn't neglect the underside of the saddle. As  with so many other once-great publications, far more useful information is to be found on the forums, blogs, and manufacturer's sites on the net.	-1
I'm glad my subscription is expiring.  I found nothing of use in 12 issues of this magazine.  Even the articles seemed suspect like the authors were given a list of products to promote.	-1
Every once in a while I will pick up Lucky magazine and everytime I feel ripped off. The clothing isn't crazy expensive like in Elle or Harper's Bazaar but what they pick for clothing is just not even trendy, its just ugly. I'm all for having an individual clothing style but their items are just not wearable in daily life. And their "real life" models have these extravagant jobs that allow them to spend high amounts on clothing and wear tacky shirts. And each one seems to have that faux bowlegged stance when showing off their clothes...I have to admit, their section on shoes and accessories is very good, lots of unique pieces to add to any wardrobe that won't break the bank.	-1
Lucky is filled with spreads of different styles of clothes, accessories, make-up, and home decor. If you are looking for absolutely anything else, you won't find it here. I do find it odd that this magazine actually costs money because mostly it just advertises things and tell you where to buy them. Lucky comes with a sheet of tab stickers that say 'yes' and 'maybe' to mark things that you are interested in buying. I had fun pulling them off and sticking them on things I'd like to have just like when I was a kid and I went through the toy catalog circling all the stuff I wanted. Some of the items featured in Lucky are reasonable priced, but most are not. Apparently Elton John has a line of candles that includes a `Three hundred dollar one that's the size of a small water buffalo.' (Insert one of my 'yes' tab stickers here!) The styles do seem to be up to date and trendy, but the same information can usually be found in any other women's magazine in their advertisements, and in other magazines you actually get content. Lucky really is just a trendy catalog.	-1
I HATE the digital version! I have somehow landed on some video commercial loop for kitchen appliances and  can't stop get out of it...there are no 'x' or other options to exit and everything I touch or swipe plays the darn ad again.  I want my money back!!!!!	-1
Too many ad's	-1
The magazine is not all that interesting...Too much emphasis on expensive products and  hotels,  not much about nature and culture.  I find it too materialistic and not aesthetic, artistic, or intellectual enough.  A recent "article" recommended a $1210 leather jacket with zip-off sleeves and $139 reversible jeans for a person who wanted to pack light for a festival...Sure...	-1
Have no clue why this keeps popping up	-1
But it has just turned to pure crap. I have been a subscriber since day one and then all of a sudden it got sooo thin. There is not much in it at all anymore. A few pictures of the scantily clad along with some of the dumbest questions answered to go along with them. Its like it has been redesigned to appeal to an eighth grader. Maxim has totally left its reader base behind. Wont be long until they go away at this rate. After years and years I won't be renewing. Sad	-1
If you are subscribing to this magazine solely to look at beautiful women, then subscribe. Otherwise, I would not recommend Maxim, go for GQ or Esquire instead. The magazine contains a lot of gossip, and low brow articles. I can feel myself getting dumber while reading this magazine.  Pros - Cheap  Cons - Dumbed down - Lacks depth, superficial	-1

Maxim rode the men's magazine gold rush in the late 1990s, leading Stuff, FHM and a host of other PG-13 fare that filled the convenience store racks as Playboy, Penthouse and the hard cores were either dropped completely or were tucked behind the clerk hidden behind individual black plastic wrappers.  Maxim is the last Laddie still in print in the U.S., having witnessed the print burials for FHM (1996 to 2007) and Stuff (1998 to 2007). Maxim's putrefaction is evident to its subscribers, hence the heavily discounted subscriber rates available today. If you were unfortunate enough to receive a gift subscription to Maxim or, worse yet, bought one for yourself, you can no doubt bear witness to the decay. The magazine simply isn't interesting or compelling to read. You could find more of everything - women, entertainment, food and fashion - in a 10-minute Google search.

Maybe I'm too low class or something.  I just don't get it.  Boring.  I tried it, it failed.  Give me sports, news, entertainment.  This doesn't really have any of that.	-1
Not available for Kindle PC. Very disappointing. I like to read on a huge screen. The page is too small on a tablet.	-1
after about two months of recieving this magazine I returned it. It just wasn't what I was hoping for. I normally subscribe to veranda, and coastal living and thought that the magazine was along those lines but was bored with everything in the magazine	-1
What this magazine should be named is "Franchises". Entrpreneurs are risk takers, people who invest in franchises are risk-avoiders, and often end up being cheated. Of course there's no mention of that in this magazine; it might offend the advertisers.	-1
Not my kind of cooking .	-1
Update: Fox News owner Rupert Murdoch has just purchased National Geographic.  Do not trust the content from here forward.  He is planning to turn the magazine and society into a for profit organization in order to hide science and progress under the guise of a 'scientific journal'.  E-mail and cancel your subscriptions and send a message to this tyrant!  We want science and fact - not fiction and skewed articles serving right wing, mega corporate interests!!!  For a little while I was confused with the article selections.  It seemed they were picking some pieces that weren't really about geography, sociology, or history.  More like current events.  But the last year or two they have been on track with solid stories and spectacular photography.  I was more impressed with Smithsonian for awhile, but their new format is laughable (you can read my updated 3 star review at the Amazon listing:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Smithsonian-1-year-automatic-renewal/dp/B0032KHQU2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Smithsonian (1-year automatic renewal)</a>.  National Geographic has taken its place as top world history/sociology magazine again.  The stories may be less fleshed out than some other magazines.  These guys are definitely about the pictures.  But the pictures usually serve a purpose. They aren't just glossy and pretty.  Looking in a recent issue about global warming and population increase in Bangladesh, the pictures illustrate the point of the story: the struggles of many impoverished citizens in a country in the grip of climate change.  The stories have gotten less 'preachy' and don't tend to berate folks for not doing everything they can to help those in need.  Instead the stories tend to show both outlooks on a divided issue without painting one in a bad light.  Of course, the reader can usually infer from the nature of the story the outlook that Nat Geo favors.  It is a highly liberal magazine focused on conservation, but that is what they have been about for years, so it shouldn't surprise anyone.  I highly recommend this magazine for those folks looking for great stories on a variety of topics pertaining to nature, history, and people.	-1

In the July 7 issue... Teen Vogue just published a "how-to" article on "A Guide to Anal Sex". As a parent, it is unbelievable that they think this is okay and reflects the gulf that separates what I believe is appropriate for my teens and what they obviously think it okay. I can no longer trust what my teens find in this magazine. Beware -- the cover makes it look harmless, but it is a wolf in sheep's clothing aimed squarely at your kids.	-1
Have had subscriptions to this magazine many times off and on through-out the years and wanted to give it another shot with the $5 a year deal.  I have already cancelled my auto re-new.  LOTS of ads!  And I mean lots!  It is worth $5 a year in my opinion, but I would not pay any more than that!  Just not worth it for what I was looking for, in regards to recipes and home decorating.  But a girl can dream of having a home like Martha's!	-1
Not possible to read on Kindle or Android Kindle. Too small to see a magazine page. Forget zooming around...that takes away the fun. Please let me read it on my pc.	-1
This magazine is stuffed with often decadent ads of expensive clothing, usually dull photos geared to readers in their sixties, and  parties featuring aging celebrities.  I usually flip through this magazine in a fairly short time.  However, every once in awhile there is a fascinating, heavily researched article.  The last I can remember is an indepth feature several years ago about the contemporary art scene before the financial bubble burst. Great stuff.  Otherwise, I can't see this magazine lasting another five years in print... Mostly flash, little substance.  Edit:  Add another excellent article:  April 2013 issue, A Tale of Two Londons, an expose of the City of London Corporation, a city within a city, where "lax regulation and lax enforcement" allow dirty money from, for example, Third World dictators, Russian oligarchs who fleeced Russia's resources, and  American bankster gamblers to escape taxes and laws from their home lands. Thank you for revealing what's going on, Nicholas Shaxson. People may wish to complement their knowledge of private central banks' rip-offs with Bill Stills' youtube video, The Money Masters and some books by Joseph Stiglitz.	-1

Yes most issues are as thick as Vogue, which of course means like 50 pages of ads, before you get to the first page of text, but overall, I'm really impressed with their articles. They write about a variety of topics, and I thought it was great, how in the March (current) issue, the Editor In Chief, decided to use his column, to show the names of everyone who's died since the war in Iraq began, and where they were from, and what rank they were. It was really sad seeing these guys who were only 19, and they had their whole life ahead of them still. (Of course, these were all the people who had died as of press time for the issue). I believe the count was 472, and that has risen by almost 100, but it was still a very nice gesture. So what genre is Vanity Fair in exactly? Well, first off, don't let the name fool you and don't think just because when you first open it and you come to your first perfume sample, that it is only a magazine for women. Because further on in, they also have male models, so it's kind of for both genders. Some might say it's an Entertainment mag, but I hear it's just General Interest, and that's why it's not in the women's magazine section of my local grocery store, and it's just to the right of the Entertainment ones, so apparently, it's General Interest, and it means it's for anyone. You really shouldn't be ashamed to get it, like I first was. EDIT 3/13/04: After recieving the new issue today, I'm completely sure it more for women that anyone else.	-1

Warning -- If you are looking for the Prevention Magazine that you remember reading back in the 1970's or 1980's -- THIS ISN'T IT!  Gone are the wonderful articles on health by way of the PREVENTION of disease, replaced by advertisements for DRUGS and useless "fashion magazine" type stories that are filled to the brim with NOTHING of any value to the astute reader. The original publisher of Prevention must have run into financial difficulties, and perhaps sold the name to another company. This magazine bears absolutely no resemblance to the informative, educational publication it once was. I noticed years ago that it started slipping in the value of information presented, but this is just a joke! I'd compare it to a print version of all those endless commercials on TV for perscription medications, showing young, hip people in positive situations, while a voice-over drones on with an endless list of side-effects including death.  If you are looking to educate yourself about the prevention of disease, by all means avoid this useless publication. It is completely without value, unless you happen to have a short leg on your coffee table.  Yes, it's that bad. Stay away!	-1
Like some of the other reviewers, I used to subscribe to Prevention many years ago. I purchased a few issues from the newsstand and I am so disappointed. There is a preponderance of advertisements for drugs. Prescription drugs, over-the-counter drugs, articles about drugs. Everything in this magazine is about drugs, not natural health and healing. At this point, they might as well accept cigarette ads.  Whatever happened to eating right and staying thin? What about vitamins and healthy foods? Nope. Just drugs. Diet pills to make you thin, sleeping pills to help you sleep, and every other drug you can think of. Lots of ads and very little substance.  Don't waste your money.	-1
I only received one magazine, although the content was enjoyable, the fact that no other issues have been delivered is not good.	-1
This Old House is published, naturally enough, as an adjunct to the popular PBS show, but it doesn't really offer much by itself. It's mostly a read-and-toss sort of magazine. If you're really interested in home building and remodeling, there are two far superior magazines: Fine Homebuilding and Old Home Journal. Each of them offers far more depth and useful information than This Old House, not to mention better photography and a wider range of topics. Fine Homebuilding in particular is a magazine you'll want to keep- and most readers do.	-1
mag itself is pretty good but its mostly ads	-1

There is very little about simplifying your life in this magazine, it is mostly about rampant consumerism; I am not saying there is anything wrong with consumerism, it is great for our economy, but it should be labled as such, not wrapped up in a false guise with a silly label. Hidden between a forest of ads, you will find the occasional spindly little article, and chances are, that article will also be selling you S.T.U.F.F. with clever product placement. The ads, which are quite wide-ranging in whatever the target audience is supposed to be, made me dazed and confused, and my nose was not pleased either, as some of them contain "perfume". As for the "tips", not all are helpful. They suggest for instance, that you hard boil eggs, and keep them for a week in the refrigerator (page 18, November 2003 edition). True, a week is the limit for storing hard cooked eggs, and they will not kill you, but have you ever eaten an egg that has been sitting in the fridge for seven days ? It is enough to put one off the incredible edible forever. Five days is max folks, for a decent tasting egg. The paper quality is quite good, with a matte finish, but if you want substance, and really inventive ideas, look elsewhere.	-1
Have been looking for a mag subscription for a while for my 12yr old.  Thought I'd found it with this -- I was wrong.  She felt too much of the magazine was too young for her and her friends.  Her comment was, "I like this, but I would have loved it a couple years ago."  Discovery Girls needs to refine their age recommendations and target their content to that age group.  Not going to renew.	-1
I am shocked at all the good reviews here.  Don't get me wrong, this magazine is cute for girls ages 12 and older but EIGHT???  The problem with our society is that kids are being pushed into growing up WAY too quickly while they are still too imature.  If your 8yr old is learning about how to talk to boys, what glitter to wear, how to maintain a BFF friendship - then what will they be reading at 13?  My bet is Cosmo.  Slow down everyone.  8yr old girls should be playing on a swingset, playing barbies, pretend school, etc...  If they are already bored of these things, my guess is that you pushed Barbies on your daughter when she was 3 which is your own fault.  Parents need to remember that the younger these girls turn into "tweens" the younger they will be teens and we all know what we did when we were teens.  Give your 8yr old magazines like ASK, MUSE etc...  Let them work their minds, not teach them to be shallow superficial girls.	-1
I'm past the age range that this magazine recommends (8-12), but I was at the bookstore one day browsing through magazines when I came across this one and started to read it, expecting a clean, wholesome, American-Girl type magazine with no advertisements.  Well, I was wrong. Discovery Girls is nothing special and has as many advertisements as the typical teenage magazine. Plus, the topics covered in it are nothing really special, the fashion pages are lackluster, and the advice columns and such, well, SUCK. Topics in it are also sometimes inappropriate for the 8-12 age range, as well (some issues have stuff about make up, dating, and boyfriends and girlfriends. At EIGHT years old?!?)  In addition to the high price, advertisements, and age-inappropriate articles, this magazine also is, well, boring. Nothing in it is really interesting and since it's so short, you'll probably read through it really fast (not counting ads).  Save your money. If you're 8-12 years old and want a good magazine, read American Girl. It's definitely better than this one.	-1
Kids like to read magazines and books as long as they contain visual elements, games, and other things to keep them entertained. They don't even mind a little bit of education and learning as long as it is entertaining in some way. This is why kids' magazines are often so visual and colorful and National Geographic kids is, as expected, a publication loaded with pictures and bright colors. The magazine is focused mainly on animals, but also includes material on science, geography, technology, etc.  My girls are big fans of several kids' magazines and they look forward to receiving issues in the mail each month. I like most of them, due to their educational value. But I must take exception to National Geographic Kids magazine. This publication does contain some educational material, but the problem is that the education is minimal, with the remaining pages covered with meaningless fluff and advertisements. The ads are especially annoying because National Geographic Kids intermingles the ads into what seems like an educational article. It is done in a subtle way that you may not even notice at first.  National Geographic Kids attempts to break up the educational material with trivia, some photographs, and a few other things, but they are not items I would expect to see in a publication that is supposed to be aimed at children in the later elementary school age years and that is supposed to educate. It is also surprising how thin the magazine is- it seems more like a thick newsletter than a magazine publication.  National Geographic itself is a great magazine and I am very surprised that such a quality publication would permit its name to be scarred by the likes of this magazine. It could be so much better with a little work. It isn't like National Geographic doesn't have the resources to make improvements. They have the expertise and the know- how to make a quality kids magazine, but seem content with this publication in its present form, in spite of its many flaws.  Kids magazines are plentiful and there are some really good publications available that help teach kids about different subjects in an entertaining way. National Geographic Kids, unfortunately, isn't one of them. The worthwhile material can be isolated to about one- third of the magazine's limited pages and the overall educational value is minimal. Sum everything together and you have a magazine that isn't worth the money and should be avoided.	-1
I was disappointed when our kid's first "National GeographicKids" magazine finally arrived. This magazine is nothing like the original National Geographic. Honestly, it's one big advertisement with infrequently placed articles and trite kids activities. This could be so much more...  Kenneth Haft	-1

C&D was once entertaining, witty, objective and a great read. The staff worked well together and they put out a consistently good magazine. Then it went through some rough years where it got kind of tame and boring. Now, it's an ill fitting mix of new and old writers trying to be fresh and hip while being spoon fed by the car manufactures. The magazine lacks consistency, focus and any sort of clear vision as to what they're about.  C&D mostly seems to print what the biggest manufactures want them to. There have been several articles lately, such as on the new Nissan GT-R and Corvette ZR1, that literally mirror articles in other magazines even featuring some of the same quotes from the same car execs. You might as well go to the manufacture's websites and read their press releases.	-1
I used to love this magazine, particularly in the 1970s. Unfortunately, the writing is now bland and there is little incisive coverage. This used to be the premier bike magazine. I won't renew, that's for sure.	-1

ESPN magazine is good for skim reading. If you are looking for in-depth articles that present new ideas then look towards Sports Illustrated. ESPN magazine features many short articles about current, and upcoming events in sports. Most of the content in each issues can be written by a couple of interns, but within each issue are one or two lengthy article that maybe worth reading. Otherwise, this magazine is great to read in the bathroom, or during breakfast. I subscribed ESPN magazine because I wanted a cheap magazine that provided an overview into sports. For those more serious about sports, upgrade and spend the extra money on Sports Illustrated.  Pros - Cheap - ESPN Insider  Cons - Articles lack quality - Many Ads	-1
I've subscribed to ESPN and The Sporting News for a couple years now. When my subscriptions end, I won't be renewing ESPN.  I want detailed sports information, in-depth stories and the kind of details I can't find in my morning copy of USA Today. Instead, ESPN delivers a Maxim-esque version of sports with lots of popular culture reference and clip art. And plenty of ads for gold jewelry, cell phones and men's body spray.  I used to complain more but I've come to realize the magazine is a reflection of SportsCenter -- a show that has devolved into a series of annoying euphemisms for home runs, slam dunks and touchdowns.  Bottom line: If you love SportsCenter, you'll love ESPN magazine. If not, look at the newly-redesigned&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/The-Sporting-News/dp/B00007B1OF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">The Sporting News</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Sports-Illustrated/dp/B00005R8BG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Sports Illustrated</a>.	-1

Time has really deteriorated  in the last few years. It has become a glorified people magazine. So much of the content is dedicated to non news worthy filler material.  kenneth haft	-1
This was one of my most favorite magazines along with Allure. Very few articles and lots of advertising.  These magazines should be FREE.  There content is so little.  I hope that ELLE will rehash their magazine to its older standards.	-1
To begin with, I am not much into fashion, so take that into consideration while reading my review. I grew up in the mid-west, where for most people considering we are surrounded by corn fields and our communities are filled with farmers, comfort is more important than fashion. You are more likely to see farm and home stores than fashion stores. Anyway, this was only $5 so I took a chance on ordering it along with several other magazines (which I have a surplus of and am currently behind on reading lol) and this is one of the only ones that even though it is only $5, I had to cancel even if they didn't refund me. I just did not want this coming to my house every month. It is a thick magazine which is good and bad, but one issue was like an encyclopedia. When I started flipping through the pages, MOST of it was ads for products and designers. Just women posing in silly clothes and makeup. The articles, to me, were boring, bland, and not relevant to my life or interests. I read one article where a woman struggled with her appearance because she was Jewish and had a big nose and whatever and it made me kinda sad that she couldn't accept herself for such a long time. Everyone is beautiful in different ways and magazines like ELLE present a culture of one kind of beauty which really isn't beautiful. It's fake and kind of scary. So I just did not want this magazine in my house. I am sticking with more down to earth magazines. I enjoy a range of health magazines, home and family magazines, and girly magazines that aren't quite so fashion centered. Again, this is my opinion so please don't criticize me. I understand location has a lot to do with how you view fashion and body image but I am perfectly happy with me!  Update: I'm glad some people are finding my review helpful! I also forgot to mention that my mom (a woman in her 50's) exchanges magazines with me and this magazine has very small print which made the magazine hard for her to read. And I flipped through the last issue I received and most of the articles (at the end of the magazine since the first half of it is full of ads) were about feminism. I am not a feminist and that's as far as I'll go on that subject. You can formulate your own opinion of the articles. Just pointing it out to potential subscribers since I had no idea what to expect from this magazine. Another article in this magazine was defending photo shop and feeding false body images to women as artwork like it is no big deal! I was shocked because it contributes to eating disorders and low self esteem in many women, especially young women. A better name for this magazine would be SUPERFICIAL.	-1
It was ok...I like people magazine best I think.	-1
was boring, nothing much to the magazine, very few pages and no news about celebrities that I hadn't heard before.	-1
I bought my first issue of InStyle two years ago and its gone downhill imho. The article titles on the front typically have absolutely nothing to the article itself, like what to wear now does not explain what to wear now nor does it point you in any general direction. The only plus side to the magazine is that it features bargain prices on clothing every once in a while. The pairings of clothing they put together used to be great, very wearable for the daytime and for most people not in a fashion business. Now it seems as if they've tried to mimic the weirdness that you see in Lucky magazine.  Another plus is the makeup and hair section, they do a good job showing what the newest trends in makeup are with a wide range of prices and products. FYI skintones are also factored in.	-1
This mag is for folks looking for an "informative" People-level read, and maybe need a sound bite or 2 for water cooler chat. That is, if you want to feel intelligent or informed without actually having to BE either of those. Here's a helpful scale: 10 -science journals, where serious papers are presented and only the professors undrestand; 8 - Science Magazine, where the papers are less technical but you are expected to know the jargon and how it all relates; 5 - Science News or NatGeo, which puts it into layman's terms and smaller bites but actually teaches you something about the world; 1 - mental floss, which explains questions like "What's in a black hole" with cute one-liners. It's fun if you want to invest the equivalent time-span of the average bathroom sit, but if you prefer a bit more serious read and more real info for your time, try Smithsonian, NatGeo, or Science News.	-1
I like most scientific publications because it comes down to, or should come down to, objective reporting of facts. Unfortunately SA has gone and started to editorialize the information it reports. I'm amazed at the community of "scientists"  who swear up and down the sky is falling,or at least that it has a hole in and we're all going to die because of it. Do these people take into consideration the absolute immensity of the earth and atmosphere? They can tell that us, unequivocally, that we are damaging the atmosphere and that apparently they know the correct climate conditions for earth in 2014. What a load of dreck! The earth is so massive that man amounts to a pimple on it. The atmosphere is so immense that earth is a speck of dust, they can't possibly know what the correct ratio of gasses and vapor is supposed to be, yet we are bombarded with junk science that says we are killing the planet and the atmosphere because we release gas and vapor. How about proof of concept? Hewal and stream, river or ocean. They can't but they want us to believe that they can heal the earth and atmosphere? If we can't find a pinging airliner in the Indian Ocean, how can we believe that these "Chicken Little" scientists and their gloom and doom forecasts? We can't control or influence the weather or the atmosphere around the globe, If everybody in China jumped up and down at the same time, could they influence the orbit of the earth? No! because it's so huge. it can't be done. Yet we hear daily that we have to sequester carbon and stop using petroleum and switch to solar, wind or unicorn power. Guess what happens to sequestered carbon in trees when the tree dies or is cut down. It gets released. Al Gore set  the alternative energy industry free with his forecast or "Global Warming".  We've spent billions of alternative energy (Solara) and objective people have figured out that we can't meet demands by converting to "sustainable" energy sources. We have been sold a bill of goods, pay no attention to the man or woman behind the curtain, The political theater of "greenies" are going to save the world using regulations and unfunded mandates. SA has drunk the Kool-Aid and are now mixing up and distributing batch after batch each month. Who believes that man can "fix" the weather or environment? Who believes that somebody can correctly predict the correct climate and weather conditions for earth in 2014?  Count me out, I'm subscribing to and actual objective journal that reports actual or real information not this unicorn riding, mantra chanting mass hallucination of a Big Bank Theory magazine.	-1
Scientific American was once the premier scientific journal for the educated reader with an interest in science. Every article was written by a researcher in that field, and nothing was dumbed down. Every October, SciAm published a special issue that covered just one topic in depth, and these special issues presented the state of the art in that area in a way that was readable and understandable to the non-specialist, but at the same time could have served as a text for the student in that area. Some of those special issues were re-published as book, and when I was a grad student, the special issue on The Brain was actually used as a text for one of my seminars.  Today's SciAm is a sad, pale, echo of that once great journal. Most of the pieces are short, superficial, one or two page essays that can be quickly skimmed over. Much of the content deals with policy issues, not the underlying science. And whereas mathematics is the common language of science, the tool that (as a friend once remarked) keeps scientists honest, there's not a whisper of it in today's SciAm- a particularly sad thing given that one of the most popular features in the old SciAm was Martin Gardner's column on recreational mathematics! Gone also is the Amateur Scientist, a section in which serious amateurs would present their research programs, complete with detailed drawings of apparatus. It was here I first read about experimental rocketry, constructing computers (in the 1960s!) and building telescopes.  When I was a student in middle school, forty years ago, I found much of the math daunting, but that only spurred me on to study more and learn the tools that would unlock the knowledge found in the articles. Today, it's a magazine that  requires nothing of the reader. Facts are presented in a superficial way as absolute truths, and the magazine is designed to be skimmed over, and discarded. A sad end to a once great journal.	-1
How can environmental science have 2-3 worthy breakthroughs/month deserving of the classic SciAm recognition? SciAm used to be leading edge stuff. It was like winning the Nobel to have a paper chosen for publication.  My subscription expires in June 2012. After 40-some years, SciAm and I will go our separate ways. I've already subscribed to American Scientist.	-1
I wanted to love this magazine, but the interior design it featured in the last few issues has been SUPER fussy, formal, and frilly, so I cancelled my subscription. Definitely not very many clean and modern or classic interiors featured. Some people love this, but from reading this magazine, it helped me realize that my style is definitely pared down and classic, and not gold-flaked, tiered, and brocade-ed. If you are looking for super-high end design but want it to be more clean and classic, try Architectural Digest. Both magazines feature things that are totally out of reach for the average person, but Veranda's motto is absolutely "more is MORE."	-1
A magazine full of advertisements. Hardly any decorating inspiration or photos. Would not recommend.	-1
Might have been better if it was 1875 and I was an old lady. Very floral, rustic, lots of brass beds, etc. Not up to date country at all.	-1
Cancelled my subscription before the 30 day free trial ended. This magazine did not hold my interest. Also found it a little difficult to read on my Fire.	-1
The multi-page special reports on various world regions or themes, as well as exposes of corruption, are the best features. The end of the year issue making predictions for the following year is very broad and interesting. The anonymously written articles are annoying. Why hide your opinions? The magazine promotes lessening or eliminating corporate taxes and not raising tax rates on the rich, while promoting government-paid: training programs based on what local employers want, cash assistance for employees who move over two hours from a new job, intensive home visits with health and nutrition care for children younger than preschool, expanded preschool, and earned income credits contingent on work so as to discourage poor people from not having paid employment (instead of taking care of their own young children).  Who's supposed to pay for these programs?  The declining middle class? Their promotion of unhealthy homosexual "marriages" and applause at the "gentle" decline of worldwide fertility rates from 6 children per woman in 1960 to about 2 children per woman indicates their population control agenda and distorted sexual viewpoint. Don't they understand that a population dominated by old people indicates a dying civilization? I learn some facts and get some opinions here that I don't elsewhere, but their editorial slant is a self-serving promotion of the failed Washington consensus.	-1

This magazine started out really good. I don't know what happened or exactly when. I had gotten this for my wife on several occasions via subscription. The last time my wife said not to renew, and made a comment about some of the subject matter just not pertaining to real people, and the products raved about were mega hundred dollar shoes and such.	-1
Didn't like it !!	-1
Tablet screens are too small for magazine reading. Please make available for kindle pc.	-1
Got a "special price" subscription to this, and glad I did.  Wouldn't want to pay a lot since this magazine pretty much bores me.  Not interested when it arrives in the maibox (like I am with other mags I receive, such as Readers Digest, Good Housekeeping, Woman's Day, Family Circle, etc.)  Favorite part in the magazine is Gayle King's Favorite Things page.  That's always a fun read and she has interesting, eclectic taste.  Will let my subscription expire.	-1
i've only had had one  issue so far and i was not really impressed with it.  there just weren't  enough interesing articles in it.  i'm glad i didn't pay too much for it.  can't imagine i will order again.	-1
More for younger women I believe.  While I found a few articles good it seemed more focused on the younger women among us.  Such as how to have great buns, great sex, etc.  Good articles for 20-30 year olds but I would prefer all around general health articles and not based mainly on the younger age group.	-1
Price is great, but...Instead of the most current issue arriving first, I received back issues more than 2 months after they hit the news stands.  If this counts towards my 12 issues, I will not renew.	-1
Makes me feel like less of a man to read this stupid magazine.  Advertisements and fluff articles.  Like Martha Stewart Living and the New Yorker for suburban men.  No thanks.	-1
Perhaps I mixed this up with a similar magazine but the first 2 issues we received very totally devoted to a few areas that have no interest to us	-1
In the not-too-distant past, the quality of this publication went right into the . It went from being a vibrant publication for people who live or vacation in seasde communities to being a bunch of schlock advertising aimed at the same crowd. TAKE A PASS ON THIS ONE.	-1
After 4 years I finally called it quits with the Every Day magazine. The magazine has changed in size, layout, and target audience to the point where I feel I am NOT that demographic. The magazine has become aimed at the more wealthy members of society. The recipes are a bit repetitious or made with "one shot" ingredients, i.e. expensive ingredients that are hard to find. Ingredients used once then you are stuck with something you will never use again.  I'm really disappointed to see Rachael Ray go off on tangents about her expensive vacations. It's disheartening to see her monthly product page filled with items like jeans that cost $150. I thoroughly enjoyed the start of the magazine, but I do feel ostracized by recipes I cannot afford to make or that include ingredients so unique that making the recipe costs a lot of money. Sorry, Rachael.  My budget has no room for you now. I love recipes, but yours have become too far off course.	-1
I can't stand Rachael Ray. Sorry. I got the magazine subscription from a friend as a gag gift. And it was a gag gift. The recipes all sounded horrible, or, the ones I tried, turned out horrible. You want a good food magazine, go with Taste of Home. and stop wasting your money on this poser.	-1
I received this magazine and was disappointed with all the ad's and hardly any articles. Almost every page is an advertisement. I ended up getting a refund from Amazon and ordering a different magazine.	-1
I got a subscription to this magazine for $5, which was a good thing because I was disappointed with this magazine.  I was recently diagnosed with diabetes, so I am always on the lookout for good recipes that I can prepare and eat without messing up my diet.  I had heard good things about the Everyday with Rachael Ray magazine, so when I found this great price I decided to try it.  I loved the general setup of the magazine, but was disappointed that the recipes didn't show any nutritional information.  How am I supposed to know if the dishes are diabetic-diet friendly, if there is no nutritional information available?  I already received a renewal bill, but I won't be renewing the magazine unless I see some improvement in the next couple of months.	-1
I've subscribed to this magazine for several years, and I admire Rachels' perkiness and I do enjoy some of the articles. The problem I have is none of the recipes really appeal to me. Either they are strange, example: "Elvis Styled Grilled Banana Sundaes" or just not appealing  "Salami, White Bean and Water Cress Crostini." She focuses a lot on pasta dishes, dishes with tomato, appetizers which are fine, but not tempting, and I don't find they have as much family appeal.  The non-holiday months are fairly generic, although I admit I do like the Fall and December issues.  There are also articles that focus on clothing, travel and the psychology of shopping. I would suggest buying a few issues and seeing if her style and tastes are yours.	-1
Entertainment Weekly is pure fluff, and you can get the same celebrity news off any tv talk show or the E!tv network.  It's fun to flip through at the dentist's office, but the subscription cost really isn't worth the money.  Readers who want useful beauty and fashion tips are better off subscribing to Vogue, Marie Claire or Cosmopolitan than EW.  I got my subscription because I had to spend some air miles that were about to expire.  It's okay to flip through, but there is no real substance, and I wouldn't pay money to resubscribe. Save the $$ and get a subscription to PEOPLE if you want to follow celebrities and you'll get better articles as well.	-1

So horribly full of superficial crap. I regret ordering it.	-1
This magazine, as I already knew, is just about sex. I really don't know why women like to read this, and especially why parents allow their children to read this magazine! It only encourages them to be sexually active and experiment with boys. I read an article online that a woman is trying to get news stands to sell this magazine in a plastic bag so that young women cannot read it's contents at the store! I do not enjoy reading this magazine. I only tried it because I knew it was so popular among women and wanted to see why. I also was not happy with the customer service. My magazine took forever to come in the mail and I just decided to cancel it because of the delay in shipping and the content is smut! I can spend my $15 on a much better magazine.  One more thing: If you have allergies, BEWARE! I had to pull out at least 5 or more perfume inserts and the magazine still smelt like perfume! You may want to consider this before it ends up in your mailbox and you have an asthma attack trying to read it!	-1
"The Cosmo Sex Poll - 6,000 Horny Guys Tell All" is an actual title from the August Cosmo issue (I'd be more interested to learn how they determined the guy was horny before letting him take the poll ;o) )  I used to be an avid Cosmo reader in my 20's. Life got busy in my 30's, but, I have recently decided to re-subscribe. I am sad to report that the magazine has slipped considerably in general quality of information provided, as well as the manner in which it is done. I was looking forward to hot-off-the-press fashion news; I wanted to learn about the best beauty products on the market; I wanted to read stories relevant to my life with real life heroines who inspire other real life women. Well, it was not to be. What I got was a little bit of fashion and beauty with the rest being a poorly written sex manual. Oh, "how to manipulate your man" was also high on the magazine's agenda... Here are some titles from the August issue:  "She Had Her First One Night Stand at 34" (she's for it and it's in the Need to Know section of the magazine...) "Secrets His Sex Style Reveals" "Guys Rate 125 Sex Moves" "Get Hit On All The Time" "Orgasm Whisperer" "First Time Sex Bloopers" "Cosmo's Naughty Sex Dare Game"  I could go on, but I am feeling noxious again...It's rather disturbing that teenagers and young women are reading this and may be getting the idea that this is all their life is supposed to be about: having sex, all the time, with strangers, as well as manipulating men... Sad...  If you are looking for magazines with fashion/beauty focus, I recommend: In Style, Style Watch, and Lucky.  Regarding Cosmo subscription service: I received the Sept issue promptly, FOLLOWED by the August issue (they were clearing out their warehouse, I guess...).	-1
Every month its the same thing, how to have sex and how to loose weight. Its so repetitive its stupid. Cosmo is just bad, the cover "models" are bad, the articles are horrendous. I used to be a faithful buyer till i realized that each month its the same stuff. The same sex tips, the same smokey eyes, the same sexy beach waves for hair, and the same cheap paper its printed on.	-1
Price is great!  Instead of the most current issue arriving first, I received back issues more than 2 months after they hit the news stands.  If this counts towards my 12 issues, I will not renew.	-1
my wife is happy	-1
I have been a subscriber since it was Premiere Magazine. The current version of the magazine is People, the movies and TV edition. It's low-quality pop culture garbage. It takes me 5 minutes to "read" an issue. I will not renew my subscription. Not worth the paper it's printed on.  I used to rely on their movie reviews for suggestions what to watch. Those are now worthless, too. The whole thing is a mixture of People and TV Guide. It's just moronic.	-1
Each issue seems to have a limited scope - one or few topics or people - if you're not into that topic or person then pretty much the whole issue is a bust.	-1
not so good.	-1
This magazine has been going downhill pretty fast in the last year or two.  I have been a subscriber since 2010, after the rest of my Premiere subscription was replaced with EW. I remember the times when I looked forward to reading it, when I spent 30-60 minutes on an issue, when the valuable information (I am a movie buff, and I don't watch TV or listen to pop music) was at least 50%, when I chose the DVDs in my Netflix movie queue based on their EW score. These guys used to be that good. Not anymore.  Nowadays it's just another piece of pop garbage. My subscription ended in February, but they sent me a courtesy issue, which I have just finished reading... in the usual under 10 minutes. Jack of all trades, master of none. Full of gossip-level amateurish material. They are simply irrelevant for this generation X-er. If they continue the current trend, I foresee a fast fall into oblivion.	-1
So disappointed with this service. There are 6 issues on my Kindle Fire that I cannot read. These issues will not download! Oh, did I fail to mention, these issues were paid for and I have nothing.  Please read the recent reviews. This is an ongoing problem. Don't lose your money like I did.	-1
The best thing I can say about this magazine is that I didn't have to pay for the subscription; I bought it with air miles. Good thing, too, because this magazine is NOT worth its price, either off-the-rack or via subscription.  Want to keep up with your favorite celebrities? The "news" in this magazine is nothing more than a collection of rumors.  Want fashion advice? The most you'll get here are photos of celebs wearing something and what it is.  Most of the fashions and cosmetics are, of course, waaayyy out of the price range of the average reader.  The stories are rumors you can get much cheaper via supermarket tabloids, or "quotes" from a "source" that's supposedly "close" to the celebrity, or paragraphs of what the person "might" do, based on trends or what their celeb pals have done in the past.  Usually these are incorrect.  A few months ago I the magazine gushed about Princess Kate's pregnancy with twins, and how Buckingham Palace "should confirm" it soon.  Today the cover squeals that Kate and her sister Pippa are both pregnant, Kate with a girl and Pippa with a boy.  I won't hold my breath over it.  Subscribe to US or PEOPLE if you want intelligently-written articles about celebs and others in the news.  The magazines don't source stories on gossip and rumor, and are written by reliable reporters instead of paparazzi, which I suspect is the case here.  OK! was anything but, and I'm sorry I wasted air miles on it.	-1
Very uninteresting and a lot of nothing. I won't be buying this magazine anytime in the near future.  Seems like it was all ads.	-1
Rated it low because it is a waste of money. Felt like reading a "rag" to relieve some boredom and ended up bored with the magazine. Writting skills are limited and articles are jammed into each pages. Found it hard to read on the Kindle	-1
WASTE OF TIME.  WIFE COMPLAINS ABOUT ALL THE ADS.  LITTLE TO READ	-1
Lots of junk food recipes with two sticks of butter and two cups of sugar followed by weight loss product ad or other prescription drugs. I used to find interesting articles about making your own spa products and consumer-type articles on finding great deals. I find some of the articles to be politically correct propaganda. Some of the features are just infomercials on cheap clothes or unnatural "beauty" products. I don't enjoy it.  On the other hand, there are some healthy recipes and positive articles about people helping others.  Overall, it is just too commercialized for my taste and I won't be renewing.	-1
I've read WOMAN'S DAY since the 1970s, and I'm sorry to give it only a two-star rating this year.  Each monthly issue seems to mirror the last - some health tips, a few recipes, perhaps some shopping or fashion advice.  WOMAN'S DAY once had multi-generational appeal.... I enjoyed it as a teen in the 70s and 80s.  Now it's target audience seems to be 30s and 40s females with children only.  Women's issues get short shrift, and one can gain better health and beauty information from MARIE CLAIRE or COSMO.  I'd like to see WOMAN'S DAY feature more recipes and articles, as it used to publish.	-1
Too many adds	-1
There seems to be only pics in magazine.. no real articles and even the pics are not of interest to me.. . did not find it useful	-1
October 2017 issue has 49 pages of covers, directory, crossword puzzle & (finally) readable content.  The remaining 16 pages were full page ads.  The content (mainly recipes) is moderately interesting, just know what you are getting.  Not a magazine I'll renew.	-1
not much that I've even made in this so I canceled it.	-1
not complete enough	-1
Good value.  09/01/17 Cancelled my subscription.  Magazine has gotten to be more advertizing than articles.  Used to love this magazine but I have been going thru when it first arrives and tear out all of the prescription medication and other advertizine pages.  Just nothing left in the magazine at all.  Even though it was a good value at $5.00 for 1 year I didn't want to renew.	-1
It's an okay if you like nothing but advertisements and recipes. That's really all there is to this magazine. I bought it to learn more about the south, but this magazine proved to be lacking much in that. Take for instance the current issue, there's lots of recipes, ads and an article about "How to Buy a Sofa". That gives you and idea. I purchased a subscription but didn't renew. Very disappointed with this one.	-1
Okay miss the old style TV guide won't buy again	-1
TV Guide used to have complete 24-hour-a-day listings, plus terrific articles about TV actors, trends, etc. Then they remodeled it completely, and now they just aren't about listings, and their articles aren't as good.  Sure I can surf the channels on cable, but my provider doesn't list shows more than a few hours in advance, and surfing the web for schedule info is a big drag.  I stopped reading TV Guide when they stopped doing complete listings and having great articles, even though it still arrived every week for months.  I'd LOVE to go back to it.  It used to be something you could pick up really cheaply at the supermarket, for fifteen cents.  But I wouldn't mind paying if I was getting a real TV GUIDE.	-1
Cancelled subscription. Didnt care for the magazine.	-1
Can't read it on my kindle PC. So it's useless. Reading on kindle devices or tablet is not visible.	-1
In the July 7 issue... Teen Vogue just published a "how-to" article on "A Guide to Anal Sex".  As a parent, it is unbelievable that they think this is okay and reflects the gulf that separates what I believe is appropriate for my teens and what they obviously think it okay.  I can no longer trust what my teens find in this magazine.  Beware -- the cover makes it look harmless, but it is a wolf in sheep's clothing aimed squarely at your kids.	-1
Will not be auto renewing this, my daughters ages 15 and 17 do not like this magazine.  Not exactly sure why, but they do not want it anymore.  If it helps to know, my 17 year old is into fashion, make-up, current trends, etc.  My 15 year old daughter is more of a Tom-boy, so honestly would not expect her to like a magazine such as this.  Was surprised that my 17 year did not care for it.	-1
too advanced/suggestive for pre-teen-11-12 yr old- clothes ok, articles not for young readers	-1
Just ok...	-1
Garbage. All ads, all unrealistic fashions. Liberal hit pieces on Trump.	-1
NOT WHAT IS USED TO BE.  MOSTLY FASHION ADS AND ARTICLES.  TRULY, A WASTE OF TIME.	-1
I find that about 10 % of the content actually relates to the common person. Girly men fashion models are strange looking and in need of a Big Mac. This is supposed to make their clothes more appealing ? Yikes. It was the easiest way to use a magazine gift card. Guess next time Ill be more selective.	-1
The cover on my last issue featured Sofia Vergara in Agent Provocateur's black lingerie - and I still didn't bother to renew my subscription. It was too little, too late for a magazine that initially drew my interest as I smarter alternative to&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Maxim/dp/B002IYSZBM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Maxim</a>&nbsp;and a more coffee-table friendly alternative to&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Playboy/dp/B001UJICAK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Playboy</a>. Alas, after a one-year subscription, Esquire failed to capture me.  I purchased my Esquire subscription with the same expectations I had for&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/GQ/dp/B00005N7QI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">GQ</a>, magazines known more for their abundant advertisements and cologne samples than for an unique, interesting take on men's interests. Esquire pushes well beyond my limits. The April 2012 edition (my last) makes a perfect example. The table of contents appears on page 25; advertisements packed between it and the cover:  Bvlgari Giorgio Armani Ermenegildo Zegna Dolce & Gabbana Calvin Klein Woodford Reserve Lincs DC & Co Newport Beach Film Festival Hugo Boss Luminox Moontower Comedy & Oddity Fest Buick  That's 24 pages of advertisements before you reach the first editorial copy. And if you think that's an unfair representation, let me share that the next 20 pages includes ads for JC Penny, Tommy Hilfiger, Triumph, Canali, Salvatore Ferragamo, Ford, Breitling, Hickey Freeman, Gucci and Citibank. Within the next 20 pages, there are two more pages thinly spread with a table of contents, a staff listing, and only four pages of content, one of which carries the staff listing jump.  So, in the first 45 pages of Esquire, there are less than four pages of actual content.  Only one article, "Miracle" by Craig Davidson, was of the quality that I'd come to expect from Esquire. The nine-page piece (two pages serve as bloated title art) explores the medical advancements of synthetic hormones to delay age-related conditions.  The Sofia Vergara cover garners two thumbs up from me. However, only three more pictures of her appear in the magazine. Three! That's reason enough to fire an editor, maybe a couple. I can only take so many pictures of shaggy, bearded, brooding men hawking shoes, watches and cologne. If you are going to put Sofia Vergara on the cover, at least have the decency to treat your readers to a longer layout, at least a half dozen pages.  What's left is a choppy, increasingly juvenile collection of short articles and humor that illustrates how much Maxim and the other Laddies infected the entire men's magazine industry. The April 2012 edition included these one-page, puddle skippers:  Levi's made and crafted Mad Men's fifth season New books by Stephen King and John Grisham How picky are sperm banks? Keyboard shortcuts we need  In summary, Esquire is at the 1977 Elvis stage of life. I look back on the old issues with the same fondness I once held for Men's Health, Playboy and GQ. For a magazine approaching its 80th anniversary, Esquire needs some of those synthetic hormones to ward off its bloated visage and marked decline in quality features. Someone forgot being entertaining and smart are not mutually exclusive. Simply, today's Esquire is shallow and Maxim-esque.  Rating: Two stars.	-1

It seems that with this particular Kindle version, one is not able to change the page for size, or for font.  This makes reading some what difficult when compared to other Kindle magazines.  Unless there is a change in the Kindle format, we'll probably not renew the subscription for a print & Kindle of this magazine/	-1
Kindle screens are too small to read the magazine. Please make available for kindle pc.	-1
Not much there for me.	-1
not hwat i expected seems more advertising and fad diet than pertinent articles, worthwhile subjects	-1
I only received one magazine, although the content was enjoyable, the fact that no other issues have been delivered is not good.	-1

After several years of subscribing to Yoga Journal, I finally cancelled my subscription because the magazine has evolved into almost no yoga-related content (mindfulness, philosophy, better living) and is almost exclusively poses and product tie-ins related to Yoga Journal and/or their sponsors (articles about Yoga Journal tours, reviews of Yoga Journal sponsor resorts and trips, interviews with teachers of Yoga Journal classes, etc.). Gone are all the great articles about meditation, healthy mind-body, different yoga-related philosophies, etc.  I wound up subscribing to "Mindful Magazine" instead and it's more of what I was looking for. (What I *truly* wish is that Body and Soul magazine would come back. Anyone remember that one?)	-1
Like commercials at dinnertime...like telemarketers when your eating...food network magazine sucks...like cold pasta with cherry tomatoes and basil.	-1
This used to be my favorite magazine, but it has declined. This is the first year that I decided not to renew it after buying it for decades. The magazine seems to have evolved into a sarcastic gossip rag with a heavy emphasis toward the horror and superhero fan base. Not my preference. There used to be a wide range of tastes and good reporting. I could depend on at least a few articles in every issue while skipping those that held no appeal. The last several mags were a drudgery to skim through. Not worth my money.	-1

Great price but price matter little if the magazine is not entertaining. I had high hopes being a novice farmer disappointing. Mother Earth a better choice.	-1
This magazine is such a disappointment now.  When I subscribed, it was what the title proclaimed.  Great!  They'll sift thru the site and choose recipes many folks would like; and bring to the readers' attention unusual recipes they have missed on the site.  Then they started adding ads.  No problem and no surprise.  How else could they continue?  THEN...they started adding other stuff!  In my Feb-Mar 2018 issue, the first recipe didn't appear until pg. 36 (out of 104 pgs., mind you).  And what was this stuff?  Fitness, lifestyle, tablescapes, kitchens renovations, utensils, baking with kids, and choosing healthy snacks (plus ads).  FINALLY, we got a recipe!  If I wanted all that "stuff", I'd subscribe to a mag that does it well (such as MARTHA STEWART LIVING).  And, in fact, I do subscribe to MSL.  AR does not do this sort of thing well, at all.  I will NOT be re-subscribing to Allrecipes.  It has turned into something unlike its charter.  A very big disappointment.  If you want recipes without extraneous barely-related material, AR is not for you. mb  PS.  TASTE OF HOME used to be "no-advertising," too, but they had to add it to survive.  They've avoided padding their content, however.  AR should take a lesson.	-1
After 4 years I finally called it quits with the Every Day magazine. The magazine has changed in size, layout, and target audience to the point where I feel I am NOT that demographic. The magazine has become aimed at the more wealthy members of society. The recipes are a bit repetitious or made with "one shot" ingredients, i.e. expensive ingredients that are hard to find. Ingredients used once then you are stuck with something you will never use again.  I'm really disappointed to see Rachael Ray go off on tangents about her expensive vacations. It's disheartening to see her monthly product page filled with items like jeans that cost $150. I thoroughly enjoyed the start of the magazine, but I do feel ostracized by recipes I cannot afford to make or that include ingredients so unique that making the recipe costs a lot of money. Sorry, Rachael.  My budget has no room for you now. I love recipes, but yours have become too far off course.	-1
I can't stand Rachael Ray. Sorry. I got the magazine subscription from a friend as a gag gift. And it was a gag gift. The recipes all sounded horrible, or, the ones I tried, turned out horrible. You want a good food magazine, go with Taste of Home. and stop wasting your money on this poser.	-1
I received this magazine and was disappointed with all the ad's and hardly any articles. Almost every page is an advertisement. I ended up getting a refund from Amazon and ordering a different magazine.	-1
I got a subscription to this magazine for $5, which was a good thing because I was disappointed with this magazine.  I was recently diagnosed with diabetes, so I am always on the lookout for good recipes that I can prepare and eat without messing up my diet.  I had heard good things about the Everyday with Rachael Ray magazine, so when I found this great price I decided to try it.  I loved the general setup of the magazine, but was disappointed that the recipes didn't show any nutritional information.  How am I supposed to know if the dishes are diabetic-diet friendly, if there is no nutritional information available?  I already received a renewal bill, but I won't be renewing the magazine unless I see some improvement in the next couple of months.	-1
I've subscribed to this magazine for several years, and I admire Rachels' perkiness and I do enjoy some of the articles. The problem I have is none of the recipes really appeal to me. Either they are strange, example: "Elvis Styled Grilled Banana Sundaes" or just not appealing  "Salami, White Bean and Water Cress Crostini." She focuses a lot on pasta dishes, dishes with tomato, appetizers which are fine, but not tempting, and I don't find they have as much family appeal.  The non-holiday months are fairly generic, although I admit I do like the Fall and December issues.  There are also articles that focus on clothing, travel and the psychology of shopping. I would suggest buying a few issues and seeing if her style and tastes are yours.	-1
Found that it has too much gardening and design info for my taste. The gardening applies mostly to the Southeastern US, not here in Texas, where global warming is making most all of our ground-covers,  plants, fruit trees, etc. do strange things these days....	-1
I have had a subscription for decades and used to read it religiously but no more.  Their articles used to be about men and their hobbies, careers, travels, explorations, health, toys, etc., and it was worth reading.  Over recent years though they have gotten too political, liberal, and left wing.  I began to notice it when they took every opportunity to criticize President George W. Bush who was pretty manly and outdoorsy.  Then along came their idol obama who they drooled over in every issue,  They put him on the cover that stated Barack Obama, Jock in Chief (oh please), and then wrote about Barack Obamas Next Level Retirement of which the authors were jealous.  And then the people of America elected President Donald J. Trump and every single issue has at least one and often more negative comments about him.  Someday they might realize that all of their readers are not liberal snowflakes but I doubt it.  My subscription expires this month and that is it.  No more mens journal coming before my eyes.	-1
I am cancelling my subscription because Oprah has turned the focus into something which is against my values. Even my 86 year old mom refuses to read O!	-1

Not much substance.  i won't be renewing.  But truth be told, i'm not a mother so much of the stuff just doesn't relate to me and there seems to be a lot of medical and drug ads that I am not a fan of.	-1
Got my first issue and it seems to be nothing more than an advertising publication with a few mildly entertaining articles thrown in. I'm disappointed, I thought it would actually be about the American Cowboy and the life they live, not dude ranch, silver and hat ads. There is so much more to living the cowboy code than a fancy hat, caring about the environment, sliver and turquoise bling a bunch of tack on your horse. So far this magazine really misses the mark. I hope it gets much better real soon.	-1
where is it? I placed an the order on Sept. 1st, and it is now November 15. No Magazine to be seen. I tried to contact Active Interest Media, like usual everything is harder than it has to be. That is why I ordered it through Amazon in hopes that I would not have problems with delivery. The other magazines that I ordered at the same time have had no issue and I'm know receiving 3rd magazine on a few.	-1
You get maybe one article of interest per month. The rest is some weird political diatribe. All this time I never knew that electronics and internet had a political bias or affiliation. Pretty bizarre. Guess I know now why this is such a small niche magazine.  Then you have to wade though the endless ads. Will not be renewing this mess.	-1
Not what I expected. Found it boring and lacking information about recipes and articles. I found Internet much better for those categories	-1
