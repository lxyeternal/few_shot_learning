As advertised. Reasonably priced	1
Like the oder and the feel when I put it on my face.  I have tried other brands but the reviews from people I know they prefer the oder of this brand. Not hard on the face when dry.  Does not leave dry skin.	1
I bought this to smell nice after I shave.  When I put it on I smelled awful.  I am 19 and I smelled like a grandmother with too much perfume.	-1
HEY!! I am an Aqua Velva Man and absolutely love this stuff, been using it for over 50 years. This is a true after shave lotion classic. Not quite sure how many women that have been attracted to me because of Aqua Velva,  I do know for sure that it's just to many to count. Ha.  Not sure how long this has been around but the Williams Company ran a paper advertisement, taken from a 1949 magazine, which features Ralph Bellamy of Detective Story and Ezio Pinza of South Pacific for Aqua Velva After Shave Lotion. I'm sure you all remember Ralph Bellamy and Ezio Pinza from the 40's right.  There slogan was " There is nothing like an AQUA VELVA MAN " and it seemed to work because this was a hot item when I was a young man. It's just amazing that this is still around when the vast majority of after shave lotions from that time period have disappeared over the years.  The only negative about Aqua Velva is it does not last very long. Usually in less than an hour the aroma has dissipated. The more expensive after shave lotions and perfumes have Ambergris in them which is quite expensive and comes from a sperm whale this enables the aroma to linger much longer.  At any rate this is a great classic after shave with a wonderful refreshing odor, give it a try you might just like it.  Note :::; Some reviewers mention this 7oz size now comes in a plastic container, I just bought one in Wal-Mart and it was glass.	1
If you ever want to feel pampered by a shampoo this one is the one.  It smells like a wonderful perfume and cleans your hair until it shines plus adding a fullness that most other shampoo's don't give you.  It is expensive, but worth it!	1
If you know the scent of Diva, you'll LOVE this body cream....everyone says "who smells so good in here!"	1
Got this shampoo as a solution for my wife's dandruff problem. It worked! She got rid of any dandruff signs after 3-4 uses. As long as she is happy, I am happy too!	1
No change my scalp still itches like crazy. It doesnt lather at all so its very hard to move around the hair and scalp. It does smell good and my hair feels clean.	-1
Too expensive for such poor quality. There was no improvement and I am starting to think my scalp is worse off than it was before I started using this product. I do agree with other reviews that it feels watered down too much. Had to use more shampoo than all other shampoo's I have tried to get a good lather.	-1
It dries my hair, doesnt help to reduce dandruff. I have to use very less shampoo nevertheless it dries.. don't know how this got higher ratings	-1
Outstanding! Top organic shampoo!	1
So watered down, I didn't feel like it was actually shampoo. I tried twice then threw it away.	-1
10 stars right here. This product helped me with my itchy skin and my sister's greasy hair complain.	1
First hair care product I've decided to purchase online. Worth it for sure. No more struggle with getting rid of my dandruff problem. I use it about once per 2-3 days and it is more than enough to keep my hair and head skin healthy.	1
Made dandruff worse and irritated rest of skin	-1
Worst shampoo Ive ever used.  Was mostly water.  I could not get a good lather.  Hair never felt clean after use.  I cannot understand why so many good reviews.  Will not buy again!	-1
Made my hair brittle and dull looking, didn't do anything for the itch or dandruff.	-1
I received the shampoo because I was suffering from dandruff and I was like ok lets try it and I couldn't believe the result from only just one wash. it cleared out the dandruff without drying my hair out. My hair felt smooth and Fresh after just the first wash. I tried aveda spray before but it was useless and waste of money	1
works great	1
Suffered from itchiness under my hair for couple of years. This product cured the itchiness completely. I took some 4-5 drops of it and then massaged my wet head for a minute approximately. After 2 uses noticed a considerable difference. It definitely gets the job done!	1
Got this product for me and  my daughter. I can say 100% - it works superb on both, long curly and short straight hair.	1
Cleansing properties are above any praise! Suprised by how good an all-organic product can be. Hair feel amazing after use.	1
Good but kind of drying	1
My psoriasis has been a lot less irritated now that I am swapping in this shampoo to replace my other shampoo every other wash. Not only is my hair cleaner, but my psoriasis is a lot less flared up. I am very happy with this shampoo.	1
Really good one my head feels really relaxed after chemical shampoos it's pretty big bottle.thanks for inventor.	1
The best one Ive ever used!!!	1
Selenium appeared in my search results when I was looking for an organic anti-dandruff shampoo. I was super excited to see the 5 star review. I have been struggling with dandruff for past 6 years and I was really hoping this will make a difference, atleast keep the dandruff at bay for 2 days followed by a shampoo wash with Selenium. But unfortunately, it hardly keeps dandruff at bay. And to make it worse, it makes your hair super dry.	-1
I have a dry scalp and occasional dandruff. This product really helps! Leave it on for a few minutes then really lather it up and give your scalp a good scrubbing. It really works.	1
Was skeptical at first. The liquid is kind of runny. However, it is absolutely awesome performance wise. Hands down the best shampoo out there. Smells great, cleans hair great and stopped me from scratching my head after using this product for a couple of times.	1
Been looking for good shampoo that would work with my dry hair for a long time. Tried a lot of options. This is the one. Hair feels as clean as possible after use. Also, deals with dandruff problem easily. No more snowy shoulders.	1
This really dries out my hair and makes it feel even thinner than it already is. The smell is nice, but consistency is pretty much water. I honestly think most of the reviews are false	-1
It gets messy after the first few times, but clears out the head nicely. My son has no traces of eczema and very small amount of dandruff after less than two weeks of use.	1
I really like using organic products and this product had awesome reviews. Ive been seeing a dermatologist for my psoriasis and received a much of topical cream and even steroid injections. So I wanted to go more oganic. It still didn't work and Ive used the whole bottle. It didn't even help improve it any bit. Im sure this may work for someone else but it didn't for me.	-1
Skin did not improve. Felt like using scented water.	-1
My product was not sealed and either used or something.. attached are pictures. Would like a refund please.	-1
Doesnt smell	-1
Throwing it away, burned my scalp.	-1
Awful. Zero anti dandruff properties. Comes out of bottle like water, so very easy to waste. Very poor lathering, requires large quantity to lather up hair. Vague smell, not bad but also not pleasant.	-1
The shampoo is very watery, and I did not see too much of a difference in my dandruff.	-1
I agree with several of the other reviewers. Feels as though Im just rubbing banana scented water through my hair and after I shower, my hair feels greesy (like when I don't use any shampoo) so I wonder if there is something fishy going on here. Read the other reviews and you'll noticed most of them have nothing to do with shampoo. DO NOT trust.	-1
A really good gentle cleanser. Always leaves my hair feeling clean, and soft. Also virtually eliminated dandruff issues where other bigger named products consistently failed.	1
This product is a scam!  Not only does it have the consistency of water, but you need a tremendous amount for it to foam, as suggested in the instructions.  I have a shaved head and can see going through this bottle in a week or two at this pace.  To make matters worse, the my short hair was sticking up as if I had been electrocuted!  I'm going to try try this junk one more time and if I experience similar results, I'm going to try to return this trash.  BUYER BEWARE!!!	-1
I bought this shampoo because the description stated it was gentle, for itchy, red and irritated scalp. I used it one time and it burned my scalp almost immediately! I bought two bottles and I am returning them both!  I honestly don't know how it get so many good reviews.	-1
Great smell and products.	1
Love this product. It is the only thing that has worked on my flaky scalp. Not too heavy and the fragrance is pleasant in comparison to other products.	1
I've used a chemical shampoo for too long and my hair started breaking off! So with a lot of research I bought this! It has made my hair (which is thin with oily roots and dry ends) way stronger and shinny without being oily! It's really fantastic. I took a star away for 2 reasons, one is because the price is a bit outrages, and two is because if I use it every day my hair starts to get buildup so I have to find a clean shampoo that washes away the build up to use twice a week..	1
I bought this for my husband. Hed been having issues with dandruff, but most dandruff shampoos cause skin issues. He loves it. Its just great for his hair and skin aside from helping with the dandruff. It smells good, too. Great product. I highly recommend it and would buy it again if it were still available on the site!	1
Arrived opened  and leaking all over the box.  Tried shampoo but didn't help at all.  Still so itchy.	-1
Came on time. She will love it!	1
Nope. It smells like artificial bananas, and this smell does linger. It's pure liquid, there is no thickness to it at all, it's like pouring banana water on your head that lathers. It does not help with an itchy scalp either (I have psoriasis). This shampoo neither helped nor hindered my hair or scalp, made absolutely no difference (except for the banana smell). Don't waste your money.	-1
I love how soft this makes my skin and the scent is amazing. When my local stored are out I can always get it at Amazon	1
Love this perfume. Light and feminine and doesn't give me a headache like many other fragrances.	1
Love this product because of the way it makes my hair feel and look.	1
I was using this shampoo from six years and found helpful restoring hair and reducing dryness of psoriasis. But it was discontinued from three years .Why I don't know .Then I used other psoriasis  shampoos ,which didn't help .scalp still dry and hair falling down. I bought on line but came in small bottle and was costly, and was looks like doublicate not the real.	1
I love this shampoo!!!!!!	1
I have an Airbnb.  This is perfect for guests.  The price is right and I can provide shampoo with little waist.  I appreciate this product	1
Husband loves it.... Uses it to wash his locs	1
Love this shampoo.  I have been using it for years...keeps the yellow out of gray hair.	1
love this shampoo	1
Great ingredients, but didn't agree with my skin	1
love it. will continue to use all products from herline	1
Very nice scrub. Not walnut or random shell pieces acting as your physical exfoliant in this product! Neither does it use plastic microbeads. Definitely cleans my face when I need to get rid of flaky skin, but it does not leave my skin tight or dry. Instead, my skin is soft and smooth - but not irritated, (I know this because my skin is not red, especially considering certain sections of my face still have healing blemishes). Will try the hair care products soon.	1
I bought this shampoo to go in wedding guest gift bags who are joining us on a cruise. I wanted something that was natural and this little tube of shampoo fit the bill. I also recieved an email from the company thanking me for my purchase and thought that was a nice customer service touch. I will definitely be exploring their other products and recommend this company.	1
My husband loves this soap and I love how it makes him smell. Worth the dollars!	1
My scalp randomly starts hating any kind of product being on it and retaliates by going crazy with eczema like symptoms that seems to last forever. This is the only shampoo and conditioner that I have found that doesn't make my scalp cranky...It's a good product!	1
I weirdly got this at a Dave & Buster's in Culver City with game tickets the first time I tried it. I had never worn powder before. That was two years ago, and I continue to wear this powder every day. It makes my complexion look so even and hides the redness I get after drinking too much coffee. Highly recommend!	1
Excellent product.	1
thanks	1
This is one of the BEST shampoos for swimmers. I always got complements on my hair since I started using this product. Unavailable now.	1
It's Bare Escentuals, 'nuff said!	1
nice	1
Very pleased   Nice assortment	1
This is so handy and unique! Comes in a protective pouch, and with an extra refil. Seems like it will last a long time for those who just like a little dab of a beautiful scent.	1
Use regularly. love this product.	1
Great	1
Biolage is a great product. Thank you for providing the product for me. All Biolage products are wonderful. Thank you!	1
This pressed powder goes on like silk, so light weight but covers well. I don't like to use a heavy powder that shows all the wrinkles, this one is just right!	1
This is just adorable compact fragrance. It comes in a gorgeous silver compact. A cute carry pouch. And to my surprise- a refill. I am Uber pleased with this purchase. Oh and the D&G Lifht Blue is one of my forever favorite fragrances.  Love	1
What the hubby wanted	1
Took care of my flaky scalp, a problem I've had for years.	1
This and the matching conditioner saved my scalp. My hair was falling out due to a very dry scalp. Nothing else I tried would cure my issue. My head literally hurt. After one use, my scalp had real relief. My hair looks beautiful after just two washes. I'm definitely going to buy this again. The smell is not great, but you'll look past it to save your scalp. It is one of the only products that is 100% truly organic. No added chemicals. Very gentle and effective. I highly recommend this product.	1
Have been using the product since I got my first as a gift and I like it.  I have dry coarse hair and it helps to soften it and take away the dullness.	1
This set is awesome! I bought one for myself and bought a second one as a gift! Good scents and a good price.	1
This body wash smells amazing. Let me see how to describe "amazing" as a scent. It smells like you just showered in a botanical garden on a beautiful spring day.  Plus your skin feels silky smooth thereafter.	1
Great product	1
Frequently get compliments on my beautiful shiny hair, great shampoo	1
Love this product. Cleans hair quickly and leaves hair soft.	1
Best shampoo/conditioner hands down	1
love it	1
Excellent product.  The package arrived quickly in perfect condition.  I definitely recommend this product  and this particular seller.	1
Very pleased with Uhuru Naturals Hair Growth Shampoo.  It stopped my hair loss, and adds volume.  My hair has even developed waves that it never had before, plus it's soft and silky. I'll certainly buy more of this excellent shampoo when I finish the bottle I have now.  I've already recommended it to friends. This shampoo is gentle to my baby fine hair and leaves it really clean.	1
Very happy with my first time using it my hair was manageable	1
Love this shampoo. Just wish Axe still made it.	1
Smells great!! Thanks for the fast delivery!	1
These are my favorite eye shadows! Box even comes with instructions. Love it!	1
Love Love Love, Very hard to find	1
Nice light mousse.  Gives some control to old gray wild hair.	1
Wife uses this cream always. Hard to get.	1
Also a very good product	1
Excellent product	1
Best stuff on earth for your hair!	1
Love this cream. I have been using it for over 6 years and will continue to use it as long as it is available. I LOVE it!!!	1
My favorite powder!	1
I have really sensitive skin therefore never was able to use any type of scrub all my life.  But a friend advice me to try this one because my skin started to smell pretty bad during certain  times of the month.  Causes no irritation and I was able to use it everyday.  Seems to get rid of the oily smell from my face.	1
Excellent Amla powder! Very fresh and edible quality. You need be little competitive on the price though.	1
Highly recommend	1
gives a nice body to thin hair.	1
I can't live without this shampoo!	1
Love this stuff.	1
This shampoo is so refreshing! I love how clean and tingly it makes my scalp feel, and it smells really good, too!	1
Love it	1
Great product!  This is a wonderful addition to any dopp kit to keep your face lettuce looking sharp.	1
Great product... just what I wanted.  Works great and very stylish.	1
My male roommate and I both love this shampoo! My hair looks healthy and never dry or frizzy when I use it consistently. All the Theorie products I have used have been excellent and do exactly what they promise. I would recommend it to anyone!	1
Google the uses and you will be a buyer.	1
Great price!  Product received exactly as described, in perfect condition and  on time.  Thank You	1
Great comb! Very well made and the wood even has a nice scent. Pairs well with Northern Fir's beard oil!	1
This is one of the most beautiful lotions I have ever used. Compliments on a daily basis! It is so soft and smooth. Love it!	1
Great product and good service.	1
I'm 63 with still nice hair but so much less than when I was younger, before menopause, so I bought both the shampoo and this conditioner to help strengthen and grow my hair possibly thicker again...the shampoo made my hair feel so stiff it was hard to push my fingers thru my scalp, I wasn't happy, but rinsed and put in this conditioner..........WOW..... my hair turned into silk.....my scalp felt cool like there is mint in the conditioner.....hope it works, I will stick it out because of the conditioner.....I also never understand when a company make the shampoo bottle larger than the conditioner bottle...we all use more conditioner than shampoo, ..i will update in a couple of months	1
love this shampoo, came very quickly, thank you.	1
Eau de Hadrien is my favorite of the Annick Goutal line & the lotion is lovely.	1
Christmas present. My son loves the variety. Inviting look. Efficient packaging. Arrived in a few days.  :)	1
Great	1
I appreciate craftsmanship and Northern Fir provided that with this comb. Great relic for any man who appreciates the finer things in life. I use it for my hair and have no issues what-so-ever. Thanks!	1
Great product!	1
I have been using this shampoo for a long time and was happy to have it available to me a 4 pack; to me it's the best shampoo available	1
I love this product. Really makes my hair moisturized and silky	1
This is a great product. I have been using it since two years ago. It is very gentle on your hair!	1
Great product and fast service.	1
Looks very well-made and colors are rich.  A bit larger than I expected (shame on me for not looking at dimensions), but I think it will look lovely in my daughter's hair.	1
This product works very well for me. I have tried so many things for straightening my hair. I use various creams and lotions while my hair is wet but I use this after I blowdry and before I flat iron.. My hair is curly (super curly at my scalp and very frizzy through the body of my hair). I have a lot of hair but it is thin and fine in texture. Before I flatiron I mist this all over my head. Be cautious not to overdo it or spray to close.  Even though looks like a big can of hairspray it is a spray shine that elimates frizz and makes your hair smooth and soft. 3 cans will last me an eternity but the price was great and a must have any time I straighten my hair	1
always good to freshen up when traveling	1
Great smell and good product. I don't know that it moisturizes our daughters hair as much as we'd like, but the Tangle Taming Conditioner is a good follow-up for this shampoo.	1
Smells incredible...almost a musk, deep scent. Lathers very well. You feel clean all day!	1
I like this shampoo. It makes my hair feel nice and soft. I'm in my 50's and on medication. So my hair always feels dry. But when i use this shampoo it makes my hair so much softer.	1
Purchased this for my wife, she loves the product.  She uses it very night, can see a difference in her skin.	1
Very nice fragrance.	1
makes hair smell really good	1
I really like the way this product  enhances my hair's natural curl without being sticky.  Lightweight and non-greasy.	1
To me this shampoo has to best smell. It cleans very well without drying my hair out. My favorite shampoo.	1
Great stuff, wish I could find more	1
Love this shampoo! Recommended by a friend! Color really lasts!	1
ive been using this cleanser for a few years now. i only found it in korea and brought a few tubes every time i visit (once a year). gentle but gets all the crap off. so happy to see it available stateside now.	1
So excited to see this on amazon! I found this hem while traveling and couldn't find it anywhere when I got him, this scrub is seriously the best. Gentle and effective.	1
Good Stuff!	1
Love this stuff - i'm on my second order. Started to get thinning hair. now there's whisps where there wasn't any and hair feels thicker all over.	1
Best stuff ever!  Makes my hair less frizzy when using with a flat iron.  Makes it soft & silky.  Highly recommend!	1
I love the smell of this body wash! It doesn't dry out my skin either!	1
best for keratin treatments	1
It worked very well i disliked nothing	1
Received product in a timely fashion and am pleased.	1
By far the BEST shampoo and conditioner I have used.  As someone with very thick and dry hair it has given me back the shine and texture I craved.	1
This has helped my hair more than any other product I've tried. I went from red back to blonde and the stylist I was seeing FRIED my hair. Literally told me "no charge for the chemical cut!" and laughed. It's been an entire year of hair rehab and this is the only stuff that's worked. I've tried Kerastase, PHYTO and Davines. The Davines conditioner was great, the shampoo not so much. So I switched back to Theorie.	1
Seems to work as usual.	1
Leaves your hair full of volume and smells great	1
My son also likes this	1
Perfect size.	1
Love  the scent and it work better than any other mousse I have used. it makes my hair look natural, not stiff. My hair is shinier and fuller. Great stuff.	1
Used for years, it has DHT blocker	1
Great Product; does wonders for colored treated hair.	1
I love it! I wish the conditioner was still available	1
It makes your scalp tingle and does a great job of cleaning your hair.	1
This keeps my silver hair looking silvery (rather than yellow).  I reorder this on a regular basis.	1
Great fragrance and product.  Will purchase again.	1
I like the way it cools my head and cleans my hair	1
Smells very nice.	1
Been using this for years. Cheaper to buy this little bulk of 3 than in a single. I use these especially on humid or rainy days as I have hair that will go nuts, frizz & grow as the day goes along on these types of days. Don't use too much though because it will give a greasy look if overdone.	1
Fantastic Product.  Been using it for years! You'll want to use it will the conditioner as well.	1
I really wish Redken had not discontinued this product, it is such a great product and now I will need to find a long term replacement :(	1
This shampoo and conditioner leave my hair in great condition. I've just started using it so I cannot tell whether or not it will stimulate hair growth.	1
I love musk cologne and it is not easy to find so I bought these.  I like all the scents but the original musk is my favorite.	1
For months i was waiting the product to come back for sale. When i saw it is available again i bought 2!! It was a good choice. I searched a lot for an organic kid hair gel, and i did not find a better one. Holds my son hair for hours. I know it is a lit expensive, but worth it.	1
just what I wanted and at a great price	1
Love this stuff! Works great when flat ironing my hair and it smells great!	1
Perfect for a pleasant "all day essence"!	1
My hair is softer with less frizz after blow drying.	1
Works great!	1
Love the this 2-1 shampoo and conditioner.  Does wonders for my hair and enjoy using it.	1
My daughter is thrilled with this flat iron.  She's been asking for a ceramic flat iron for a while now and I couldn't pass up the opportunity to try this.  She is pleased with how it flattens out her hair.  I received this product for free or at a discounted rate in exchange for product testing and review.

I am an avid hair-straightener. I bought this to serve as my travel straightener, and it will actually become my daily user. It is so sleek and nice. The plates do not grab hair, making it easy to quickly run through my hair. I love how quickly it heats up and the digital temperature gauge is great. I have thinner hair so this is perfect to adjust the heat just right. I highly recommend this product. It is compact and easy to store away. Also comes with a heat glove. Although I do not use one, it is nice to have an an option just in case. Zero complaints! I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest review.	1
good, happy with the product and price	1
Would not use any other conditioner.  I use it at least every 2 weeks to keep my white hair shining and healthy!	1
The silver shampoo I had been using is no longer available, so I tried this. It does a great job as far as color goes but didn't leave my hair as soft. I have very thick coarse hair and it's hard to find a product to soften it. Overall I'm very pleased, especially for the cost.	1
Yeah, the huge size!!!  This stuff has changed my naturally curly hair!	1
Miami is my favorite	1
I have used this product for years. It is the only one that controls the frizz on humid days.	1
This is a great help for fine hair, I've used it for three years and it really makes a difference !	1
The shampoo and conditioner both work very well. My hair feels softer and looks fuller.  I'm very happy with it	1
Great product. Thick, concentrated, worth the investment.	1
Love this shampoo. I first bought it years ago from Sally's Beauty Supply. I have very coarse hair. It leaves it silky smooth and feels like I don't even need conditioner,  which is a first. I like that it doesn't contain phosphates, because that's not something I want to have to worry about. I'm definitely going to purchase this again. Great shampoo!	1
All of the different colognes and the price.	1
Great product , price and fast shipping	1
Love this shampoo for my fine hair....gives great volume!	1
I don't know if it really works yet but smells great n my hair looks good too.	1
Great for the price	1
Excellent product! Excellent transaction.	1
like it	1
Shine, body, no frizz. Love this shampoo	1
My favorite!!!!!	1
as advertised	1
Smells wonderful. Feels great on hands and arms, etc.	1
I LOVE the smell, the texture, everything about it!!!  This is my absolute favorite.  I want the body lotion, but you usually can only find it in a set.  I just want the lotion, I have two bottles of perfume, just to get the lotion.  It's wonderful.	1
Purchased this product after researching products to help my son with his three year old daughters naturally curly blonde hair. The baby shampoos he had used were drying her hair out, and most of the detanglers weighted down her curls too much. Started using this product along with the Dark and Lovely Beautiful Beginnings Deep Conditioner and her hair is more manageable, not dried out, and has the natural bouncy curls that are adorable.	1
Excellent product	1
can't beat it... 3 for the price of 1 at a local store	1
love them	1
I love it. It worked great!	1
Great lather, delicious smell and really cleans!	1
Great anti-frizz product!	1
Looked all over to find where to purchase this product and we are very happy to be able to finally find it. The PRELL Conditioner is by far the best you can buy. We love it	1
All time favorite fragrance! If you love the smell of lemons this is for you!	1
This is a great product. It is alcohol free but holds well . I used to get it at Sally's but they discontinued it . Thankfully I was able to buy it here.	1
As expected for price.	1
Love this shampoo and am happy to find it online	1
Beautiful hair after use...shiny !	1
I have used this product for years and love it.	1
Good price.  Good product	1
what can I say my favorite hair product at a great price. I had to buy it!	1
These are products I use regularly and am always looking for a "good deal" -- I feel this was a very good deal!  Quick delivery and completely satisfied!	1
This is a fantastic loose eye shadow set! The pigmentation is phenomenal and the color choices are great! I love this set!	1
Excellent! Best soap I ever had.	1
this is great and my pups never get the puppy smells, always clean	1
Great product!!	1
Fast shipping, great price & product. 100% satisfaction.	1
love this product - wish I could find it in the store, but it's great to be able to get here	1
Sally's stop selling this great shampoo for fuller thicker hair thanks to this company through Amazon I can buy again. This is a great shampoo if you want to hide that you have thin hair, but this shampoo only gives volume for a few hours.	1
Love it. Have used it for years	1
Love it !!!! It actually came early!	1
makes hair fuller and is gentle on scalp.  hair feels soft.	1
I get more compliments when I wear this lotion!!!	1
I use this product daily I love it.	1
Good	1
Good shampoo, hair stays where its combed to.  Good stuff!	1
Worked great!	1
AS awesome as this product is, it HAS been discontinued by the makers. The people selling this on here, including the shampoos and conditioners ARE price gouging you and who knows how OLD it is..  Very Sad	1
:)	1
Although it's pretty long, it fits perfectly. It looks very similar to the style of the lab coat given to me by my school.	1
Great product would buy from seller agian	1
Love this stuff! Adds glowing moisture to my dry skin without oily feeling!	1
Love this stuff.  Only shampoo I will use.	1
Great product for fine hair, too bad it is discontinued by Bain De Terre	1
Very satisfied.	1
This is the only shampoo my husband will use, he is very picky. Loves the peppermint.	1
I have very curly hair and always used Mousse products.  I began to have a reaction to the product and tried naturelle.  The gel works well and I have no reaction to the product.  Very glad I found it!	1
Fast delivery and great product!!!!!!	1
Gives fine hair more body in just a couple days use	1
Works great for hair thats thin.  Wish Walgreens kept it on the shelf.	1
Great shampoo.	1
Best stuff, smells great, tames frizz and leaves shiny!	1
Very Good	1
Order arrived on time and exactly as described	1
My family and I have used this shampoo and love it the conditioner is great also. I love Le Grande Francisco products!!	1
My "go to" shampoo for my blonde foiled hair. The only other product I'll use aside from Pureology.  Warning to new users, don't leave in too long or it will blue your hair and wait one week before using on newly highlighted hair.	1
super conditioner	1
Best product Pantene made and can't find it in stores anymore.	1
Love this product! I use as a night cream and wake up with a soft refreshed feeling.	1
I like how it works on my haur, have it looking great.	1
Great product great price	1
Awesome product	1
I love this lotion.  It has a light clean smell to it.  Putting it on then adding a little of spray of perfume gives you a smell that brings lots of compliments.	1
Great shampoo for my 2 year old he has mixed hair	1
Does a great job of volumizing and is gentle on my hair.	1
It was scary when Tigi stopped making this stuff, and we were all scrambling to buy whatever was left online  now I guess they're making it again, so thank god.  They changed the packaging but it's still the same great product.  This has been my favorite shampoo and conditioner for over ten years now  it's the best of all worlds.  I even gifted some to my boyfriend, who has long curly hair, because he loves using mine so much.	1
I've had scalp issues my entire life and this is the only brand that not only didn't cause problems but cleared up problems I've had since I was a kid. I can remember my grandpa playing with my hair when I was eight and then going "Good grief, her scalp is one giant scab!" but since I've started using Nature's Gate I barely even have dandruff, much less scabs. I cannot express enough how much I love this brand. I may joke about the vegan shampoo thing, but everyone who knows me knows how much I adore this company and their products. The fact that the range of products also happens to smell delectable is just a bonus for me. When I moved somewhere where it wasn't easily found in stores I did try some other paraben and sulfate free shampoos and that was SUCH a disaster. I was just lucky it didn't give me horrible sores (which has happened in the past when trying different shampoos). So I got online and got my shampoo.	1
My wife and me have used this shampoo for a long time. Our best choice product. I have worried my hair loss but this shampoo helpful on my hair.	1
Very good product for fine/thin hair.  Does help with texture and thickness.	1
Finding a "natural" shampoo that isn't disappointing is a challenge. They usually fail to lather and leave hair feeling dry or dull. This shampoo lathers just enough and as someone with straight, somewhat thin hair, I've been pleased with the way this shampoo really does smooth the hair but without weighing it down.	1
If you want your skin moisturized and feeling absolutely great then buy this body cream.  Perlier makes such a great line of products.  I also buy the bath cream to go with this.  It just smells so wonderful and leaves your skin in such nice condition that once you use it you will never buy another product.	1
Love this.  I can't find it in the makeup stores.  It feels really good on my lips.  Other glosses cause my lips to become dry, especially on the edges of my lips.  This one doesn't and I get compliments on how good it looks on me by everyone.	1
Been using this brand for years. My scalp and hair love it whether I'm living in Calofornia or Hawaii. Good quality hair products!	1
I'm a fan!	1
I've used this shampoo for years and loved it............. BUT.... the last bottles I bought at Big Lots were only $1.70 for 16ozs.  There's no way its worth $39 a bottle.  Who are you guys kidding? What a scam! There are plenty of other products out there that do a good job for far less money. Use a nice conditioner (I still have several bottles left that I paid less than $2 for) and you'll still get nice results.  Bah-humbug for those scam artists trying to sell this for 10 times what it's worth.	1
If they discontinued this scent I would go postal. <3	1
Loved it and would love to but some more but just to expensive..	1
I love this scent, and it's no longer being made. I'm always on the hunt for "something like it." It reminds me of the 70's fragrance, "Golden Autumn", also not being made any more. Today's scents hit my nose in the wrong way, they are either too "piquant" with heavy tones of freesia, or too much like bubble gum. I spent the money and bought Channel No. 5 thinking, I'd just sort "move up", and while it smell great at first blush, it turns into just a baby powder smell on me. I can get baby powder for a lot less. If the fragrance gods are listening, please recreate this or something like it! I always get compliments on it.	1
Love this body wash!! My absolute favorite! And very hard to find.	1
Love the scent. Not overpowering.	1
I really like the H20 shampoo.	1
I really like these products - I saw some folks talked about "slowed" grey growth.  I haven't really noticed that.  But my hair seems less frizzy when I use this product.	1
Smells great and is as described	1
Fabulous and cheaper than down in Disney World	1
Very rich and creamy, moisturizes with no greasy feel!	1
I bought this for my daughter.  She is vegan. She loves it,  makes her hair soft and helped with her dry scalp.. Just wish it came in a larger size because she has to use quite a bit of the conditioner, she has very long hair.	1
Great shampoo	1
Item just as described	1
always my come back  favorite	1
I would recommend this eye cream because it is extremely moisturizing and it only takes a small dab for each eye.  I could tell after only a few times of using it that the fine lines around my eyes weren't as noticeable.	1
Amazing product!!!	1
This is the shampoo I loved at Disney world.	1
excellent cream, great shipping.	1
Great scents, my son loves them all	1
Item came on time, brand new satisfied with product	1
I've been using this product for a couple of years at the suggestion of my hair stylist. Took away the dullness of my gray hair. I like it.	1
Calibra eye cream is great! It takes out puffiness and tightens skin and conceals fine lines. It is also great under makeup.	1
HALE BERRY Pure Orchid is a wonderful fragrance, it is becoming harder to find in dept. stores.	1
good	1
The swatch in the photo is wrong, but I received exactly what I ordered, and SO fast! Aubergine Queen #530 is a beautiful plum with a tiny bit of silver flake. It's gorgeous, too bad it was d/c'd...thank goodness for Amazon!	1
Does a great job of keeping hair from yellowing.  Leaves it clean and soft.	1
I was looking for a product that will help minimize the fine lines around the my eyes and only after 2 weeks I could notice an improvement. After 3 weeks my family started commenting on my skin! It does not leave my face feeling greasy nor does it have any fragrance. I feel like it has made my skin look firmer, which makes me looker younger!	1
Found this while on holiday in London.  I love this shower gel and the fragrance	1
Thank you	1
This has been my favorite forever!	1
I use Oglivie hair perm all of the time.  It's a great product for fine hair.	1
great product	1
I Have used a lot of eye creams because of what they promise, So I wanted to give this new eye cream "Calibra"  a try! I started using Calibra eye cream  which I started noticing a change  under my eyes after 2 weeks, after the 3rd week ,  The eye cream had firmed the skin around my eyes and reduces the fine lines and wrinkles. Also diminish the puffiness. It's not greasy, it makes my skin so soft under my eyes and younger looking!!   Also Calibra eye cream goes a long ways, You only use very little .  I give Calibra eye cream a  A+   I HIGHLY RECOMMENDED CALIBRA EYE CREAM!!   Also Calibra eye cream goes a long ways,  You just have to use very little.  I give this eye cream a A+   I HIGHLY RECOMMENDED CALIBRA EYE CREAM !	1
Every year we vacation on a lake and the kids love to wash their hair in the lake.  This shampoo and conditioner is perfect!!	1
Great product	1
Best Shampoo I have ever used, You would be foolish not to try it.	1
Love this shampoo and haven't been able to find it anywhere . . . .until I looked on Amazon. ;-)  It is great for wash, pick, and let dry.	1
Arrived in perfect condition	1
Excellent!!  Love the product not sticky and great price!!	1
I love it  Clean fresh smell, non irritating to my scalp..	1
These balms are not sold in store's anymore unfortunately but I was able to buy them here but I hope there not selling this product when it's old because they stopped making them in 2005  when that was the last time I saw them in store's.. It helps me with my lip chilitis condition.. If you don't know what lip chilitis is, look it up and I recommend you buy this because it helps my lips to stay smooth and soft but who knows every lip chilitis is different in every person. I would repurchase this product again	1
Great conditioner that leaves hair clean.	1
By far I think this is one of the best mousse there is and love the light smell , it not loud like most mousse , I will buy agin.	1
Smells amazing. I had to double bleach and my hair needed some extra love. It's a similar texture to any other oil, but the smell is the best part! I have been using it for about 1 week, and I have noticed my hair is soft and not wirey, from the bleach. I put it all over, minus my top roots and my hairline. This will only slightly weigh your hair down. My hair is past my hips, and I was not forced to cut it thanks to this product. I also, instead of rinsing straight away, let it sit overnight, washed it, and then repeated the process a few times. It's my new secret weapon against bleach breakage!!	1
Dark and lovely is how you feel after using this product, I recently purchased this for my daughter's curly hair. It smells great makes her hair soft and manageable she's happy to wash her hair now.	1
Love these organic products. This one is a Little pricey though. Great product nonetheless.	1
Great set!	1
Good product	1
Excellent product and has thicken my hair as advertised.	1
No problems.	1
Love it. Makes my hair just lovely and curly.	1
Before writing this review I used up the entire bottle of the calm shampoo and conditioner. It never made my scalp break out and made my hair super soft. If you are looking for more volume try the argon shampoo and conditioner. I basically used this one when I was wearing my hair straight and using a straightening iron. I would recommend this product. I have color treated hair with a slightly wavy, medium texture.	1
Always excellent, third time ordering, more to come, husband loves the soap.	1
I got these for personal use.  Perfect price for a beginner set of brushes.  Plus, it came with red glitter!! I mostly use the smallest size of the swirled handle for clean up and one of the line brushes and the angled one. I highly recommend these if you're using them for yourself.  I can't speak to how well they'd hold up for professional use.	1
They look just like the picture. .I just hope they hold up with all the nails I do daily for the cheap price! !! either way it's a good buy!!	1
Love how it makes my hair feel thicker yet very manageable	1
I received my order on time, and the products were not broken which I was afraid of.....the smell is heavenly Caress body washes never fail	1
Great price and very easy doing business with Amazon.	1
muy bueno	1
I think this shampoo can be even five stars, hair feels soft and fresh. But I think it doesn't give that feeling of clean hair near my roots. It might be just not the right type for me. But in general I would definitely recommend these products.	1
Excellent product!! It has been my favorite shampoo for several years, & is becoming more & more difficult to find...	1
Great shampoo ~ the only one we buy!	1
Best sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner ever! And...I've tried many. A little goes a long way, so don't hesitate to buy this wonderful product. .	1
Great value! This is one of the few moisturizer/serum that notably makes my skin more even tonned and smooth. Delivery time was reasonable given it was shipped from Turkey. Would buy again from this seller.	1
really cleans my hair with a fresh smell, will buy again	1
This shampoo lathers VERY well. I haven't had to use any other products when using this stuff. In addition to lathering very well, it adds shine, cleans thoroughly, it's gentle on the scalp, great scent, and it improves hair health.	1
So glad I found these on Amazon.  These aren't your ordinary bear claw clips.  These have a very strong grip and can handle thick hair easily and comfortably.  I'd love to buy more, just waiting for some new designs and colors.	1
Good quality	1
It is beautiful	1
best shampoo i ever used, they give you 10 extra sample packs too  :3	1
This not only deep cleans, but also clears my sinuses at the same time.  I LOVE the peppermint--it is so refreshing!	1
excellent quality and fast shipping	1
I was a little hesitant to order this clip but glad I did. Nice for summer. Mine looks a little different but same type of pattern. Just waiting for more!  These clips are an everyday accessory for me.	1
Very high quality product. I had difficulty finding something without paraben etc. that can actually hold my son's faux hawk all day - until now. This stuff is fantastic - just wish it weren't so expensive.	1
good item...no issues	1
luv it	1
One of my favorite skincare lines. That said, I usually use their other line but since I'm not getting younger, I thought I'd try their more mature line. Strangely, it's LESS moisturizing than their younger line. I'm still using it but next order will be back to their younger line of skincare.  I think the essence in this package is better but the overnight cream and moisturizer in the other package is much better.  I do not use their eye cream, though. Gave it away as it's just too heavy for my purposes and increases milia.	1
I love this shampoo . It leaves what hair l have left nice and clean.lt also smells nice.	1
Very silky and smooth is the results I received after using the product.	1
Started using this product from a high-end spa and was excited to be able to purchase on amazon for same price.	1
Awesome	1
I have a new number	1
Love this stuff!!#	1
I have always liked Prell conditioner and so does my wife. Great product, arrived safe and sound from "Naturaly" no problems. Would definitely buy from this vendor again.	1
I love this product so much bought for my Mother for Christmas and she loves it..........	1
It's all my son uses and great price and delivery	1
My main powder brush now :D I like that it is a little more firm and voluminous than regular powder brushes. It helps with my application of powder. I love the slight angle it has and I can't say much else other than I love it!	1
My hair feels really clean after using this shampoo & conditioner. I have hard water at home and I was using Neutrogena to remove the build-up and though it works well it also dried my hair out too much. This product does the same thing but leaves my hair feeling very clean & soft easy to manage. Very good product & would purchase again.	1
Great Product.	1
wife loved it	1
I love the clean smell conditions so well please my hair beautiful and shiny	1
This shampoo cleans my hair well, lathers well, and smells good.	1
I have been using this shampoo  for years,  I  was first introduced to it in Madera in the early 90's and for  some years had them ship me the product until I found a way to order in the U.S.    I am 74 years old and have very thick hair which most people my age would love to have as well as  a lot of young people, I believe using the right products may contribute to less hair loss.  I  have  been told you should not use the same shampoot all the time and switch every once in awhile and whenever I have tried other shampoos I immediately come back to  Kerastase.   It is truly a wonderful shampoo	1
It's the best shampoo I've ever tried! It didn't stop my hair loss 100% but I can see a big difference! I bought 3 and after I ordered again...	1
Wonderful fragrance. Love It.	1
This brand is really nice for brunette hair color. The shampoo gives nice body, shine and condition. I love the scent, it is not chemically based, so I choose these types. The bonus 2 pack was a very good deal too. It helps my natural hair dye keep its color longer too..	1
very good prodauct	1
My sister smiled from ear to ear.	1
Love these drops!	1
I love this eyeshadow.  The color is so pretty and neutral.  Everyone looks great in this shadow.  I originally received it in a kit from Bare Escentuals.  Another thing I like about it , all natural ingredients.  There is nothing in it that will harm my skin or eyes.  Makeup that is actually good for you. When I ran out I panicked.  I'm so glad I found it again.  Love it!	1
Nice shampoo with conditioner. So far, it has not caused any excessive dryness in my hair. Giving it 4 stars as the conditioner part is nothing fancy. My hair don't feel "well conditioned" after its use. If you are looking to save time and provide "some" conditioning to your hair, this product is good. However, if you are looking for a "healthy shine", you should use conditioner separately.	1
I have very thin very broken bleached hair. This product has changed my world! I can actually comb through my hair when I get out of the shower. Leaves hair soft and healthy. Love it!! I Use it every other day and I will continue using this product.	1
my wife loved it ,and thanked me ,she gets good coments all the time.	1
Smells Great!! Take's just a small amount to make your hair full and hold without any residue or stickiness. Works great, I have been using it for over 3 years now, no complaints...	1
Excellent product!  Received in good time.  Thank you!	1
Really love the product--has made a visible difference in my skin.  Also, seller was great, product arrived MUCH sooner than expected.	1
Loved this. ... but I can't fInd more. ... anywhere!	1
Great product - my wife loves it	1
Nice shampoo, and the smell is magnificent. Lingers on the hair all day, I get compliments all the time. I usually leave it on my hair for 10 minutes, wash it out, leave it to air dry naturally and use a frizz eliminating or heating serum with the flat iron. Wouldn't recommend it for coarse hair, it didn't leave the same results for my brother.	1
Fabulous moisturizer.	1
These refill intense reinforcing treatment , left my hair smooth and smell good! I like.	1
Awesome	1
Great Product. TOBS always has very pleasant and masculine scents!!	1
Excellent product.	1
I love this Shampoo and told my friends about it.	1
good	1
Love this!	1
The best hair product ever	1
Great! large enough for excellent coverage...love it!	1
Wish I could get some more!	1
Very Good Thank you	1
Nice and my mom likes it	1
excellent products and excellent seller	1
I love this hair cream! It has a nice subtle scent that isn't overpowering and it is very lightweight.	1
I have used HBL Hair Masque before and love the way my hair feels when I rinse out the masque. My hair is definitely more manageable. I would recomment this product to anyone experiencing dry or damaged hair.	1
These are the best perms!  I only wish we could still buy them.  The foam is so much nicer to work with and Ogilvie is a wonderful product.	1
Makes my hair shine better than anything else I've tried!	1
love this bubble bath,love all avon bubble bath,lathers great and smells great	1
Really good	1
extremely pleased, very pleasant scent, very longlasting...	1
I have been using this product since it launched, back several months ago. I have a ton of hair but it is somewhat fine. I color and use a ton of heat. So my hair is slightly on the dry side. This product line adds just the right amount of moisture and shine to my hair but doesn't make it oily and it isn't too heavy. I would recommend this product to anyone...no matter what your hair type! I buy all of my product from Sally Beauty Supply. This is one of my favorites!	1
Smells great. I'm looking for the cologne that matches. I have the Green Tea cologne and it's a great match for the Green Tea Body Wash. I wish this product offered the same. My complaint that the scent only lasts about 4 hours is the same as that for Green Tea. If you are looking for a very fresh scent (especially if you are a guy), this is a product I recommend.	1
I wish this were not a discontinued product. But I'm glad I found what's left of it! Great product!	1
Making waves curl defining shampoo really is great for my perm.  It keeps my curls nice and curly.  I use it once a week usually and my perms last so much longer by using it.  I don't use any other product other than the shampoo and conditioner and my hair looks like it has a natural curl to it.  I highly recommend Making Waves shampoo.	1
All time favorite!!!! Wish they still carried this!!!	1
Fantastic!  I love the Diva fragrance. It has been my fragrance of choice for over 30 years and I'm amazed at the number of compliments I receive.  People often ask what I'm wearing and where they can get it.  The original Creme Perfume in a tube (from the 1980's & 1990's) is no longer available and neither is the Body Lotion.  I do wish Ungaro would bring those items back.  Even though the formula for this Perfumed Body Cream in the jar does not seem to be the same as the original, it is still wonderful and I will continue using it, along with the spray perfume, as long as it is available.	1
Ok	1
Both of these products work well together.  The shampoo has an earthy smell,  but it is not unpleasant.  I feel that I am losing less hair.  Maybe it even feels thicker.  I know it is growing faster.	1
Thank You, I only wish it was more affordable.	1
A gift that was appreciated by the receiver.	1
Have used this product for the past 7 months. It has proven to be a great shampoo by improving the overall health of my hair.	1
I have used this off and on for several years and is great for natural curly hair. Can't find it in any stores so was glad to find it on line. I was told they quit making it.	1
You Just need a little, and it lathers up great. Smells good, leaves my hair shiny and curly, and manageable. My only complaint is for some unknown reason, they stopped making the 32oz. size. Probably because they want you to buy more of the 11oz size.	1
These two products are very good for my hair.  I have colored, thinning mid length hair and it keeps my locks moisturized and looking good.  I scalp feel clean and I don't feel like these products weighs down my fine hair.  The fragrance is very great and doesn't bother me, even though I'm very sensitive to fragrances.  Will keep using these products.	1
This cape was durable and very inexpensive.  I cut my husband's hair and this is just what I needed.  The velcro at the neck insures a proper fit.	1
I am a diehard bare minerals fan. Every single brush I own is by bare minerals EXCEPT for this one. I've used this brush nearly every day for at least 5 years now and the only reason I can tell its not brand-new is because the words "Elizabeth Arden" have worn off. I've never ever had a single bristle fall out of the brush, even when I'm washing it. I also take good care of it and wash it every week with baby shampoo. (Side Note: baby shampoo is significantly less expensive and works better than any "makeup brush shampoo")  The bristles are unbelievably soft and give a really even powder coverage and its very easy to vary the fullness of coverage with this brush. The angle is absolutely perfect for applying foundation. I find that this brush works really well with the Bare Minerals loose powder foundation, though I've gotten wonderful results using this brush with pressed powder as well.  This brush is extremely high quality, worth every penny and if you take care of it, it will last you forever.	1
I really liked  this perm.  It is easy to use and not as messy as the others.  If you was 'doing it yourself' you could tell where you was at on the curlers, because of the foam.  I have thin, fine, naturally curly hair.  Because my hair is so thin and fine,  I wanted this perm mainly for body.  It worked really well for what I wanted.  Unfortunately I can't find it now.  Hope I can find it again.  I would recommend it to anyone.  (When I had my hair stylist used this perm, they was amazed at how easy it was to use.)	1
good soap.  I have skin allergies and am having trouble with mass produced soaps.  So far so good and my skin feels great.	1
This is the original Matrix Amplifying / Volumizing System Shampoo with the number #1 printed on the front label. This is the original formula, which is much better than Matrix's new shampoo in the semi-clear/white bottled formula, by far !  Matrix should have never changed their old formula, for it does not work as well as the old one....!	1
This treatment is awesome to reinforce your hair and make it look shinny and healthy. I def recommend it for everybody.	1
This soap smells so good - clean and intriguing - that anyone who uses it in my home comments on it. It's not in any stores in my town so I found it online and ordered it - not some thing I usually do.	1
hard to find a lab coat the fits nice.  this one does. This is my second coat and i am not disappointed. If I need a new one, wold by again. shipping was on time.	1
Beautiful Beginnings have been the answer to my prayers when it comes to my daughter's very thick and curly hair. The shampoo, Detangler and Conditioner work like a charm together. Her hair was breaking too much prior to me using these, not, I only get a few strands when am all done washing and combing her hair. I can't seem to find them in the local Sally Beauty Supply nor grocery stores. Highly recommend!	1
I purchased a bottle of this shampoo because it's my favorite, ever. But when it arrived it had been wrapped too tightly and the top of the bottle broke off during shipping. I kept it because I was almost out of my bottle but let them know it had arrived damaged. They were nice enough to replace my bottle and send a very brief apology. You can definitely buy this stuff anywhere, but there's some peace of mind that comes from knowing your supplier will take care of you.	1
Great buy Product works very wel;l.  Leaves skin smooth and soft If you use Estee Lauder products,  Amnazon is great place to save money on them	1
It works amazing, fantastic, never used something like this before I highly recommend this product I will keep using it	1
Love the product, except for the fact that TWO bottles have now broken after being dropped in the shower. The tops needs to be screwed off which I would change to a more friendly flip top which would not require three hands. The product is too expensive to  be wasted down the drain or watered down because the top keeps getting broken off (two different bottles).	1
Love this shampoo, can't get enough of it! Leaves hair super soft, shiny and manageable. A little expensive to buy but well worth the investment!! Nothing else compares!	1
THIS WAS A GIFT PURCHASED LAST YEAR FOR MY DAUGHTER WHO ABSOLUTELY LOVES CURVE FOR WOMEN AND WHO COULD PASS UP THE PRICE I PAID!!	1
Makes my facial pores smaller and I swear  that my wrinkles seem less obvious around my eyes.  Much appreciated since large pores run in the family.	1
Packaging was nicely done with bubble wrap and paper. Box is amazing besides perfume and I love the new red door design. Order this one because im used to the old bottle design which they sent the new one and im glad they did.	1
My ordered and loves it so guess what I love it if she loves It and if Mama is happy every body is happy!!!!	1
Love this stuff makes my skin feel great the only brand I buy just wish it did not cost so much	1
I will never be without this product.  I have used it for 5 years.  Foundation just glides on over top.  I use it with Estee Lauder foundation but you could probably use another brand.  I am 62 and get compliments on my skin all of the time.	1
This is the best product I've found that somewhat controls any frizz in my hair, without making it dull and weighted down.  I've tried so many other products which have not performed well.  Perfect product that is not tested on animals!  I use it together with MOP c-straight smoothing conditioner.	1
I have thick but fine hair, and I had a hugely horrible cut that left me with layers of split ends.  My hairdresser recommended this product and it's absolutely terrific for my hair.  It leaves it looking much better while it grows out.  My hair looks a little courser (nice), and I get great volume. Split ends are managed better.  Great smell too.  I use it with the Matrix conditioner (and I usually don't like conditioners) and it leaves my hair so soft but it doesn't lose its shape.  I was recently traveling and ran out, used a different product to wash my hair, and was miserable until I could get back to this product.	1
Makes my skin feel amazingly elastic and soft. A little goes a long way. Pricey but definitely worth it! LOVE IT!	1
Love this stuff.  It works better on my Psoriasis better then the medical creams and ointments the doctors prescribed.  Too bad they stopped making it.  Horde it all now because someday it will be gone and you will be forced to use head and shoulders.	1
This product was definitely a good deal for me. No surprises about the delivery estimated time and especially (and much more important) because the product that arrived here was exactly what I was expecting.  The seller did everything just like promised and I will have no hesitation in buying something with him again if I get interested by any of his products.  By the way, this bottle has an excelent size for saving money by buying in big quantities, so a definitely recomend it!	1
I always get compliments when I wear this perfume. It was delivered in a timely manner. It looked just like the picture. The price was nice.	1
I love this lotion and use it under make up for a glow. I used to be able to but it locally but can't find it any more. This is a good price.	1
My favorite color:) a nice brown with some sparkles. I would recommend to a friend any day of the week!!!	1
Matrix Biolage Fortifying conditioner is excellent. I use it all the time specially when I go to the beach, I live it on to protect my hair.	1
I have been wearing for years while I am on stage (and off stage).  I wish it were still in stores.  Thank you!	1
In my opinion any product by Decleor is going to improve your skin!! High end luxury skin care at a good price.	1
I just love this shampoo. Unfortunately, I can't find it in any local stores.  Try it, you'll really like it.	1
I've worn Chanel #5 since I was 12 years old.  This was a great price for the only perfume I've ever worn.	1
I have been wearing this fragrance for years and the body cream luxurios. In fact I wear it alone for a longer lasting and subtle effect.	1
Best shampoo and conditioner for fine, bleach blonde hair! The only set that makes my hair smooth and HEALTHY! LOVE IT!	1
Good shampoo and conditioner.  I have always colored my hair and this set protects my color as it really cleans my hair.  The fragrance is nice and light.  Will buy again.	1
As always Bare Minerals never disappoints and the color is gorgeous and goes with everything, it is a must buy.	1
Great product that works well when used together with repair formula conditioner. Love the way my hair felt after shampooing,	1
I have used this before and had missed it terribly. It is a fabulous product that I recommend for anyone with dry course hair.	1
Been wearing it for years, can't find it in stores anymore.  Has just a little bit of sparkle.  Like the color a lot!	1
THIS IS WHAT BODY GLOSS IS SUPPOSED TO BE LIKE... IT JUST SHOULDNT HAVE TO COST SO MUCH TO BUY	1
My hair feels soft after I started use them. They smell wonderful! If you are like me, asian, with lots of thick hair, that are prone to frizz, I think for this prize, it's worth trying them!	1
I have fine hair that's oily at the crown and very dry brittle ends.  A year ago my stylist recommended the HBL products.  Now I can't live without them!  I use hydrating shampoo and the hair masque. Only a small dab needed.  The higher cost is made up for in value of the product. I occasionally change up shampoo by using the HBL volumizing shampoo.  With the hydrating I wash hair more quickly as it is rich but never leaves hair oily.  With the masque...I do use daily but I apply first at the brittle ends and then work up from there....basically only using the remaining residuals of the shampoo on my crown.  After washing I towel dry and after it begins to dry I then work into the dry ends, a pea sized amount of the HBL Shine and Seal.  Any residual on finger tips is lightly applied to areas with fly aways. My hair looks healthy and naturally shiny!  Products smell fresh and clean.	1
This is "hands down" my favorite shine complex. Smells the best - citrusy and light,fresh. No longer able to find at beauty supply stores. Been using for years !	1
Would buy more of the body cream if moire was available.  This body cream is hard to come by.  I buy anytime I find on a site.  Lotion is easily available but the body cream is difficult to obtain.  This is my signature fragrance.	1
I would give it 5 stars but it is way over priced! My hair is looking better and seems to be healthier but I am using the Reflection Chroma Thermique also so who knows which one is working or if it is the combination..I won't pay that price again, if it were cheaper I would keep using it but I am not going to keep using it at that price..Now that my hair is in better shape I think it will be okay, I had damaged it using bleach..	1
Very speedy delivery and the product was exactly as expected. For anyone who hasn't used Biolage products, START. The only shampoo/conditioner that actually performs as promised for my very long, very fine, very long hair! Would definitely buy again from this seller!	1
Great hair care products always leave my hair feeling clean and soft, ive tried a lot of products but these are my favorite	1
It's great! Packaged right no dents on the box (container) it came with. Love the product been using it for years... Will order again from this store.	1
I really love this shampoo. the only problem is the vendor doesn't package it well. If you love the smell of fresh grapefruit on a cool summer morning, this shampoo is for you. If not, perhaps you would consider the Macallan single malt scotch shampoo. It is expensive, but leaves you smelling just like the kind of women I like to meet in bars.	1
Can't get this in the US (not ever made here, as far as I know), and not in Canada apparently anymore either.  Pricey but it's an import....	1
Even it doesn't look as pretty, but it make shower so pleasant.  It totally feels like clean without slipping feeling.	1
This is likely the best shampoo and conditioner that I have bought in recent years. Goes will with the hair gel that they sell as well. Happy with my purchse.	1
I wanted to get my 75 year young mother something she would enjoy & not be upset about the cost-(she worried about me for 35+ years) when the package arrived & she saw that mixed w/ my normal items (tools,blades,knives-ect)was a package of some lavender smelling something, she said, as most mom's say-"I hope you didn't spend much on anything for me"-after she used the soap & walked into the living room, she said "what a wonderful soap & such a thoughtful gift" I know my mom loves lavender (I smell like wood most of the time) she still remarks on how well she enjoys the soap & it does have a long lasting fragrance- if any of you men out there, have a mother,daughter,sister or wife, that likes lavender & relaxes when they do what ever women do in the bathroom- you will make some points by investing a few $ in this soap- such a simple thought w/ wonderful results- Thanks once again Amazon & thanks EO for a wonderful product	1
Smells great with out the allergy issues.  I wish I didn't have to have required number of words.  What more can I say about soap?	1
~BACKGROUND~ We purchased this cape to use when my wife gives me and my son haircuts.  ~PROS~ - Adjustable neck strap (works on me and my 7 year-old son) - Good size at 36" x 54" - Repels water - Appears to be well made  ~CONS~ I would prefer a snap closure versus the velcro which tends to hold hair - a minor gripe though.  ~CONCLUSION~ This cape has made cutting hair easier as it keeps cut hair off of clothes and contains a lot of hair so it can be dumped into the trash can and shaken out outside.	1
I was nervousness about the scent because IVe never tried this, but I love Paul Mitchell so I decided to try it.  It smells great!!!  This is a medium hold spray, so I'll use it when my hair is down (I use a stronger hold when I put my hair up).  Shipping speed was good to Alaska too.	1
it is a mauve with shimmer.  I knew this because I have bought it before but the picture on the site looks more like a peach color.  I have been trying to find this everywhere and finally thought to look here at Amazon.  I am so glad I was able to find it.  I would suggest that you retake the picture though as it is more of a dark mauve with shimmer than what the picture suggests as a peachy color.  Thanks,	1
I love the fragrance and it leaves my hair very silky.  Combined with the Bvlgari Conditioner, this is my favorite brand.	1
I stayed at the Ritz-Carlton in Mexico and was really sad when the shampoos I used there ran out. They make your entire hotel room smell great when you use them.  This one has a similar impact. I use it as body wash too, but if you do it I recommend using a loofa to increase the longevity of the bottle. I've been using mine for four months and it only just now ran out. I have used it conservatively, maybe two times or three a week. I use the perfume too, but even with the perfume, my skin and hair still smells like the product for a few hours into the day. I have gotten a few compliments from strangers that I smell nice and clean with just the shampoo alone.	1
Everything about Kerastase is fantastic!!  The Chrome Riche line promotes healthy shiny hair.  Love it!!  I also buy Kerastase Fusio-Dose Systeme Professionnel.  It's a made-to-measure at home treatment program.  The light orange bottom (for dry hair) or green bottom (for weak hair) mixed and matched with the pink (for shine), gold (condition) or green (protection) cap booster is the best!!  Makes your hair feel incredible in just a few minutes.  Best stuff ever!!!	1
I purchased this for my daughter for her science class, and this is the second year she is using it. It still looks like new - which is amazing considering my daughter is a bit on the messy side.	1
My hair was falling out, probably because of Psoriasis. Polytar stopped my hair from falling out and most of it grew back. Can't be without this shampoo, no longer available in my province. Thank You Amazon.	1
This is a very good soap for dry skin; leaves skin moisturized & soft. My husband & I use it after swimming to counteract the chlorine. Has a light citrus scent, which does not last. I tried Bob & Trout soaps on a whim, & have been most pleased. My favorite is the Sea Salt & Kelp; the Winter Spice is the best scent. Try these soaps-- you will like them! I have a longer review under the Sea Salt w/Kelp soap.	1
NARS is a treasure for those who get to hold the velvety feeling case in their hand and the blush and eye shadow are my particular favorites here. Super Orgasm by NARS is a glowing, dispersed mash of papaya and raspberry shade with a metallic cloud of shimmer with tiny bits of chunky glitter. That might sound scary but its so wonderfully fine that it looks radiant and as if it was coming from within. For everyday makeup I reach for this no matter what Im wearing or what makeup goes on, it just looks alive even before I have my coffee without looking over done.   This shade is sultry and sun kissed with this Hollywood Photoshop filler thing going on, it simply looks delicious. I love the whole range and Im also a fan of the NARS Sin  and Orgasm blushes, but this is the best.  - Kasia S.	1
Okay, how great can a blush be?  How often do you see this one referred to?  ALL the time.  I tried it.  Rosy medium skin (touching on rosacea).  This works perfect for me.  There are flecks in it but I wouldn't call it glitter at all. Just light reflecting partlcles. No harsh lines on this, just a great shade.  LOVE it.  Leans towards pink but there is a warmth to it that is almost peach if that's possible.  Not a cold pink anyway.	1
This is truly a high quality blush.  It goes on smoothly and doesn't need a touchup until, maybe, late afternoon.  So you really do use very little.  There are such beautiful colors from which to choose.  I recommend it.	1

Warm, soothing and a little spicy. This zum bar soap is perfect for fall weather. The creamy goat milk base makes it very moisturizing. I'm in love with all the zum bar soaps and keep trying new ones. This scent is the most comforting so far. I give these soaps away as gifts as well. This one would make a great holiday gift because of the frankincense and myrrh.  ~The Rebecca Review	1
This is the best smelling soap I've ever found. Some of them are so potently scented that when I put a bar in the bathroom, we can smell it in the bedroom. The goat's milk formula is gentle on my skin. The colors are beautiful, too. Unfortunately, some of them stain our white washcloths. The  price for a 3 oz. bar makes Zum Bars a luxury item, but they are high quality. They make wonderful gifts.	1

I decided to SPLURGE ($8.98 for a 3 oz. bar) and buy this wonderfully strong smelling soap!  The problem is that when you get spoiled, it is difficult to go back to Irish Spring! (I'm exaggerating here.)  It does smell wonderful!  When I open a bar for the bathroom, we can smell it all the way in the bedroom...so happy that I did splurge this once.	1
100% natural and organic and performes much better than chemical counterparts for the same price.	1
I am allergic to a lot of things. I occasionally get a red rash over my body after using some other body washes. This one is an exception. Not a single complain. Perfect!	1
So, 5 stars it is.	1
Smells great and performs great. Will buy it again, definitely	1
5-7 drops is enough for the whole body. Very interesting scent. Smells like candies, which is nice.	1
Not drying out the skin. Leaves it clean and fresh.	1

Lathers well and smells great.	1
the smell is bad and totally not natural for me	-1
No seal on bottle. Extremely runny. Like water. Seams tampered with.	-1
Wow I was totally hyped to try this shower gel. According to the rate and review I thought this would be awesome. However I received the package all torn up and the bottle itself had no seal. Very disappointed	-1
Awesome product, no doubt ! Use it in the morning before run and my skin doesnt irritate, it already gives it 10 out of 10 ! The smell is great, not chemical which makes more sense to be an organic product but does produce a lot of foam ! Love it !	1
Great product for relaxing!	1
Lovely product and works great, except the artificial coloring :(	1
Ideal for the guesthouse.	1
Best perfume smell and products	1
LOVE THIS	1
I read that sponges need to be changed once a month... This product combines a body wash and sponge in one! The skin feels so clean each time I used it! And the sponge gives a gentle scrubbing sensation. To prolong its life, I first wash my hair (my body gets wet) turn off the water and scrub/soap-up my whole body with the Spongelle. Once done, I simply rinse off with the shower. This helps reduce water waste and prolong Spongelle's useful life-span. About a month and a half after first use, I start adding some of my favorite body wash. And after three months I replace it with a new one.	1
I have really dry skin and Olay ribbons is the only body wash I use. Getting more and more difficult to find in stores - hope it doesn't disappear here as well.	1
Lovin' them.	1
Love these, wish they weren't so pricey.	1
Nice!!	1
Love it!  Scent is refreshing not over powering. Also, the 3 in 1 is great for traveling.	1
I'm devastated that this fragrance has been discontinued. I would love to see P&G bring it back, even if as an occasional "anniversary" run; I'd scoop up extras. As it is, I paid 2 1/2 times per bottle in order to gather as many as the budget would allow. Old Spice Foxcrest, you've served our family well.	1
Smells awesome love it!!	1
This is by far my favorite Bath and Body Works collection.  They discontinued it in the store.  I always get compliments of the scent on me. :)	1
Best smell by Old Spice so sad they stopped carrying it at most stores but hey they're loss is the Amazon marketplaces gain. Very quick shipping no issues will be buying again	1
Very good fragrance. A good nature smell rather than just a cologne type smell. My favorite of the series.	1
Bought along with their shampoo and lotion for a welcome gift for an oceanfront condo rental and are perfect size and price.	1
Thank you.	1
Great product..	1
great buy	1

I bought this to smell nice after I shave.  When I put it on I smelled awful.  I am 19 and I smelled like a grandmother with too much perfume.	-1
I have been using this after meals since I have braces. It helps remove all the food that gets stuck around the brackets. Other than that, I don't think it is that great. The orthodontist said the priority should be flossing and brushing, not the Waterpik. He said the Waterpik does not have enough pressure to remove plaque. This is really just for getting the big chunks of food before I brush and floss with Oral-B Superfloss. Before I got braces, I occasionally used the Waterpik but I can't say it did much for me. It has been a year and I have noticed a puddle of water around the Waterpik after I turn it off. I think the handle is now leaking. After my braces come off I will probably throw the Waterpik away.  UPDATE: I was right. The handle does in fact leak. I could buy a replacement handle for $10 but I don't want to. Overall, the Waterpik lasted about a year, which is not acceptable for a $50 item.	-1
Maybe I got an old bottle, because it's awful. I love lemon, sugar, sweet, citrus... but this combination is how air fresheners or house cleaning sprays smell. No sugar notes, no sweet notes, just lemon pledge. Which I like for my furniture, or as a dish detergent, but not on my skin.	-1
I was really hoping this scent would be true to it's name, and that it would smell of redcurrant and basil.  Wearing it, I smell neither one of those scents (both of which I love); it just smells generically perfumey on me.  I love the idea of a redcurrant/basil scent, but this is not it.  Your mileage may vary of course, but I highly recommend a test run before buying.	-1
While I like non-alcohol-based rinses, I was not pleased with this. On the plus side, it provides the same benefits as other rinses and does it without the burning sensation I get from those with alcohol. Plus, the lack of alcohol helps me deal with chronic dry mouth issues (alcohol rinses and mouthwashes make dry mouth much worse).  But how a rinse tastes is important since you'll be tasting it for some time after use. This was overly sweet rather than "fresh mint" tasting like other rinses (such as ACT). The aftertaste remained sweet to the point where it was unpleasant.  I'm was concerned about the potential for tooth staining. I've not had any issues with that so far with this rinse, but it was a concern.  If you like really sweet tasting rinses this may be worth a shot. For me, however, it was not something I'd use again.	-1
I've been using Norelco rotary shavers for the last 20+ years. I've always found them to work well and be fairly comfortable. After a few years use, instead of replacing the heads and/or battery again, I pick up the latest top of the line Norelco that's available. The Arcitec 1090 looked awesome, and I was looking forward to using it when I received it. What a disappointing product. Bottom line, it does not work nearly as well as my Quadra Action or SmartTouch XL models. I gave it some time thinking maybe my skin needed to adjust to it, but it has not improved. It just gives a mediocre, uncomfortable shave. I've since returned it, and ordered new heads for my older Norelco. I would seriously think twice before spending $200 on this product.	-1
I really like that this product is paraben-free, but the execution falls flat on its face. The bottle is tiny for the price. Money-to-value ratio is terrible. To add to that, the actual product itself is very thin and feels watered-down. To be fair, that may be the lack of additives, but it leads to over-use of the gel to get adequate coverage and actually feel clean after using it. To top it off, it really doesn't smell very good, either.	-1
No change my scalp still itches like crazy. It doesnt lather at all so its very hard to move around the hair and scalp. It does smell good and my hair feels clean.	-1
Too expensive for such poor quality. There was no improvement and I am starting to think my scalp is worse off than it was before I started using this product. I do agree with other reviews that it feels watered down too much. Had to use more shampoo than all other shampoo's I have tried to get a good lather.	-1
It dries my hair, doesnt help to reduce dandruff. I have to use very less shampoo nevertheless it dries.. don't know how this got higher ratings	-1
So watered down, I didn't feel like it was actually shampoo. I tried twice then threw it away.	-1
Made dandruff worse and irritated rest of skin	-1
Worst shampoo Ive ever used.  Was mostly water.  I could not get a good lather.  Hair never felt clean after use.  I cannot understand why so many good reviews.  Will not buy again!	-1
Made my hair brittle and dull looking, didn't do anything for the itch or dandruff.	-1
I was expecting a gel that would lather up nicely, this is a very thin/water like liquid.  It smells good but the bottle will be gone in 2 weeks because of how thin it is.  I haven't used much, maybe I can return it.	-1
Selenium appeared in my search results when I was looking for an organic anti-dandruff shampoo. I was super excited to see the 5 star review. I have been struggling with dandruff for past 6 years and I was really hoping this will make a difference, atleast keep the dandruff at bay for 2 days followed by a shampoo wash with Selenium. But unfortunately, it hardly keeps dandruff at bay. And to make it worse, it makes your hair super dry.	-1
This really dries out my hair and makes it feel even thinner than it already is. The smell is nice, but consistency is pretty much water. I honestly think most of the reviews are false	-1
I really like using organic products and this product had awesome reviews. Ive been seeing a dermatologist for my psoriasis and received a much of topical cream and even steroid injections. So I wanted to go more oganic. It still didn't work and Ive used the whole bottle. It didn't even help improve it any bit. Im sure this may work for someone else but it didn't for me.	-1
Skin did not improve. Felt like using scented water.	-1
the smell is bad and totally not natural for me	-1
No seal on bottle. Extremely runny. Like water. Seams tampered with.	-1
My product was not sealed and either used or something.. attached are pictures. Would like a refund please.	-1
Doesnt smell	-1
Throwing it away, burned my scalp.	-1
Awful. Zero anti dandruff properties. Comes out of bottle like water, so very easy to waste. Very poor lathering, requires large quantity to lather up hair. Vague smell, not bad but also not pleasant.	-1
The shampoo is very watery, and I did not see too much of a difference in my dandruff.	-1
I agree with several of the other reviewers. Feels as though Im just rubbing banana scented water through my hair and after I shower, my hair feels greesy (like when I don't use any shampoo) so I wonder if there is something fishy going on here. Read the other reviews and you'll noticed most of them have nothing to do with shampoo. DO NOT trust.	-1
This product is a scam!  Not only does it have the consistency of water, but you need a tremendous amount for it to foam, as suggested in the instructions.  I have a shaved head and can see going through this bottle in a week or two at this pace.  To make matters worse, the my short hair was sticking up as if I had been electrocuted!  I'm going to try try this junk one more time and if I experience similar results, I'm going to try to return this trash.  BUYER BEWARE!!!	-1
I bought this shampoo because the description stated it was gentle, for itchy, red and irritated scalp. I used it one time and it burned my scalp almost immediately! I bought two bottles and I am returning them both!  I honestly don't know how it get so many good reviews.	-1
Wow I was totally hyped to try this shower gel. According to the rate and review I thought this would be awesome. However I received the package all torn up and the bottle itself had no seal. Very disappointed	-1
Arrived opened  and leaking all over the box.  Tried shampoo but didn't help at all.  Still so itchy.	-1
Nope. It smells like artificial bananas, and this smell does linger. It's pure liquid, there is no thickness to it at all, it's like pouring banana water on your head that lathers. It does not help with an itchy scalp either (I have psoriasis). This shampoo neither helped nor hindered my hair or scalp, made absolutely no difference (except for the banana smell). Don't waste your money.	-1
I am very dissapointed in this. It smells so good at first but the smell goes completely away after 5 mionutes.	-1
These are typical inexpensive spa accessories, good for several uses but not particularly durable, in the case of the moisturizing gloves, and very susceptible to mold and mildew, in the case of the bath mitts.  The moisturizing gloves are stretchy, so they fit almost any adult hand and stay on all night.  They are made of  90% unbleached cotton with Spandex.  The body-loving bath mitt has a terry made of rayon (so-called bamboo fiber that is claimed to be naturally antibacterial, but which is neither) on one side for gentle smoothing and jute loops on the other for more aggressive exfoliation.  The boucl mitt has a stretchy, open weave of unidentified fiber to provide moderate exfoliation.  They are all slightly better than dollar store quality, but definitely not up to what I would expect from Pr de Provence.  I would at least expect proper labelling of the materials used in adherence with FTC regulations regarding rayon made from bamboo and no false claims, as a minimum.	-1
This foot file is pretty much just an oversized popsicle stick with strips of sandpaper glued to the front and back.  Dont get me wrong  theres nothing high-tech about any foot file, but some are better than others, and this one is about as bare bones as you can get.  While I do indulge in the occasional professional pedicure, Im a big DIY pedi girl.  This foot file doesnt have the right texture to do a decent job of sloughing off dry skin, and you can forget buffing any calluses  its way too wimpy for that!  Bottom Line:  Low-end, ineffective foot file; not recommended.	-1
This is for the eye pillow since Amazon has a ton of unrelated items lumped here under a single spot for reviews.  There were two issues we had wtih this - first, the velcro straps that you can adjust at the back of the head - makes it a bit uncomfortable there especially if you're laying on your back.  Second, this does a poor job of blocking light.  The nose piece isn't cut out nearly enough to allow this to actually rest well over the eyes, so there's just far, far too much light bleed since it just can't fit well.  Scent is pleasant though and "renewable" by crinkling the eye pieces.	-1
I have often heard about this type of product and I always assumed they would be lined with plastic of some kind, something non-absorbent, because otherwise, your hand cream would soak into the fabric, right?  Well, they are NOT lined with plastic, and the hand cream DID soak into them.  I put my regular application of hand cream on, and worked it in, and then, prepping for sleep, I put a big glob on my hands and rubbed it all around, sort of like you do on the face with a mask or hair with deep conditioner.  But the gloves are snug; some of the cream actually was pushed down to my wrist by the action of struggling into the gloves, and the rest of it soaked into the glove fabric once I had the gloves on.  I took them off a few minutes later because they were so tight on my hands (I wear size 7 gloves so my hands are not that outrageously big.)  As a process I don't recommend this, but if you are willing to deal with the drawbacks, you might like these.  But for me, I'll just keep moisturizing my hands before bed as usual.	-1
Note: The company has several products linked together which can lead to a misleading / confusing time reading reviews. This is for the booties.  I was really excited to try these moisturizing booties. Unfortunately, they did not love up to my expectations. First of all, I thought they would moisturize my feet just by wearing them as indicated in the name. They don't. You are supposed to put cream or lotion on your feet before putting them on. This means that the cream/lotion is moisturizing your feet, not the booties. I used to rub lotion on my feet and then wear socks to bed which does the same thing.  I wore these booties to bed and they immediately started annoying me. They have thick seams right at the toes and again at the heel. I couldn't stop rubbing the seams trying to make them more comfortable. Do they help hold in the heat and allow the lotion to really moisturize? Yes. So do socks. I have a pair of really soft, fluffy socks that have the same effect and are more comfortable.  Sadly, I cannot recommend these booties. I would suggest getting a really comfortable pair of socks and using them for the same thing. You can probably find them cheaper and they will work just as well.	-1
The shampoo has the consistency of water, so you won't be able to hold enough in your hand to get it on your head.  Very disappointed!	-1
I really like that this product is paraben-free, but the execution falls flat on its face. The bottle is tiny for the price. Money-to-value ratio is terrible. To add to that, the actual product itself is very thin and feels watered-down. To be fair, that may be the lack of additives, but it leads to over-use of the gel to get adequate coverage and actually feel clean after using it. To top it off, it really doesn't smell very good, either.	-1
No change my scalp still itches like crazy. It doesnt lather at all so its very hard to move around the hair and scalp. It does smell good and my hair feels clean.	-1
Too expensive for such poor quality. There was no improvement and I am starting to think my scalp is worse off than it was before I started using this product. I do agree with other reviews that it feels watered down too much. Had to use more shampoo than all other shampoo's I have tried to get a good lather.	-1
It dries my hair, doesnt help to reduce dandruff. I have to use very less shampoo nevertheless it dries.. don't know how this got higher ratings	-1
So watered down, I didn't feel like it was actually shampoo. I tried twice then threw it away.	-1
Made dandruff worse and irritated rest of skin	-1
Worst shampoo Ive ever used.  Was mostly water.  I could not get a good lather.  Hair never felt clean after use.  I cannot understand why so many good reviews.  Will not buy again!	-1
Made my hair brittle and dull looking, didn't do anything for the itch or dandruff.	-1
I was expecting a gel that would lather up nicely, this is a very thin/water like liquid.  It smells good but the bottle will be gone in 2 weeks because of how thin it is.  I haven't used much, maybe I can return it.	-1
Selenium appeared in my search results when I was looking for an organic anti-dandruff shampoo. I was super excited to see the 5 star review. I have been struggling with dandruff for past 6 years and I was really hoping this will make a difference, atleast keep the dandruff at bay for 2 days followed by a shampoo wash with Selenium. But unfortunately, it hardly keeps dandruff at bay. And to make it worse, it makes your hair super dry.	-1
This really dries out my hair and makes it feel even thinner than it already is. The smell is nice, but consistency is pretty much water. I honestly think most of the reviews are false	-1
I really like using organic products and this product had awesome reviews. Ive been seeing a dermatologist for my psoriasis and received a much of topical cream and even steroid injections. So I wanted to go more oganic. It still didn't work and Ive used the whole bottle. It didn't even help improve it any bit. Im sure this may work for someone else but it didn't for me.	-1
Skin did not improve. Felt like using scented water.	-1
the smell is bad and totally not natural for me	-1
No seal on bottle. Extremely runny. Like water. Seams tampered with.	-1
My product was not sealed and either used or something.. attached are pictures. Would like a refund please.	-1
Doesnt smell	-1
Throwing it away, burned my scalp.	-1
Awful. Zero anti dandruff properties. Comes out of bottle like water, so very easy to waste. Very poor lathering, requires large quantity to lather up hair. Vague smell, not bad but also not pleasant.	-1
The shampoo is very watery, and I did not see too much of a difference in my dandruff.	-1
I agree with several of the other reviewers. Feels as though Im just rubbing banana scented water through my hair and after I shower, my hair feels greesy (like when I don't use any shampoo) so I wonder if there is something fishy going on here. Read the other reviews and you'll noticed most of them have nothing to do with shampoo. DO NOT trust.	-1
This product is a scam!  Not only does it have the consistency of water, but you need a tremendous amount for it to foam, as suggested in the instructions.  I have a shaved head and can see going through this bottle in a week or two at this pace.  To make matters worse, the my short hair was sticking up as if I had been electrocuted!  I'm going to try try this junk one more time and if I experience similar results, I'm going to try to return this trash.  BUYER BEWARE!!!	-1
I bought this shampoo because the description stated it was gentle, for itchy, red and irritated scalp. I used it one time and it burned my scalp almost immediately! I bought two bottles and I am returning them both!  I honestly don't know how it get so many good reviews.	-1
Wow I was totally hyped to try this shower gel. According to the rate and review I thought this would be awesome. However I received the package all torn up and the bottle itself had no seal. Very disappointed	-1
Arrived opened  and leaking all over the box.  Tried shampoo but didn't help at all.  Still so itchy.	-1
Nope. It smells like artificial bananas, and this smell does linger. It's pure liquid, there is no thickness to it at all, it's like pouring banana water on your head that lathers. It does not help with an itchy scalp either (I have psoriasis). This shampoo neither helped nor hindered my hair or scalp, made absolutely no difference (except for the banana smell). Don't waste your money.	-1
Electric razors don't get a closer shave than standards ones so I got this.  This did not do the trick just smells bad.	-1
Maybe I don't get the point with this. Okay, they use sex to sell it; I get that. It's supposed to create a situation in which women - I'm assuming really dumb ones - are made out of control in your presence after using it. Right. And Yaks fly.  But is there anything truly unique about it?  Well, it does have sandpaper sides, one of which would remove the face off a statue and other that buffs your flesh to a tender red. But other than that it's just sort of a sponge. The `directions' say it gets all those special places (if we all have them are they really so special?) but I think a washrag does a better job.  So why am I even thinking about this thing this much? I'm done and I'm outta here - to find my washcloth.	-1
I am very dissapointed in this. It smells so good at first but the smell goes completely away after 5 mionutes.	-1
These are typical inexpensive spa accessories, good for several uses but not particularly durable, in the case of the moisturizing gloves, and very susceptible to mold and mildew, in the case of the bath mitts.  The moisturizing gloves are stretchy, so they fit almost any adult hand and stay on all night.  They are made of  90% unbleached cotton with Spandex.  The body-loving bath mitt has a terry made of rayon (so-called bamboo fiber that is claimed to be naturally antibacterial, but which is neither) on one side for gentle smoothing and jute loops on the other for more aggressive exfoliation.  The boucl mitt has a stretchy, open weave of unidentified fiber to provide moderate exfoliation.  They are all slightly better than dollar store quality, but definitely not up to what I would expect from Pr de Provence.  I would at least expect proper labelling of the materials used in adherence with FTC regulations regarding rayon made from bamboo and no false claims, as a minimum.	-1
This foot file is pretty much just an oversized popsicle stick with strips of sandpaper glued to the front and back.  Dont get me wrong  theres nothing high-tech about any foot file, but some are better than others, and this one is about as bare bones as you can get.  While I do indulge in the occasional professional pedicure, Im a big DIY pedi girl.  This foot file doesnt have the right texture to do a decent job of sloughing off dry skin, and you can forget buffing any calluses  its way too wimpy for that!  Bottom Line:  Low-end, ineffective foot file; not recommended.	-1
This is for the eye pillow since Amazon has a ton of unrelated items lumped here under a single spot for reviews.  There were two issues we had wtih this - first, the velcro straps that you can adjust at the back of the head - makes it a bit uncomfortable there especially if you're laying on your back.  Second, this does a poor job of blocking light.  The nose piece isn't cut out nearly enough to allow this to actually rest well over the eyes, so there's just far, far too much light bleed since it just can't fit well.  Scent is pleasant though and "renewable" by crinkling the eye pieces.	-1
I have often heard about this type of product and I always assumed they would be lined with plastic of some kind, something non-absorbent, because otherwise, your hand cream would soak into the fabric, right?  Well, they are NOT lined with plastic, and the hand cream DID soak into them.  I put my regular application of hand cream on, and worked it in, and then, prepping for sleep, I put a big glob on my hands and rubbed it all around, sort of like you do on the face with a mask or hair with deep conditioner.  But the gloves are snug; some of the cream actually was pushed down to my wrist by the action of struggling into the gloves, and the rest of it soaked into the glove fabric once I had the gloves on.  I took them off a few minutes later because they were so tight on my hands (I wear size 7 gloves so my hands are not that outrageously big.)  As a process I don't recommend this, but if you are willing to deal with the drawbacks, you might like these.  But for me, I'll just keep moisturizing my hands before bed as usual.	-1
Note: The company has several products linked together which can lead to a misleading / confusing time reading reviews. This is for the booties.  I was really excited to try these moisturizing booties. Unfortunately, they did not love up to my expectations. First of all, I thought they would moisturize my feet just by wearing them as indicated in the name. They don't. You are supposed to put cream or lotion on your feet before putting them on. This means that the cream/lotion is moisturizing your feet, not the booties. I used to rub lotion on my feet and then wear socks to bed which does the same thing.  I wore these booties to bed and they immediately started annoying me. They have thick seams right at the toes and again at the heel. I couldn't stop rubbing the seams trying to make them more comfortable. Do they help hold in the heat and allow the lotion to really moisturize? Yes. So do socks. I have a pair of really soft, fluffy socks that have the same effect and are more comfortable.  Sadly, I cannot recommend these booties. I would suggest getting a really comfortable pair of socks and using them for the same thing. You can probably find them cheaper and they will work just as well.	-1

I use essential oils frequently in atomizers, on damp cloths near fans, and even as an additive in homemade cleaners. What I've found is that lavender scents can be tricky. Some are intense and other times they can be rather weak or not even smell like lavender at all. The Pre De Provence Maison French Lavender Blossom Linen Water is one that sadly falls into the latter category. I sprayed it on decorative pillows and at first it smelled really good They got the scent correct. But when I picked up the pillow 15 minutes later, it was no longer detectable. I tried it again, this time sniffing it 5 minutes later. Sadly, only the faintest hint of lavender greeted my nostrils. I was disappointed as Im a fan of aromatherapy, but this product just does not pass the muster.  I poured some full strength into my diffuser and it did work then, but that means using a lot of the product. Id rather just add a few drops of essential oil to water. Additionally, Maison has some questionable preservatives (Methylisothiazolinone (MIT) and Methylchloroisothiazolinone (CMIT)) and FD&C Blue 1 and Red 33, rather than just pure scent. It does not come with a spray attachment.  ~ Kort	-1
Barely any scent. And it doesn't smell like a lavender. I don't like it.	-1
Lavender water.  This has a nice scent and the sprayer sprays well, but it is so weak that the scent disappears within a few minutes If I spray more, the sheets get damp. I received a free bottle in exchange for an honest review and I was pretty excited about having lavender-scented sheets, but I won't be buying any of this item and can't recommend it. I have tried this company's soaps, though, and they are wonderful!	-1

I used Jan Marini eyelash intervention and my lashes were longer and noticeable. I wanted to try something else and Revitalash had a good reviews. After 3 month of everyday use there's no difference at all! Now I'm gonna try Procyde MD Lash factor if that doesn't work I'm gonna be back to Jan Marini even it's the most expensive lash conditioner.	-1
I bought this as I was really motivated by the commercials for this "Optic White" mouthwash. I was a victim of the promise.  Maybe it does work, but seriously, this is NASTY stuff.  NASTY.  I would force myself to use it (white teeth=life's problems solved!), but then end up spitting it out short of ten seconds.  I hate that I bought a four pack and am stuck with two unopened bottles.  I'm not a wimp with flavors, but this is gross. Hate.	-1
UPDATE ON 8-28-17:  Since I first purchased this, I've been getting really bad skin rashes and welts on my face after using this.  I have sensitive skin, and know that this product is causing the reaction since it only happens when I use this.  While I like the other Mad Hippie products I've tried, I'd stay away from this one if you have skin that is easily irritated.  One or more of the ingredients is definitely too strong if you have bad reactions! -------  I recently ordered the Mad Hippie Face Cream, Exfoliating Serum, and Antioxidant Facial Oil, and really like them a lot.  I've only been using them a few days, so I'll be sure to update my review as I use these more, but so far I like the fact that this is a healthier brand, with not many chemicals added to their products.  This Face Cream is not quite hydrating enough for me, but I've found that using the Antioxidant Facial Oil on top helps seal in moisture.  The Mad Hippie website also gives instructions for how to layer their products:  "We recommend gently massaging the vitamin C serum into your skin in the morning after washing and drying thoroughly.  Wait 5 minutes after applying the serum & apply the creams.  Apply the face cream to the entire face, including eye area, then apply the eye cream beside and below the eyesmaking sure to rub both creams in well, particularly around wrinkle prone areas.  Follow this with our extra hydrating antioxidant facial oil.  At night, follow the same steps but replace the vitamin C serum with an exfoliant:  either the exfoliating serum or vitamin A serum.  If just using the creams, wait a couple minutes after washing your face when skin is fully dry to apply. The facial SPF should be used as the final and last step of your morning routine."	-1
I have been using this after meals since I have braces. It helps remove all the food that gets stuck around the brackets. Other than that, I don't think it is that great. The orthodontist said the priority should be flossing and brushing, not the Waterpik. He said the Waterpik does not have enough pressure to remove plaque. This is really just for getting the big chunks of food before I brush and floss with Oral-B Superfloss. Before I got braces, I occasionally used the Waterpik but I can't say it did much for me. It has been a year and I have noticed a puddle of water around the Waterpik after I turn it off. I think the handle is now leaking. After my braces come off I will probably throw the Waterpik away.  UPDATE: I was right. The handle does in fact leak. I could buy a replacement handle for $10 but I don't want to. Overall, the Waterpik lasted about a year, which is not acceptable for a $50 item.	-1
At first taste, the Crest Pro-Health for old folks seems pretty good.  There's no alcohol and consequently there is none of the tingly sensation some of us are accustomed to.  After using it, your breath is definitely minty fresh... BUT there's a weird chemical after-taste that lasts and lasts; which my husband and myself found to be unpleasant.  On the non-pro-health side, it's a chemical concoction.  It contains "propylparaben" which is know to mimic estrogen.  It also contains Red 33, which can be found in Cutex Nail Polish remover.  Now really, given that we are adults-over-50, can't we just have clear mouth wash.  Or whatever color the Cetylpyridinium Chloride gives the liquid.  Because that's the only active ingredient: Cetylpyridinium Chloride.  (also used in some pesticides because it fights fungus.)  Can't recommend. I really prefer a mouthwash that doesn't put my tastebuds out of action for hours at a time.  Also, my dentist insists that I use something with Floride to protect my tooth enamel, which this product doesn't have.	-1
My fav mouthwash is Listerine no alcohol. Crest one for 50 years old+ (I'm not sure what age has to do with mouthwashes) is mediocre. Not the worse I've ever tasted, but not strong and refreshing enough for me. The worse thing is the bitter aftertaste lingering until I eat something so for quite a while obviously. I wouldn't buy. My Listerine is a bit more sweet and leaves nice fresh breath for way longer.	-1
Both times that I experimented with the product, I found the results unsatisfactory. It made my hair a bit smoother, but I couldn't achieve any real volume with it. The best I can say, is that it has a pleasant scent. (But those with fragrance sensitivities/allergies may find themselves bothered by it).  And, I must agree with several reviewers who sagely noted that the components of the product are less-than-healthy. The first two times I tried the whip, I quickly washed my hands afterward. Of course, logically, it was still in my hair ... and near/on my scalp. Ultimately, this made me way too nervous to continue to use it, so I tossed it.  There are number of better, more effective, less expensive products on the market. Although a little pricey,&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Alterna-Bamboo-Volume-48-Hour-Sustainable-Volume-Spray-4-2-oz/dp/B00CCYOHPQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Alterna Bamboo Volume 48 Hour Sustainable Volume Spray-4.2 oz.</a>&nbsp;is amazing!!! And completely natural! Give that one a try.	-1
I really wanted this to work. I was hoping to plump my hair at the roots and have some volume for my blah hair.  I tried it on three occasions, each time working a small amount into towel dried hair (as the instructions state).  I noticed nothing.  No volume, no lift.  Nothing.  Each time I used less and less, and still ended up immediately with a greasy feeling in my clean hair.  In fact, it seemed to weigh down my hair more than anything else. Plus, I had to rewash immediately to get rid of the oil feel. Ick.  Not only does it feel gross, but makes me wonder what is going to get on my skin....sometimes hair products that are oily can cause pimples and breakouts.	-1
These little strips are about 1 1/8 X 3/8. They are long enough to cover about 3 teeth. They are easy to apply and they adhere well. I noticed a lot of the reviewers complained that they don't stay in place. I did not have that problem. I think that if you apply the strip, close your mouth and don't talk, eat, or keep touching  the strip with your tongue, you will have a better chance of it staying put. You are supposed to leave them in place for 10 minutes and you cant eat for 30 minutes. I have had a problem with sensitivity to cold as I have gotten older. I think my receding gumline is the main problem. I was hoping these strips would work, but I cant say I noticed much difference after using them.	-1
The jasmine scent is barely detectable. I am returning this item.	-1
This is the fourth Pre de Provence soap I tried, I loved the others but this one dried my skin out. After using my skin felt tight and itchy and to calm it I had to use a total body lotion after the shower. This soap arrived in a clear plastic wrap with no labeling at all without an ingredient list. The scent to me is of citrus and I suspect the natural oils of the citrus fruits in the fragrance are what is oil-stripping my skin and leaving me with dried out skin. Ratings 2 stars = Don't Like It. I cannot comment on anything else about the ingredients since I have no ingredient list and there is not one on the product page either.	-1
Williams Lectirc Shave is a great product that has served men's electric shaving needs for several decades!  BUT DON'T buy it here!  WHY?  I didn't pay close enough attention to the prices vs weight and when it arrived I was really angry!  This is the 3 ounce travel bottle that you can sometimes find in you local drug store for about $2.50, NOT $5.62!!!  For $5.48 - $5.85 you can buy the 7 ounce bottle at every drugstore in your town or on line at CVS.com or Drugstore.com or any other online national drug store chain.  DON'T GET RIPPED OFF BY THIS SELLER!!  YOU ARE PAYING TOO MUCH FOR WHAT YOU GET! THE PRICE SHOULD BE FOR THE 7 OUNCE BOTTLE AND NOT THE 3 OUNCE BOTTLE.  RIP OFF!!!!!!!!!!!	-1
Electric razors don't get a closer shave than standards ones so I got this.  This did not do the trick just smells bad.	-1

I sprayed it on decorative pillows and at first it smelled really good They got the scent correct. But when I picked up the pillow 15 minutes later, it was no longer detectable. I tried it again, this time sniffing it 5 minutes later. Sadly, only the faintest hint of lavender greeted my nostrils. I was disappointed as Im a fan of aromatherapy, but this product just does not pass the muster.  I poured some full strength into my diffuser and it did work then, but that means using a lot of the product. Id rather just add a few drops of essential oil to water. Additionally, Maison has some questionable preservatives (Methylisothiazolinone (MIT) and Methylchloroisothiazolinone (CMIT)) and FD&C Blue 1 and Red 33, rather than just pure scent. It does not come with a spray attachment.  ~ Kort	-1
Barely any scent. And it doesn't smell like a lavender. I don't like it.	-1
Lavender water.  This has a nice scent and the sprayer sprays well, but it is so weak that the scent disappears within a few minutes If I spray more, the sheets get damp. I received a free bottle in exchange for an honest review and I was pretty excited about having lavender-scented sheets, but I won't be buying any of this item and can't recommend it. I have tried this company's soaps, though, and they are wonderful!	-1
The shampoo has the consistency of water, so you won't be able to hold enough in your hand to get it on your head.  Very disappointed!	-1
I really like that this product is paraben-free, but the execution falls flat on its face. The bottle is tiny for the price. Money-to-value ratio is terrible. To add to that, the actual product itself is very thin and feels watered-down. To be fair, that may be the lack of additives, but it leads to over-use of the gel to get adequate coverage and actually feel clean after using it. To top it off, it really doesn't smell very good, either.	-1
I was expecting a gel that would lather up nicely, this is a very thin/water like liquid.  It smells good but the bottle will be gone in 2 weeks because of how thin it is.  I haven't used much, maybe I can return it.	-1
