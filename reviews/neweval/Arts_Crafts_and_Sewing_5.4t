Fast shipping, nothing missing damaged or leaking.  These are great quality paints. I have been painting with acrylics again for the past 9 months. Getting back into it, do your self a favor....start with the best paints! Starting with cheaper brands will not only make the outcome of your painting dull and fake looking, but you might think all paints are the same and just give up painting all together.  Don't do it , start with the best.  Will buy again for sure.	1
My experience was good with excellent materials acrylic paintings	1
I got heavy body Liquitex paints with a good assortment of colors as well as extra accessories.  This set let me experiment with the heavy body paints.  I also obtained a really good price than what was sold in the store.  I found the paint to be highly pigmented.	1
This was a great set for the price. I only wish they had a filbert brush in stead of a straight blunt tipped brush.	1
Hey its great acrylic paint, wouldn't know what do use instead..	1
Machine works, but bulb was broken when I opened the package.	1
thank you	1
Does a very good job for enlarging only wish it had adjustable legs, other than that I really like it	1
I have bought this brand in primary colors, black, white, gold and silver. Have been happy with the paint every time. Will buy again.	1
good	1
Always use this Acrylic paint, There Is no other paint I will use. The price Is not that expensive.	1
A real bargain!	1
This is the best medium I have ever used! The effects you get with this medium are more than worth the cost! I have went through 2 gallons of this stuff and am on to my third. I love it because it is self-leveling, doesn't crack or craze, it doesn't affect the opacity of the paint when mixed, and it has really has taken my work to the next level.  This is such a fun product to work with but it is VERY MESSY! Do not get it on your skin. Wear long gloves. I got this on my hands, arms and a bit on my legs and after about 2 hours of scrubbing with the rough side of a sponge, rubbing alcohol, a loofa, a nail brush and a washrag... I finally got most of it off (along with a bit of skin, OUCH)!  It dries fairly fast and feels like a rubbery plastic but really does makes cool effects! It is very shiny when dry. I made a 3 piece painting set with it and it sold in less than 3 days off of my Facebook page!  It's worth trying out, just remember to protect anything you don't want it to touch (including yourself).	1
I use this to help thin airbrush paint. Not sure how much it helps or not, but its fine for me. Just a couple drops is enough.	1
This is beautiful stuff. I like to just brush it lightly over all or parts of my finished pieces. It sofens the color and leaves a beautiful pearly iridescent sheen.	1
I just paint for fun, it is just a hobby and these are my favorite paints to use.  They are a bit pricey, but the texture is perfect, exactly what I was looking for.  The Liquitex Basics are also better quality than I was expecting.  But now that I have used these, I can't go back to my cheap paint.  Love the Liquitex brand.	1
My kid liked the vividness of the blue.  This kit also contains 2 tubes of white.  Each tube is about 4" long and about 1" diameter.  It is expensive.  For every day painting for kids, I am going back to cheaper tempera paints.	1
I wanted one of these sets for my painting class, but they're surprisingly hard to find, and usually when I do, they're pricey. I'm always looking for a bargain, so this was a wonderful find.	1
Well packaged and quickly delivered. Good  range of colors for a hobby/modeler to add to their supplies, and Liquetex is a well-respected name in the art world.	1
excellent	1
Always better than off-brands. Heavy body is even better.	1
Great! But I like heavy body Liquitex even better, covers better.	1
Great value.  Handy applicator for more precise blending.	1
Always buy Basics paint. never have a problem. I think it's one off the best paint's on the Market.	1
This worked just like it said and no heat needed to be applied to "set" it. Just wait 4 days and then wash.	1
If you like to have white snowy flakes on your artwork - you will love this.  It's fun to play with and has a nice effect.	1
My local art supply house doesn't carry this (not enough business to stock it). I use it to thin Vallejo air and Vallejo Model paints for airbrush use and it performs well. You may want to get some plastic dropping bottles to transfer this over to, allowing you to more precisely measure paint to thinner medium amounts).	1
What can I say. Besides Grumbacher, the only paint I will buy. Reasonably priced, good flow and transparency. Happy with purchase	1
I only use this brand.  I understand there is an even better quality that W&N has come out with, but these are all I've used so far, and they are perfect.	1
I teach canvas painting classes and we go through A LOT of paint!  Basics is a great quality brand and very opaque so it covers well, which is sometimes hard to find, even with more expensive paints.  It's thick, which I like, but can also be thinned with water for fine details.	1
Beautiful color! Love Basics!	1
Nice coverage and smooth application. I love Liquitex.	1
Excellent!!	1
Disappointed in this simple basically useless piece of plastic.  The way you adjust the size and focus is by moving it closer or father away, not that hard but irritating to get it right and sliding the lenses in and out.  That's where the problem lies.  There is no stop so if you pull it too far it lands on the floor.  This only makes enlargements and they are really big.  You can't just have it twice as large like from a 3x5 to 8 X 11.  If your original should slip or you accidentally move the drawing good luck getting it back to where you had it to match it up.  Trying to keep the slide out to the very end while tracing without it falling off isn't pleasant or practical.  If all you want is to project an image to a very large size you'll be happy.  Otherwise it's basically a toy for $90.00.	-1
A friend of mine loves to paint.  I always get her art supplies as birthday and Christmas presents.  Liquitex is among one of her favorite brands of paint to use.  I got her this set of paints.  It gives you a tube of all the major colors and you can get bigger tubes of any colors that you tend to use a lot.	1
A friend of mine loves to paint so I got her this set.  She was very pleased and likes the quality of these Liquitex paints a lot.	1
Perfect for enlarging my quilting patterns.  Love it!!	1
Works great but can get overheated. Other that the heat issue it works very well.	1
Had to send back 2 jars that were dried out. Got this instead. Good item.	-1
Great price.  Exactly what is advertised.  Often used color so it was great to purchase at this quantity at a decent price.	1
Great!	1
I purchased this item in economy size to extend and thin my acrylic paint when creating acrylic skins or designing an acrylic pour on canvas. I would recommend this product to professional artists. Liquitex offers both quality paints and mediums.	1
Love this stuff.  It adds a lovely shimmer to any regular acrylic paint.  It arrived quickly and as advertised.  Would recommend!	1
Good product.  I use it to thicken my acrylics and make 3D designs on craft works.  Definitely would recommend!  It arrived quickly and as advertised.	1
Cool and hard to find!!!	1
Great for thinning out craft acrylics for airbrushing.	1
I like a lot of Liquitex products especially their mediums. This item was not available locally and the multicolored effects will be interesting and unusual. All Liquitex mediums can be mixed with soft body or heavy weight acrylics also by Liquitex. I would recommend this item to those who like texture and interesting effects for their art projects. Crafters and mixed media artists would appreciate this item.	1
Make sure to read the directions if you've never used this before.  1 part flow aid to 20 parts water.  I use a graduated medicine syringe (who doesn't have these floating around their house if you have children?).  This product works by reducing the surface tension of the paint (and water) and allows the paint to flow freely.  Detail work become much easier to do, as does washes.  I bought 2 four oz bottles, and I've barely touched the top 20% of one of them!  Little bit goes a really LONG way.  ** UPDATE** 15 July 2014  Have discovered that I can thin paint so much that it will allow the paint underneath of it to show through and blend... even paint that is normally opaque.  If you would attempt to do this with just water, you could potentially thin it to the point where the binders in the paint no longer adhere well. Flow Aid allows you to thin the paint without using nearly as much water (because of the greatly reduced surface tension), therefore making a wonderful wash to place on top of an existing layer of paint, allowing you to create a unique blend that would otherwise not be possible.  One way I have been using this newly discovered technique (new to me anyway) is creating the slightly darker areas of the same color, in the natural folds of clothing of the tiny figurines that I paint, giving it nice depth.  A secondary benefit, is that it greatly extends expensive paints, thereby stretching your paint dollars much further, and I have still yet to hardly touch the first bottle I purchased!!	1
I love this product!  It is soooooooo helpful in avoiding the dreaded the dreaded tip dry condition that is so troublesome for airbrush artists. I now use it in EVERY batch of paint I use in my airbrush, even with transparent paints.	1
Received projector today. As other reviews have stated, item arrived with broken light bulb. You would think the manufacturer would at least enclose the light bulb in plastic so the entire projector is not covered with broken glass and who knows what else. After cleaning up the mess and putting in a new bulb the projector worked to my satisfaction.	1
This is great! I bought this product for my father (a skilled woodworker) to use to enlarge his sketches directly onto the wood to be cut. It's been a big time saver for him.  I also use one of these at my workplace for various projects. Only small complaint: I wish there was an easier way to manipulate the image under the projector. Paper underneath the projector does not slide around easily so making small movements is difficult.	1
Better than expected, great in low light. Works as advertised, recommend.	1
nice price and product	1
Great deal and quality acrylic paint. I purchased a Basics starter set last year, but found myself running out of white, thank goodness they sell this larger size.	1
Love this brand of paint... I'm a beginner and I can say this is the BEST product.  You will definitely need this tube of white if you buy any of the other sets. I ran out of white alot due to mixing, so yeah buy this.	1
Grabs quickly, cleans easily and adheres perfectly.	1
I bought this to fix up some old children's books and it works beautifully, Easy to use and has a nice smooth, solid finish. I recommend also using the Lineco brush to brush it on.	1
doesn't warp your paper when used correctly	1
As a newbie to making my own books, I had no idea where to start when it came to glue. I did some research, read some reviews, and chose the Lineco adhesive. So far, so good!	1
This was a fun medium to work with. Watching the colors collide and swirl around is very relaxing. I found this type of art to be satisfying and this product worked exceptionally well.	1
Always predictable and playful, the description fits the product. I enjoy working with the iridescent effects medium, I trust liquitex for most of my mediums. Good quality and expected results, have used these products for years.	1
I wanted something that would slow my drying time and make my acrylics behave more like oil paints. ...I was happy the first ten minutes of use. It was smooth and buttery, like oil paints. But then, after it dried, I went to do a second layer over the top (very common painting practice) and the underlay of paint just came scraping off in odd round strips and balls. It was so disheartening. I had worked for several hours and days on the painting. It was completely ruined.  Then-- I noticed something that had almost the exact same name and packaging! It was Liquitex Slow Dry Blending Gel Medium!! You can use as much as you want on your painting and it made everything look and behave like oil paints, so buttery and silky beautiful! --That was just what I had hoped to find the first time. Here is a link to the better item on Amazon:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Liquitex-Professional-Slow-Dri-Blending-Gel-Medium-16-oz/dp/B001URYIOG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Liquitex Professional Slow-Dri Blending Gel Medium, 16-oz</a>  Good luck, friends! I hope this helps you to make a more informed decision than I did. :-) I wish someone had told me this before I had purchased. ....Be well ~	-1
I like this stuff. It adds a nice shine to whatever color paint I add it to. The texture is a good thickness.	1
It thins out my acrilics, and does it without causing any problems for the airbrush.  The quality of the paint remains high, and the paint goes on without a hitch.	1
I love that this doesn't affect opacity of the paint. It doesn't create a glaze effect; the paint remains opaque. I've been able to make some nice marbleized looks. I'm having a lot of fun just playing with and experimenting. I'm not sure how I feel about the glossiness. It is VERY glossy and everything looks like you're trying to paint abstract ponds or lava flows.	1
Well made.	1
I use this as a mixer for other colors of heavy Liquitex. It works well in that capacity.	1
A little runnier than small tubes but much more economical	1
Everything worked out great,delivery was as promised,shipped well,and packed well. The  product was as described and expected. A great place to search and fined pretty much anything your looking for.	1
The first one I ordered had a broken switch.  The replacement came almost immediately and it works well.  The projector saves a lot of drawing time when I start a painting.  It also prevents errors in perspective, proportions, etc.  It is an easy to use projector that is also light weight.  I recommend it.	1
I really like this. Fun to use!	1
It's white	1
Love the big tube you never have to much white	1
This brand of acrylic remains usable much longer than Golden brand, I'm able to work with the colors for weeks instead of days/hours. The tubes are excellent size for large canvas work. Thanks !	1
Excellent color, a bit rustier than shown on the monitor, but I was counting on that.  I love that this paint in water-based and available in such a large tube for such a great price.	1
A little tacky but covers good	1
white is light and I use it everywhere. This is a great size and a good price for someone who likes to paint for entertainment.	1
Love it.	1
The projector does speed up drawing on complex projects, but you do need to have a very dark room to clearly see what you are projecting.  Light weight, ready to use out of the box and reasonably priced.	1
This really works better then I thought. Easy to use on canvas.	1
cool	1
Really great medium to use for any painter. Helps paint to move much smoother on any canvas and the overall looks of painting	1
I'm still a bit of a novice with airbrushing, but have been doing it off and on for about three years now. Before I thinned my paints with water or window cleaner and I would notice the paint would bead more than it does when using this medium. This distills the paint while keeping it nice and smooth.	1
My airbrush medium arrived in time and in brand new condition.  I started using it in my acrylic painting to thin the paint instead of using water.  Works great.	1
Impossible to get Golden in Utah since the only store that sells it is sold out all the time.. I decided to try Liquitex.. I started with them and still use many of their products. But the Airbrush medium is Exactly like Goldens.. except it's not quite as glossy.. but you can alway's fix that.. I recommend highly (and you get 2x's the product for same price)	1
I love the texture this gives to my artwork----so awesome.  It doesn't dilute the color hardly at all.  I love this stuff, highly recommend it!	1
At first, I found that it added a little glossiness to the Citadel paint I use. I'm not sure if it's that I've gotten used to it or I'm just not noticing it anymore, but I don't notice it now. I've been using it to thin all of my Citadel paints for brush, but I think I'm going to see what kind of results I get from the Liquitex Matte Medium.	1
great product, beautiful mother of pearl shine I will go to this seller for more items for my altered book items.	1
love the look and mix it with almost everything I work on, maybe too much. I like the look especially in metallic paints. Make varnish really pop.	1
This board is worth it. I chose to get the one from Amazon Warehouse Deals which I was worried about since it said it might have package damage but it was five dollars cheaper and still prime shipping. It has a two or three inch slight scratch on the back, barely see it and not deep, and one of the bottom corners on the back has a little smoosh about one and a half inch long, not trying to come apart or worsen so it's cool.  Rubber ban came protected in a little zip top bag which is cool. It's a VERY tight rubber and so DO NOT put more then one or two sheets on the board at once, traditionally you would take ONE from your drawing pad and attach it to your board when you don't have a drafting table to work on (as I do not yet).  The clips are super tight but that's what you want when it needs to securely hold your heart: the piece you are working on.  Not an issue to me but just thought I would mention the board I recieved is closer to tan then dark brown. I'm sure it's just the variation in the masionite or lighting when the picture was taken.  I'll be using the board for the first time later today but did put my name and contact info on it so that if it's lost or stolen in not out the money to replace it. When I was doing this I did notice it appears to have ZERO bend to it, which I was hoping would be the case.  Well worth the investment because if you take care of it right it should last you the length of your artist career / life.	1
They arrived to my grandsons safe and intact. They have been using them for drawing & painting quite a bit! Success.	1
I use this every day to color on, and have done for almost a year. Great board! I keep things on it with Silicone bands instead of the enclosed rubber band. I like them better.	1
Excellent investment!  Makes it easy to sketch anywhere.	1
Liquitex is fantastic and I love how well it mixes. White goes quickly, so do remember to always purchase more white!	1
Liquitex is such good quality and a real pleasure to use. This particular shade of gold is just lovely! It spreads and covers beautifully, and adds a glow that almost looks like liquid light. It reflects natural light in such a way that the whole painting just shimmers from many angles. I use it in large areas sometimes, but I really love using it to add those unexpected details that enhance the overall look of the painting. It is satin-like, smooth and precise, and it is becoming somewhat of a "signature" of mine on my work. I will always have this in stock!	1
I needed yellow paint. Never had a problem with Liquitex Basics before, but the jar of paint when opened wasd caked. I used acrylic paint liquifier to loosen it so the pain would flow but that hasn't worked. Next time The Art Store!	-1
What a piece of junk. More of a child's toy than an art tool. Didn't work, and if it had or still would've been impossible to use since the area is so small you can trace and the projection is only a foot or two away.	-1
I have used these paints forever.  They are all vibrant, beautiful colors and are just the right consistency.  4 oz. tube like this goes a long way.  If you have big outdoor projects (I'm painting bricks) you might want to go with 8 oz.	1

good price for the size. I used it to make gesso and it looks great! Now I need the other colors in the spectrum to do some painting!	1
Works well, does not dry quickly. Make sure that you use a level work surface to avoid rippling or pulling at edges.	1
Great quality interesting effect, I have played with this and always wish I purchased in larger sizes. Tip: use Vaseline around the inside of the lid after opening.	1
But, you dilute it with a 20 parts water to 1 part Flow Aid, so it will last forever. I was never very good at math anyway. I keep the diluted flow aid in a water bottle that has red marker all over warning me not to drink it. Probably need a better way to store that, lol.  I used it with my Winsor Newton acrylics while I contemplated getting Golden Open acrylics.  It definitely increased the drying time and the paints were still wet to the touch on the palette the next day. The texture or porousness of the canvas determines the drying time on the panel, but I had to time to rework the paint. I still prefer the Golden Open paints (yes I did break down and buy a set), but I can use up the Winsor paints now.  I have been keeping a small cup of the diluted Flow Aid on hand to use instead of water for thinning paints during the painting process. I'll never use water to thin paints again. It. Is. Amazing. I still keep a cup of water for cleaning the brushes, but this is so much better for preserving pigment purity when thinning the wash.	1
Put this with any transparent color and it comes alive.  I Mix about 2/3 Medium to 1/3 pure color for the best result.  This makes my facination with iridescent paint expanded dramatically.  It works best with transparent colors or colors reduced to where they are transparent.  Better than I expected.  I will order more...  I don't want to run out as I use it in all of my paintings.	1
This product did exactly what it says it does with the added bonus of not having to heat set! I marble fabric and it's a great additive to certain acrylic paint which I had been having trouble with. Liquitex comes through again!	1
WOW- this stuff is amazing! I read the mixed reviews on it and decided to give it a try anyway. Out of the bottle, it appeared to be pearl paint- white base with pearlescent sparkles. But when I mixed it with my acrylics, it turned them into sparkly, metallic paints. The white base is sort of an illusion- it does NOT lighten paint when mixed with colors. I used just a tiny dot of it on my palette and it gave a very sheer sparkle/shimmer to all my colors without fading them or lightening them.  You can either use this sparingly for a barely-noticeable effect just to make the colors pop a little on the canvas, or you can mix heavier amounts to get different variations of metallic effects.  I highly recommend this!	1
After reading and seeing a thousand warnings about diluting acrylic paints with water for a "wash" effect (too much water prevents the acrylic molecules from bonding with each other, which prevents the paint from adhering to the surface/canvas for long-term, which means cracking or peeling), I read about using airbrush medium instead. It's super thin and milky and provides a great "wash" effect with paints, but it still allows the acrylic molecules to do their thing. I have to admit, washes made with the airbrush medium are actually better on the canvas- they just look richer and more vibrant when dry. The "milky" effect disappears when the paint cures, and it's a little hard to get used to at first, but it's really no difference than working with glazing medium (which is thicker).  I highly recommend this for acrylic artists who are looking to make their paints more fluid, translucent, and "wash"-y. It is a really great mixing agent!	1
It is fine.	1
I gave this sketch board to a patient in a nursing home and he loves it b/c he can just "put his work away" when tired, etc.  Doesn't have to worry about wet paper.  This was also a good size (16 1/2 sq) to hold 8X11 paper.	1
I bought this for an Art class. It is as expected, although it arrived dirty inside the packaging.  I will say that it's overpriced, as I discovered a similar sketch board at Hobby Lobby for around $10.	1
Great Quality!  Very sturdy :D	1
use daily	1
I've been using this projector for about 10 years for projecting reference photos and line drawings onto canvas for painting. It can accept images that are up to 5x5 inches in size. You place the unit on top of the paper image (or book page, etc.) and move the projector forward or back to adjust the size of the image it makes. You adjust focus by sliding the lens in/out. It can slide right out if you pull it out too far, and it can fall out while carrying the projector.  Moving the projector forward makes a smaller, brighter, and sharper image. Farther out makes a larger but dimmer and duller image. Regardless, you'll usually have to use it in the dark. Using a 100W bulb heats up the reference image to real hot...I wouldn't dare leave this thing on for long periods, or leave it on unattended. There is no carrying handle on top - which would make it easier to move around.  Although it looks modern, cute, and funky, it's mechanically and ergonomically a crude design. At first it's fun to use and elicits a "wow!" response, but the more you use it, the more frustrating it becomes. Top-loading projectors are better and much easier to use, but they start at around twice the price of the Tracer.	-1
What can I say?  I needed a lot of black and will need a lot of black as I continue painting.	1
I love the effect of cobalt blue and my paint set didn't include it.  I now have enough to do whatever I want to do!	1
As far as cheaper quality paints go, these are pretty good.  Colors are nice.  I am in love with the Heavy Body Acrylics but if you can't afford them, these are still pretty nice.	1
great product. would buy this again in a heartbeat. looking forward to many great things with this wonderful product. a must have.	1
I bought this to thicken up my acrylic paints. I know Liquitex is a great brand, so I was open to trying this product. I like painting with thick paint because it enhances the brushstrokes, which I love in my artwork. I was THRILLED with how this medium works. As it says on the label, it doesn't affect opacity or color. It immediately thickens the paint, but it does have some curing time. I store my colors in jello shot cups, so after mixing my color and adding the medium, I saved it for a few days later, and when I used it, my thought while using it was "it feels like I'm painting with toothpaste" (in reference to the thickness, not gritty like real toothpaste). I was so happy! Just what I wanted and I'm so happy I bought it. I plan to continue using this in all future painting endeavors.	1
Very good product, it opens up the time that your paint dries what helps you work much better with the paint. Great for mono printing and canvas.	1
I'm an artist and I love this medium since it allows me to give any color of paint that I mix (and I mix nearly all of my own colors)  a metallic, iridescent or pearlized.  In painting fantasy genre, this gives my work an extra quality that I was unable to achieve prior to discovering this product!	1
THIS WHEN USED PROPERLLY CAN GIVE YOUR WORK A 3D EFFECT THAT SO MANY PEOPLE DESIRE TO MAKE THEIR PAINTINGS STAND OUT FROM THE REST!	1
Works great!   Now it's time to prattle on about nothing for a bit so I can post the simple "yes it's good"  It's cold outside today, 12-2-13 Seattle WA, well cold for the area high 30's F.  Short days this time of year.	1
Really brings out a rich and vibrant color on fabric with my Inktense pencils.  Very easy to spread and work with...keeps ink from bleeding and I don't even have to wait for it to dry to do an adjoining area.  Very impressed, so ordered another immediately!  Going to try mixing 50/50 with Aloe Vera next...had read several people trying that too.  Might make it a bit too thick for easy spreading, but can't wait to play!	1
I am very happy with my purchase	1
Very nice	1
I've only had one other brand of acrylic paints (Winsor and Newton Galeria) so I don't have a ton to compare it to, but here it goes. I'm a beginning acrylic painter so I wanted some paints that were a good value and well-respected. I had read these were fairly thick paints, which is one reason I bought them. I've discovered they are definitely NOT thick paints. In fact, they are fairly thin.  The colors seem bright and vivid, though, and you really can't beat the value. I paid the same price for half the amount of the Galeria paints (which were also pretty thin). Since I'm using these mainly to fine-tune my techniques before I buy thicker paints, I can't say I'm disappointed; in fact I'll continue to buy them for a while, and just use a thickening medium to give me more texturing options. Eventually I'll just get the Liquitex Heavy Body acrylics.	1
Let me be the first to say, reviews are great. Since I've been exposed to reading reviews before purchasing.. I almost never buy without doing so. It's saved me some great headache, led me to some favorites, and let me learn from my own mistakes. This had mixed reviews.. on various websites I read on and on about it being.. as it's labeled... "basic". I was led to believe this was of low quality and I should pass it up. However.. I ignored those reviews, as I sometimes do. To say the least, I'm glad I did. I love this paint. I love how smoothly it applies. It's a great cover paint, which can be hard to find in whites. I've never had a problem using it as even my sixth layer. Add water, and you have a great glaze. Don't be fooled by negative reviews. Think of it this way.. it's cheap. If you hate it, you didn't waste much money finding out for yourself. I for one, love it and am glad to have found a wallet friendly paint to add to my palette.	1
Liquitex Professional Iridescent Effects Medium, 8-oz  is great! If you can use  a little iridescence in your paint, that is...	1
I use this as a mixture or a layer and it adds a layer of shimmering light to the page. I recommend this product for mixed media work	1
This worked for exactly what I needed it to. My only complaint is that somewhere along the line the bottle cap was damaged so now the product leaks when shaking or bottle gets tipped over	1
its nontoxic, and i don't have to breath in unhealthy fumes, so much better than the alcohol based mediums. it also works with other material as well. i use it in my fine art as well.	1
Unfortunately, this product is pearlescent and not iridescent. Thinking that perhaps I'd received a bottle from a failed batch, I called Liquitex to ask and they confirmed that the product is, in fact, pearlescent and not iridescent. Why it's misnamed, I have no idea, and the lady on the phone seemed a bit baffled about it, too. If you're looking for something to impart an iridescent quality to your work, you'll need to look elsewhere. If you're looking for a pearlescent effect, this is the (misnamed) product for you!	-1
I bought this because I needed a projector right away, and someone on Craigslist was not getting back to me. Long story short, I still don't have a projector -- and this thing is going right back to the store. Thank heavens I got it on sale.  A good projector does not require a pitch black room to function. This thing, even in a very dark room, produced the most impotent attempt at a projection that I have ever seen. Yellow, faint, and completely impossible to focus. I'm not even certain my focus system works.  Don't buy this, not even for your children. It's completely and utterly useless, and not even deserving of that one star. For someone like me, who drafts preliminary clothing patterns on the computer and then projects them onto pattern paper to create full-size patterns, or any artist who requires a system to project images for copying, mural painting, etc., do yourself a favor. Don't waste your time with this anemic piece of junk! Now I have to wait until my refund processes (they can take money right away, but it takes days for them to give it back, gotta love that) to buy a different one, and I'll be way behind schedule.	-1
I use white more than any other color to blend it and this product is really satisfactory. It pays to buy the large one.	1
My baby (17 year old cat, Rusty) passed away the day after Thanksgiving, 2012.  The clinic had his paws imprinted onto a clay circle.  I wanted it painted but know nothing about paints.  My twin sister is an artist, and she specifically asked for this product.  I received my cast from her done with the black, red and white version of the Liquitex paints, and it is beautiful.  She really knows her paints!  If you're a real artist, then I needed say more.  If you are just learning to paint, this stuff rocks (she swears by it!).	1
It works the color is true.  We bought so my brother could paint a mural on my daughters wall.  Some of the work called for the White so it worked out well and colors last and even allows for cleaning over it once dry.  My brother noted it was easy to use.  Seems like a good value for the amount you get.  I would buy again.	1

Good quality	1
Have seen and worked on these boards before; in College, Art workshops and so forth. Now I have my own: I don't know how I made out without my own. Everything is in place, awaiting to be called on next. All held in place with the aid of the strong elastic band and the strong alligator type grippers at the top. The carrying handle is also well placed, and swings along freely and lightly as I make my way from appointment to appointment.	1
I love this medium and use it a lot in pour paintings, especially backgrounds. It's easy to use. I try not to waste it however as it's basically liquid plastic. You can mix it with color 50/50 or add a little water to it to thin it more. You can substitute this stuff for "tar gel" which is horrible stuff anyway and probably some other mediums you use. This medium has a lot of purposes for an acrylic painter, and its transparent and glossy too.	1
This product arrived very quickly.  I have wanted to try this Liquitex product for some time, however I just received it and have not had a chance to use it in my art.  I have always been very impressed with Liquitex products so I'm sure that I will be very pleased.  Thanks	1
I like the product and now I have to meet a word requirements so this company will accept my response	1
I use this product to thin Liquitex soft body Acrylics for use in an airbrush.  This product mixes thoroughly and easily with the Liquitex line e.g. Hard Body, Soft Body, and Liquitex Ink!.	1

Liquitex makes a very good product in my opinion. This Titanium White paint is no different. It is very thick and has a vibrant color. The price on Amazon is very good too.	1
This paint is excellent. Very thick and vibrant black color. Very well priced as well. I would recommend the Liquitex brand as they seem to make a quality product.	1
Took me a long time to get an art board but now that I have one, I can't do without.  I tape watercolor or mixed media paper to it before starting a painting and it keeps the paper from warping and bubbling.	1
I have no idea how "normal" this is but the clip is insanely hard to open even a tiny amount to somehow slide 65 lb paper in it. It is far too stiff and springy. It is very dangerous as when it slips from your finger/thumb when opening it it snaps back on the board with a very strong and loud SNAP!  It was only delivered today and I've now had two other people check the function of the clip and both say it is far too difficult to open the clip for use.  I'm afraid I'll have to return this and purchase another brand, maybe on another site as I think I only see one other brand I think, and the reviews say that it is flimsy.  This Heritage Sketch Board seems nice and firm and a good size (15" x 16") but that clip is truly a deal-breaker for me because I have peripheral neuropathy and newly forming arthritis in both hands and fingers. But no, my medical problems aren't causing bias about this sketch board. Two healthier individuals (one man, one woman) say it is ridiculously difficult as well.  The rubber band that is included has surprisingly little odor. Normally rubber bands, especially larger ones, smell of rubber. This was minimal	-1
Got this for my grandson. He likes to draw outside. This board gives him a convenient drawing surface.	1
The large 8oz tube of titanium white acrylic paint came on time and was packed well. The paint works well and is a good price.	1
This paint is decent paint. It goes on smooth and when it dries it's tough and very resilient. My tube arrived with the end partially blown open and a portion of the paint dried. I'm glad it did because the dried paint sealed the tube--bad packaging I guess (or a bad tube). The paint is also easy to mix with other acrylics, too.	1
Perfect for watercolor or drawing on the go!	1
Good experience	1
as a fashion design students i believe its one of the best sketch board i had in whole my life...	1
good	1
I like this board much better than one I used previously of the same size. The clips are small, they aren't cumbersome, and they don't rip my paper.  I would really love it if I could buy this board in 20x26, though.	1
good	1
I use this while doing my artwork all the time!  It was an excellent purchase.  It is just the right size.  I can hold it on my lap while working and angle it against the table.  It is solidly made and the clasp has been good to hold my paper in place.  I am very pleased with this board.  I recommend it.  Thank you.  CMB Creations.com	1
Pretty good drawing board, clips are very good, rubber band is strong and holds paper in place, all in all a good product, especially for the price. Wish the board itself were a little sturdier but really nothing to complain about.	1
The rubber band that holds you work broke into a million pieces right out of the package. The board it nice and big though.	1
This board is perfect for sketching when you are not at an easel. Great size, holds a variety of sketch pads. Side clips for sketch pads are SUPER strong.	1
With this product W&N has a very competitive product in the blank postcard category. I have and have used about a dozen brands and this is fine, and has a competitive price. It is pretty decent watercolor paper and, in this small size, can take plenty of water and harsh treatment. The US Postal Service has fairly strict regulation about what is acceptable for post card rates. And, you cannot just place your artsy stuff willy nilly everywhere. Go on-line to the USPS web site for the latest info. These W&N blanks are at least as good as any. I've recommended them for a long time.	1
Tired of sending the same postcards that everyone else does? (I mean, what do THEY know about which pictures you want to send your friends.) Or do you have something to say that works better in imagery than in words? Or is there someone in you life who deserves a bit more attention than "Wish you were here"? Or ...  Well, there are bunches of reasons to send a unique image. These cards come conveniently sized and packaged as a watercolor block. The good, heavy stock stands up to hard use, and works well with pen, colored pencil, or marker, as well as watercolor. Although postcard sized, this also fills the bill as a [nearly] pocket-sized pad, for easy carrying or for times when you don't want to commit a bigger sheet to a small thought.  Not the most economical, measured by square cm, but very convenient.  -- wiredweird	1
Bought this for $15!!! INCREDIBLE PRICE, INCREDIBLE PAPER for pastel or watercolour, and does not need to be mounted on a board.  This is heavy weight, high end paper that any artist will appreciate.  Also, one sidce is smoother than the other, and very thick like card-stock, so definitely worth the price.  If I cahnge my mind after working on I will update this review, but would have given it 6 stars if I could.	1
I ordered two packs of this paper.  One pack was fine.  The second pack was a front and back cover only with NO paper inside.  Very, very disappointed.	-1
I have really enjoyed this watercolor paper. It was recommended to me in a class I was taking. The teacher didn't recommend the usual high-end paper brands you always hear about (arches). Don't get me wrong - that is GOOD paper. But not all art needs high end paper. It really depends on what you want to do.  If you love big watery washes or you really want the paint to float, flow and mix on the paper, then arches is a great choice. For illustrations of only a few layers, this paper is a great economical choice. Probably my favorite for the price range. The paper can buckle a bit with a wash but it seems to flatten out easily once dried. Locally I can only find Strathmore and Fabriano Studio. I like this more than both of those. I have to order this online but its worth it. I've had mixed experiences with the Fabriano Studio paper so I don't recommend it. One pad of that pilled on me no matter what i did. I ended up just using that pad as sketch paper because it didn't seem to handle any water (i think it was defective). And strathmore 400 series is adequate.  I prefer the spiral pad 7x10in. Sometimes I like to trace complicated shapes using a light pad but I also like to keep my work together whenever possible. So the spiral pad meets both my needs. And the size is just comfortable for me to travel with the pad or paint on the couch while watching tv.  Attached is a painting of a succulent done on this paper. I ended up cutting it out and placing it over a vallum and patterned cardstock to frame because of a paint smear. I like the end result.	1
Ugh, the "railroad tracks" on this paper are terrible! Too deep and clearly a deliberate pattern instead of a natural part of the process. Get pads of paper if you can "stretch" it, a block of paper if you're not stretching it, and in reality, Arches and Aquarelle are the best in quality-to-cost ratio (I did my own research on this comparison.) But, honestly, this stuff looks like it has a waffle pattern!	-1
Thick textured paper to paint on, and send to someone. Got these for a casual watercolor painting party and they were a hit. The paper is sturdy and decent quality, similar to Canson watercolor paper. I think it has a little less texture than the Canson I got, but not much of a difference. I'd definitely get them again, since it gives people something to focus on and a smaller space if they're feeling shy about painting	1
Good	1
Great quality.  Very pleased with the purchase.	1
This is the best watercolor paper I've ever used.  I will never buy a different kind.	1
Great product. Sturdy board. The metal clips can be difficult sometimes but it's good that they're strong. Would buy again	1
Great board, the only downside is that mine is a bit warped, and the rubber band doesn't really hold anything in place.	1
Very nice quality watercolor paper!  The 200 lb weight makes it perfect for plein aire paintings without having to do taping and stretching.  I think it's a great product at a good price.	1
I find the convenience of this product worth the extra expense. It makes watercolor painting a breeze.	1
UPDATE 02.24.2016: In love with this paper. Will continue to purchase in other sizes. Watercolor blends well. Paper buckles only slightly but manageable. See 2nd pic. I used Albrecht Durer Watercolor Pencils.  Very very good quality watercolor paper. Bought to use with my Albrecht Durer Watercolor Pencil Set, LYRA Watercolor Paint Set and my Winsor & Newton Cotman Studio 45 Half Pan Set. Would love to see how well each brand holds up on the paper...esp washes.  This review is based on my initial observation. I will do an update once I've used it a few more times.	1
Fantastic pads and a good price.	1
Awesome paper. Great deal in pricing.  Only issue is that it will curve once taken off the block. Nothing a picture frame cannot solve :)	1
I am in love with this paper! Great for watercolor.	1
great quality and texture	1
very good paper; the heavier the better.	1
good everyday watercolor paper	1
I love to live with things that inspire me. I use this board to hold images, ribbons, photos, magazine tear sheets and all manner of whatnots that I find beautiful. Makes a really nice display and keeps things I enjoy in plain sight without looking messy or taking over my small space. I rotate the contents as often as I like.	1
Love the higher weight for smaller pieces of Paper...hopefully 300lb. Will become available in tablet for also. ...but in the meanwhile this is great	1
Great product and delivery	1
Great product and delivery.	1
Great product and delivery.	1
If you're like me you like your watercolor paper crisp white, sturdy, and "fixed."  I feel like the paper I received from Amazon has been in the warehouse for a long time!  The white is still white but the "gummed" side is dried out so the pages are not adhered to each other and the stiff backing slips and slides around.  (I have purchased this before and it's not the brand!) Since I'm fortunate enough to live within walking distance of a Dick Blick store I'll just buy all my paper in person.  There was no price advantage to buying this through Amazon and I was just being lazy having the paper delivered. You would do as well buying separate sheets or paying more for a definitely watercolor block.	-1
I use this pad as a blotter book for photographic prints while they are drying, to transport them from school to home and finish drying them there. This does a great job. I would give them 5 stars if the gum binding on it was stronger, but if you are looking for a heavyweight paper that will handle a lot of washes without pilling up, I bet this paper would be ideal for that, since it handles my sopping wet prints without a problem. If I was using this for watercolor, the binding would not be a problem at all.	1
soaked some old brushes with dried acrylic paint and they came out soft and pliable.  Oil paint comes right out.	1
I confess, some of my brushes got pretty stiff up near the ferrule, or had acrylics dry on when I had a lot of brushes going on a fast-drying day. Given that they weren't big brushes, this stuff got the crud out after just a few hours of soaking. I haven't tried it yet on oils, alkyds, or more unusual media, but it worked great on my acrylic brushes. And, as near as I can tell, it doesn't contain solvents that would turn your studio into a Superfund site.  Just one word of caution: when you suspend your brush in the cleaner, make sure it goes no deeper than partway up the ferrule. This paint remover works as well on the intended paint on a brush's handle as it does on unintended paint in the bristles.  -- wiredweird	1
Very nice paper. Good for starters and accomplished painters.	1
Loving this	1
Always love strathmore paper. This is great and I love the tooth on it	1
I like this paper	1
This cleaned my brushes!	1
This is a great cleaner. I've used it for a few years now in combination with a brush soap and I highly recommend it.	1
Absolutely FABULOUS!  No spiral annoyance and great paper.  Love it.	1
Nice product for our budding artist!	1
Great quality paper, I am new to watercolor and this held up to soaked pages, spills and other mishaps. All my paintings look great.	1
great price and product	1
I really like this watercolor paper, it's easy for me to manipulate paint exactly how I want on it, it absorbs pigment beautifully and can withstand a lot of water without getting soggy. The price is great too. Strathmore brand is generally great.	1
Good quality paper color paper at a good price! Doesn't bleed whether you are using watercolor paint or ink.	1
excellent complement for long lasting brushes	1
This is absolute complete overkill for small acrylic brushes. I am a model painter, so I use very small but expensive brushes.  I had about 15 very nice, but crusty brushes that needed cleaning. I poured a very small amount of this into a narrow but tall ceramic cup. I then placed all my  dirty brushes into the fluid to clean them up in bulk. The description says not to let the liquid touch the handles, so I kept it pretty shallow witb liquid.  When I checked on it about 20 minutes later, the brushes were utterly destroyed. All the synthetics were in a state of dissolving and the sable hair brushes were shedding as if the hair had been ripped out.  My brushes were so well cleaned that they turned into a soup. I'm not too bummed because they were older brushes, but I probably lost about $80 worth of brushes in this endeavor.  I do NOT recommend this cleaner unless you want a universal solvent that will eat through your floor.	-1
Great, Thank you!	1
this paper is good for doing painting on.  or atleast that's what the other reviewers said.	1
It did what I needed to do . I will order more soon	1
works well.	1
Does exactly what it is supposed to.	1
Great brush cleaner.	1
I always get this brand, you can't beat the quality.	1
Worked great as expected.	1
Great quality artist paper	1
I've used this paper for over a year and it performs well.	1
Good quality.  Fairly heavy. Does curl some even wet.	1
I use it for beginner watercolor painting class and it's great!	1
OK I got these for a specific on line course in watercolors that I am involved in.  For regular painting I use the rolled paper.  This is OK for practice and learning new techniques and I would recommend it, but not if you are thinking  of doing 'real' paintings.  I bought 10 about a year ago and have been happy to have plenty of paper on hand and not worry that my beginning attempts were ruining too much paper.  BUT I think it was good to not worry about wasting money.  The first year is almost over and I am almost out of paper....so no doubt I will be ordering more.	1
The paper's great, no complaints. But I ordered it in "block" form to try out that method. It came as a pad and so I was disappointed. If you're looking for a block of paper, don't buy this one.	-1
Nice quality paper. Takes paint and Dylusions nicely.	1
I am new to arcrylic painting and hence there are so many concepts to try, and it is not worth buying larger canvases as it would a waste at my level of competence!  I like the Strathmore brand and it works well with most of the paint (not the expensive brands for me right now).  at ~90 cents per sheet, I am deriving a lot of joy from practicing with this product.	1
Good Product. Thanks	1
A handy brush cleaner and conditioner. Works very well to keep my oil painting brushes in top condition and avoid smearing colors because of paint residue in the bristles.	1
great product: a little bit cleaned my stiff oil paint artist brushes in about 30 min and they are like new!	1
I am a budding Mixed-Media artist. This paper is great for my projects .	1
I just recently discovered this stuff existed and I love it. I can play with all kinds of tools, mediums etc on it to find what the results will be. Great product!!	1
Works really well with any type of medium. I used mostly with delusions paints and gelatos.	1
Nice quality paper for painting.	1
This worked great for my inktense on a shirt painting project. Thinned our with a 2 parts medium, 1 part water consistency, this activated the inktense well, but once dry, provided the extra permanency I was looking for. It doesnt say to heat set it, but I fluffed my finished piece in the dryer for a good 20 min before washing it, just to be sure. Washed up just great.	1
I really like this product. I used it for acrylic pouring.	1
Good quality	1
Excellent and reliable service	1
When I bought this I thought it was for cleaning brushed that had dried paint in the bristles..  It doesn't do that, but is a pleasant smelling and does the job of washing wet paint out of your brush, either as a final cleaner, or when changing colors for the same brush.	1
Great product	1
My title says it all. I had a fabulous Purdu brush ruined by paint forgotten and gone bone stiff dry. I soaked for weeks in mineral spirits...nothing!! Then I ordered thi	1
This is by far the best brush cleaner for acrylic paints! I have only used it for acrylics so I cannot speak for how well it works on oils. I bought the big bottle this time! I am an art teacher and no matter how hard I try to teach my students to keep their brushes in the water there are always one or two students who forget. This brush cleaner has saved me so much money in brushes because if I did not have this cleaner I would have to throw away the brushes! I always let them soak in a small amount of the solvent and then I scrub them a little with a toothbrush. Then, I place the paint brushes in warm water with some Dawn liquid soap. Then I thoroughly rinse and reshape the bushes and lay them out to dry. Excellent product!	1
I am an actual buyer and I did used the product and will continue to use it on material that makes paint rol off.  Used on polymer clay with basic acrylic paint. It worked perfectly!! The paint stayed on my project, no bubbling off. I read acrylic paint doesn't stay on polymer clay and didn't want to take chances so I tried this product.   Well I decided to checked it out for myself... acrylic paint doesn't stay on polymer clay but with the Liquitex product does make a huge difference.	1
Great product, for much cheaper than local store.	1
My children love this canvas paper. It was the best paper I bought for Christmas. I actually need to buy more. Perfect texture for paints. Love it.	1
Good product and fast shipping.	1
This is too thin for acrylics.  My bad.  But it could be a good paper for sketching, or maybe water color.	-1
I Use this to thin Acrylic paint for direct application to wooden toys. It thins the paint WITHOUT diluting the acrylic particles so necessary to adhere to the next layer of paint, if needed. The thinner paint soaks deeply into the wood, locking the paint to the surface, and allowing more coats to stick to the surface. Some acrylics will still cover in one coat after thinning with this (black works very well) but others will not cover in one coat even direct out of the bottle. So as a thinner, keep in mind coverage as well as adherence to the surface and the next color, if needed.	1
A must for oil-style painting with acrylics. I mix it with the liquid retarder to get a product of the thickness I prefer. No special formula--I just mix in enough of the liquid kind to have a slightly gelled consistency.	1
THIS STUFF WORKS GREAT!!  Very forgiving in application, smooth through any airbrush.	1
A friend of mine loves to paint.  I got her this set and she was thrilled.  She usually doesn't use oil since she finds it harder to find good sets for a reasonable price but with these she said she planned to get them again.	1
Grat product and fast delivery. I don't know why they have this listed as a toy......this should not be used by anyone under the age of 18 without supervision	1
Excellent transaction. Product works as advertised.	1
Great for cleaning brushes. Very little odor	1
It works. You just need a little bit. You can even dilute it with water once it's in your cup. Remember: Always put the brush cleaner in a separate bowl/cup.	1
I used this to remove the factory makeup of a doll for customization and it worked beautifully. Almost no smell and no scary warning labels!	1
This really saved my large, flat bristle brushes that became hard as a rock when I had to leave my acrylic painting without cleaning or even rinsing for a few days because of an emergency. I didn't clean them until almost a month later and they came out clean.	1
I did not receive the Reeves product but some cheap china oil set that could be hazardous to me and others! I cannot give a review on the actual Reeves set pictured here.	-1
You can't go wrong with the Liquitex products	1
Does what it is suppose to...	1
Always useful for painting	1
This is nice and thank you...	1
you can really paint on it doesn't seep through	1
Good quality for money	1
love it!	1
Works wonderfully well to clean paint brushes and for stripping paint when an art project doesn't turn out quite right.  Recommend.	1
Once in awhile I just have to soak my brushes to get them really clean.	1
Definately helpful	1
I filled up a jar with this cleaner and left two brushes in it overnight. The next day I took them out and some of the paint had been cleaned from the ferrules, but not all. I checked the bristles and there was still some dried paint in them.	-1
awesome!	1
If you are on a tight budget this is not a bad starter set. One tip - invest in one large tube a titanium white and use it to mix from the colors in this set - you'll get more mileage out of the set. Also, if you do find you like painting you can get away with just buying the primary colors (and white) and mixing your own secondary colors. In fact, it's a good learning exercise to start with just a small number of colors to work with in the beginning.	1
These are great, with very vibrant colors. I like using them to teach my students. Very cost efficient. I would recommend them to anyone.	1
great paint for the price, but very small bottles. Smaller than the picture looks. Just be aware when buying that it will only be good for a few paintings.	1
If you have dried on oil paint or lacquer or just face paint, this cleaner, after a little soak, will take it all out.  YES, take caution in not letting this cleaner touch anything but the bristles!  It will strip your painted handles or anything else you let the cleaner touch!  It is the best cleaner I have ever used.	1
This product works very well to help restore brushes.	1
it works well.	1
It says not to get product on the handle of the brush.  So, I put about 2mm in the bottom of a glass jar & set a 1" flat bristle brush down into it.  Took it out a few minutes later, the least amount of time it was supposes to take to remove the hardened oil paint.  It did remove the paint, but unfortunately capillary action had drawn the Brush Cleaner up into the ferrule (unbeknownst to me).  I laid the clean brush down on a clean rag to dry.  The next day the paint of the handle, which had been softened by the cleaner, had embedded itself into the rag &  so brush & rag had become one. The label recommends using a fingernail brush to clean off the dried paint from your brushes.  I think in the future I'll also use that same nail brush to apply the Brush Cleaner to the paint brush, thus limiting the likelihood of getting it on the brush handle. So, I'll continue to use it, but much more cautiously.	1
Good weighted canvas paper. My daughter is happy, and therefore so am I.	1
Great buy!	1
The canvas paper was a good buy. Although it was not as thick as I thought and needed to be taped down so it will not buckle when painting. I think I will stick to canvas panels.	1
I like this paper, but I am spoiled - love drawing on linen added paper- more tooth and texture. This is a high quality paper.	1
love it helps with pouring paints	1
Love this to delay drying process	1
Nothing really compares to the Liquitex pouring medium. I have tried a combination of others and found this one to be the best and most consistent	1
I got this for acrylic pours...it's just what I thought it would be.	1
Loved this project!	1
Great for acrylic pours	1
This canvas paper is the real deal!! Just as thick as normal canvas.  Zero bleed through even when get thinner on it.  I love it and have already ordered one in a bigger size.  Very, very pleased with the price and product. Plus you can pull the top page all the way back around so you can paint flat without removing the paper top. When you're done with that page,  the binding holds perfect anyway and you just pull it back and it comes off easily enough but solid enough that it wouldn't have fallen off no matter what.  Surprisingly well made product.  I'm sure I'll be using this brand for years to come!!	1
I am quite pleased with the quality and the price of this product.  It gives a feel of canvas, but I don't feel like I am breaking the bank if I mess it up.  This particular size is quite handy to take along on walks, or even just out in the backyard.  I can dash of a quick bit of work, and then take it home to refine on a larger scale.	1
I ordered this because I didn't want to practice on my regular canvases, but it's not worth it. The paper curls up when it's wet and is hard to keep still. Didn't work very well.	-1
Works well to thin acrylics.	1
Costly but necessary-	1
Works good for mixing with acrylic paint, but pricey. Floetrol works just as good for me.	1
I am an 89 year old retired artist. Like most artists, money for painting supplies is not plentiful. I had some old brushes that still had good bristles but paint had hardened next to the ferrel. I was going to throw them away. But saw the cleaner  and restorer while search Amozon, thought it was worth a try andordereda bottle. After soaking, the paint dissolved and the bristles were soft and pliable. I have used them a number of times and they apply the paint just like new ones. I will certainly use this when needed.  George "Pops" Dobbs	1
My only complaint with this stuff is the hefty price tag. Works very well but it's too expensive to be able to use it all the time.	1
Winsor & Newton has provided great artist supplies for years and this is a good item to have in your supply cabinet.	1
This is my favorite of all the sketchbooks I've bought since I've been art journaling.  The pages are smooth and don't fall out.	1
as advertised	1
The single problem with this stuff is how hard it is to get it.  The product is versatile and excellent.  I don't know why they put it in a bucket instead of a jug, but honest,  the bucket is easy to open.	1
Where did my acrylic  pour cells go? I expected more from Liquitex. I will update if I find I'm just on the dark side of a learning curve.	-1
This worked very well for my older, drier acrylic paints. I was able to save most of them. It doesn't seem to keep working as it sits. Even after punching some of the drier paints it didn't seep into them. This was my first time using a product like this so maybe that's standard and my paint was too far gone.	1
Mixing this with dyes keeps it permanent on fabric, just love it.	1
Overpriced	1
good deal, grandchild loves to draw and save her work, this was just what she ordered!	1
My daughter goes through one of these every six weeks. She likes it because she carries it on public transportation and it's a good size and very sturdy, and also she's left-handed and doesn't have to deal with resting her arm on metal spirals.	1
I do a lot of crafts and am always looking for deals on chipboard and paper products, but worry about the acid content ruining my work over time. This arrived quickly and works well, it wasn't dry. The tip did turn purple after a couple uses but it hasn't changed the way the pen works or detects acid. I'm glad I bought this, that little bit of peace of mind helps a lot when I'm working on a project I expect to last a long time.	1
Beautiful book! I bring it everywhere. Super quality pages. Wonderful for Prismacolors.	1
Good quality. Recommend!	1
I Liked and my cat XD	1
A!	1
the glass beads don't fall off, end results are so pretty. can use this through a stencil too. dries clear, but shiny. looking for matte finish now.	1
Works great as an additive when I make acrylic pouring paintings.	1
I put a few drops in the color mix when creating acrylic pouring.  Very, very, nice effect.	1
I really like having this ph pen around. I keep it in my craft room to test items I am not sure about, for the safety of my photo's. Scrapbooking is a really fun activity for me, but capturing special moments and saving them for family members is key. That is very important to me and I do not want to have to worry about an item potentially ruining a photograph. Especially in the cases where I don't have a negative or a particular photo is the only one around. This pen is well worth the purchase price of $7.31 and I will be purchasing another when I use up this one.	1
Like this pen it helps me find out if my papers. I'm using is acid free and safe for my scrapbook projects.	1
Gave these to two 10ish girls so they would stop doodling on the furniture and they loved them.  It's great to foster talent while keeping furniture clean :)	1
Good value	1
A necessary product for my liquid poured painting projects.  Works well.  Wish it had a pouring spout however to fill smaller containers without having to use a funnel.  Or better yet, a squirt top would be great.	1
good product	1
There isn't much to say about this except it delivers what you need.  I used it for an art class, and had no complaints.	1
working out great..	1
does a awesome job	1
For $27 you cant beat the price.	1

my paint flows better so it works great	1
I bought this sketch book for my black and white drawings. It is very nice and looks very profesional. The size it is great. Nice to keep all my sketches in one place. Very well made.	1
I wish I'd have found these bound sketchbooks years ago when my daughter was younger, but it wasn't until she was a junior in HS. The years and years and years worth of artwork on random pieces of papers could have been avoided!  For parents of budding artists out there: I highly recommend making one of these a staple in the school book bag! My daughter would draw on literally any scrap she could find (including illustrating every spelling word on tests!) and many were lost or rescued from the trash by teachers who paid attention. This bound sketch book is much easier for her to carry around than a spiral-bound book (the pages always rip on those). You'll be happy to have the bound record of their artistic progress through the years!	1
First time using thickening gel and boy let me tell you. It doesn't take much and it definitely thickens very thin paint. Sculpture consistency is right.	1
Use in fluid acrylic pouring to help keep the medium moving.	1
When you need to get your painting groove on, you know get into the FLOW of things, Liquitex has your artistic back!	1
Exactly what I expected.	1
Great product!	1
Exellent	1
great for a budding artist paper was thick enough to paint on and did not tear same book at Micheals but cheaper	1
Perfect!	1
Excellent	1
These are awesome, especially when you put another color paint underneath or are using white as the background.  Makes great snow	1
Nice and works well for what I do with them.	1
This didn't work the way I wanted but maybe I just don't know how to use it yet.	1
Black glitter in goop. You can see the flecks in some paint but not others (can't see it in white, but fine in purple, etc).  That would make it mediocre, but what makes it bad is trying to get the glitter out of my brushes! After two hours in multiple cleaning methods they STILL have glitter in them!  The only way I've been able to get some of the glitter out is by flicking the brush hairs, but that ends up ruining the brushes!  The pictures are after trying to get them clean.	-1
Useful, simple, great cover and wonderful paper quality. I use graphite, compressed and vine charcoal, colored pencils(verithin) with plastic and kneaded erasers. Never once do I face any problematic situation, approval I give to this wonderful book.	1
Works great with the paints.	1
Good stuff. I like it. Wish there was a "generic" product that cost less. Maybe someday.	1
Great artist material, came quickly and is easy to use.	1
Great	1
Great product, wish it was a bigger bottle though for the price you pay.	1
excellent product will buy again, thanks	1
Standard paper for artwork.  Sturdy binding for easel work.  Exactly what I was looking for.	1
Awesome!	1
If you like playing with texture in your paining or art journaling this is great. It holds the beads firmly without adding too much additional medium, but it does add some. You can add paint to tint it but it does thin the pigment load.  If you are art journaling, you need to use one that has heavy paper like the one from Ranger. As you'd expect the glass beads add weight to the page as well as texture. There are many create uses for this medium.	1
Love, love this product truly amazing.  You have to try it.  Thanks for another tool to create with.	1
as rated	1
Purchased as a gift and the recipient has no complaints.	1
Very high quality paper. Very good price.	1
This is not my favorite paper at all.  It is very thin and extremely toothy, partially my fault because I didn't check the thickness before ordering.  But I don't think that anyone would want paper that is this thin for their art.  I don't see the paper holding up well over time, and it is hard to get much detail with the laid finish, once again my fault for not paying attention. Also it doesn't have the prefer rated dot thingies that you can tear it out by. The paper is directly attached to the ring binding and has to be cut out. Since I can't seem to cut a straight line, that's a big downer for me.  I will only use this paper for scrap pieces.  I've included pictures to show how thin in paper is, and a quick sketch with a charcoal pencil to show the laid finish of the paper.  Overall I do not recommend this product.  If you are a charcoal artist I would highly recommend the Strathmore Bristol Vellum 100lb.  Not this product. The Vellum 100lb. is thick and has a great smooth surface.  I have even used it for portraits and I loved how they came out.  Also the paper is NOT attached by a ring binder and simply pulls right out, I own this particular one in four different sizes and it is great for charcoal.	-1
Came bent and with permanent folds..... :-(	-1
I bought this as a gift for my daughter she love the paper	1
I bought this for use in some calligraphy projects. I wanted a thin paper that wouldn't bleed at all. This paper did the job and then some, without picking up the cotton-fiber type particles in the pen's tip. Even with the extra-fine (sharp) tips, it held up beautifully. I'd definitely recommend this product to anyone who uses water-based, non-waterproof inks.	1
Strange product.  It has a weird consistency -- kinda like if you chopped up jello. Years ago, Liquitex acrylic retarder was a smooth flowing clear product kinda like a tube of paint. This product requires attention to mixing so that it the chunks dissolve, and it gets equally mixed (easier with a palate knife and squishing this into the paint.  It *very slightly* adds to acrylic dry times. Let me explain: If straight acrylic paint is workable for 5 minutes and dries in 15minutes, then (adding a ratio of 1/4 this product to the amount of paint) makes paint workable for 6-7minutes (tops) and dries in >2 hours. What you want from a retarder is to increase your workable time, and this product isn't very effective in that regard. I will try a different product next.	-1
As a professional artist who has used and tested many acrylic and other media, I can say that there's nothing else quite like this stuff.  This is not something to apply like paint by brushing a thin layer. The closest alternative is Golden's Self Leveling Clear Gel, but the Liquitex Pouring Medium spreads better.  Both work best by pouring a layer and letting it drip off the edges of your work for a think gloss layer.  These dry in a flat layer, whereas other media distort when poured in thick layers.	1
There really is no replacement for pouring medium when you're pouring abstract acrylic paintings.  The effects are addicting and there are so many creative possibilities.	1
Works exactly like it is supposed to.  Of course I make a mess with it.  lol  It makes the paint pour so much better than mixing with water or medium, and does not affect the pigment binding of the paint.  The paint does look plastic when it dries, but that is the nature of the beast.  I love my pouring medium!	1
Love this product! I use it as a thick, clear, shiny varnish on my mixed media pieces.	1
This stuff has kept me from wasting tons and tons of expensive acrylic paint!	1
This worked great for painting sea shells to make them iridescent!	1
good stuff	1
Definitely the best little travel item I've found in awhile! I carry this water filled brush with a 4x6 sketchbook and a couple of watercolor crayons, and can record impressions of a scene quickly. Best, they all fit into my purse easily. I have two sizes--they're great!	1
Awful paper, not worth the money. Love cansons watercolor and mixed media, but this stuff is trash. Go for a good card or smthn, this paper is streaky, bad for blending and more. Bleh.	-1
I'm actually pretty disappointed in this paper, I typically really like Canson's products, so when I was given a very cool set of art markers for Christmas, I ordered this to use with them (the ink bleeds on the heavier Canson papers, like the sketch pad and the multi-media pad). This stuff pretty much feels like a tablet of printer paper. I don't love it. I don't even like it. Really disappointing.	-1
Beautiful! I love rendering on this.	1
Mixed it with yellow paint and two drops of gold and spread with a palette knife. So great for these abstracts. The texture is very visible on these pieces. Highly recommended, and would buy again.	1
allows me to make nice lines when i throw paint.	1
Perfect fibers and a beautiful blue fade on the bristles that never wear Away. Long lasting water supply! HIGHLEY RECOMMENDED.	1
Best Waterbrush EVER!  Did tons of research after lots of leaks with other waterbrushes.  I love this - after many years I found my unicorn!	1
leaks badly	-1
My favorite watercolor brush.  I must have at least 6 of them by now.  Love the small brush especially in coloring books.	1
Much better than tim holtz or some of the other ones I've tried. It holds the tip well.	1
These work great with both pen and ink and for watercolor	1
These are great for working with watercolor pencils.  It doesn't leak water, I filled it, threw it in my art case so I could go back and forth to the craft center, and it never dried up or leaked.  The tip has a good consistency.  Definitely a good buy.	1
must have great quality	1
Good brush	1
good	1
Works great	1
Better price than what I can find in stores. Works great for pouring painting.	1
Definitely makes my fluid acrylics more flowy.	1
These are my favorite water brush pens on the market, and I have several of these and other brands as well (some I fill colored inks).  The reason I like this particular brand is that they have the best flow control compared to other brush pens like the Pentel Aquash or Koi.  The water reservoir has a very small opening so that water does not inadvertently flood the brush.  With others, I am continually having to blot excess water off the tip with a paper towel.  The con though is that this great control has a price - the small opening in the reservoir means you cannot hold it under a water tap to refill.  The instructions say to squeeze it in a water glass and suck up the water.  This is not very satisfactory because it will only half fill the reservoir at best.  What I use (as many others do) is a little 5 ml blunt nose plastic syringe.  I bought mine at Amazon but Goulet Pen also carries these and has a video on their use and how to store the blunt needle in the plunger cavity for easy carry. An odd quirk that is confusing is that some vendors like Amazon list these as Yasumoto Niji whereas in many others list them as Kuretake Niji.  They all have Kuretake stamped on the side so they are apparently the same brush pen.	1
Love this pen. better quality than pentel	1
i got these as a gift and i absolutely love them!	1
Exactly what I needed!!! Great product, fast delivery!	1
Hands down the best water brush I've tried. You can also put (water soluble) ink or liquid watercolor in the reservoir and it works like a charm.	1
This is a great brush, well made, doesn't leak, nice brush tip. This works great with my peerless water colors.	1
Love!  I'd never used a waterbrush before.  This one is nice for detailed work with it's tiny pointed end.	1
This paper is really thin. I don't really like that but it holds up really well and doesn't bleed through.	1
Expesive but necessary if you want to pour.	1
The product arrived as promised and was fine.	1

This is a great medium for acrylic paint. Love it :)	1
A great travel brush and a little workhorse. This size and the mini are my favorites and go to brushes for travel.	1
I really enjoy using water tank brushes.  They are always ready to go.  The brush on this one is very nice. I can do washes and then I am able to do detailed work also.  Very easy to fill and does not leak. If anything I have to encourage the water to flow.  But I like that then I have the control not the brush.	1
Works great!!	1
Very handy if you use watercolor pencils or inktense pencils. Allows for fine detail. Good for mixed-media where your paper can't take lots of water.	1
These are absolutely the best water brushes on the market no matter what size you get. There are some importers which I have tried. In this case cheaper is inferior. I was glad I did try them though so I can tell you exactly what the difference is. With the off brand, the water either doesn't flow easily, or, when it does, it's too much. With the Niji the flow is effortless. So good in fact, you may decide to use it exclusively for watercolor pencils. To clean in between colors, I simply squeeze a little water into my pail and swipe a couple if times on a paper towel. At first you may think you did not get it clean because the white bristles discolor on the first use, but a test will show it is clean. Cap stays on well too. Perfect for on the go. I am sort of picky, so, to safeguard longevity,I only fill with distilled water. The directions do not say to do this. It's just my quirky little thing. These are highly recommended!!!	1
Great brush - I'm really enjoying using it! I bought it to use with my Sakura Watercolors Field Sketch Set.	1
This paper is good. It takes a lot of layers of a very dark color for this paper to bleed through to the pages underneath. Very thin, and almost transparent.	1
I love this paper. I use it for my brush lettering drills and it is nice and smooth and doesn't wreck my tombow markers or my fudenosuke pen. I recommend this paper for any sort of calligraphy or brush lettering.	1
Been using this brand of marker paper for years. They receive pen and marker well as well as having great erasability for pencils. The top side is smooth and the bottom is a little rougher. Use the smooth side. I've made the mistake of using the bottom and it made everything smear and bleed. The paper is thin but thicker than tracing paper and almost as transparent (about 20% less transparent?) . I use prismacolor and some copic markers for this paper. I actually like this better than the copic papers because they have more standard sizes and cost less while delivering the same performance. I think marker paper is a must if you want to be able to blend colors because the smooth surface is supposed to work with the alcohols in your marker to allow it to absorb slower, dry slower, thus giving more time for the color to be wet and bendable. However the same is true with pens, be careful to wait for ink to dry or else yo risk smearing. The smooth paper allows for crisp lines and blocks of colors without bleeding like Bristol paper. This is like vellum but lest costly so it's good for layouts and tracings.	1
Great paper for copperplate or Spenserian work, works well with watercolor pencils, or palette.	1
Wife uses it for college projects.  Good price and serves its purpose.	1
Nijis are okay but my favorite waterbrush is the Pentel Aquash which was $5.88 (also from Amazon). The Aquash tips are longer lasting; the barrel shape prevents them from rolling off a flat surface and they are easier to fill.  Aquash:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Pentel-Aquash-Water-Brush-FRHFBP/dp/B003W0I2VY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Pentel Aquash Water Brush FRHFBP</a>	1
I wrote a great review on it's larger cousin the medium, and of course will do the same for the large size. It's just a great product making a watercolorist's life easier.	1
Exactly what I expected	1
Just as it reads.liquitex is a great company and makes great products	1
Great for stretching paint.	1
I received mine for Christmas and it works great so far. No problem with the bristles not retaining their shape,no leakage,no problem refilling. I wish I had asked for more or maybe considered a package of different sized ones. If you plan to fill or use with ink I would suggest buying two and keeping one just for ink alone. I like it but I would also like another that has a smaller brush for more detail type work. All in all really great and I'm thrilled with it. Especially for travel on planes and in a car.	1
Works well for tracing and takes calligraphic inks well.	1
ok	1
I really like this marker paper. I have used it with alcohol markers and watercolor markers. There is absolutely no bleeding. My Spectrum Noir alcohol markers blend so incredibly well on this paper. I have noticed one side blends better than the other. I don't know why that is but it's something I have noticed. I use a waterbrush with the watercolor markers and the effects are beautiful. Even with adding the extra water there was no bleeding through the paper. I highly recommend this paper.	1
It was a good quality as I expected. Delivery was smooth.	1
great	1
Im in love with the pouring medium!! All that flow and that gloss!! Also it can be used as an alternative to resin .. Except this is not as hard as epoxy resin. so many ways to experiment with this!!	1
Great paper	1
Great Pad...no complaints!	1
Excellent	1
I ordered this to help my husband paint his Warmachine miniatures. The paint in such small amounts dries too quickly to blend or to place in a palette, so this extends the time the paint can be used. It saves paint and therefore money.	1
Received my package way early and was very pleased with the shipping.  It works wonderfully with acrylics.	1
Great product and price!	1
Great item! packaging great!	1
Good product, I use it often to get "special effects".	1
GREAT PRODUCT......I like this stuff it makes paint flow good.........GREAT PRICE..............FAST SHIPPING...........WILL BUY AGAIN!!!!	1

WOW!!  I have enough pouring medium to last awhile.  I'll be back again, I'm sure!  Thanks for sending order after first one lost.	1

Awesome product!	1
This is my ALL TIME favorite mix media product.  I mix in some ink and stenciled with it.  Oh it is magical!  If you want to make a wow statement this is the product.  Beware that once it dries it is very hard to cut through.	1
Worked like I expected	1
love it	1
This is a super fun product. Adds awesome texture and dimension to art projects	1
It doesn't get any better than this.  How wonderful is this medium?  I've made art projects every other day since I got this product.  Now I'm getting ready to place an order for more!	1
You can never have enough of these blending brushes if you are using Tombow brushes. Makes all the difference to nuance and shading.	1
These blenders are great although they don't seem to last long. As an artist I buy a bunch and keep them handy for daily use. The nibs seem to fray a little with extended use.	1
I use this with to create acrylic ink that I use in Montana refillable empty markers it works perfectly.	1
works as well as I was told it would	1
I have no idea what I did before this stuff. What a difference it makes in my work. I am an artist, miniature figure sculptor by trade, and my biggest issue has always been with painting eyes. They are so small it's difficult enough to work with a 2 hair brush, but to have to fight a constant battle against drying paint on the tip was always discouraging. I had tried other mediums, but this Flow-Aid was exactly what I was looking for all these years. I don't know why I never tried it. Now my paint doesn't bead up off the tip of my brush - if you paint small, you know what I mean. So many times I'd go to paint only to see that my bead of paint wasn't even on the tip, but had ridden up the hairs. Tough to create a realistic iris with that. With this Flow-Aid, the paint on my brush is smooth and doesn't dry up right away. Awesome.  Definitely a good buy.	1
I am new to this pouring medium, but so far so good. I thought it would be more runny, but I am glad it's not. Looking forward to see what else it can do!	1
Works great!	1
this product is great. it is a smooth texture great for mixing with my high flow acrylics from golden to pour over canvas and create beautiful artwork. i will say it sticks to your hands but it peels off. the deal i got on this large quantity is awesome way better than buying it in smaller quantities. i do wish it was sold with a pour spout. i use a ladle to get it out of the container. i would definitely recommend it to anyone looking to try this poured acrylic effect.	1
good price for brand	1
Really fun to make your paint iridescent...Love it!	1
Great as described!	1
great medium	1
Tombow is a great brand	1
good for blending same markers	1
The only thing this blends are gel pens that spit out to much ink. A real bummer	-1
Worked perfectly!  Needed fabric sizing and this product easily dissolved overnight in water, better than I expected.  Will save about 400$ by mixing my own.  I am spreading the word, I am supremely happy with the results.  1/2 tsp in 2 1/2 cups water stirred, then let sit overnight.  Transferred to spray bottle.  Wonderously cheaper and I can make a batch stiffer or lighter as desired.	1
Wow, a whole new medium to expand my gourd painting  and canvas art! Can be applied over dried colors. or mixed with colors in varying brightness as desired. Makes a wonderful iridescent sheen.  Great product!!	1
great items	1
I love this	1
Works really well thinning acrylic paints and helps the paint hold its integrity.  Didn't want to over-dilute with water and this products is a great substitute for - agua.  If you paint in acrylics - this is a terrific product to extend your paints without the worry of it breaking down and flaking.  I like creating washes so this really works nicely for me.  Hope this helps.	1
Initially I was impressed by how well this blender worked with my watercolor markers. I used it twice (just the fat end) and set it aside for a couple of weeks while I was busy with other things. I attempted to use it again and it barely worked.  The thin side - which I never opened - was dried out. I tried a little water but it damaged the paper. Maybe I might have better luck with another one but I'm reluctant to try again. Very disappointing.	-1
I may have expected this to work differently.  The best measure to blend is to use a dry erase board then work with the reduced intensity colors to blend as you go on the page.  Any other tips for making this work better would be greatly welcomed.  I  use it enough that I would definitely buy another one!	1
Very satisfied with this product.	1
Great pen	1
Perfect and as described	1
love this, goes well with all the other tombow pens	1
I love this, the dual brush is such a deal!	1
Pretty pricey, but perfect w/ blending w/ watercolor pencils also, love it! Quicker to use then using water pen.	1
Very good.	1
Excellent blender tool, love the dual tips - brush and pen.  Perfect for blending water based inks and watercolor pencils.  Highly recommended	1
This is a very cool medium that once practiced, can produce some very unique results. Wonderful for abstract experimentation.	1
Good basic inexpensive product.	1
Good product at excellent price. Fast shipping. Will buy from again!	1
Acrylic paints flow with this medium.  Also seems to lift dried acrylic slightly when I change my mind.	1
Liquitex is the master of all things are they not? Had a lot of fun thinning paint for washes with this medium. Very effortlessly the most stubborn paint becomes when mixed with a dab of this. I love the archival quality as unlike water it won't spread out the binders. It's a must have basic.	1
very good	1
Loved it	1
Great brush. I found it cheaper at a craft store but if u don't have a craft store in your town buy it here. Comparable to other brands like Princeton and zen brushes. I use it for gouache paintings and some India ink.	1
I owned one, love it for flat wash in watercolor.  Bought two for my students to enjoy.	1
Very nice paint brush!  Also works well for glitter projects!	1
The handle paints started to came off from brush handle after few used. It get to the point that it is everywhere when I am painting. Brush is okay not supper impressive compared to others.	-1
good	1
This is a very nice brush especially for painting small details. Plus its easy to clean.	1
I ordered this and received 1 brush in the requested size. I bought the #0000 'Series 111 Round' option to paint table top miniatures. I paint on canvases normally and have never had the need for anything that was this tiny. The details that this size can accomplish is insane. The quality of the brush is great and I have not had any issues with loose bristles. It holds a good amount of paint. I have used it for acrylics Easy to clean, easy to use. Good size brush handle and the color of the handle is nice too. I highly recommend this brush for miniature detail painting.	1
As described	1
Performed as expected but turned out to be not what I thought I wanted. My bad. I did better mixing Soft Moulding Paste and Soft Gel.	1
You can find more sheets of paper for less money in similar paper products, but not of this quality. Those inexpensive pads are adequate for younger children; we all know how they often enjoy scribbling one line per page and then tossing the unfinished "work" ... or pasting it to the fridge AS IS!  Daddy's little budding artists ... lol ...  But this Strathmore product is definitely for the more advanced artist who wants a sketch that s/he can frame, if desired.  This paper is of a higher quality in an aesthetic cream color, appropriate for highlighting details of the artist's best illustrations.  Since each pad contains twenty-four 80lb. acid-free sheets per spiral-bound pad, that's approximately six sheets per dollar.  What a bargain!  Reviewed by: Betty Dravis, 2008	1
Great brush.	1
I've had no problem with these brushes.  I already had a couple of them and got some for my daughter also who is wanting to learn watercolor painting.	1

it was packaged securely and arrived on time.  I just love this brush and it has become my favorite.	1
Not to much to say about it. It tiny glass beads in white base. You can build it up as much as you like.	1
This not only thins heavy body paint, it also stretches it out so that it lasts longer and takes less each time.  I have used water to think heavy body paint up until now, but this is better!!	1
gives a minor pearl effect and wet look to what you paint.	1
really helps with blending and shading.	1
Works great to turn acrylic paint into fabric paint	1
Great.	1
Just as I expected.	1
I bought his to use with my acrylic inks to get them to flow more like watercolor but so I didn't have to add water and weaken the color.  It works amazingly well and I use it in my art journal and paintings all the time.  Great collection to your acrylic medium stash	1
Works great to turn any paint into an iridescent color. I will continue to buy this! Great Stuff!	1
Excellent place to buy fast delivery, item as illustrated, and good price, is what we all expect when making a purchase.	1
Nice, not quite the same quality as some of the other winsor and newton brushes, but it arrived on time and in good condition.	1
Excellent brush for detail work as well as larger areas. I use it for gouache and it gets into lot of teeny places and produces smooth accurate edges. No dripping or clumping of fibers. Will last a long time with proper care. Your work will look twice as good with half the effort. Cleans up easily with lukewarm water. Not a great price here on Amazon, check retail outlets.	1
This is my go-to for a good-sized (eight by ten inches; 12 x 25 cm) sketch pad for random sketching, doodling, and Urban Sketching.  There are finer grains out there, but this one takes well to my "wandering" pencil and color pencils -- and it's still quite cheap.  The lack of spiral binding is a plus, too.	1
Great drawing pad.	1
Lots of artist people to buy for. They love these beautiful pads of paper and so do I.	1

Oh my gosh! I love this medium. It's all I want to work in a present. The hard thing was getting the top off, but I wrote to the Liquitex people for help. I was told to remove the tabs and use a flat screwdriver to pry off the lid. I have two more coming, so that's what I'll do. I had to get my studio handyman to open it for me. I shall not be thwarted in using this delightful medium!	1

First time user, so might has been a user error. However, I didn't get great results. I followed the directions, and the paint part went well. But the after it dried the fabric was very, very stiff and unfortunately not able to be washed easily. Probably won't be attempted the painting fabric thing again. Let me add that I am an extremely crafty person. Where I do use acrylic paints ALL the time, I've never painted fabric before. I didn't care for MY results to reuse.	-1
I used it with acrylic paint and for me it dosnt make enough of a difference for me to buy it again.	-1
Used this product on  100 hundred percent cotton. Left the fabric stiff and scratchy.  I was really disappointed. My intention was to use this for painting on baby quilts.  Tried on other cotton blends same result. Won't use it again.	-1
Very scratchy paper, not a good paper to practice on.	-1
I wanted something that would slow my drying time and make my acrylics behave more like oil paints. ...I was happy the first ten minutes of use. It was smooth and buttery, like oil paints. But then, after it dried, I went to do a second layer over the top (very common painting practice) and the underlay of paint just came scraping off in odd round strips and balls. It was so disheartening. I had worked for several hours and days on the painting. It was completely ruined.  Then-- I noticed something that had almost the exact same name and packaging! It was Liquitex Slow Dry Blending Gel Medium!! You can use as much as you want on your painting and it made everything look and behave like oil paints, so buttery and silky beautiful! --That was just what I had hoped to find the first time. Here is a link to the better item on Amazon:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Liquitex-Professional-Slow-Dri-Blending-Gel-Medium-16-oz/dp/B001URYIOG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Liquitex Professional Slow-Dri Blending Gel Medium, 16-oz</a>  Good luck, friends! I hope this helps you to make a more informed decision than I did. :-) I wish someone had told me this before I had purchased. ....Be well ~	-1
Unfortunately, this product is pearlescent and not iridescent. Thinking that perhaps I'd received a bottle from a failed batch, I called Liquitex to ask and they confirmed that the product is, in fact, pearlescent and not iridescent. Why it's misnamed, I have no idea, and the lady on the phone seemed a bit baffled about it, too. If you're looking for something to impart an iridescent quality to your work, you'll need to look elsewhere. If you're looking for a pearlescent effect, this is the (misnamed) product for you!	-1
The making fluid is awesome, but but it alone and not with this nib. The nib is crappy and didn't even last one project.	-1
I am not sure how to star this product.  the product itself is fine, no problems with it, always have used them  however this package of pencils arrived in a sealed envelope and the pencil package itself was opened and only had 3 pencils in it.  There is no way this could not have been seen by the reject putting it in the envelope.  That person should be reprimanded I waited far too long for these to arrive as well  the entire shebang was a dissapointment..  thanks for  nothing.  so now I have to wait even longer to get another set to begin my project	-1
Could not get it to stoke correctly.  Went through all plastic holders would not work correctly.  Don't know if the fastener was defected	-1
Not the machine from the 70's ... I'm a bit like Sheldon from the 'big bang ' show .... I read the instructions faithfully. Then I watched the you tube video. I inserted perfectly, heard the plastic fastener 'click' into position in the machine. I pulled on the fabric to tighten it as in the you tube video. The twin needles can only handle button needs for shirts. Forget any type of pants at all unless you have button fastening needs on your 'jammi-type yoga pants like' jeans. Oh how wonderfully the old one from long ago worked .....	-1
The clips are too short and the anchors are to small to hold in heavy work clothes	-1
Can't figure out how to use it & the directions that come with it are a joke. You need a magnifying glass to read it in the 1st place.	-1
This product is not satisfactory for attaching buttons on any clothing that pulls on the button.  I used it precisely as instructed and the button (trouser waist button) continuously pulls free. I am not a tailor/seamstress; however, I believe that this product is only satisfactory for buttons that are not stressed in any manner by clothing's pulling on the button: such a shirt button; however, a collar button or waist attachment button, etc. is not in the realm of this product.  Such buttons need to be hand or machine sewed onto the clothing.  I sent it back using Amazon's amazing return procedure and was refunded immediately.	-1
This barely works on thing, single layer fabric. On any thick or layered fabrics It won't work- the plastic fasteners break and fall off upon pushing the button down. This is not like the original buttoner that came out well over 30 years ago.	-1
waste of money	-1
Will work for cotton shirts or any lightweight fabric. However if you need to put a botton back quickly on a pair of slacks or a jacket these attachments are too small to go through the layers. Channels of Buttoneer are too narrow for attachments so I have had to push them in. Push slowly to move them through fabric. Have not been able to attach a button as these are too small to accommodate.	-1
When this item arrived, the bottom of the OEM packaging was open, allowing the packages of buttons and fasteners to easily fall out.  Following the instructions, I loaded a fastener strip, which only has 2 fasteners per strip, into the Buttoneer.  As I did, I noticed that the fasteners had the consistency of silicon rubber...way too flexible to hold anything.  I removed the cover off the needles (2), I first attempted to fasten a button to fabric...didn't work.  Tried again...didn't work.  I looked at what could possibly be failing and decided it was the flexible fasteners that were at fault.  The Buttoneer wasn't cutting the fasteners...it was stretching them until they broke.  Tried another time and I watched as the fastener just stretched and didn't fasten anything.  This gadget will never work using a flexible fastener. My recommendation...don't even consider buying this product...it doesn't even deserve a one star rating!	-1
JUNK.	-1
Sounds good in theory. In practice, the Buttoneer works for light thicknesses of cloth. For heavier thicknesses, like a collar button, or denim jeans, the device is not able to push the needle and little nylon button retainer through the fabric. I found this device far too limited in application to get much use out of it.	-1
Tough to work on jeans	-1
Very disappointed in this product..Is Not the original product, and fasteners are so tiny that it is imposible to fasten anything with it let alone fasten a button..	-1
Save your money. Even if you can get the button on with this, takes practice, they will not stay on. After 3 times on the same button, yes I found it 3 times, I gave up!	-1
this is not your old buttoneer this has thin small fastners that do not hold buttones on you can not buy heavier fastners, the old buttoneers you could put a button on a coat not this one, it doesn't hold a button on double cotton fabic sorry i brought this is NOT the original	-1
A great idea, BUT: Not-trivial learning curve, difficult to use, and the plastic stays break frequently when you're trying to inset them. Not worth the trouble.	-1
Got the job done of freshening up the place the way that only bees wax can... But really poor quality wax! Got some on me and it was like trying to get burning plastic off me.	-1
This is not a good choice for most applications, it can be oil fed but the cutting head is of poor quality, lacks control short life on cutting wheel	-1
I purchased this product for an experienced origami artist thinking the foil would be ideal for folding and holding the crease, plus the beauty of the colored foil.  When the gift was opened and the first fold was made, it was apparent that the foil square did not hold a crease well and thus defeated the purpose of future folds.  It probably would be better suited for cutting die cuts or embossing but not the precise folds needed for origami projects.	-1
This is smaller than it looks like, it is really tiny. Plus, it looks cheap and since the focus is not adjustable, you might need to get as close as having your nose touching the subject.	-1
It seems weird that a well known company would put their name on this loupe.  The focal point is right in the center and very small. Most of the lens space is wasted.  Before retirement I used this same brand to inspect tiny surface mount electronic components and it worked great.  What happened?	-1
The package was suspect from the get go.  Then I opened the weak frosted plastic to find that the Cricut points had been taken out, the sticker over the cartridge had been peeled off and the booklet was wet!  Truly someone had used and abused this and sent it as NEW!  HA! HA! HA! Jokes on me and what a lousey present!	-1
Like the album. Came on time. I only gave it  2 stars because it had small particles in the plastic cover. One of them looked like it possibly could of been as bug? Hmmmm?	-1
I was very disappointed with the cut of this scissor. I need precision cutting all the way to the tip for my cardmaking/papercrafting, so thought the small size would be helpful in making detailed cuts. It was not. The tip end didn't snip, just kind of gave out by the end of the scissors. Tried cutting ribbon, but it frayed the ribbon edges and didn't work with that either. I do like the non-stick coating since I use lots of adhesives in my papercrafting, so I kept them to use for cutting sticky papers. I definitely would not buy again.	-1
I was happy for the beads I did get (which was only 10 of the colors) the other half of the order I did not receive. Amazon gave me a refund for the amount of the order I did not get but I find it frustrating that I should have had to gone through this at all.	-1
I love Derwent but this is hurting my feelings. When you save your money and then get a damaged product. This box was not damaged on the outside so it was packed and shipped knowing it was damaged. Pictures included. I am so sad and disappointed.	-1
I just received these pencils today and took them for a brief trial run just to see how the colors lay down. They incredibly soft and if you want a deep color just apply more pressure as you color. I've read a few complaints about them breaking during sharpening so, I'll have to update my review once I've sharpened a few of them.  **REVIEW UPDATE **  I really want to love these pencils because at initial use they seemed great, but after attempting to color with them they fell flat. They look like crayons on paper and it's nearly impossible to overcome that appearance. I also noticed after 24 hours there was a horrible wax bloom. They're going back!	-1
This should be good pencils but the color breaks way too easy! With almost no pressure they break. Was very disappointed!	-1
#1. This product is titled, SKINTONE PENCILS. I don't know any humans with skin any of these colors, so if you are an adult coloring book colorist, take a pass on this set. The product should be titled DO IT YOURSELF SKINTONE KIT.  #2. Although I did notice that the cores were 4mm, the description did not say that these pencils were a non-standard diameter (and round  but the picture is dark  at least it is on my monitor) and that you had to use their minimal (no shaving catcher) sharpener to sharpen them. (So these pencils are not practical to take with you for coloring in public because of the mess. The pencils are oversized for other sharpeners  too large for the pencil hole and way too small for the crayon hole  although I often use the crayon hole to give myself a second sharp point on a regularly sized pencil I am using, so I don't loose the length of the pencil that a long tapered re-sharpening would entail.  #3. One pencil came with a broken off point  the lead was broken off way down inside the wood and by the time I got a sharp point on it (that matched the points on the other pencils) the one I had to sharpen was 1-1/2 shorter than the others.  #4. I have inexpensive colored pencils sets of 120, 72, 48, 36, 24, 12 and 10 colors. In the larger sets there are pencils that are closer to the colors of human skin than any of these Derwent Skintone Pencils and I don't have to blend them  perhaps just add a highlight or blush here and there. These pencils, advertised as Skintone necessitate total blending since none of them are people colored. You are better off, for the price, just investing in one of the larger sets of inexpensive pencils unless you are an artist doing portraiture. In fact, in both the 72 and 120 pencil sets I have there is a pencil that is almost perfect for Caucasians, only needing a bit of blush for the ladies!  #5. Proof Positive that these pencils are not people colored? Not a single one has a skintone name.	-1
Not a fan	-1
do not color good	-1
Pencils are too large, Shades are not as I expected.	-1
I was looking for a nice creamy pencil similar to Prismacolor because the cores kept breaking.  I found this set of Derwent colosoft 72 pencil set.  The came nicely packaged and protected but upon opening the tin the wood casings were all different colors and were scratchy to the touch - before I even colored with one - and they weren't even uniform in amount of wood showing on each pencil.  I used four of the pencils and even sharpened them with their sharpener and the cores started breaking .  They also leave a chalky residue which has to be blown away or risk ha info little bits of color where it doesn't belong..  I own Derwent's Inktense and have not had a problem with them YET.  The wood on the Inktense seems to be a better quality and I am hoping that as I use them the cores don't break.	-1
I really wanted to like these colored pencils and bought them since the reviews said great things. In my opinion the item didn't meet my expectations especially as an artist quality brand. I've used derwent art supplies in the past but first time trying their colored pencils. Pros: nice case, pre sharpened, nice color selection Cons: poor color saturation (unless you firmly push down), uneven coverage without taking a blender pencil to the area, flimsy plastic tray inside, the colors displayed on the ends do not match the color on the page by a long shot and this was my biggest gripe. Yes I should have tested the colors but I feel as though artist colored pencils should depict their product accurately. Why color the ends if they do not match what's really inside the pencil? I wasn't happy with these so I returned them.	-1
I wanted to like these pencils much more than I do. They have great reviews, for the most part, but I honestly wish I hadn't bought them. So far, the only color that performs to my preference is the Deep Cadmium (yellow). While the pencils are a bit larger in diameter than my Prismacolors (and I do like that feature), the lay-down of color leaves a lot to be desired - as does the blendability. The orange in particular lays down uneven color, super waxy with little blobs of pigment, and doesn't blend well at all. I have used Prismcolors, Koh-I-Noor woodless Progresso, Koh-i-Noor Hardmuth, Blick, SoHo Urban Artist, and Prang pencils very steadily for the last six months or so, and I honestly would put these Derwents on the same level as the garbage Rose-Art and Crayola colored pencils. They simply do not live up to the reputation. I thought it was just me, but I recently came across a professional artist's review of these pencils on YouTube, and she had the same complaints as I did. If you are going to invest in colored pencils, I would not recommend Derwent Coloursoft.	-1
Used the entire bar on a jacket, but it is still not as water resistant as I was hoping. The water soaks right in and doesnt bead off like I anticipated. I may need to do another few coats, but wouldnt repurchase this brand. It took quite a bit of time, but wasn't too messy.	-1
This white does not show up well on any color paper it seems.  Disappointed.	-1
This ink was vary faint, not nearly as opaque as I thought it would be. Might be good for background accents, but not bold sentiments.	-1
Maybe it's just my pad, but this ink could not be used because the rubber stamps would draw too much ink and the design was lost in the clumps.	-1
Too heavy and clumsy for me. Sent it back.	-1
came with all colors completely dry.	-1
I find this product difficult to use compared to other double-back tape.	-1
Just some paper and design ideas.  Nothing special.	-1
Hard to do.	-1
These came so banged up and broken I can't even tell what color is supposed to be what  weird because I got a different set as well, came in the same package, and the other one is fine	-1
The condition in which I received this order told me that mail order was probably not the best way to get this. It is literally a chalky mess. The colors are gorgeous but I will try to find a replacement locally.	-1
Can't believe I fell for this. When I received it, I realized that I was just paying for shredded construction paper.	-1
THIS ARRIVED IN VERY POOR CONDITION. THE CHALKS WERE ALL CRACKED AND LOOKED OLD. I'VE PURCHASED OTHERS OF THIS BRAND AND THEY WERE FIND, BUT WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THE PASTELS AT THIS TIME.	-1
Missing parts so unable to assemble	-1
this thing is a piece of crap, BROKE before I could even use it. when you tighten in the screws even oif you be very careful not to over tighten the wood splits down the middle so you are left with a easle that cannot hold itself up let alone a canvas for you to paint on. even for the price I at least thought i would have something I could use a few times. this is the first time i've ever had a problem with anything through amazon. and if you are for a replacement, they leave it all up to you to ship and return since I don't have a printer to print off the return label. so a waste all around, this thing isn't fit to build a fire with, DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY PPL!	-1
I've grown sort of disgusted with the Copic price. Copics sell for just three dollars where they are made. And they were imported into the United States. That was the excuse for the 8 dollar per marker price. But that's just not an excuse any more. The markers are made in countries all around the world now so they don't have to be imported. But the price is so high. I just went to a show and was just chatting with the guy and he commented what a good value the refills are. And I guess I felf disgusted because I have about five dried out copic markers. They used to last for years without drying out but these were dry in less than two years. I only have about twenty pro square style copic markers and usually only use the set of grays.  But lets say you buy a set of 72 like this and you want the refills count on paying 800 dollars to keep them all running.  I just think its awful and there is not excuse for it.  We can see comparable markers being sold on Amazon for just 50 cents each with great reviews. They don't have as extensive a selection of colors. The quality control is slightly yes. But the color and flow on the cheap ones are great. The problem is the copics are likely made for 5O cents or less as well. Its exploitive. The wine industry hit a crisis because people were realizing really expensive wine was not that much better than the reasonably priced stuff. They dropped a lot of their wines under ten dollars again and some for 5 dollars and below. Here's hoping people will buy some of these cheap sets and realize Copics arent' eight dollars better.  Blick Art Studio markers have a brush and fine tip comparable to the Copic for just three dollars.  But people will reply...well if you want the best you have to pay the price to get it and its worth it.  But the truth is if these are three dollars where they are sold they are worth three bucks. They have psyched themselves into Rolls Royce pricing and like wine its more about the mystique and prestige.	-1
After hours of work I used these markers to put the final touches on the project. The marker splatter out a huge blot and ruined the entire thing. Can not say how disappointing these markers are.	-1
Copic Markers are just the same as the Magic Markers you can buy at Staples or Wal-Mart.  Save your money.	-1

I have run into a problem with the markers unexpectedly leaving a large blob of ink.! These markers are too expensive to accept a defective product. I will be looking forward to a remedy.	-1
These markers will leave a blob of ink unexpectedly and ruin your artwork. I am upset about this and will be looking for a remedy.	-1
I am a bit upset, even tho I like the product and was happy with the fairly quick delivery, the marker will leave a blob! Unexpectedly! For the cost of this product, no defects are acceptable.	-1

Don't waste your money!  These markers are absolutely not worth the money! They bleed outside the lines, I've had a couple of markers 'throw up', literally drip ink, and create large blots on the page. The brush tips are not capable of handling intricate, finely detailed designs. I was going to return them, except I can't do that due to the special handling that would require.	-1
Arrived five weeks before expected. Very pleased!! UPDATE!!! The Markers are all drying up. I am very upset with this. I barely use them and they are kept near me  inside the container they came in with the lid on. I cannot afford to spend so much on something I cannot use.	-1
I had not tried these art markers previously. They arrived with the plastic container cracked. As I wasn't going to use it, I did not worry about that. However, some of the markers appeared already dried out. As this was my first try with this brand, I had nothing to compare it to, but based on this, I probably would try another brand.	-1
Do yourself a favor. If you are going to buy this, put a dab of superglue on the inside of the end without the hook. That way, the metal hook won't slide out, pop-out and lose forever that plastic cork, and eventually you won't stab yourself with the rough metal end, slicing your finger and forever ruining your mother's white cashmere scarf you're knitting.	-1
Not a fan of this yarn.  It feels coarse, and the skein was a mess. The color was a garish shade bearing no resemblance to the photo. I'll use it for flower parts for applique, but I will not purchase Bernat Satin again.	-1
It's hardly even black. I mean it shades to black, but a good 50-70% of the line is this neutral gray bleckiness, I don't know if I got a bad batch or what, but as it stands, don't buy this ink if you want anything remotely close to black	-1
I ordered this as a Amazon PRIME item and had purchased one bottle of it previously that I was pleased with. I ordered this one as a gift. One part of buying inks is the packaging. This ink was in a very nice heavyweight glass bottle...something that is important feature with inks that helps with them NOT BEING TIPPED OVER when filling. Also there is the artistic side of the bottle...a huge part of their marketing. I was VERY SURPRISED to just open my package and find a WHITE PLASTIC BOTTLE inside the usual white Noodler's box. I am severely disappointed in this feature and hope NOODLERS will rectify this if it was their move. I am wondering if it was done by the party I bought it from on Amazon. Their store name is JUNIPER> so buyers be aware of this very recent change... it is NOT A GOOD MOVE! Ink hopefully will still be of same quality. I a personally wondering if it is a knock off though.	-1
This ink is absolutely not waterproof. Even after allowing it to dry for several hours on high quality art paper, a light water wash caused the ink to bleed and run. I also had problems with the ink clogging my pen. One complete waste of money.	-1
Ink is not waterproof to any degree even on recommended paper. The ink will immediately start to fall apart when it comes in contact with water. See picture.	-1
Really disappointed in this ink. Came in a crappy plastic bottle, and it smudged and smeared terribly.	-1
This ink is not fully waterproof. The ink fades terribly when used as lineart for watercolor pictures. I can't give it one star, because I do enjoy the way the ink looks and feels in my pen. It's a good ink for certain uses, but not fully waterproof when applying a wash or using watercolor paints. I enjoy using this to write with and for drawing, but I ruined some large drawings once I put the paint to the paper.	-1
This is not waterproof. Many have said it takes a long time to dry, but when I added watercolor over a drawing done 3 weeks earlier, it still bled - not just a little, but completely melting like a water-soluble ink.	-1
Not waterproof. Description says. "Resists.. moisture, ... water exposure, etc.". This is by no means "waterproof".  I'll give two stars because the only thing in the description they got right is that it's 'ink', and black in color. Product should be renamed to "Eternal, unless it gets wet". Lesson learned.	-1
I bought this for a fountain pen that I bought from Amazon. However, a friend cautioned me about using this product for my high end fountain pens. I spent $150 on one pen...I had better chose the correct ink. I would have returning this if I still had the packaging. It's being donated.	-1
I purchased this ink thinking it would be perfect for sketching before watercolor washes. It seems to lay on top of the paper and runs after drying it for a day. It's a bit glorpy in consistency. I'm not seeing all the great things people have said about this ink.	-1
boxing and presentation great. Just not what I want to use	-1
Construction paper.  Not a good buy.	-1
What happened to Prismacolor? Chalk was broke in package and its just not the quality I remember this brand to be.	-1
That if you buy this online from anywhere, many pieces of these long thin pastels will be broken.  Prismacolor went for the cheapest way to house these pastels:  flimsy cardboard and cheap plastic inserts rather than foam inserts.  Oh yes, there was one flimsy piece of foam between the 2 layers of pastels but that was about it.  There's hardly any other insulation to act as buffer to protect the pastels inside its case during shipping.  That's the manufacturer's fault.  When I received my set of 96, the box was still sealed with plastic.  Nice.  But upon opening the box and seeing what was inside was something horrific -- pastel dust everywhere, pastels in 2, 3, and 4 pieces with only about a dozen of the 96 sticks surviving intact.  So unless Prismacolor comes up with a more reliable, sturdier and more secure housing for this set, DO NOT BUY THIS LARGE SET.  I would have gladly paid more money for a better box really if it meant most of the pastels arrived whole. But if you must, purchase a smaller set first, as the smaller sets somehow seem to make it through shipping far better than this large set.  These pastels are also available open stock where you can buy them individually at some art stores online or locally.  But if you still want to invest your money and buy this large set online, go ahead but be warned and prepare to be disappointed when you open the box.	-1
At least a third of the box was broken some pieces were crumbled. I returned the box. Gave it two stars because it's a great product but I don't want them broken before I use them. I want to be able to just split them in half. The foam was missing from the box so I suspect that had a lot to do with it. I have a box of 12 I bought locally and even after use they are not broken. Not sure weather to order again and take my chances on getting an intact box.	-1
These Prismalcolor Nupastel (set of 24) are no different in color, texture as described - than the same set I bought 5-7 years ago. They're described as being harder than the previous Prismacolor art stix or pastels, so they don't break as easy, however they are not even as pretty, the selection is slightly different and not as vibrant as the older colors, they break just as easy if not easier - they quality is no better than the same box (different box style) than the set of 24 I bought a few years ago. As a matter of fact the older box contained silver while this one does not.  If you've used these pastels before and expect anything better - don't buy these. They are they same with  less color variation, less vibrancy and they break even easier. The only thing "new" is the the box they're in now. I'd submit a photo however there is no longer that option here in "Reviews" for some reaaoon	-1
I returned the pastels because the packaging was inadequate to protect the pastels.  The interior of the wrapping was covered with chalk dust and when I opened the box, almost all of the chalks were broken.  Sorry, but when I pay $75 for something I don't want it broken.  Thank goodness Amazon has a buyer protection plan!	-1
You to get a wide selection of different peaces here, but none that match up enough to use them.	-1
This is a flimsy version of Kraft Paper. I don't see how you could wrap anything unless you go around it multiple times because the paper will surely rip.  I wanted to cut it down to size and print some things on it first but it is too thin to go through the printer and if it does, it comes out all crinkled just from being handled. I am veryyyyyy displeased with the item and will now have to find something to do with the entire roll since I can't use it how I had hoped.  I guess I shouldn't have ordered sight unseen.  The seller was quick and very professional, the product just was a bit deceiving.	-1
The photo shows a set of square rulers. What I received was a large triangle ruler. The ruler is fine, I do like the Omnigrid rulers, but I was really wanting the small square set.	-1
the pins are light weight.  Bend easily.  Plastic head chipped and very sharp.  What happened to quality stuff from Singer.	-1
Not happy with these. The plastic end comes off real easy	-1
Believe it when they say it. The picture means nothing. The box was full of black and red scraps. I'm fine with the black, but really? No other natural colors? Just this awful bright red that will be going straight in the trash.	-1
Horrible To be a good sharpener	-1
I just bought my Cricut and I do not have this tool and see no need for it.  I have fingernails!  And if it gets as gooey as people say then it is scraping the stickiness off the mats, which is one of the major complaints about mats:  they lose their stickiness way too soon.  I will not be buying this.	-1
I really liked the spatula tool when I first got it. It's a lot better than trying to use my fingernails to get the paper off the sticky mat. But if the paper is delicate, or a delicate design, it crinkles the paper, and doesn't keep it nice. I also feel that it scrapes off some of the stickiness of the mat, so it doesn't last as long. Later I bought the cricut 'tool set' (not sure if that's exactly what it's called) but I like it a TON better! The tools are smaller and work Great! If I would have known, I would have bought those only and not the spatula at all.	-1
These punches are poor quality; but you get what you pay for I suppose.  The first punch caught/ snagged on itself at the very top of the circle and would lock because the cutting wedges weren't aligned. It made it very difficult to punch holes without a tremendous amount of force (I got blisters on my palms from wrestling with it so much). It eventually, after only about 100 punches, snapped at the hinges below the handle.  The second one I ordered had the cutting plates aligned properly, but still snapped at the hinges below the handle just as the first one had; I managed about 200 punches out of this one before it died.  I'm sure they'd be perfect for small jobs, one punch here, another there, but if you plan on using it heavily, I advise you look elsewhere.	-1
Don't stay on .	-1
Flimsy. Broke fast. Skip these.	-1
If I could give a no star rating I would.  These are uncomfortable and slide around.  Wore for a couple of days and took them off.  It snagged on clothes, pinched my skin.  I watched the YouTube video on how to put them on too.	-1
I read all the reviews that said it needed to be for small rings. Mine was. By the time I mangled the second one trying to get it on, I tossed the third one. Don't waste your money.	-1
I was so excited that they connected and was happy to find them since I needed to make something large.  But after the first use, they were warped and didn't connect evenly any more.  I returned and got my money back.	-1
Boyfriend bought this for me well over a year ago. Used it once. Have attempted to use it several times since and every time I remember why it was put away. The wing nuts hurt like heck to tighten, and the dowels are cut to where other does NOT hold fabric right on the middle. When you try to tighten, the fabric just slips out in the middle regardless of what you do. Would love to get back to two handed stitching...	-1
I received mine timely but it is really badly constructed, the indentation don't line up and it is skewed so that the two sides don't line up either.	-1
back leg moves even after tightening	-1
NOT adjustable! The leg goes waaaaay back, making it way too wide for my table. I've tried adjusting the angle of the leg. NOT happening. Totally unusable. HATE IT.  PS I earned degrees in art. I make things. I fix things. I know how to adjust a wingnut.  Don't know if worth contacting Amazon about a return. Did I mention it's TOTALLY not functional? Not for painting, displaying anything, nothing. Totally unreliable. HATE IT. Extremely disappointed.  Ordered a bamboo easel from another vendor.	-1
sooooooo smalllllllllll omg	-1
Bristles very frazzled. It's this how it should normally look? All the other pictures I see if these they are very sharp.	-1
It only has two positions to choose from.  The picture show three different punch possibilities to make.  The embossing doesn't  show up when the punch is used, so this selection is worthless.	-1
i purchased this mat because i needed a good all purpose self healing mat. this one seemed affordable so i grabbed it without doing much research. after a few uses, i'm looking to purchase a new one. i like the size but it's kind of flimsy. the edges are curling up so it doesn't lie flat at all and the holes at the top and sides take away from the cutting surface and are useless to me. next time, i'll go for one that has a sturdier backing.	-1
I needed this staple circle cut out and I'm very disappointed in the results. It cuts 3/4 of it nice and clean punch out, then it gets stuck and tears the end off. Over and over again this happens even with different paper. Now I have to go back in with a scissor for a clean cut. Waste of time and effort.	-1
defective punch....not even one circle was punched....	-1
This review is for the Extra Large Circle Punch.  I'm extremely disappointed in this product. I tried to use it cut out 2" circles from regular printer paper and it totally failed. First, you have to line it up so you only have about 1/8 of paper at the bottom of the punch (I found this annoying as I was trying to cut our a bunch of pictures printed on an 8 1/2 x 11 sheet of paper).  But the main reason I found this product to be terrible is that it did not cleanly cut out a 2" circle. It cut out the top of the circle ok (not perfectly cleanly), and then the bottom of the circle was torn-looking.  This is not a case of operator error, as there is one way to squeeze it. The paper was cut out, just not well. I had to use a scissors to cut out the circle the rest of the way.  There is a chance my product was defective, as I have other Fiskars punches that are fine, but I suspect that this is too big of a circle for a squeeze punch and that it is just a poorly designed or executed product.  I'm returning it and advising you, gentle reader, to avoid this product.	-1
I can not recommend this product. very unstable. The punch from EK tools are much better. I do not buy more punch from Fiskars.	-1
Very primitive!!! Drill bits, broke off with ease.  It difinitly would work on "paper" toilet paper!!!!!!	-1
I gave this as a gift to my grand daughter, and my son informs me that it broke right away.  Not recommended.	-1
From the reviews I think I will like this drill, but I can't use it yet until I get some drill bits.  The drill bits were missing from the drill I got.  At least I thought those empty slots were supposed to have drill bits in them. Maybe I am wrong. Did you other buyers get drill bits with yours?	-1
ok	-1
Really big	-1
WAY over priced and the colors are just BLAHHHHHH.	-1
I'm cutting a thin mylar material.  Should cut easily.  Worked fine for about a dozen, then it only partially cuts where the cut head is lower.  Don't waste your time or money on this.  Fiskars used to make a quality product, no longer.	-1
The design is great.  It's easy to squeeze the handle and punch.  However, if you need to punch anything thinner than card stock, you may have problems.  I used this for card stock and for label paper.  It worked fine on the card stock.  It had a few tears with the label paper.  When I tried to punch regular copy paper, the tear frequency went up dramatically.  I'd say about 30% of the holes had extra tags on them.  There's too much of a gap between the punch and the circular hole.  Copy paper is thin enough to get caught in it.  I gave them two stars because I was able to get a refund.  I tried the other brand hole punch by EK Tools.  Had he same problem with copy paper.  I don't know of a good brand that can punch thinner paper.	-1
The grips are very hard on the hands - not super ergonomically friendly - and the model I purchased had some kind of issue with the die punch where it just couldn't punch a full circle out! It'd always get stuck, and i'd have to pop out the paper circle the rest of the way. Sigh! Results just weren't consistent enough. I wish I had returned the product - it just kind of got left out of my supply rotation and is in a drawer somewhere. Wouldn't recommend this product.	-1
Don't order! It's a piece of Crap! It is not so gentle in the hands as it gets stuck all of the time and it crushes the paper or card stock instead of cutting it.	-1
The plastic bag containing the beads was torn at both the top and the bottom, making me think that this was not a new item as it was described. When I opened the intact mailer, all 1,000 beads came flying out and went all over the floor. If you have ever walked on pony beads, they are akin to marbles. They went everywhere. Under my oven. Under the refrigerator. Under the kitchen island. 1,000 of them. On the floor.	-1
Seemed it would be the perfect punch due to the brand and style. But, each punch was left hooked to the paper and has to be torn off, making an incomplete circle. I would not buy this style again.	-1
after a few months, it does not cut cleanly. I tried all the quick fixes I could find, but ultimately, I end up having to trim with scissors to snip off the parts this punch leaves on. I don't know if they are only used for a few months and its common to have to rebuy these every few months but I didn't use it much and it's currently at the back of my craft drawer not being used.	-1
this punch did not make a clean cut on even the most light weight paper and the embossing was barely visible.	-1
The desing does not work when its punched out.	-1
i hate it	-1
Not very big, and impossible to see on the edges of the papers.	-1
A kind of dissapointed, the bag does not include green color beads,	-1
It is VERY difficult to get off the roll. I had to pull, hard, using pliers, to get a length of 8" and then it broke. Does anyone know a better product?	-1
I got the wrong size of beads so I returned it!	-1

Packaging (wrinkled) was so cheaply made that made me think the beads were the same. I had to return.	-1
Both packaging and item are cheaply made! Delivered in a nice box but when I opened the plastic packaging was torn apart and beads were everywhere. I had to return.	-1
I received Tarnish Resistant Wire instead of Non-Tarnish. I will buy another brand next time. So I can get the description promised. Very sad with the stuff received.	-1
these are 9mm pony beads ,and they kinda glow in the dark , but not very good or very long . i was buying glow in the dark beads from jolly store and they cost more ,but they really glow ,these beads barely glow at all . i mean even when left in full sun for 4 hours they glowed 11 minutes , compared to the jolly store beads that glowed for 1.5 hours . i bought these for the glowing effect and they are poor . i gave them to the neighbor girl . 2 stars .	-1
Light weight and not the amont I was expecting for the price.	-1
They do not glow in the dark even after being in sunlight all day. But they are pretty. They aren't brightly colored but more pastel.	-1
This item did not work (defective), and I cannot get a hold of anyone to return it and get a refund :-(	-1
This is for the large, 1.5 inch model. I can't get it to cut but only to tear, and it will not cut all the way through. It's a great size. I wish it would work.	-1
Doesn't cut anything stronger than regular paper. Worthless	-1
Awful, awful, awful. Do not buy unless you don't care that there's no gutter at all. You have to have the punch right on top of the item to be punched because there's no way to push the punch into a card or other piece of paper because it hits the bottom of the punch area.	-1
I was very disappointed in this. I used it for about 45 minutes, then an internal piece broke of and it stopped working completely. I wasn't punching anything thick, either - just single sheets of cardstock. Usually Fiskars is the best brand out there, but it looks like maybe their quality is slipping.	-1
Makes a great circle on paper or card stock. But just one. Put two pieces in and it doesn't close at all.  I trashed the packaging when I opened it because it never occurred to me that it would not punch multiple copies. If I hadn't ruined the package I would return it. I have used another brand that easily punches four pieces.	-1
I have used this product only a couple times.  It cuts horribly on most paper leaving a space that doesn't cut through at all.  It finally quit cutting and got jammed the other day.  i'm trying to see if I can fix it but doubt if it will cut any better if I get it to unjam.  I would not buy this product again.	-1
Do not waste your money in this. While i have a Fiskars corner puncher that works well, this doesnt! it can't even cut a circle on a 80gm paper. it's a total waste of resources! Please manufacture something that can work, the earth is dying and do not need another piece of trash!	-1
This must have been a "something went wrong in the factory" product, because they will hardly cut through cardstock. I've used this exact puncher before, and they have all worked great. I just decided to get a new one, as I like my cuts to be super precise, but this one is a complete waste. I definitely recommend this product and brand, but not from amazon. Go to a local craft store to buy this, and you will be happy with the product!	-1
I was very excited to get this punch after ordering. After delivery & the first time using it, I will admit to being disappointed. It didn't cut out the paper so much as just tear the edges. After a while of using it though I realized it would only punch out craft paper ( if doubled) , nothing thinner or thicker! Anything else results in the paper being torn, the punch sticking, or the paper just getting scored, never properly punched out. This punch has actually broken after only a few weeks of ownership, & even less time of being used because it 'cut'...(please)...so crappily. The overall quality was so flimsy, with the major components being plastic, & only the cutting surfaces & the spring the controlled them being made of metal. I am VERY disappointed in this product & strongly suggest that anyone thinking about purchasing one of these punches takes into consideration the fact that they may be purchasing a new one all too soon.	-1
doesn't cut well. only cuts part of a circle. what a piece of junk! Think I'm going to have to find a different punch. This just doesn't do the job. I made the mistake of purchasing a bigger one, too. Now stuck with something I'm never going to be able to use.	-1
bought this even after buying a shabby pair of Fiskars scissors in hopes the scissors were a fluke.  Not so.  I couldn't get them to punch anything.  Not cardstock, not regular paper.  This punch couldn't punch it's way out of a wet paper bag.  I contacted Fiskars and they sent me a replacement.  The replacement worked in the same manner as the first punch,  not at all.  Purchased and EK Success punch instead and have not regretted it.  Won't be buying anymore Fiskars products.	-1
I bought this punch after having the larger punch.  This one will not cut half of the circle.  On rare occasions it will punch successfully.  I've tried to find something on Fiskar's site but as of yet have been unable to.  I wasted my money & will not buy another.	-1
If you are punching items "stand alone" these are probably okay, although the spread on the handles is almost too wide for my hand to grasp comfortably.  However, for me as a card maker, they are pretty much a loss because the depth is about 1/8" which is no good at all for positioning.  I'll figure out a way to make my circle dies from Spellbinders work.  If you are looking at being able to position a circle cut on the interior of a page, don't get this.	-1
Not liking how the hook looks like, demand my money back	-1
Very flimsy, thin plastic shell, body shape is ugly. Returned.	-1
Too large for my measurements	-1
It's getting the job done, but you should be able to turn the form on the stand without stripping it.  As a result, if you move it you have to push from the bottom or the top comes off and you're left with a mess.  It's hard to adjust, the controls are fiddly and the stupid foam pincushion pops out every time you try to use it.	-1
It was next to impossible to adjust the sizing on this. I had to return it because it literally hurt my fingers to try and turn the dials for the settings. I am not elderly and have no hand or wrist problems. It is just way too hard to turn the dials as they really don't want to move! I was very disappointed.	-1
The action is stiff and sticky. I have several no-names that work better. I use my sharp smooth  full size (no name cheapies) versus these -- and they are still cutting beautifully after a decade. This was a waste of money. Such a profound disappointment. Don't buy these.	-1
This was not sturdy enough for use. The pegs came out easily and it was difficult to thread as a result.	-1
AMAZON SCREWS UP AGAIN BY BUNDLING APPLES AND ORANGES TOGETHER > As is easy to see by reading the other reviews, the reviews of a variety of products have been lumped together here (by Amazon)---so you have no way of knowing which reviews actually refer to the item you want to purchase. > As of the time of this writing (changed since I placed the order 3 weeks ago) the entry title now reads "Domire 50pcs Split Key Chain Ring Connector Keychain with Nickel Plated", which actually only describes the last-to-the-right of 6 photos. > The first of those photos show "split rings", photos 2 through 5 show "key rings" (actually plain rings), and the 6th photo shows a "key chain connector"---three entirely different products. > I ordered "50 Split Rings Nickel Plated 9mm", I received 9mm plain rings.

Ok	-1
The holes are too small.  Makes the backs a wreck getting them on.	-1
Nice but make sure of the size you need.  These are very small and hard to clasp if you are using them for necklaces.  Otherwise they are made well and good qualitiy.	-1
They are hard to open & I found quite a few that are broken.	-1
The Clasps are small	-1
Junk	-1
these clasps are to small hard to work with.	-1
not 10X6, more like 10x5	-1
Maybe a litttle small for what I want, will use later	-1
To little for me	-1
4 mm at best. VERY small. VERY SMALL...	-1
These were Okay. My big problem with these lobster clasps were that many of the clasps were stuck and I could not use them. The ones that did work, worked fine.	-1
These clasps are very nice in appearance, but are of variable quality.  I've thrown away half that I've used.  Problems:  don't close after they're opened, openings too small for jump rings.	-1
I purchased these and after having worked with them for awhile now, have discovered about half of them don't open.  I can understand a few pieces not working but half or better?  Not a good buy.	-1
The color is lovely but I am not happy with them.  They hardly open at all.  The mechanism is of very poor quality.  I would not buy from this seller again.	-1
The Lobster Clasp were beautiful.  They were not 10x6. They were so small I had a hard time opening them. The seem to be for a kids jewelry project.	-1
That's right, in the batch I got, 44 out of 100 were defective and had to be thrown away. UNACCEPTABLE . WOULD NOT RECOMMEND PRODUCT AND, WILL NOT REPURCHASE FROM THIS VENDOR.	-1
I bought this for texturing metals. The hammer is really too light to do any kind of real texturing. Plus the heads start to loosen after the first few hits. I solved that problem by wrapping a piece of masking tape around the threads. But I still don't really have any real use for this hammer now that I have it. It was a waste of money in my opinion.	-1
Hammer is to light. The heads also loosen much to easily.	-1
WARNING !!! THIS PRODUCT IS PLASTIC AND NOT METAL, I'm very disappointed with this product as being falsely advertised as being made of metal. Definitely not worth the money !!!	-1
not very strong	-1
THESE SUCK ALSO!!	-1
great looking but too weak for my needs.	-1
Product description and pictures claim it has a knurled handle, yet the one I received does not.  Looks inferior to the one in the pictures.	-1
this aint stainless steel	-1
Can't read the numbers on this cheap plastic.	-1
This isn't a soldering board!  This does not block heat from passing through it, at all!  On my first (and last) the material beneath it GOT FRIED!!!  The heat went straight through all the little "tunnels" that go all the way through the board - hundreds or thousands of them - straight to the surface beneath it.  It will work as a place to stick pins in to hold your work, as long as you have an ACTUAL soldering board beneath it!!!  This is NOT a soldering board!  False Advertising!  I am returning mine!	-1
This item arrived broke	-1
The price is very low on this for good reason. The plastic sizer cannot be used to stretch out a ring, it very low middle grade plastic, the photo is Very misleading. And I would not buy it for that very reason. The hoops used to size finger looks nothing like the one in the picture. The one that I received is a very cheap plastic ring that when used scrapes the &$),)&@@@$$(/:-),!?', Out of your finger, I check my wife's finger and was no passion for three days. So I checked my finger  same thing. The problem with that is I didn't see any burs on it to file down. I know every year I buy at least one P.O.S item and I would say that this item aside from being nothing like the photo and only based on the product itself, I would rank this one up the with the functionality of the Pet Rock	-1
These are not smooth to cut with.  They have more resistance that what I want for daily use.  Sent them to the garage for my husband.	-1
I just received a contact from the owner of this company.  Not only did she refund my money but REQUESTED THAT I NOT RETURN THE KIT.  I still do not care for the kit but THIS COMPANY HAS SUPERB CUSTOMER SERVICE AND I ENCOURAGE ANYONE TO TRY ANY OF THEIR PRODUCTS. i WOULD LIKE TO CHANGE THE STAR RATING TO 4 BUT AM UNABLE TO DO SO IN THIS EDIT.  I ordered this kit and it was received in about 5 days. Then my trouble began. This is a kit with split dowels through which you pass your canvas then it is tightened. The longer dowels were 1/16"  smaller (doesn't sound like much)and fit too loosely. The side stablilizers could not be tightened enough to hold the canvas.  Another thing, small wing nuts are used as tighteners and, as a senior, caused pain to my hands when trying to screw them tightly. When I tightened the stabilizers, it caused the cross pieces holding the canvas to bow and the canvas slipped out of the center area.	-1
Wings do not tighten all the way and the size of the scrolls is off from the holder I was using prior to purchasing these. Very frustrated by being unable to tighten the wingnuts as I can't get the cloth taut enough to bother using the scroll.	-1
Holes are to big for rods, doesn't hold fabric good and loose on the sides that are not on the rods, also hard to get fabric on the rods.	-1
clunky, confusing, and splintery.	-1
I have never been do utterly disappointed in a product in all my life. I'd previously purchased the handiclamp version, which involves part of a PVC pipe to hold the material. The description stated that it had been sanded to perfection, no raw wood. I assumed all of Edmunds products were of equal quality. I was wrong. A review had stated that it was as if someone was in their living room, buzzing a saw down wood to make a quick buck. A most accurate description. The wood was raw, unfinished. I got splinters everywhere. After purchasing sand paper, I stood for over an hour, trying to polish it. when that was done, I slipped in the fabirc. What a joke. The wing nuts clamped the edges, but left everything else open. It didn't even clamp down the rods. They spun freely, falling out. They certainly weren't going to keep fabric taut. I immediately returned them (VERY impressed with Amazon's return policy, BTW.) I ordered another set of handiclamps, as well as extra rods that were 24 inches. 100% pleased with the quickness of that order. I now have my project in them. I would NOT recommend this product to anyone. I don't know how others are pleased with this "clamp". Literally nothing about it impressed me st all.	-1
After a few cuts of very thin cotton material they will not cut tissues now .	-1
I don't like this stretcher frame set very well- the wing nuts enclosed for tightening the frame are useless if you have any kind of finger weakness (arthritis) and they don't stay tightened. I had to order the big black knobs in order to use it- an extra $25- it would be better and probably cheaper to just include them with the frames. Mine had to be sanded down before use- there were splinters all over- very roughly made. I also had to duck tape the fabric to the bars- other wise it kept slipping out. I would have sent them back, but I needed a frame to embroider a piece for a birthday and couldn't wait to get a replacement.	-1
I have about 7 pairs of different models by Westcott, because Westcott is the only brand Walmart carries, it seems.  Well, NON of them cuts well.  The upper part of the blades is useless with every pair.  It cuts papers all right, but if you try to cut plastic bag or mesh bag or whatever else, they don't do anything except for frustrating me and raising my blood pressure.  I went to Five Below and got myself a pair of Stanely sissors.  Now this one cuts like a charm.  I don't know how so many people find Westcott sissors 5 star quality.  I just don't seem to have any luck with this brand.	-1
These scissors are awful. I only use them to cut fabric and after just a few days they have dulled. Im only able to cut if I use the top 1inch tip. Dont waste your money.	-1
Much lower quality than I expected. They don't operate smoothly. Nowhere near heavy-duty enough for basic household scissors.	-1
Followed dorecta to a "t" and it ruined my fabric. It didn't dye evenly. Considering it was cotton there shouldn't have been any issues.	-1
Wouldn't work for the bedskirt I was trying to color. It came out lavender colored even though I started with white.	-1
Didnt dye the fabric	-1
I bought because the yellow powder was fantastic but the blue is apalling	-1
This was supposed to be LIGHT pink it dyed a small dog harness bright hot pink, I was very disappointed since the color on the box was not even close to the color represented. It ruined my dog harness.	-1
Arrived damaged.	-1
Arrived damaged!	-1
Works well just cheaper in the retail stores.	-1
It works just way cheaper in the store.	-1
Did not work and gave an already beige blanket just a light beige color, certainly not chocolate brown or even brown really. Has a purple undertone that I do not care for and did not expect. We followed the direction for a high efficiency washer. Total waste of time and money.	-1
total garbage. returning after not even being able to use successfully once. i purchased the silver gran prix extra filberts and was so amazed by how good they were i wanted more long filberts. the silver ones hold their shape perfectly after every use. but i was put off by the high price and the high shipping costs. so i found these brushes at a much lower cost. well you get what you pay for. these brushes are made from cheap white bristles and are not stiff. upon getting them wet with citrus thinner they flayed open and became unusable as detail brushes. they also are not stiff so they would not spread paint. i have pictures of them deformed after one attempt with both the 5 and the 7. going to buy more gran prix.	-1
very poor quality brush and very disappointed in the brand.  always had good luck before wtih winnewt...	-1
very poor quality brush for this old brand.  very disappointed in it.	-1
Blending Is marginal at best.	-1
Tried this marker with prisma colored pencils and markers and it was quite ineffective on both.	-1
I am not going to use a plier each time I open this pen. Very inconvenient and VERY difficult to open!!!!! Not worth the trouble.	-1
The item i received was not new as advertised.	-1
The marker is completely dead. And I literally just took it out of the package	-1
My alcohol ink pieces are either on tile or paper. This blender pen was quite dry, so not very useful. May on a different substrate it would hydrate	-1
Work great.  Blends well with pencils I got nice clean break activity for relaxation and color fix at work :-)	-1
I'm not really thrilled with these brushes. After using W&N Series 7 brushes and Cirrus brushes, I wonder why they made these. They don't really hold a point very well - the less expensive brushes do better - and have a tendency to split between strokes. Maybe I'm spoiled by the Kolinsky brushes, but these are disappointing, especially since I really expect high quality from Winsor & Newton.	-1

eh	-1
Not the best elastic. It's not heavy duty, but at this price I'm not sure why I expected it to be. Has way too much stretch.	-1
You'll see great reviews for this. But not many of the reviewers are actually storing silver jewelry. I bought two of these Artbin tarnish inhibitor super satchels. I bought the second one to get more of the anti-tarnish dividers. In June, I cleaned all my sterling silver jewelry pieces that I had made and placed them into the compartments.  I checked the jewelry today and all the pieces are tarnished. I mean, almost black tarnished. Artbin claims that the dividers inhibit tarnish for up to five years. The bin didn't inhibit tarnish for even two months.  Sadly, I had also bought two smaller of the anti-tarnish satchels before I realized that they are useless in that capacity.  I will go back to the anti-tarnish strips and the anti-tarnish baggies that actually work. What a complete waste of money!	-1
I purchased this item when looking for a source for good quality colored wool. I love the wool but was disappointed when I found the exact same thing at Michaels for about $4.50 (regular price). If you don't have a source near you, this would be a good option but if you have a craft store that actually carries wool felting supplies, I'd check there first.	-1
I expected them to stay sharp longer than a few days.  I cannot recommend these.	-1
I loved these scissors when I first got them. I do quilting and used them to snip thread. I have had them less than 6 months and they have rusted terribly and are totally useless. I'm so disappointed.	-1
Not good for embroidery scissors, I'm very unimpressed.	-1
These are pretty cheap.	-1
Have not used them yet but they are a perfect size for what I need. My sister in law has several,pair of these and swears by them. I got this order very quickly and would recommend this seller to anyone looking for these items.	-1
Eh.....not a fan.  These look really cute, and they cut okay....but the finger holes are so tiny and uncomfortable.  The fiskars detail scissors may not be as pretty, but they are so much more comfortable to use.	-1
This is a very nice ruler and I especially like the frosted surface.  Thanks.	-1
A lot smaller than expected	-1
I don't like this product. It is clumpy and takes too long to dry.	-1
I didn't know there were multiple thicknesses to glue gun sticks! These were WAY too fat for my glue guns. Putting in the product description that these are one width of multiple out there would have helped. Maybe it's my fault, but it's one star because I can't use them as they're intended to be used.	-1
This was an add on product, but I was disappointed to find when they came that they were short little glue stick and not the long ones. Read carefully the size before purchasing.	-1
too stringy when in use.cheap quality	-1
I have purchased two of these rulers and found that the lines between 6 and 12 inches are off by around 1/32 of an inch.  I ordered both of the rulers from Amazon and didn't realize that there was a problem with the first one until it was too late to return it.  So, I ordered the second one and found the same problem and returned it promptly.   I found the problem with the ruler one day when I was just fooling around and put this ruler up against the OLFA 6 x 24 inch ruler and noticed the lines were off.  Then I checked the OLFA 6 x 24 inch ruler against my Omnigrid 6 x 24 inch ruler and found the lines matched just fine.  However, while the OLFA 6 x 24 inch ruler's marking lines are fine, it is about 1/8 of an inch longer below the 24th inch than the Omnigrid ruler. Apparently, quality control at the OLFA is not what it should be.	-1

Not very useful and it is awkward.	-1
Too mushy and really not 1/4". Even with a piping foot, I find it very difficult to get this tightly sewn. You should just be able to essentially wrap it and put it through the piping foot and see and be done. But because it is so soft it doesn't ride in the piping foot very well. And a zipper foot is even worse.  If you need something with a little backbone, look elsewhere.	-1
Sorry for the low rating but as I've said in other reviews unless you really know what the sizes and weights of these types of things equal, they mean absoulutely nothing to me. I'd like to see a piece of the item next to a small ruler so I can tell what it is I'm buying-in this case the cording was much to large around for me to use as I wished & it now sits all alone under my bed untouched. If you could add a pic next to a ruler I'd purchase these from Amazon but without that I am soon forced to move on to the local fabric store to purchase this type of item as I said earlier the numbers used to explain sizing really mean nothing to me and do not help me in anyway when trying to purchase this type of material.	-1
Too busy and hard to line up for a straight cut.	-1
I don't know what happened, but I had to send this back. It obviously wasn't a OLFA brand. The tag was ripped off, and the sides look as though they had been chewed off, they were so rough and chipped, and uneven! I have bought several OLFA products from Amazon with no problem.  As usual Amazon was amazing to deal with, and refunded my money within hours of dropping the package off at UPS!! I HEART AMAZON	-1
I found this product difficult to handle.	-1
Did not stick well enough, pulled off paper backing, adhesive came with it!!	-1
The brush does not hold a point. I bought it for fine line art purposes and lack of a point makes this mostly useless to me.  The lack of point may be from damage during transit, as the brush was just thrown in a box without any packaging protection. There was no plastic cover for the brush hairs or ferrule.  I will keep trying to coax the brush back to a decent shape, but it's not working well so far. 0/10 do not recommend.	-1
I purchased sizes 5 and 12 of this inlaid liner series 5519 expecting needle sharp points. I was wrong. Unfortunately, the tips do not come to a natural point like one would find in a quality pointed round or a script liner because the tips of these brushes are trimmed -- more like chopped with an axe at the tip -- which is not good to say the least. The tips are dead and dull, unlike the product photo and the product description, the brush tip is NOT needle sharp. And it's not just the one brush, but both brushes in 2 different sizes that I received. The shoddy packaging did not help either. So buyer beware.	-1

I purchased 2 inlaid liners by Da Vinci (e.g., Maestro 5519 series) with kolinsky tips.  Unfortunately, the brush tips are dull and blunt, and do not come to a needle sharp point as shown in the product photo or in the product description.  The tips appear like they've been chopped with an axe and the shoddy packaging did not help either.  Response to other reviewer:  My review is based on my own experience in using my Da Vinci inlaid kolinsky liners and I will say it again:  Da Vinci's inlaid liners are poorly designed.  They do not come to a natural point as they should because the tips are trimmed, and they certainly do not have needle sharp points.	-1
I purchased a size 12 of this same exact brush (Maestro 5519 series) and the kolinsky point was dull and blunt, and did not come to a fine point as advertised, unfortunately.  I expected better from a Da Vinci Maestro brush.  For the price, I would have been better off just purchasing a pure kolinsky pointed round brush between sizes 2 to 4 from the Winsor Series 7 range, or the Raphael series 8404 / 8408 as their points are more reliable.	-1

brush looks nothing like this, it has a cheap poorly shaped tip, disappointing purchase.	-1
no good with watercolor, it parted the first time i used it. the brush is aright with thin lines and stuff with acrylic.	-1
Singer notions, shame on you.  You've saved half-a-cent on production costs and spawned a tape measure that I cannot hang up and which feels like it won't last out the year.  Shame, shame, shame!  Do I need to make sure that all the numbers are still on there as well?	-1
these are very nice because they are thick, but the only bad thing is that they are not point enough to get into the thicker fabrics or the semi thick fabric.	-1
I was surprised at how flimsy (thin metal and somewhat loose-feeling closure), but I'm keeping them as I think that they will get the job done on lighter fabrics and for sewing projects. However, I would not recommend for anything that needs to stand up to pulling or needs to go through thick fabric.	-1
Too thick.  I thought they would be thinner.  Might as well use glue gun.  I don't think they work that well, either.	-1
Doesn't cut well at all.  A big disappointment.  Wish I had tried it right away so I could have sent it back.	-1
The product does do what it says... it will punch a hexagon.  The problem is.. I bought three sizes so I could cut a small hole and then cut the next size up in the same place.  BUT, because there is a guard, you cannot nest these on top of each other.  This is very disappointing to me because that was the sole reason I purchased them.  Of course now that I have opened them, I can't return them.  I guess I will just have to hope that I can come up with another use for them.	-1
Dont waste your money. The bristles are constantly falling out, they make a mess of whatever you're trying to paint, and they really just aren't good quality at all. I wouldnt buy again.	-1
Ok, for a group of kids, but they don't clean up very well to reuse.  They look really worn after just the one use.	-1
I bought this for my youngest daughter to cart her art supplies to school as her present pochade box was much too big and had broken.  I wasn't much interested in the paints, although having tested out the watercolors, they seem pretty good...OK for beginner students anyway.  The box was disappointing, after assembly we found that it wouldn't close properly and made a horrible 'cracking splitting wood' sound whenever it was opened or closed.  I wanted to send it right back, but my daughter insisted on keeping it.  I don't think it will last long, but hopefully when it does crack it's weak hinges, my husband will be able to repair it with stronger ones.  Would not recommend.	-1
Box came with a broken part...  Storage was less than expected.	-1
The first set came with beat up box, and I was just shocked to find that the art supplies inside had been used and then stuffed back inside especially the chock every piece of chalk had been used until it was just a little nub of chalk left. And then somebody had the nerve to put it all back in there and try to sell it. The paintbrushes were broken, the box itself was broken, the packaging is the worst problem that they happen I have contacted and dandy the store that sells these, and made some recommendations because it can't be that hard to make it so that the art supplies don't come broken and In pieces, when my replacement set came, I was excited because after all I wanted the set. But then again the top shelf of things were jumbled all over the place the paints all had the lids off everything was jumbled all over, the oil crayons or rather oil pastel crayons were broken although they were complete whereas the first set they were used the second set they were just broken. The paintbrushes in the second that were broken as well as the first set I believe that all could be fixed by taking a look at the packaging. I won't ever get another set like this from this company.	-1
The easel set was missing items, everything was out of place, tubes were either opened, used, uncapped and/or crushed, the chalk was broken. Inside it looked like it had been used, because paint or something was all over everything.  Would have changed rating but I received the replacement and the chalk in the second drawer was broken and in the top drawer the items were out of the tray that should hold them in place.  I would send it back but I needed it for my art class. It worked okay for class but brushes were not nylon and did not perform as they should and I had to buy more brushes to complete my assignment.  Needs to protect the items with better packing; this will ensure that merchandise is not damaged upon arrival.	-1
This pad does bleed through.  I was contacted about it and was told they would send me a new one but I never received it.  I will never order this product again.  I just started buying her an art pad that is canvas paper, she loves it.	-1
Not at all what I expected from copic. Have tried few times using this for my drawings. But it soaks up ink and doesn't blend well at all. Card stock does better. Save your money for price of this there are other things out there better for use with copic markers.	-1
Can't say how it works with Copics as I use Spectrum Noir and Prismacolor markers but honestly how diff can alcohol markers be? There is a lot of bleed w this paper both through the paper and around your image. Paper itself is super thin and there is no real discernable way to tell which side of paper you are supposed to color (the side that is the "protectant" side will streak and puddle your inks causing a non seamless blend). The side that you color on gives a "grainy" appearance. Both brands of my markers give this appearance. Copics may have a diff formula? But if you're a non Copic user, I don't suggest this paper.	-1
Unbelievably thin~Too thin to use my Copics on.	-1
Ok, I am not one to give up so I gave this paper one last try and here are my new comments. I printed a digi stamp from my HP printer and let the image dry. Using my Copic markers to color the image i noticed that the ink left splotchy blobs of ink while trying to blend color. I tried letting the ink dry between colors and blending but got the same results. Although I was able to color the image with a flat color and not have the printed image smear I did not have any success using subsequent colors and blending them without the blotchy look. Additionally the dolor does not seep into the paper but sits on the surface and is VERY tacky even after the coloring dries. I am dissatisfied with the quality of this product. Having the Copic name on it does not mean quality. The paper is very thin and after testing just a small piece I noticed that the stamped image that I used smeared even after allowing for drying time. If you are still set on purchasing this product make sure to test it. Not what I expected of this product at all.	-1
Can't recommend this paper. It is extremely thin and the color bleeds through just like any other paper.	-1
The hook is not the same as the other susan bates crochet hooks that I have	-1
Don't bye very delicate. Waste of money. Not good quality	-1
They don't go in and out as easily as I had hopes. Sometimes they get caught and pull the yarn and sometimes they are just difficult to put in and take out. I will investigate a different type of marker for my crochet work.	-1
Broke 3 days after using.	-1
The paint/coating on the needles is really shoddy. I knit and crochet a lot and I've bought loads of supplies through Amazon. This was a real disappointment. The coating was peeled off and caught on any yarn used with it. I got disgusted and just threw it away.	-1
I got these needles to make a Christmas present, and after about three rows I gave up. The joins on these needles are not smooth at all, the cord is so stiff that it makes it extremely difficult to work on anything, and the cold, hard, aluminum hurt my hands. Will not be using these needles again	-1
I don't care for the finish.  The tips are sure pointy enough, but the finish isn't as smooth as Addi Click needles.  They are now decoration in a vase or to loan to my daughter.	-1
Not sure how the pair of needles I got passed quality control.  Tips on both are bad--one rough & the other with a slice partly through the metal.  The end of one is loose & I got one "pink" & one "purple" needle.	-1
too big to use	-1
This is a cheaply designed crochet hook.  The head of the hook needs rounded edges so as not to catch the yarn so much.  I am crocheting mats for the homeless using strips of plastic bags.  I can't use this hook at all.  It doesn't cost much, but it was a total loss for me.	-1
I'm not beginner. I've been crocheting for nearly 30 years and this item is pretty useless.  The clear plastic tube that attaches the needles together is too stiff and inflexible to do anything with. It's packaged with the tube rolled up and it will not straighten out. It makes the hooks themselves impossible to hold correctly and control.	-1
Misleading... i thought i was buying metal knitting needles... I cannot stand false or misleading advertising. It's about as bad as selling a "steem" cleaner which doesn't produce steam to shampoo carpet and taking advantage of customers.  The seller was awesome..  But the Susan Bates Company ought to be reprimanded for misleading it's customers with the name of the knitting needle. I don't care if it said or not plastic anywhere-  i have a problem with the title bc it immediately misleads the person into not checking if the knitting needle is actually made of metal rather than plastic. Plastic has more friction resistance, which is probably nice for beginners, but not for fast knitters.  The length of the needle for english style knitting is perfect	-1

The product description of these knitting needles states that they are made of heat-treated aluminum alloy; however, the ones I just received are plastic and not the aluminum alloy! I am very disappointed with this purchase!!	-1
Nice, but needle tips are too short.	-1
Yarn catches. Don't really like these as well	-1
These have the worst connection between cable and needle, I will not be able to use them and should have returned it.  Get the ChiaoGoo - see my review under  ChiaoGoo Red Line Circular Knitting Needles: 24"-Size 0 (http://www.amazon.com/ChiaoGoo-Stainless-Circular-Knitting-Needles/product-reviews/B00CNSUSTU/ref=dp_top_cm_cr_acr_txt?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints=1)	-1
I am not a huge fan of circular needles, having learned to knit in the round with double pointed needles. These looked interesting for being 10" rather than the commonly available 7", which could make things like hats less likely to drop stitches off of a needle. Since the picture was too small (no larger version was available) to tell with any certainty if there were 4 or 5 needles in the package, and the description was unclear, I hoped that there would be 5 and ordered this item. There are only 4 needles, which makes the increase in length over using a set of 5 7" needles trivial, and not worth the cost and trouble. I am returning these.  Reading the description again, this incomprehensible sentence (copied directly from the product page) might indicate that there are only 4, but the "4in" seemed to refer to the size of the pouch described, as far as I was concerned. "the quicksilver 11 3 4x1 5 8x1 4in vinyl pouch can be used for storage."	-1
The metal portion of the hook is not very long and no flat area like I'm used to using in normal crochet hooks.  I hope I can get used to it in order to make my projects.	-1
I found this to be difficult to work with. The hook itself is too short and feels unbalanced. You spend more time fussing with this to try to get a better position. I have pulled way too many projects apart. If this was about 3 inches longer or perhaps change the structure of the hook to add more weight? Don't waste your time with this item as I have.	-1
Don't fit any of my needles. They are nicely made.	-1
sent wrong hooks,packing was right but wrong size hook and cable was black not clear ,very very thin would not hold up to weight of yarn. sent them back	-1
After knitting with one of these needles for a few hours I notice the plastic tips have started to peal and have some ruff places in them. Just a few hours of use and I've already started to have this problem. The needles are extra light, but the texture isn't very smooth. I was knitting with some cheepo acrylic yarn and noticed the yarn would not slide easily from one needle to the other. I'm just not very happy with the Bates knitting needles as a brand so far.	-1
Received today and returning asap.  As you can see the needles come in clear packaging.  The top of one of the needles was completely detached with no hole to place it on the needle.  An obvious defect.  Quality control must have been asleep.	-1
These seem to knit tight.  I normally knit on the loose side and have had everything turn out too tight using these needles.  Also, the yarn sticks and does not slide smoothly. I prefer bamboo needles which can be pricey. I rarely use aluminum needles because stitches fall off too easily, so I was excited about this product.  I will not order any more.	-1
does not work effectiuvely	-1
the bobbins are cardboard and tear easy... my other box the bobbins are a sturdy plastic. the rest is ok but that is a deal breaker for me.	-1
This ribbon had a really hard time curling up and was difficult to work with. I tried with multiple pairs of scissors and other tools to try and get nice curls, but they always went flat or had lots of indents. Would not recommend unless you are not planning on curling.	-1
Not only were they too small to fit on my earrings, but they were practically impossible to hold between your fingers.  A couple of reviews said they thought these were made for children.  I would say they are made for people with incredibly dexterity and extremely small fingers.  They were returned the same day.	-1
They are very pretty but I ordered them for me, not a child/ They are really small and small backs can sometimes work their way into your skin.	-1
These earring backs were to big. I thought the locking backs would be a good choice but unfortunately they weren't so they were returned.	-1
I can bend these out of shape with my fingers. These are cheaply made.	-1
These leverback earrings are not stamped .925 so I am suspicious they are not. I am returning. I am having trouble with ordering earrings from China, even if they are marked .925, they are not. These are not even marked. Watch out for China good's, this is NOT the first time I have been rooked!	-1
Before you buy these be sure to check who has the "buy box" (main page "sold by"). These started off being sold as genuine 925 sterling silver findings, the stupid Chinese jumped onto the listing (respectfully) with their fake 925, outbid the original dealer who had authentic silver and now the hooks being sold are stamped but fake, which is why you have a mix of good and bad reviews (aside from the people who just don't know better).  Sterling Silver is a precious metal and the same price per weight matter what country it comes from. If you see an amazing price for a precious metal, you can count it as too good to be true. These listings are being taken over with overseas counterfits so be sure they come from a reputable dealer. If you're unsure, ask where the findings come from and if they will test as solid 925.  If you've purchased the fake silver, report.  If you would like the genuine hooks, click on the "New from Xxx" link to find the original dealer or at least a reputable one	-1
Says it's stainless but it rusts bad enough to get pits! Pits are very bad! I need a hard very smooth surface for my work as I would think most the people who buy these do. It is a hard surface hence 2 stars.	-1
Come on. All it had to be was flat and smooth, and it failed. Kinda flat on one side but not the other; not at all smooth on either side. Totally unsuitable for fine jewelry. Paperweight. Edit to add- took it to a local machinist, who charged me $20 to put a decent finish on this.  Ridiculous.	-1
Ok seriously...why was this block not deburred prior to packing? They cut this sucker from a slab of steel on a CNC Machine and didn't even bother, at the very least, minimal deburring of the sharp edges and corners. I sliced my fingers 4 times, drew BLOOD 4 times just getting it out of the plasic and removing the oil off of it (Disclaimer in BOLD needed on the box - "Wear leather gloves to remove!")!  So now, I need to get a deburring tool just to make this thing useful and safe to handle. Kind of hard to use for it's intended purpose if I have to wear thick leather gloves!?!  Too bad I am no longer working in machining...I could have just slapped this sucker in a vice and machined myself a precision edge break on all corners/flats. In any case, nothing says "enjoy your purchase" like a pair of leather gloves and deburring tools just to use what you bought! Not cool HTS, not cool!	-1
Now, I understand that buying from the bottom means you are going to have issues, and I fully realize that plastic mandrels this cheap are going to have flaws...HOWEVER:  I noticed when I bought it that the ring sizes would not match up to the mandrel.  Later on, I measured it out, and not ONE of the mandrel sizes were even close to accurate.  I took out my calipers and began measuring:  the first US size 1 is actually a 3/4th, and the largest size, 15, was actually a 14.  It's one thing for it to start accurate and become less accurate:  that's fully expected of a cheap product; you get what you paid for.  However, for NONE of it to actually be accurate on a tool whom has the sole job of being accurate within a fraction of a millimeter and is off by a whole millimeter is unacceptable, and useless.  If you want a cheap mandrel, you'd be better off carving one with a belt sander and a block of wood, because in either case you will have to note the measurements anyways.	-1
Have not figured out how to get the results I was hoping for.  I believe a metal set might work better for me.  Will keep trying...since I am a beginner.	-1
Ehh. Didn't cost much. The mandrel is not true to size.	-1
Did not size the TRUE size!	-1
Don't waste your money on this.  I think everything about the sizing on this is inaccurate.  The rings are a really cheap plastic.  Mine is going in the trash.	-1
Just another junk item that doesn't work well.  It doesn't pick up the stones well.  The prongs aren't set into the cylinder at proper angles and two are smooshed together making it difficult to pick up a gem.  If you buy cheap you get crap.	-1
. The four prong , it doesn't pick up the gems as easy as 5 prong, and when pushing the plunger, it sticks every time, making it harder to use . I give the four prong a thumbs down	-1
I thought they would be sturdier then this, very thin and flimsey	-1
Too large and can't be returned for a different size. My mistake. I'll have to donate them to local crafting group.	-1
Very disappointed in my order. I have ordered these hooks several times, and this time they were different. They seemed smaller in length (which is no big deal), but they were extremely soft. they bend so easy. That really disappoints me, because I had loved my last few orders, but this one is different. Please, go back to what they were!!!! :( and one of my ears are not liking them... So sad about this!! :(	-1
I wish I had read the reviews first - yes they came in a big box, inside of another one, that was provided by amazon. But I carefully opened it and the first I see is dirty! Yuk! Like they sat on a shelf in the open forever. They are badly put together, and overall very cheap. I can only use them to wrap costume jewelry, not items of value, what an utter embarrassment that would be. Pay a little extra and know you will get good quality. Never fails -	-1
The title states 3.25". The boxes i received are not that size. Then in the description it says 3 1/4" x 2 1/4" x 1" (82 x 57 x 25 mm) which is true for the LID. It should have said that it's the usable space. Now i have 100 boxes i don't need. To return it, i would have to pay $6. I should not have to pay any return fees since it was not my fault that the size was wrong. Awful experience.	-1
Misleading picture, description. Angled wrong way, blades too thick, poor quality craftsmanship, tips of blades distorted and pocked. I needed these for trimming threads while machine embroidering. The picture makes them look bent with the handles upwards and the blades forward. That would have been perfect for maneuvering under the machine but instead, they are angled to the left and are flat. The blades are too thick to get a close cut as well. You'd have to be a contortionist to angle your hand to cut properly with these. They may work for hand embroidery but even then, they are rather large.	-1
These scissors are really flimsy - too light weight and are not what I was expecting.  The quality is not what I need.	-1
Cheap, flimsy, and they break way too easily. They bum me out.	-1
The edge is a little sharp.	-1
I would highly recommend you proceed with caution buying these as chances are if you're purchasing from the main page lowest price "buy box" these are not 925 sterling silver, maybe plated, but nothing more.  When the listing was originally created by Finding King they were selling genuine sterling silver, as FK is a highly reputable dealer. Along comes overseas dealers with faux 925, jumped onto the listing, priced them significantly lower and won the buy box as a result..which is what you're seeing now.  With a precious metal- a good rule to follow is if it seems to good to be true, it is. Precious metals cost the same per gram no matter what country you buy from. China does not have some magical precious metal cost the rest of the world does not, they just tend to have very low standards when it comes to product integrity and have no issue selling fakes. Chinese wholesale sites are flooded with fake stamped metal findings and most sellers will even tell you it is not 925 SS if you inquire.  If you are looking for real Sterling silver, my advice is to buy from a reputable dealer. Ask questions "will this metal electronically or acid test as SS?". Magnets are not fully reliable as findings often have parts that can not be manufactured with precious metal (inner workings of clasps, etc) . If you click on "other sellers" and scroll through you should be able to find the original seller with authentic findings.	-1
Wrong items delivered!! I have been frustrated to death trying to work with the hook earring with the ball and bad design.	-1
Just look at the pictures	-1
These are not sterling silver.  They are made of steel, and are magnetic.  Do not order these if you want genuine silver.	-1
Most of the head pins were bent. The weight of the head pins is not the same. They are not the quality of sterling silver head pins I have purchased in the past.  Are they made with metal other than sterling silver?  Can they be returned?	-1
Nice and shiny, but crooked.	-1
You get what you pay for.  A long time between ordering and receiving, and on top of that, all pins are bent (and not just a little bent - think 90 degrees).  Don't bother.	-1
terrible item. they r all diff sizes and came so late. I would like to have them replaced or refunded.	-1
Do not buy this product. The diameter of the pin varies greatly along the length of the pin. I work with mostly 4mm or 6mm round beads, and they may thread at the top of the pin, but will not push all the way down to the bottom of the pin where it gets thicker. Also, every single pin is bent, and the flat part at the bottom is off center. Impossible to make a nice pair of earrings with these.	-1
Out of 50 headpins I did not find a single straight one! Not even one! Poor quality	-1
They are not sterling silver.  A magnet picked them all up like cheap metal.	-1
I am very disappointed! The head pins were all bent and had a curve to it every 50 pieces...never buying head pins again.	-1
Please be aware that this item is shipped from China. The quality is really bad because the head is not made consistently. THe price is very attractive but you just need to wait for the package to arrive with lots of patience. And definitely wouldn't use it if you are trying to make something for sale.	-1
I just spent five minutes with this trying to smooth the end of a piece of dead soft copper 20g wire. My hand is tired, and the piece is only slightly less sharp than it started out. It is still too sharp to be considered finished. Cannot recommend this at all.	-1
it didn't work as i thought it would....ends still rough after use	-1
I bought it to round off wire but I don't find it useful. I got a tutorial thinking I was not using it correctly but I am not getting the results I expected.	-1
didn't work. didn't set well at all. it was very easy to dislodge what i tried to glue.	-1
don't like it at all	-1
I was using this to adhere quartz crystals to flat round metal earring.  It didn't work.  Yes, I followed the instructions exactly.  It just would not hold securely.	-1
I make a lot of jewelry and have to glue the stones onto the settings. I did some research and the product was described exactly for my application. I took to long to dry and did not adhere properly even setting over night	-1
I used it according to the instructions and it seemed to work and seemed to bond to the torn area but later when it cooled down, it started peeling off.  I ended up sewing it around the tear :-(	-1
This ad is deceptive. you only get one brush.	-1
Didn't work for me	-1
This is NOT GOOD for paper glueing.  It forms a HARD crackly adhesive. similar to light weight cardboard  I glue composition notebook pages together and glue embelishments onto these pages.......Score tape is great, but I wanted a liquid repositionable paste or glue.  I read the reviews most were good, however unless I got a "bad jar" this stuff IS NOT good for paper artistry.  Mine came very very hard in the jar it needed a fork to break it up just to get some to use..... then I used a stencil "pouncer" once I got it "loosened up"........not sure why this  "paste" would be like the old can of  wax for car finishes but that is how mine came.  SO if yours is hard like this you too will have problems.  If it is more like the old school paste perhaps it will work better.  I just don't think for the price it is worth it for paper work.	-1
I wanted to love this paste. I'd heard that it was the go-to paste for people putting little wallpaper bits on doll houses. It was suggested to me by someone who does art journaling. Unfortunately, I've found it to be messy to use, hard to spread and it doesn't stick well. The texture is weird. It's like petroleum jelly (aka: Vaseline). I used an old debit card to spread it, topped it with a second paper and then used a clean card to sort of squeegie the excess from the center to the edges, and I still had bubbles when dry. Oh, speaking of drying, it dries pretty fast in the jar. I keep I have two layers of wax paper under my lid. One on top of the paste to keep the air from getting to it and a larger one that I put over the jar before screwing on the lid, so the lid doesn't stick.	-1
Will not be reordering this product. These dots are very messy for most any small or medium die cut.	-1
Didn't realize until these arrived that the "2 x 2 inches" was the entire die, not the area being cut! "Tiny" is a misnomer... these are miniscule! I'll remember that when ordering a 2x2 again. However, I'll stick with "4 x 4" to come closer to the size I envision.	-1
It is made cheap, cuts good for about a month of lite cutting.	-1
Like other people mentioned, the blade is not sharp enough. The first time of use, yes but after 3 or 4 times of uses it won't even cut through paper.	-1
cuts like a child's toy	-1
Bends my paper more than it cuts it. I wanted this for tiny pieces that needed cuts but this did not do the trick	-1
It comes out red, not pink	-1
I returned the item back to amazon because the very end of the blade didn't cut but ripped my stuff.	-1
VERY SMALL	-1
I was actually disappointed in this as several of the ink pads are rather dried out. But that's what I get for ordering ink pads online.	-1
I ordered these pens thinking they were glazed pens as it states, but when I received my order, they were the 10 pack 3d colors basic set (as it states in the description).  The Micron pack, as I notice now, only have 8.  The seller told me that micron pens only come in black.  So, I wasted some time here due to the fact the picture is not correct for these pens.  Notice on the photo it states, Pigma Micron.  This particular photo is for black pens only.  NOT GLAZED PENS!!  UPDATE:  This is now the correct photo.	-1
I wore the extender for 8 hours and when i took off my necklace the extender had tarnished haf to throw out	-1
Do not like these.  They do not dry well. Would not recommend.  Find ink pads are more consistent with color.	-1
If you're like most people (and count me among them), I was under the impression that the size of these inkpads would register somewhere, on some scale. Untrue--these are the TINIEST lil dollhouse versions of regulation ink pads that I have seen in my ENTIRE life...I feel ripped off and will not buy this product again.	-1
Cheerful bring colours, but the ink pads are soooooo tiny, you can't use them.  You can get creative and use the ink pad as a sponge / paint brush on your artwork.... but the ink dries out quickly so don't dream too big. Storing is nice and easy, self stacking. Sharp looking product... wish it worked out better.	-1
I've already returned these.  I used two of the pens and on each one I could easily see how the ink had reduced in the clear pen shaft by an inch after writing two greeting cards.  Also, they tell you that they add "dimension" to your writing.  Mine were flatter than pancakes.  No raised lettering whatsoever.  So they're glossy- big whoop!  Considering how fast they would have run out of ink, they are a complete waste of money- even though I got them as an Amazon Warehouse Deal they STILL weren't worth the money.  I should have learned from my same experience with the Sakura "puffy" pens which are also flat and run out quickly.  I got some Sharpie pastel paint pens today for writing on black paper and so far they are great.  Save your money and skip Sakura.	-1
These are not what I'd expect from Sakura.... The colors spread and bleed together and take SOO LONG to dry.  The biggest probelm is how the ink seems watery and spreads further than where you put it.  Not of the same standard as the Stardust and Metallics	-1
These pens are just ok. Not worth money. Bought for coloring in 3D. Some of them do what they say and others don't. And they give you a clear pen??? What on earth am I going to do with that? For the reputation that comes with these pens - they are a complete let down. Especially do to the co$t.	-1
f these tI bought these pens for a 3D look when coloring. Some of them do raise nicely and have good pigment. But some don't raise at all and its like writing with a regular, ball point pen. Not overly smooth as the product claims. But my real disappointment comes with the fact that they give you not one but two clear pens! What on earth am I supposed to do with one ohings, let alone two??? Waste of money!	-1
not very glazed, pens run out very fast	-1
When I got these inks I found the gold was dry.  Unless you hear the little ball when you shake the container, it is dry ink.	-1
shook for an hour and still clumps in botton...this is not a returnable item. Would not have purchased had I known. Can not use.	-1
This half circle cut is to small and never comes out even.  I think I ordered the wrong size and I'm not happy with this at all. Diana	-1
Quality is okay but can only be use on a single paper.	-1
junk letters....rip so easily. very disappointed	-1
I tried these on many products and materials and didn't hold anything... I finally used hot melt glue to do the same work	-1
Unfortunately this product was not what I expected. Can hardly punch 75 grames copy paper and not more than 2 sheets. I have doubts this can cut or punch photo paper ratherly well. Positively CAN NOT punch cardboard, less coated cardboard. 100% dissappointed.  It's a tiny product that is not worth to trouble Amazon with returning it but I would like my money back.	-1
I feel that the inkpad dries up too easily. Only did a few projects and the ink on one of the inkpad has dried up. Would rather buy the actual size inkpad. I hope Amazon will carry more colour.	-1
Never ordered	-1
I was actually disappointed in this as several of the ink pads are rather dried out. But that's what I get for ordering ink pads online.	-1
These do not separate well. Very hard to use.	-1
I'm disappointed with this punch. Corners come out rough and uneven, and I have to sand them down with a nail file afterwards to get a properly rounded corner.	-1
The gears and roller in this brand do not work very well. The tape roll came loose, and was more work trying to fix and roll down 1 inch of adhesive then it was worth. Very frustrating.	-1
I bought these for scrapbooking and I could not get them to stay on the page.  Shipped fast, now I am just hoping I can use them in another way so it is not a waste of money.	-1
Sketchy application doesnt last long	-1
Super hard to use and the tape plastic container was broken.	-1
It has a white tape which is not what I expected.  Not as great at other 3L products I have bought in the past.	-1
Received the two in a package-one stopped working half way through and the second one did not work at all-had to return them	-1
Ink smeared very easily	-1
Talk about garbage. Use it for an hour and throw away all those plastic containers! Ridiculous!	-1
No idea if this stuff would have worked in my printer. All I know is I bought it expecting it to be transparent - since that is what it calls itself - and when I peeled a bit of the backing off the sheet discovered it is no such thing. Translucent is perhaps a better term - it has the effect of heavily frosted glass when I was expecting something like clear acetate. Ordinary tracing paper is more transparent than this stuff. Total waste of my money.	-1
I have used these little adhesive rollers for years, but either they have done something to change them or I got a defective batch.  I bought eight of them and went off to a scrapbook retreat thinking I was well stocked.  But no, the adhesive just wouldn't hold and the pictures kept popping off the pages and I had to redo them all with a different brand of roller.  Amazon is giving me a refund, but I won't be buying this brand again.	-1
I had high hopes for this - I like the clear inkjet film except that it is virtually impossible to get it to stick to ceramics or glass.  The adhesive version sticks OK, but the ink does not completely dry, not even after 24 hours.  Once you rub it the ink starts coming off.  I also tried putting an acrylic coat over it and all that happened was it caused the ink to run (this was after 24 hours of drying time).  I have tried this with many different printer settings (Epson Artisan) and the overall result was exactly the same.	-1
Colors printed way too dark on this paper	-1
ink smeared all over it-probably my fault for not letting it dry properly, but I'm not impressed.	-1
Could not get to work in my printer	-1
You have to really use your arm strength to punch and get a specific technique going or you end up wrestling the circle out of the jammed punch.  I wish I would have spent a little more on a better product.	-1
quality not up to your general standard	-1
I purchased this based on the claim that it was matte and transparent. I use transparencies in my artwork, but dislike the glare of the gloss. The sheets are like thick vellum and not remotely transparent. Light comes through when you hold it up. The product also arrived 4 days later than expected.	-1
This did not work.  At all.  The ink didn't want to print well, and the coating is horrible, scratches easily, attracts dust, but if you get it wet, you destroy it, so you can't clean it!  I'm looking for something else, and I'd advise you do, too.	-1
These do not cover well at all, unless you put white ink on white, then what is the point. Could not draw enough ink up to cover the stamp enough to get a good print, now matter what I tried.	-1
The colors shown online on this product does not match the colors that are actually there in the stack.  Very disappointed.	-1
Didn't like this product. The ink is not on the pad. You have to put it on and smear it around. It is then uneven. Way more work than I want to put into a stamp pad	-1
Must have received a bad batch. Super runny and bubbly. Not worth the trouble sending it back. I'll use it as an adhesive.	-1
made my pictures run the ink, never had this happen before!!!!!	-1
I have been using this product for many years with mostly good results.  I order a new bottle every few weeks.  My latest order came with a new style applicator cap.  The cap has a permanent hole in the top.  Diamond glaze needs to remain tightly capped when not in use.  Why would they change the design to a top that is ALWAYS open?  I salvaged the cap from my last bottle but it doesn't fit quite properly.  I suppose that I can tape the top closed but it's idiotic that I have to start doing so.  This has to be about the most moronic design change that they could possibly have come up.	-1
I used this on bottle caps and they looked great. I gave them to all my friends and my daughters' friends only to see them a month later yellowed. They looked really dirty and just plain bad. I would not recommend this product for bottlecap charms. I now use sun and moon glaze and have had great results. Also, if someone is thinking I got a hold of a bad bottle, I went through several bottles before I realized it yellowed.	-1
Marvy Uchida has always been a good brand in the crafting industry.  However, I was instantly disappointed when using the punch for the first time, when it failed to cut and caused the paper to hang up and tear.  This prompted me to purchase a die cutting machine which I had been putting off for some time.	-1
The punch cannot give a clean cut and is rusty. Don't waste your money on this punch. I would have given it a minus 1 star if I could.	-1
Worked great for about a minute, but I find it more efficient to just directly toss cash from my wallet into the trash.	-1
For the price it should have some type of padding underneath to prevent from moving. It's like a piece of paper very thin.	-1
I have a glass pane on my work table with white paper underneath. I spray rubbing alcohol and it's completely clean.	-1
Easily the most overrated craft tool I've ever stumbled upon. I kept seeing this mat in a lot of crafty Youtubers I follow and thought I should get one to protect my craft desk and make cleanup a snap. I should've paid more attention. This isn't so much a mat as it is a sheet of plastic paper. I mean, I have placemats with more substance and I got them cheaper from Ross.  Do you have a cheap silicone mat from the dollar store? Parchment paper? Do you have access to a laminator you can use to laminate a 12x12 piece of paper? Congratulations - you've got yourself a freakin' craft mat dupe. If I hadn't thrown the box away immediately after receiving this, I would have certainly sent this back. $14 for this is highway robbery. I promise you, you don't need this - go buy yourself a nice stamp set instead.	-1
I already owned one Ranger craft sheet.  I expected this one to be of equal quality. The only resemblance is the color.  This mat is very, very thin.  It doesn't some near my first one.	-1
Was like a piece of wax paper.  Had to throw away after first use, couldn't get it clean from stamping	-1
an Amazon purchase is ALWAYS a great idea, but not every item - anywhere - is...my money for this item was pleasantly refunded to me since it did not live up to my expectations. Another excellent reason to choose Amazon and it's sellers.	-1
This came via mail and was flattened when I got it. Since they cannot be folded, but need to be rolled, it cracked the mat every inch or so. Not happy about it and should have returned it, but didn't want to go through the hassle! Otherwise, these sheets are fabulous for using glue that can be wiped off the mat--and many other uses--a necessity for any crafter. Would recommend you take the trip to JoAnne's to purchase. To be fair to the seller, however, I did not try to resolve my dissatisfaction with them.	-1
I would rate this higher, but the sheet was very crumbled because the box was crumbled. There were also crimps on corners. I will use it. It still serves its purpose.	-1
I received this as a gift. I think it is a fake product.  It does not come in Ranger packaging, it appears to be cut by hand from a larger sheet and was rolled up and taped with scotch tape.  The insert (which is a printout) says it is made in the USA but has no indications that it is from Ranger.  It is very thin and showed obvious signs of wear when I unrolled it. I hope no one else buys this fake product.	-1
I'm not sure what I got. But it is definitely not the RANGER product that was shown in the picture when I purchased it. As many of the reviews before me indicated, I was expecting the RANGER boxed product like you see sold in the craft stores. What I got was a sheet that was cut from a roll (of I'm not sure what) and no packaging (other than what was used to ship this sheet to me). Not to mention, it had some wrinkles in it and where it was cut had tattered edges. I didn't want to waste my time to return it as I saw the hassle someone else went through so I am eating up as a learning lesson. But I do want my story shared to hopefully save someone else the time, money, and disappointment.  As for the product, I used it for a ink stamping project and the ink has stained it. Did not wipe off easily so I am afraid to use for any heat embossing projects.	-1
Do not buy this, from Limited Don it's not a Ranger craft sheet.  It showed up in my search and I know it's my own fault for not double checking.  It comes packed in a cardboard tube, not Ranger box.  It is not shiny like the Ranger sheets are.  It's a flat out knock-off.  Edited to Add *I've tried to report it to Amazon but since he's a third seller they keep telling me to contact him.	-1
This sheet was so thin I could see through it..... Don't waste your money. Even though it was inexpensive its still a waste. It is also NOT a ranger product. They would be embarresed to put their name on this.	-1
As a frugal journaler and artist, I look for products that I can add to my toolkit for use in my studio. I was silly enough to think that I had to actually pay for "name brand" products such as this to include. This product breaks down too quickly (I've owned it for less than a year) and it is already breaking down with moderate use. I have found that there are alternatives for MUCH less within the Amazon marketplace such as (Non-stick Oven Liners) that have worked beautifully.	-1
Ok so I placed my order through Werner Imports. The craft sheet came in a brown cardboard box folded up and creased. That wasn't the problem... Water goes through my craft sheet. I was mixing pearl ex, gum arabic, and water. I mixed everything and then noticed that I didn't really have a lot of paint so I lifted my craft sheet and noticed that there was paint on my desk. It's just not what I was expecting. I bought this just because it was water proof. Well mine isn't and I'm not happy.	-1
I have no idea why people are so in love with this product.  It is the most flimsy thing I've ever purchased for the price.  Its extremely thin, there is nothing on one side to keep it anchored to your work surface, and its just way too over priced for what you get.  It probably costs them .25 cents per sheet to make in China.	-1
40 piece set is $66.00 and 84 piece set is $171? Something is definitely wrong with this math.	-1
Crayolas are not as good as they used to be and this brand isn't as good as Crayola presently is.  (mine also arrived broken but since the ends were missing from the box, that's from the manufacturer)	-1
Sadly our cats didn't enjoy this toy.  However, it's possible that your's will.	-1
The idea of a crochet hook that lights up is interesting, but the hook isn't well-formed or easy to crochet with.	-1
I love the light but really hope another manufacturer or the patent holder decides to come up with a better execution of the design. The "hook" itself (at least on the one I purchased) really didn't have a hook to speak of. Most of the space for the yarn was filled with plastic. I can tell the grip would be very comfy for some but it was just the wrong design for my hand. I had a hard time deciding whether I should sell it (which I did) or keep it because the light really is so awesome it *almost* made it worth it.	-1
Doesn't really make it easier to see your crochet in the dark.  I actually didn't realize this was a light up hook until I received it.  I bought it mainly because I had a hard time finding a 4.5mm hook otherwise.  Regardless of it not lighting up the work area well, I don't care for it mainly because of the material the hook is made out of.  It's not as smooth as most hooks and makes it difficult to push it through tight stitches, which I require since I make mostly amigurumi.	-1
I purchased this to use with darker color yarns. It works as a crochet needle but when the light is on it is more blinding to your eye than helping with the darker color yarn. It is a shame I can't return it but I would not purchase it again.	-1
The light is too bright. If it was a bit dimmer at the tip it would be easier to use. It is so bright you can't see the yarn stitch. Not impressed at all.	-1
Sent it back It doesn't work Defective Very dissappointed	-1
I had such high hopes for this crochet hook. I crochet at night mostly and I don't have the best lighting in my home. When I work with dark yarn colors it's more difficult. I thought this would  be my problem solver, but it actually makes it worse. It's almost blinding. So disappointed.	-1
Returned. Meir. It like the feel of the hook. Was awakaward shape	-1
Was not impressed...	-1
Light was great, however too much cushion on hook.  Hard to hold stitches	-1
I don't like it because the handle is uncomfortable	-1
The lighted hook is a nice idea, but the end of the plastic hook is NOT smooth and catches on the yarn as I'm trying to work the stitches....Disappointing.  I'll stick with my plain old aluminum hooks that have never given me a moment's trouble.	-1
Many bits and pieces missing, not happy at all	-1
This ring sizer is off by like a 1/4 size. So lame. If I had bought an expensive ring based on this, I would have been so upset!! Do not buy this!!! Instead get the purple plastic one on Amazon as that one is accurate. I tested it with my vintage ring mandrel that my Grandma gave me from working at a diamond company back in the day.	-1
Bizarre choices of sizes.  Ex: 4, 4 1/4 but no  4 1/2. (why no 4 1/2?)  5 is OK (3 fractional sizes).  6, 6 1/4, BUT no 6 1/2. (why no 6 1/2)  7 and 8 are OK (whole, 1/4 and 1/2)  9, 9 1/4, BUT no 9 1/2 (why no 9 1/2?)  10, 10 1/4, but no 10 1/2.(why no 10 1/2?)  I might understand the larger sizes not being that complete, but the more common sizes are missing!!  Would not buy again...weird sizes. AND stupid rings slide around like crazy making this hard to use. Metal is not sharp. Very disappointed at the missing sizes.	-1
What a disappointment but I knew better....I read the reviews prior to this purchase and found that many were claiming wrong sizing but took the chance anyway. I blame myself for believing it was a "fluke" for others but it is the manufacturer. The sizes are a mess. Mine in most cases was a 1/4 less than the marked size and it other cases 1/2 size. It made me dizzy trying to figure if I had all the sizes and just decided it was not worth it. I do not want to spend time remarking something so I have returned it. I will try to find a more accurate sizer even if it will cost more for ultimately the quality and accuracy is EVERYTHING that I am looking for. This manufacturer needs to wake up and rework this sizing for the metal used is perfect. It is not cheap at all. This is why it was hard to return--the quality of the metal is ideal and I hope I can somehow find both next time around....We shall see....	-1
Other than being flimsy, it's just a piece of junk. It hardly works; after even a few uses, it barley cuts thread. It is cheap junk that isn't even worth the cheap price I paid for it.	-1
For the price,  ok. But very very thin and weak. I even had a 'bendy' one when I was simply attempting to thread it - which is a mofo, regardless of size . Wouldn't re-purchase.	-1
I like that there are several sizes (in terms of needle length and thickness) in here, but there's not much range in the threading holes.  They are mostly tiny, and a few have huge holes.  All if the thinner needles have very small holes.  You'll need a threader tool and they aren't ideal for thicker threads	-1
It took me an hour to get the top of the compact to move into position so I could remove a needle, and then four needles came out all at once. This is one of the worst products I have purchased recently, but fortunately it is inexpensive. I do not recommend this to anyone who has hand or wrist issues, as it is difficult to operate and the edges of the compact made my fingers sore. I wish I had just bought a regular assortment of needles in a paper wrapper, but I was in a hurry and just grabbed this mess off of the display, figuring that if it was made by Singer it would be a superior product. Boy, was I wrong!	-1
poor quality. easily stretches out of shape	-1
Not the size indicated.  I would probably order these if they were REALLY that small, but much too big to make earrings from these.  They are more like double the size indicated.	-1
These are not sterling silver!	-1
Short string	-1
