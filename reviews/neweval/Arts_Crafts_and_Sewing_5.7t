I love this brush. It was expensive but well worth it. It holds paint wonderfully and has definitely improved my painting. I recommend it highly. Even though it was shipped from Great Britain, it arrived in about 2 weeks. Very pleased.	1
Winsor & Newton Series 7 Kolinsky Sable Water Colour Brushes are by far the best brush I have ever used for smooth flow and control, and in keeping its original shape and point which is so very important in areas of fine detail. These brushes also have a longevity that is far greater than other brands touted as being similar in quality.	1
wonderful, freeing, friendly brush you must try to appeciate.	1
Works like a dream on the paper.	1
This is perfect for miniature oil painting. Shipment was great.	1
For professional artists, this is the only brush to have.	1

Takes a bit to get them started, and they aren't smooth.  Not sure how much I'll actually use them.	1

Wrong size.  I wanted size 1, don't know why I was sent size 6...need to return.	-1
Best brush for the money	1
when I got this, one or two of the hairs were sticking out and messing up my inking. I clipped the hairs and now the brush works like a charm. A great size for comic artists, its line varies from super-thin to nice and chunky.	1
Brush shipped in a padded envelope (manilla-air type), inside a Windsor and Newton storage/shipping tube (big enough to hold the brush and protect it, not one of those courier tubes), and the brush had the brush cap (small plastic tube that only covers the brush).  The brush cap is thick and well made, and doesn't appear like it's going to come off during shipping, and the actual tube for the entire brush is pretty sturdy.  I wasn't sure about buying a brush sight unseen, but this was a great purchase.  Holds its' point, well made, and overall a really high-quality brush.  Willing to buy the 3/0 and 4/0 when they are back in stock.  Also, please ignore the 1 star review where someone was upset that Amazon didn't give them the "customer is always right" treatment.  2/0 and 00 are the same thing, so the customer, in that case, was completely wrong, and seems to have copped an attitude about it; I don't see anything in that review that has anything to do with the brush being defective or bad in any way.	1
I am an oil painter and I do very detailed work. I have been using these brushes for years. They are by far the best I have found...well worth the money.	1
I've used this brush for 40 years in my cartooning work and have always been pleased.  When I was unable to order some new ones from US suppliers recently, I was able to obtain some through Amazon from a British supplier.  The only reason I'm subtracting a star in this rating is that during shipping the small package was crushed a bit, and the ferrule on one of the brushes arrived seriously bent.	1
It was larger than I wanted, but that's my fault for not researching. Beautiful brush. I also purchased a Raphael just a little bit smaller, they are less expensive than the WNs and just as good.	1
What more can I say, this series of Brushes are the best around. They are a bit expensive but well worth it.	1
This brush is amazing and its quality cannot be denied. That said, I recommend that any detail painters (such as mini/comic fans) Try the size 2 brush before this one. You will find the point just as precise, and the size 2 holds more liquid so your medium doesn't dry as fast on the brush.	1
This brush is AMAZING! I've never been happier with a miniature brush (including the artist brushes that consist of 2 hairs tied together :P ).	1
Youwould think craft stores which sell cross stitch material would sell the needles...not.  I went to several locations with no success...I then turned online to get what I needed.  I received in a timely fashion and am quite happy with the results.  Thank you very much as now I can cross stitch to my heart's content!!	1
just about need another pack as careless as I am with them.  Always good to have spares around the house.	1
So I cross stitch all the time.  Can you believe I went to 3 stores that sell cross stitch kits and they only had sharp needles.  Sharps hurt my fingers and don't slide as nicely as they seem to get caught in every little fiber.  these needles are amazing, they slide so nicely, make me go faster than sharps and are very easy to thread.  If you cross stich, I higly recommend these needles...enjoy stitching	1
Love them, so happy to find a place where I can order them again.	1

I use these with a mixture of sewing. embroidery paints, pastels, and scribbles and they turn out great.  Everyone that sees them likes them.	1
they are easy to use and work great	1
they are easy to use and work great	1
glad to receive this	1
I had no problem with them and they did a great job!	1
All pieces there and arrived quickly!	1
Came quickly and package contained everything!!	1
I enjoy working with these paints and like having lots of color choices.	1
I enjoy these paints. Tips do need changing when they wear down.	1
I trust Kolinsky Sable brushes and they last a long time with care. I look forward to keeping it with me for all my watercolur fun.	1
Small detailed lines uniformly rendered are important to you? Then this is the brush you need. Often imitated but never duplicated. Bite the bullet and spend a few bucks up front for the brush that out performs all the rest.	1
These are splendid brushes that will last for a long time if properly cared for. I paint miniatures and these are the best I hae ever used and well worth the money.	1
This brush is perfect. Mine has outlasted many cheaper brushes and was easier to maintain and clean. I found that when I clean it, paint residue slides out of the bristles much easier than cheap brushes. Almost nothing sticks to the sable hair and it retains its original color and springiness over time.  Be careful and take good care of it, but in my experience so far, it's actually easier to take care of, so don't stress about it.	1
This is my favorite watercolor brush in my collection.  I buy a new size one about once a year because I wear them out I paint so much.  That is NOT because they are bad brushes.  They are amazing.  They keep their point up until the bitter end allowing me to do very detailed and precise work.  There are few things more beautiful than a brand new Series 7 brush.  This one came all the way from the UK and it came to me quickly and in very good shape.  I love it and I'd buy from this seller again.	1
I buy a new one of these brushes every year because I paint so much and a size 0 is so delicate and fine I wear them out easily.  But that is just me.  I would wear out ANY brush.  These keep a point better than any brush I have ever tried.  I can get great detail with this tiny brush and with the excellent point it's almost like I am drawing it.  I have used no other watercolor brushes except Series 7 by Winsor & Newton for 25 years.  I was having trouble finding them and was glad to find them through Amazon.  It is a lovely brush.	1
I'm using these for my Reaper Bones Kickstarter miniatures.  I just went to the local craft store and got some beginner brushes, which were adequate for my learning process.  My beginner brushes began to develop a curl or hook at their tips.  This makes any detail work impossible.  I'd trim the hook off and it would just develop again over time.  The W&N brush, though is fabulous at holding paint and transferring it to the mini.  I'll continue to use the older brushes for basecoats, but after that I'll use the kolinsky brushes for everything else.	1
This is the best brush for violin varnish touch-up, but it's probably the biggest size you will need before switching to flat brushes. This size is perfect for re-coloring the edge of a violin in one stroke.	1
This is the best brush you can use for violin varnish touch-up. You'll need a lot of sizes but this one is great for touching up moderate sized cracks and scratches. I highly recommend getting some of "the masters" brush cleaner along with this to keep the bristles like new.	1
Good Product. Been Using Martha's for a while.	1
Liked the Colors .	1
Perfect as always!	1
Love them	1
I am very pleased with both the 8-pack of both packs I ordered  have made a couple of sweaters and waiting on the flour sack towels to do more I want to get some more colors to	1
So easy to use. love the fact you can use them on so many different mediums.	1
Arrived promptly. Exactly what I asked for. Best price I could find it for online.  These brushes are the best brush anywhere for fine detail and control. I won't use anything else. They're expensive though. This one was a really good price.	1
I love these brushes,but I could ink with any round tip brush. You can get to your destination on any kind of bicycle .	1
If you need a brush that will hold a hairline point and deliver the paint in a constant regulated flow then this is the brush for you.  I have not found any better.	1
It's perfect for rather small paintings, especially leaves, palm fronds and flowers and can get in between for shadows with it's tip.  I use a bigger brush for a larger wash, such as sky.	1
not what we thought we were getting very  unhappy could have bought it any where for that  price not a deal	-1
In my opinion, the Series 7 is the best watercolor brush available. I use them exclusively for my rounds because they are excellently flexible and hold a point perfectly.	1
I have been using W&N series 7 brushes for years. They are excellent brushes. I use mine for inking comic books, so they get beat up pretty bad if you don't take care of them. But for watercolor, these brushes will last a super long time if properly cared for (Can't say forever cause eventually they will wear out) I actually use the size 0 and size 2, but I wanted to make sure there was an actual product review on here, so people didn't just see the 1 star review from an angry misinformed customer and be turned away from this fantastic product. Poor information and bad customer service does not make the product unworthy of purchase.	1
I didn't have any trouble with mine I am a satisfied customer	1
it is a good deal and they were all fine I had read where other people had trouble but I tried them anyway & I am happy	1
Very fun.	1
Very fun.	1
There's a reason everyone who still uses a brush to ink comics uses THIS brush:  it's perfect for the job.  It holds a point every bit as fine as that on much smaller brushes, but due to its size, the bell holds far more ink (or paint, if you're using the brush for watercolor) than the tiny brushes marketed towards painters of miniatures.  The W&N Series 7 No. 2 has been the comic book artist's inking brush of choice for decades, and it remains the best choice for the task.  I simply can't praise it enough.  And as an aside, if you're an aspiring comics artist and not sure whether or not you even want to try mastering the brush, try it with THIS brush:  it's so well-suited to the job that it makes learning far easier than you'd expect.	1
This brush was part of my second set of W&N series 7 brushes. I use them for painting miniatures. There's not a lot of consensus among miniature painters on many things, but I've never heard to the series 7 referred to as anything but "the best" or "among the very best" brushes for the task.  My first Series 7 brushes lasted for almost 4 years (They are still useable now, but can no longer hold the fine point needed for detail work). They're pricey, but well worth it,	1
These are great brushes and at a great price could not ask for more. They work real great for line work on ink and also watercolor.	1
I use black india ink (windsor newton brand) and these brushes work great.  Tip: To keep the point in the brush, lightly cleanse the brush in water and then shape the point with your tongue. If you are using India ink it can taste like a tiny skunk fart, but it's not too bad and the brush lasts longer and is ready for the next round of inking.  These brushes are a great price with some secondary sellers on Amazon.	1
I intended to order a W & N Series 7 size #2 brush. The item was advertised as size 2/0. What arrived was a #00, according to the packaging and the writing on the brush itself. Customer service was of little help, insisting that 2/0 and 00 are the same. That may be, but it strikes me as vague and misleading and I would have liked a bit more of "the customer is always right" and a bit less of "haha, that's why you shouldn't buy stuff on the internet, sucker!"	-1
very deceving, I, as well, thought  that I am buing seiries of 7 brushes, but received just one brush that is grossly overpriced. you can get brush like this one at  Dick Blick store on line for a fraction of this price. very disappointed, very manipulative seller.  eva	-1
I bought this brush on the advice of experianced miniature painters and am not disappointed. The brush holds water well, bringing the tip to a nice point, and makes the colours flow off the brush much smoother than a teeny-tiny brush does. Definitely worth the money to get a better brush!	1
I use this to paint 25mm scale minis. Great brush. Tip stays true and pointy, holds good amount of paint, proper pressure spreads bristles out to cover larger areas. I use this bruch for 98% of the painting and then go to a smaller brush for eyes and minutiae.	1
They are expensive but they are so worth the money. You must takes really good care of them. They are hand made and they real hair of the red sable squirrel. I only use my series 7s for watercolor only. Some professionals use them for inking also. They are great for ink but they will destroy them over a couple uses.	1
Very fun.	1
I don't know why but I was not expecting a smell like I would with spray paint. These stink and gave me a really bad headache the first day I used them. I decided to move my embroidery painting out to my sunroom where there is a lot of airflow and I don't get dizzy using these. I did have a couple where the paint wouldn't come out, I followed the directions that came with and used the end of a paper clip to get the ball rolling and paint flowing. I like this, it is very easy to use, and after finishing 1 dresser scarf I have plenty of paint to paint several more scarves if I chose so.	1
They worked fine.	1
Was good.	1
These are wonderful colors and do a fine job of helping me bring to life the various projects I have been creating for family members.	1
Good starter set.	1

This glue works great.  It bonds anything foam and I use it on foam craft balls.  It dries quickly and holds great!	1
I love this stuff! I do lots things with craft foam and this is the only thing that truly holds without making a mess. Regular glue works but sometimes there are pieces that other glues won't make stick and that's when I use this product, I don't use all the time because of the price. I have tried several other glues, Elmer's school, Elmer's extreme (both stick and liquid), Elmer's glue all, Arlene's tacky, etc and this always holds!	1
Just what I needed for my project. Fairly easy to use.  Fast shipping!!	1
Love these colors! Fairly easy to use. Fast shipping!!!	1

These don't start very well, 3 of the 5 I tried either ran fluid only, no color, or did not write after a LONG time "priming" them.	-1
This is a great product at a fantastic price, and I bought the extra tips as well, so why 4 stars instead of 5?  Because for 30 plus years I have been, (and always will use), Tri-Chem paints first and foremost... but the cost is 4 or even 5 times higher... so when someone that I know wants to "try" my paints to make a custom t-shirt, or quilt panel, etc, I buy them a set of Aunt Martha's.  They are a fantastic substitute, a good starter set, and they fade only a little faster than the Tri-Chems over the years... but for the money, or if you are just going to dabble with a couple of shirts, this is the way to go.  I am not knocking this product in any way shape or form, I just prefer the others for my own work, but I have bought several of the Aunt Martha's sets this year alone.  So try it, and don't be afraid to take a chance. Seriously though, buy at least two sets of the extra tips, as if you get hooked on this, you will need them. Painting on fabric is like drawing on fine sandpaper with a ball point pen, the heat and the friction wears out the tips long before the tube is empty, its the same with all paint tubes like these, so stock up!  You will be happier if you have the new tips at hand instead of having to order them after the fact.	1

Provides me with the colours I need.	1
So far worked good	1
I have used only this product because they give me the quality work I require.	1
these are working out great my daughter is teaching my granddaughter how to do this as she had done this when she was growing up and is now passing it on to her daughter.	1
Beautiful colors that don't bleed or wash out!	1
Perfect for decorating T-shirts and baby clothing!	1
I used to use these all the time with my grandma in the 70's.  We made pillowcases,  quilts,  doll clothes,  etc.  that are still in use today.  I even have quite a few of the old tubes that still have the paint in them (unfortunately,  the tips are dried shut so they can't be used).  These pens tubes look the same and the paint smells the same (when you can get it out)  but they do not work the same.  I was able to draw a single piece of fabric before giving up.  The paint doesn't flow at all.  If I  prime it on paper,  it appears to be flowing fine,  but the moment I start on fabric,  forget it.  It's like the ball point stops moving and all you get is scratchy,  messy paint that is uneven and looks bad.  I've gotten better results using a plain old sharpie.  I've tried with every imaginable type of fabric and in every conceivable surface.  There is marginal improvement if you stretch the fabric very tighly with an embroidery hoop and then somehow push down on a rough surface.  But these are nothing like the "liquid embroidery" pens of the past.  The only good thing I can say is that if you can get the ink out and you set it with an iron when you're done,  it holds up very well with no fading,  cracking ir bleeding.	-1
I bought these as a Christmas gift for my daughter as I used to do tube painting with my own mother.  They are very nice and I received them in a very timely manner.  I plan purchasing more of the paint colors!	1

These are awful! The paint doesn't come out and you have to push down super hard to get anything out, and even then it's not great.  It looks sloppy.	-1
I just wish there was a much larger variety of colors!  I love embroidery painting!  I would like some glitter colors too.	1
I just wish I could get a bigger variety of colors.  If there are more please let me know, because I love painting.	1
Disappointed that I can't just buy one pen replacement.  Every local craft store sells only the box sets.  And, they are really not that easy to use.  You don't get a fine line.  They don't all flow evenly and fluidly.  Depending upon the fabric, I'm sure, its difficult to get it tight enough (tea towels - cotton) and it moves around, so you can end with fat lines and then thin lines.  So, no consistency in workability of the pens themselves.  You are not supposed to "squeeze" the tube when using it, which is nearly impossible.  And then you have to sometime push down so hard on the tip to get them to work that it's nearly impossible to only squeeze "gently."  A couple out of the box worked fairly well and I caught a quickly but fleeting glimpse of how fun these pens could be.  But, the rest worked just awful to be honest.  In addition, if you have any hand pain or arthritis issues, this is not a craft for you.  I'm not elderly, but I have hand pain issues, and after only a short time of use with the unease of the pens, my hands are really hurting.	-1
This was just so-so as some of the paint tubes are very difficult to get paint started . I have had these a few years ago and all worked fine. Not so pleased with this pack. The colors are nice but need to be able to use more easily.	1
You can use these "pens" to decorate all kinda of stuff but you can surely make some one of a kind T-shirts and other clothing with them. Do your own flowers, rainbows or any other symbols with much less effort that actual embroidery requires.	1
This paint is as good as I remember from when I was a kid it goes onto fabric great and last forever I have tea towels that my grandma made before I was born. I'm making things for my grand children that should last for their children. This is the best paint for the long haul. Oh I would get the plastic sleeves for the paint tubes they help to keep you from crushing the tube near the tip.	1

i love them they are everything i remember.from when i was a kid and my mom used to do them.	1
They work well.  You have to practice with them first to get a feel for the pressure and how much coverage you can get out of each pen.	1
I bought these for finishing my embroidery items. Now my daughter uses them to paint and draw on tote bags she sells at the fairs. Great product. i used them first in the 50's and liked them then. Since I really didn't want to embroider the items I had because they were too old, I bought these again because it went faster.	1

I found these by accident, I had some of these years ago. I intend to make some craft items to sell at swap meets also intend to make wall hangings for new babies room. They are much faster than embroidery.	1
Sand before staining or painting. Otherwise happy with this.	1
Nice flat piece of wood.  Will be turned into a sign, is exactly what I needed.	1
Exactly how I expected it	1
Did not realize it came with beveled edges. Had to sand them down to make it a regular square shape, and I also had to sand the top, because there were burrs and a very rough texture to it.	-1
This is the perfect little piece of wood for the project I was working on. I wanted wood to paint and then place some vinyl letters over it and it looks great. It is not the heaviest or sturdiest piece of wood, but for the price, it's perfect. Unlike other reviewers, mine was one piece of wood, not several pieces stuck together.	1
Nice	1
Exactly what was described! Great shipping!	1
Great for Burning	1
Love it , use it for watercoloring	1
Great pen.	1

Had a marker like this before and I needed another one it is just a great color use it alot in my scrapbooking.	1
I simply love the slender "le pens" by Uchida but thjs pen by Uchids leaves me mystified.  I don't find the ink at all vibrant, as is the case for the hundreds of "le pens" I own.  The double tip is of no use to me whatsoever.  Besides, they were all dried out in at least two of the four I ordered.  I'm sticking with "le pens".	-1
I love Uchida's "le pens" and have ordered hundreds and given them as gifts, to enthusiastic recipients.  However, these don't even begin to compare, in my opinion.  Rather dull colors, a "mystery" tip and two of the four I received had already dried up/out.	-1
these leave me completely baffled.  The tip at the opposite end of the pen eludes me and besides, it was all dried up when I received the pen in the mail.	-1
I cannot even figure out what the other tip is for and besides, for whatever purpose, I received it all dried up.	-1
Unlike the Uchida "le pen", I didn't care for this product by Uchida at all.  One end is different than the other and it seems quite useless to me.  I don't care for either the colors or the feel of the pen, either.  Sorry, Uchida.  Or maybe I just don't get it?!	-1
Marvy Uchida's "Le Plume II" is a water-based marker. Cherry is a classic red. I find these markers quite useful, especially for creating custom fabric prints or dyeing small amounts of fabric.  PROS:  * They can be used on a variety of surfaces, such as fabric or paper/cardboard.  * Includes two tips. The fine-tip has a narrow, hard point, good for drawing thin lines or detail work. The brush tip is softer and wider, more like a small paintbrush. It's good for broad, heavy strokes, or for coloring an area in.  * No odor! This doesn't mean the vapors are safe to inhale, it just means they don't stink dreadfully when you uncap them.  * They come in a wide range of colors. If the exact hue you need doesn't exist, you can always blend two or three markers together to create just the right color. They even make a colorless blending marker, which is useful for ombre dyeing.  CONS:  * The color of the cap isn't necessarily the color the ink will be. It will lighten as it dries, and sometimes the color will change, too. Always do a test swatch using the same material you'll be working with, just to be sure.  In general, these are good, dependable markers. I have no complaints. Highly recommended!	1
Uchida's Le Plume II is a water-based marker that can be used on a variety of surfaces, including paper and fabric. I own several different colors and use them to dye or hand-paint custom fabrics. The marker has two tips: fine-point, which is very small and hard, like a felt-tip pen, and a brush-tip, which is softer and large, more like a paintbrush. I like that you can pick which tip you want to work with, depending on your needs. I also appreciate that, unlike other fabric markers by the same company, the Le Plume II has no odor. This doesn't mean they're safe to inhale (always work in a ventilated area), but it does mean you're not gagging on the scent the whole time.  These markers come in many different colors. When I did a test sample on muslin, English Red turned out exactly how I wanted, a lovely dark wine-red. When I used the marker to dye a pair of satin doll shoes, however, the color dried a dark reddish-purple. I have no idea why the color changed so drastically! Perhaps it was a reaction to some chemical in the satin? It turned out useless for my project, but I'm hoping to fix the shoes by over-dyeing them with a cherry red marker. In any case, be aware that colors can turn out differently on various fabrics, so always do a test sample on the fabric you're using, if at all possible.  I'll subtract a star for the unfortunate color problem, but otherwise, Le Plume II markers are wonderful. Highly recommended!	1
Good Product	1
i typically love this brand of brushes.  the brushes in the 1177 set shed like crazy.  i used the brushes for art (acrylic paintings) and the white nylon is always perfect while these were a disappointment with all the constant fibers that end up on the canvas.  ugh	-1
My teacher thoughtlessly asked us to get huge brushes.  These are huge.  Now she says they are too big.  LOL.  The smallest one is what she had in mind.  That being said, I am glad I can do washes of large paper areas.  This brand is recommended by my teacher because of the softness, and the great points.	1
They look just fine for me but like I said I am a beginner in this field. I did see that my teacher used one of these brushes to wash the background of a watercolor picture.	1
Probably not the best brushes for fine art, or for wall-painting either; but excellent for decoupage. Brushes on the Mod Podge smoothly, rinses easily; and because the brushes are only a quarter of an inch or so thick, there's not a lot of waste. The bristles don't come loose the way they do in some cheap brushes. A very good purchase overall.	1
I have several set of these and keep buy more because they are so useful in the studio. I paint with the 1 inch ones, mostly in acrylics, use the 2 inch for glazing in oils and acrylics and use the 3 inch for grounding canvas. The are uniform in quality and easy to clean. A very good buy.	1
These brushes are loved by miniature painters world over for their quality and they are what they say they are. I've used these a long time. These are the best sable brushes you can get. Others compare (Raphael, DaVinci, Rosemary Co.) but these hit every mark. I could do practically everything on a miniature with a size #0. Minus one star for price.	1
Brush came with the bristles bent backwards in the protective cover.	-1
The brush is simple, yet elegant.  Holds paint very well, bristles have much spring,  and the point retains its shape superbly.	1
What can you say except buy this item. I do modeling for miniatures and the quality of this brush is excellent	1
like it.	1
These brushes are excellent, some of the best you can buy. Unfortunately, some of the brushes I was sent were used. That's right, used. They had dirty frayed hair. So, I had to send half the batch back for a return. I am not sure how to rate this, 5 for a great product or 1 for being sent used paint brushes?	1
I am really horrified at the quality of these brushes. I ordered the #1 and #2 size. The attached photo is after ONE use, and I am a gentle painter. I was using them with Winsor Newton watercolors. As you can see, they are horribly split and frayed. My WN Cotman brushes are much better. I am so confused as to the poor quality...did I receive fakes? Conditioning did not help. I can't get them back to any sort of point after just one gentle use. Buyer beware.	-1
Love the performance with  watercolor	1
LOVE these brushes for detail. Great price!	1
Good quality brush set.	1
If you are looking for gesso brushes these are pretty good. I've lost only a few hairs from each brush for the first use but they aren't causing me a big problem (big brushes shed and there's nothing to be done about it). Hairs in gesso aren't hard to remove when it's still wet. These brushes are also really good for watercolor washes. They do exactly what I needed them to do and they didn't break the bank.	1
I love these brushes for touch ups.  They wash very easily and keeps its shape.	1
I'm please with the purchase! Quality brushes at a fantastic price! Would definitely buy these brushes again!	1
I like these brushes.  I used them to apply a sealant to some clay dog footprints that I did for Christmas presents and these brushes worked great.	1
These work great, for painting large canvases. The brushes or so soft, and so far they haven't been shedding, which is great.	1
First of all - Winsor & Newton is an excellent brand on every level, especially for the quality and presentation of their products. As a fine artist, my absolute favorite brush is a Winsor & Newton Series 7.  However, this seller is sending fake-outs, factory rejects, or something similar.  The #2 brush arrived, crushed, in an envelope. The hairs were splayed, the ferrule was bent, the handle was scratched up, and the tube that holds the brush was just taped at the ends, instead of having the end caps they normally come with. The hairs are the biggest problem, though. Even after using Masters brush soap to condition the splayed hairs, the brush is useless. Winsor & Newton pride themselves on the brushes holding a sharp point, but the hairs of this knockoff brush want nothing to do with each other, splayed out in every direction, and refusing to hold paint.  I will be ordering Winsor & Newton brushes again, but not from this seller.	-1
These are great. I prefer the one labeled miniature because the hairs are shorter.	1
Couldn't be happier	1
Awful.  I should have returned this guy.  Out of the packaging it was already split, but I thought my conditioner would get it into a nice point after reading so many good reviews.  I still used this brush all the time to justify its price, but it honestly works as well if not worse than my pack of 15 brushes I already owned for half the price.  Stay away.	-1
After everyone telling me "this is THE brush you need for miniatures", I bought one. What a waste of money. It's soft. Only slightly springier than camel hair and holds a tip just as poorly. I've spent two weeks conditioning the brush everyday with masters trying to lock into a nice tip. It can only hold a tip for about three strokes. I spend more time fiddling with the brush than painting.  The most expensive brush I own will now be regulated to the only thing it can do well. Drybrush.	-1
Product was in original plastic tube, was well packaged and arrived on time. Thanks.	1
Really pretty unhappy with the brush.  Tended to split right away.  After talking with other painters, Winsor Newton 7's may have a quality control issue.  Some are very good, but some are just junk.  My offbrand cheap Walmart brushes were better.  I picked up a Rosemary & Co brush for about 1/2 the price and it was so, so, so much better.	-1
Best brush I own.	1
Great brush.	1
Excellent brush	1
amazing!	1
Nice quality. Using for blending oil glazes.	1
excellent tool to paint acrylic on plywood.	1
just what I need in my watercolor washes. no hairs left behind on drawing after use and application of watercolor.	1
Good for the price.	1
Great for paper on paper crafts and preventing the warping of paper.	1
Fantastic of course! It doesn't over wet your paper, so there is no warping of your paper when you add your layers. I wish I would have found this glue sooner than I did, some of my projects would have been easier and looked more	1
This company is rediculous. This is the second time Ive ordered series 7 brushes cus they are supposed to be the best. First order #1 round was splayed all to hell. Not fixable. Second order: all the sent were the tubes. WTF!!!! There weren't even any caps where maaaaybe the brushes fell out the corner. Shipping bag was totally sealed by the way. My recommendation order from an art supply company	-1
These brushes come very highly recommended, but my first one was not very good. I've only used it twice and I have loose hairs that won't go away and the brush is already forked. I'm no novice to painting miniatures, I made absolutely sure not to get paint in the ferrule. Extremely disappointed considered how much I paid for this brush.	-1
I should've returned the brush when it arrived with a splayed tip.  I was ignorant and thought that it just needed a little conditioning and it would be fixable.  After 3 months of constantly trying to get the point to hold a shape, I've given up all hope.  I have some other W&N brushes that don't have this issue, so I guess I just got a lemon.  BE WARNED that quality control is extremely shoddy.  If your brush arrives looking like this, RETURN IT IMMEDIATELY!	-1
Bought a size 00 for painting miniatures bristles are bent and do not hold to a point. I've got better brushes from a 10 pack for $8 than this single brush, supposedly the best, for $14. Absolute trash.	-1
The best. Holds lots of water. Keeps a lovely sharp point. It's true what they say about Kolinskys. They are the best.	1
I have always heard about how awesome these are for inking and watercolor, which are my two main uses for a brush. I usually buy my brushes when they go on sale for half off so at my local art store, a brush usually costs me about 5$. So when I finally broke down and spent the money on one of these I was pretty excited to see how it would perform. In one word "Terrible"! It is by far the worst brush I have ever used and DOES NOT hold a point at all. I spent more time trying to just get this brush to hold a decent point for inking than actually inking. So frustrating to have heard so many people praising the Series 7 as the best brush around and then come to find out a size zero brush is only good for blocking in sections of black and is useless for detailed line work, that makes no sense at all. I recommend that someone looking for a brush to ink with stay away from the Series 7.	-1
I just feel like a better person when I paint with a Winsor & Newton brush. Great brush, great tip, all around worth it.	1
The best brushes ever, hold their point as well as a surprising amount of paint, and just the right snap, thank you!	1
This brush is excellent.  I mean really good. It's bigger than my other brushes and I plan on making larger strokes with it. I mean really big. And that will be excellent.	1
Good thing, but almost 1 month shipping time is way too long...	-1
Delivered as ordered.  I paint candles with this product.  Rather than replace them because of color, I just paint them and they look great.  I have never lit the candles I paint, so I don't know if that would be a problem or not.	1
These brushes cost more for a reason! I've had one of these last longer than three AC Moore $5 brushes for the use of painting Warhammer 40k models and it's still like new. Just take care of it and it'll last a long time!	1
Its a W&N #7.  Enough said.	1
Best miniature brush you can buy in my opinion. Shipping was quick and was pleased that these were the genuine article and not some knockoff (which I have gotten before).	1
Everything about this brush is top notch. I use it for miniature painting and its very versatile. It holds a point as advertised and applies paint well. I would recommend this to any level of painter. Honestly, do not do what I did and mess around with cheaper/lower quality brushes as you will just get frustrated.	1
Great!	1
los pelos de este pincel se abrieron rapidamente y no mantuvieron la forma. Hace tiempo que pinto y cuido materiales y me soprendio ver lo malos que me resultaron los Kolinsky, por el precio. They didn`t resist 2 uses, the tip lost its shape and the hairs were messy. I have been a painter all my life and I know how to take care of brushes, but for the price I would buy another brand. Won't buy this again.	-1
I got the #0 brush. It is literally the BEST brush I've ever used for painting my miniatures...  BUT...  There were initially quite a few bristles bent backwards from the bristle cap, i was able to get most of the to straighten out again, but did end up having to trim a few...	1
giving them a try	1
Nice feel and easy to use	1
EXCELLENT	1
works as stated makes my soaps stand out	1
It works!	1
Great price!	1
WORKS GOOD.	1
I had heard about the W&N Series 7and wasn't really sure I wanted to spend that kind of money to "try" a new brand of paintbrush.  But one day I decided to give it a shot for the less expensive size. I am SO glad I did! These brushes are *excellent*! Icant tell you how much I enjoy using this brush and will surely buy others. They are absolutely worth every penny!	1
Fantastic brush.	1
I want to ask people interested in sable brushes (no matter which brand) to please consider synthetic sable instead because the hair used in these brushes is gotten by extremely cruel means. Please research this for yourselves. Thank you.	-1
Good quality but I prefer Da Vinci series 35.  DV35 is softer and more responsive.	1
A Beautiful, old world, hand crafted, artist tool. Thicker handle very nice for those with large hands - makes your brushwork better -	1
I've been painting for 18 years, and can say when you get a GOOD version of this brush type, it will be the best brush you've ever owned. However, of the last three purchases of this brush, two of them have been poorly made. A brush should not splay and fishtail on day-1 of use (and this is with highly diluted acrylic paints mind you). Due to the extremely poor quality control at Winsor & Newton, I will permanently be switching to the Raphael 8404 brush series.  If you opt to buy one of these brushes, be prepared to make returns until you receive one in good condition.	-1
This brush is brand new and useless. It does not hold a point and fans out almost immediately. I am not sure if these are genuine or not because I have other Series 7 and they have been solid for years. I am seriously disappointed and would NOT buy these again.	-1
Love It !!!	1
Garbage. I'm not sure how winsor and newton series 7 quality can differ so much. I bought a size 8 from Amazon. It splits with varying degrees of water in it. I have da vinci (series 10, 11, 35) and they are BY FAR SUPERIOR and most importantly CONSISTENT. I'm returning my series 7 for another series 11 da vinci. I've noticed my escoda reserva splits, but only with lower degrees of water in the brush. When saturated it's perfect, but as the water is removed it splits. But my series 7 split literally sopping with water. When it was damp it looked like Albert Einstein. See photos of brush with varying levels of water and splitting.  With all this said, I do have a couple smaller  series 7 brushes that are fine - 0, 1, 2, 4 and 1/4 flat. But once you go above a 4 it's over. The 8 I bought from Amazon and the 10 I bought from Jerry's were both garbage and returned.  Do yourself a favor, get a da vinci. Their quality far exceeds series 7 but most importantly when you spend the money you will consistently get a great brush. Series 7 brushes of the modern era are just mass produced garbage, from a company resting on its laurels.	-1
This was bought for my Dad, who has been doing a LOT of the adult paint by number paintings lately.  I knew he would not spend this much for a brush and I wanted to get him a nice one since he is wearing out the ones that comes with the pictures and they often aren't small enough to do some of the thin line areas.  I had bought him a set for about half the price of this brush that had 00 brushes.  After hundreds of hours of painting they would no longer hold a point so I thought this would be a great surprise for him.  Boy was it a surprise he thought he had this great brush and in less than 5 minutes it started fuzzing up and he tried all the usual stuff but he could not get it back to a point.  He said if I reviewed it to give it a negative 5 stars.  Couldn't do that so it's getting a one star.  Hope this helps someone else from wasting their money.  Sad thing is his sister taught art for years and paints and twenty years ago bought a brush for $20 that she still uses so he knows a good one should last.	-1
I got this for an art class because my professor highly recommended it and kept talking about how great it was. I haven't used it much, but for the few times I have, I haven't been disappointed. I use it for inking, and it's been easy to use for both small linework & details as well as at a larger scale. Definitely worth the money, despite only having used it a few times.	1
Excellent as usual	1
Ok. I bought a size 2 and heard these were awesome brushes to ink with. Wrong. At least in my case. It doesn't keep a point at all! I bought the masters brush cleaner and didn't let ink into the ferrule and everything. So I went ahead and bought a size 1 thinking maybe the size 2 was just a dud. IT WON'T KEEP A POINT EITHER! don't waste your money.	-1
Do I need to write anything else? I think not. Buy them in every size you need!	1
These brushes are so great. I paint Warhammer 40k miniatures and these brushes turned out to be the best brushes I've ever used for the hobby! I love these brushes and will buy them again.	1
The #12 brush is very disappointing. Given the $220 cost and the reputation of Series 7, I had very high expectations. It maintains a sharp point with only the exact right amount of water, after just a couple of stokes it is spread to an unusable sharp for anything but washes - this is not what you buy a brush like this for. A good synthetic brush is a much smarter purchase.	-1
I bought this brush for an Artist friend of mine and she loves them for her water colors.	1
Great brush	1
Love these paint brushes and am very happy with the way that they are shipped to me!	1
Item worked as expected	1
Great brush!	1
Overall an excellent brush. I used this brush for painting plastic miniatures for board games and the like. Make sure to clean the brush after each use and avoid getting paint near the base of the "hair" part of the brush to ensure a long life for this brush. I recommend using Masters Brush Cleaner & Preserver, or an equivalent to clean.	1
If you looked up online everything about why this brush is amazing it's all accurate. The way this brush holds ink is crazy and even loaded up still produces the nicest line work. I have sizes 2 & 4 and I couldn't be any happier with this purchase. Well worth the money and will probably buy more sizes in the future.	1
Love all sable brushes!	1
Absolutely love this brush for painting miniatures.	1
Been using WN series 7 for many years.  They are the absolute best of all sabe brushes. This brush will make you an instant genius	1
Fantastic brush for model work. Worth the money. Paint goes on smoothly and the hairs stay attached to the brush and don't come off while painting. Would buy again and will buy others in different sizes!	1
Great professional brush.	1
Will not hold a point. Fans out in use.  This vendor should not be aloud to sale on this sight.  This item is too expensive to not work.  This is supposedly one the best Kolinsky sables on the market. Hope no one else was this unfortunate	-1
Excellent brush!	1
love it	1
Forms an excellent point and holds great water/pigment. These brushes are worth the extra money.	1
Best brush I have ever used	1
The person I purchased this for loves it.  Great quality brush	1
My daughter's Xmas request.  She was happy.	1
Yes they are expensive. I'm an experienced model builder and I want to repeat a sentiment shared by most model builders; we spend maybe $40 on a tank model, another $40 on the tracks, $20 to $30 on photo-etch and other details. Then we turn around and complain about spending $10 to $20 on a brush that we will probably use and keep for years.  Guilty as charged for many years. You will see a massive improvement in your skills when you invest  in quality tools.  You are paying for a high quality brush, not just some "artists" name with these proven brushes. Keep your brushes clean, store them hanging up and they will serve you well.	1
This brush makes me feel like a master painter. I use it a lot, and it has maintained its tip, with no curl.	1
these are really quality brushes.	1
Best brush ever	1
I purchased three of the Series 7 brushes as Citadel Artificer Layer brush equivalents after watching several reviews (including Spikey Bits) and I haven't been dissapointed yet, I really haven't noticed virtually any difference so far. After hearing the rumors that both brushes were manufactured in the same factory, I could see why someone would come to that conclusion. Other than the metal bit at the end of the Winsor & Newton brushes,  and it's slight heft compared to the Citadel brush (completely plastic) I can't notice any other significant differences.	1
Without a doubt the worst brushes I've ever used.  Obviously seconds.	-1
Purchased both a size 1 and 000.    The size 1 likes to split after one stroke like a snakes tongue, and then after the second acts like its full of static electricy ( Hairs going everywhere).  Needless to say not happy with this brush at all.    The Size 000 on the other hand works really well.    Not sure why one is good the other is trash.  Have to wash and reshape it after 2 strokes.	-1
My husband said it was the best art purchase we've made on Amazon	1
These are top-notch brushes. Having used cheap brushes for the majority of my art career, these require a slight learning curve to figure out how to use the proper tools. But they are worth it.	1
nice	1
WN series 7 brushes are the best brushes on the market. I am very pleased with the quality of this brush. What made this buy even better was the cost/value. A very reasonable price was asked..	1
I love this brush.  I never realized how bad my other brushes were until I got this one.  It holds a fine point, yet contains a lot of paint in the "reservoir".  Definitely happy I got this brush.	1
Brush is awesome!  I've just started to draw and moved into watercolors.  Brush allows you to make the delicate strokes while still being able to make broad stokes.  Highly recommend this product.	1
same quality	1
These are the best you can buy.	1
Nice!	1
This brush only lasted through one model kit. I was not impressed one bit. Most of the hair has fallen out. I have a $4.00 chinese knock off that is way better than this. Would not recommend.	-1
so far so good, works great, smooth , no bristlles falling out and no chips on the handle after it sits in water for a few..good quality	1
great brush	1
The one on top is from Amazon, and the one the bottom is from dickblick. The quality sucks on the brushes. They won't hold a tip and they split down the middle. I bought two and both come out the same. I'm not sure it's the same manufacture but they look different.brushes. Next time i'll order from dickblick.	-1
Great quality brush! I will not use any other brand of brush. These are great for line work and hold their shape.	1
Superb.	1
it's wonderful!	1
LOVE this brush! It's very high quality, no loose hairs, and perfect for details.	1
Love these brushes for oil painting detail brush, and for inking! I'm a professional artist and I find myself reaching for these brushes first, when it comes to detail work.	1
Destroying every other brush I've ever owned. I need more of these.	1
Keeps a tip well.	1
Series 7 #1 are a fantastic brush.  I use them with oil as I am a miniaturist. However they are incredible for watercolor.	1
I don't think I need to speak to the quality of Winsor & Newton Series 7 brushes; chances are if you're looking at them you already know that they're fantastic pieces of kit and a joy to work with.  You're going to pay a little more than you would otherwise but the investment is worth every penny.  What I will comment on is this was shipped and delivered promptly and more importantly in pristine condition.  I know a lot of people shy away from purchasing high end brushes for fear of damage in shipping.  The brush was capped with a protector and the whole thing was then sealed in another plastic tube.  The end result was a brush in perfect shape when it arrived on my doorstep.  No bent bristles, no smashed ferrules, just a good clean product ready for use.	1
Brand new perfect condition!	1
A good quality brush, so far. The hairs haven't fallen out, which is always a problem with thin brushes (maybe I clean them too roughly). The hairs split occasionally, but it's not constant and the split isn't too wide or unmanageable. The barrel is relatively comfortable to hold.	1
Not bad but it is not as good as what I bought before. The hair is not long and pointy enough for miniature painting.	1
Always good.	1
Great	1
It's a beautiful brush!  This is my second brush from Series 7 and it's lasted me for for quite a long time now.  Definitely worth the splurge.	1
What can I say? These are awesome brushes. My wife paints every day and loves how well these hold a tip and their shape. They outlast other brands she has tried.  I have bought a few for myself now and I love them. I even own a size 9, but I don't paint with it too much, I'm scared of ruining it it's so nice. But the size 1 and 2 are fantastic for Warhammer and inking comic pages.	1
Works great for blood rage miniatures	1
I guess they're using the logo and text font from the miniature series on the standard series as well now. At first this made me think some of these were counterfeit.	1
My wife (Lisa Hunt) has been a professional watercolor illustrator since the 1980s. The only brushes she cannot do without are her W&N Series 7s. She uses mainly the size 0 for detail work, but others as well. Her work speaks for itself.  Many of her S7 brushes have lasted for years (given the proper care), but they do need to be replaced occasionally. She feels they are worth the investment, and I agree when I see the results on paper. If you want a quality brush for controlled painting that will last years, then W&N Series 7 should be your first choice. No other brush comes close. Due to import restrictions, they were hard to find in recent years, but have once again become available. Get them while you can!  ~ Kort	1
So much better than the cheap brushes I've been using. It's been really nice to put paint where I want it, and that's really key when painting miniatures. They hold paint well and don't flood small areas when you set the tip down. It holds paint until you apply it the way you want it. If I need more brushes, I'll skip the cheapies and go with these. They're easily worth it.	1
I bought this a few weeks ago and have plenty of time to break it in with watercolours. I have been most pleased and impressed with this brush. The #00 is about the size of my other #000s which is fine, I work mostly in very small details. So do be aware if you are new to higher end brushes, the sizing starts to change or seems that way to me. Getting a different type of brush to compare so I will come back for an updated review.  First the brush came in a nice solid plastic tube which is easy to keep together and inside of while not in use, although I don't bother anymore as I usually paint on and off throughout the day.  The brush itself holds a surprising amount of liquid, had to adjust to that but it was a wonderful adjustment.  It keeps its shape very well and has beautiful spring.  One of my favorite things aside from shape and spring back, is the handle and handle shape. I don't leave my brushes in water anymore because I'm not five, I dislike wood handles still. It also has a nice thickness but not too large. Tiny hands, tiny work, tiny brush, slightly fat handle. Its nice.	1
Series 7 is the name of the brush made by Winsor Newton. It does not mean you get a set of 7 brushes! Wake up people!	1
Simply the best Kolinsky Sable brushes on the market.  They are very well made, and hold their points.  Provided they are cared for, they are also very long-lived.  Very highly recommended.	1
liked it	1
This is supposed to be the brush of choice for inking comics. I had to purchase two to get one that would maintain a point. The first, ordered from Dick Blick had a crimp and a too long stray hair at the tip, which produces a jerky, zigzaggy line. The brush I ordered through Amazon was superior. In general, it's a good idea to order three brushes at a time if you order them sight unseen online. That's just the way it is.  The Raphael Kolinsky Sable size 2 round is still my favorite brush for comic book inking, but after learning that I ought to pay close attention to the feedback from the brush, I now find that the Windsor and Newton Series 7 no 2 round is more or less equal. Brushes like the Windsor & Newton Series 7 no 2 and the Raphael Kolinsky Sable size 2 round  provide physical feedback that you won't get from a brush pen. Learning to sense the physical response from the brush will help to control the line (some artists call it "spring" or "snap" but I find that term misleading--the feedback for me is more subtle).  A lot depends on eyesight. Working with a magnifying lamp helped reduce the time it took to improve. As for knowing what to ink and how much, I have a lot to learn.  One difference between the W&N series 7 no 2 and the Raphael Kolinsky size 2 round is that the Raphael will  hold more ink in the belly, and can produce a thicker line without a dry brush effect longer than the W&N no 2. At the point that the Windsor and Newton produces a dry brush effect with thicker lines, it will continue to produce a "wet" look with thinner lines, which is useful for details. At least this is my experience.  For pro white and corrections, Windsor & Newton Series 7 no 2 brushes are my first choice.	1
Thanks for the brush!! Fast service!	1
BEST BRUSHES IN THE WORLD!!  water color or in my case acrylics...I use the for painting minis...you take care of them they'll last for a very long time!  Love them...the keep their tip amazingly well and if I could I'd own every size and start painting with them on my canvas acrylics...but that's kind of an expensive investment...but again the best brushes!!!	1
great product, fast shipping	1
I just started using this brush today, and how wonderful it is! I'll be buying another one in the future. I use this brush with india ink, mainly to ink drawings, but I may also do lettering in the future.  It feels amazing, better than anything I've felt before. It feels much better than using a pen to ink, though it takes a bit more control. The point of the sable brush is razor sharp, allowing for the thinnest of lines. It also looks very elegant! It is a shiny black, like a beautiful Steinway piano. Honestly, I think I'm in love with this brush.  I had had considerable trouble using a Royal and Langnickel 6700R (it is an artificial sable round brush in a series called Espresso). The Langnickel wouldn't hold a point, and I gave up on it. I clean my brushes in ammonia, and that may have ruined the Langnickel, but I doubt it. (Also, after cleaning the brush, I reshape the tip with my lips while it is wet. This stopped working on the Langnickel after awhile.) Ink in the ferrule should not have stopped it from working after only a few uses. After this frustration, I figured I shouldn't be cheap and bought the gold standard in brushes for inking: Winsor and Newton Series 7 Size 2.  I'll make sure that the brush is durable, and update my review if it doesn't last: honestly, it would be my fault, since these brushes are supposed to last forever if well cared for. I am very happy with my purchase, and I will be buying another Winsor and Newton Series 7 in the future.	1
I'm normally not one to fanboy all over the big name brands, but this brush is absolute magic. Needle sharp tip and it holds tons of fluid. I do watercolor often, but this became my dedicated inking brush. While brushes are not quite as clean looking as a fine liner - this brush can match even the thinnest of fine tip pens in terms of line width. It can do this even after a fresh dip. It will hold enough that smaller drawings can be completed with one or two dips.  I actually lost mine after a full year of use and came back to amazon to purchase another and leave a review. Well worth the price and I have nothing bad to say about this product. Good job Windsor and newton!	1
Bought this for my husband who loves to paint miniatures. Great quality brushes	1
This stuff is very weak.  The directions say to use 1/8th per 2lbs of wax.  Well, that looked very faint pink.  So I wound up tossing the whole block in (about 3x more than the directions say) and it's still pink.  Using way more than the directions got it closer to red, but it's still pink.  This is cheap stuff that falsely advertises what color it is.  Don't buy if you really care what color you want.	-1
Ot os a good color and works well with soy wax, I am impressed and woul recommend it to anyone. Glad I got it and will get more in the future	1
This is great for making paraffin candles. Follow the directions and establish how much you want to use to get the color that you need. It really is that simple. The color lasted until the end of the candle burning. I highly recommend it.	1
Paintbrush made from an endangered species.  Your paint will be very appreciative .	1
I hear this brush (singular) was created by a deposed Nigerian Prince. Really good value when you think about it....	-1
This is a scam listing attempting to make you believe you are ordering more than one brush, thus justifying the incredibly high cost.  Please note that you can order brushes for much cheaper from Winsor & Newton directly.	-1
Some of the finest, durable and reliable brushes I've worked with. I swear by Winsor Newtons and have used these brushes for ages.	1
The product listing uses the word 'brushes'...plural. The product photo show 'brushes'.....plural. I received a very fine 140 dollar brush....singular. Not happy.	-1
As a mini figure painter, this is perfect. I've never had a brush that held it's point so well.	1
So far so good. Makes amazing lines and holds point well, dries with hairs in place as well.	1
Top knotch.  A great brush.  Highest of quality.  BUT...  I feel bad for the weasel the poor little guy.  This is the only W & N Series 7 I own and I won't be getting any more.  I hear there are great synthetic versions available these days so I'll be looking in to those.  It may not save any of the critters but I don't have to use a paint brush made with their tail fur to feel all artsy.  What do they do with the rest of the weasel anyway?	1
For painting wargaming miniatures...there may not be a better brush. Get it, paint your crap, kill some s*** on the table.	1
A king's brush! Or a queen's! You decide!	1
But when you have a member of the family who needs a tool kit to work with, it helps to find one some where.	1
Nice collection of basic basket weaving tools in a convenient storage pouch. Very useful and convenient with comfortable grips; easy to use and keep clean.	1
I work a lot in watercolor and gouache, so a good, low tack masking tape is critical for creating sharp edges.  Although Scotch calls this a low tack tape and claims that it will not pull up paint when removed, I found that to be untrue.  Not only does it damage the paper and paint surfaces I work on, it also leaves a residue of glue on the page which resists color and sticks to facing pages (when I'm working in a sketchbook or journal.  There are much better alternatives out there.  Be good to your artwork and leave this stuff on the shelf!	-1
One of my favorite brushes...great service.	1
Great brush. I love it.	1
Just what I wanted- Thses are my go-to brushes.	1
Just what I needed to paint eyes on my miniatures!	1
Wonder if I was ripped off here--No where does it say Kolinsky brushes except on the box.  The round 8 is already losing hairs andw hold a point.	-1
Very good brush	1
These are excellent brushes	1
I see a huge difference between this brush and "dollar store" brushes, it tends to hold its point well but still be pliable enough that its a treat to paint with.	1
This is a nice fine brush, and good quality.  Not quite as small as I needed for manicures.  This will be a welcome addition to my brush collection	1
It better that any of my other brush that i have	1
This is a nice kit if you are just beginning basket weaving as I am. I decided to make a couple of baskets for Christmas and even though the kit didn't specify any of these tools to be used I was glad I had it and it really helped. I especially like the small yellow cutters as they are very sharp and good for a lot of products besides basket weaving.	1
If you basketweave, you will find these tools so very handy!	1
Great product. Came on time. Will buy more.	1
Worked great.	1
god tools kinda pricey.	1
gotta start somewhere	1
Start off with this Kit. Save yourself sone time and money. Add on to this afterwards	1

My favorite brush. Best available for painting miniatures.	1
Everything as expected!	1
love the variation in line weight and how well it loads and holds paint	1
Great brush, fine point handled and delivered protected and with care. This paints very well and holds a point	1
Why I bought this product: I have a variety of synthetic brushes that I use for painting small figurines using acrylic based paint and I wanted to see if I would have a better experience using a sable brush.  Overall Impression: these brushes are more expensive than synthetic, but well worth the price. I would suggest to anyone that has similar hobbies (modelling, miniatures, fine detail with acrylics) to buy a small variety of sable brushes over a large variety of synthetic. These brushes store more pigment, have a sharper point, and provide better control. I was surprised how much I could cover on a flat surface with smaller sable brushes and still use the sharp point for fine lines and edging.	1
Perfect	1
You can never go wrong with W & N Sables, esp. Series 7. If you are a serious artist, you get the best.	1
My new favorite paint brush - it's worth the money.	1
A great brush but I received it in poor quality. Tip was already ruined. Maybe I was unlucky.	-1
Good product. Hard to get in the USA. Reasonable wait.	1
Very low tack and does what it's supposed to do, which is NOT ruin your artwork or stick to your art or watercolor paper. However, it doesn't hold watercolor paper down very well or keep it from buckling, especially if you use a heat tool. It does work to keep masking paper or stencils in place even with wet media, such as ink sprays, but again you lose that with a heat tool or if your using a non-stick craft sheet. There's not a lot of it, so use it sparingly. I found it wide enough for my purposes, though. There just needs to be more of it.	1
WASNT SATISFACTORY FOR ME	-1
I love this tape for holding my dies on my cardstock does not rip paper when pulled off	1
This is great for lifting colors from a coloring book before using an eraser.  Anyone who has put down red, knows how hard it is to get rid of.  I use this tape to pull off as much color as I can and then I use the gritty eraser or my electric eraser and get MUCH better results than just using an eraser.  I would highly recommend it to anyone who loves toi color.	-1
Exactly what I wanted, even I don't have any reeds right now.	1
This kit has every tool you will need for making a basket. The tools are sturdy and get the job done.	1
Good basic tool set, but does not include the packing tool pictured in the. "Basic Basket Making" book. The little nipper is particularly good for cleaning up wispy bits.	1
Product was as advertised.	1
Does what I wanted. Easy to plaster down and pull up.	1
Can't see through it.	-1
This is my go to brush for mini painting.  The tip has held its shape and has yet to fray.  I recommend this brush to anyone who is serious about their work.	1
Great Product, Would buy again	1
Fantastic brush.  Hairs are solid, supple, hold their point, and allow paint to flow really consistently, almost pen-like.  If you want to get serious about miniature painting, or any other painting that requires a smaller brush, this is a great first step.	1

very good.	1
Love the brush.  Nice quality	1
This is a pricy but worth it pen. The tip has been reliable and the brush holds an amazing amount of fluid for its teeny size. I understand the weasels who have the best hair for this use are getting more rare (or so I've heard) and that explains the price. I would encourage anyone who would like to undertake painting (watercolor painting especially) to start off with the best brushes, paints, and paper on the market. Cheap products produce unhappy results.	1
Excellent!	1
Love this brush.  Best brush I've ever owned.	1
Art supplies are always going to be a little subjective, so maybe the more critical reviews here are worth considering, but I love these suckers, and this particular brush was in nice condition and got me a lot of attention when I went to draw at the cafe. :)	1
This is one of those products that probably should just be tried.  I bought it for less than $4 as an Add On item.  It works perfectly for what I wanted, but I mostly wanted to use it for masking and holding lightweight paper in place on a light box.  -It is not as sticky as painters tape or masking tape. -It is thicker and more rigid than most tapes.  I can lay it down and use it as a hard edge to draw very straight lines. -I've laid it down over ink drawings and dried watercolors and not had any damage to the paper, ink or paint.  The only thing I see on the back of the tape is lint and stray cat hairs. -I haven't seen or felt any residue on the paper when tape is removed.  I've never left it on for more than a day or two, so that could change with time.  I don't know. -The tape is 3/4-in wide.  It's easy to cut for smaller width or to form shapes for masking.  I would not use this for anything requiring much strength.  I would recommend trying some of this tape on a test swatch if concerned about removing medium.	1
Perfect little roll of low tach tape. Works great for tapping off my borders. No problems with paper tearing or ripping or anything like that. I will buy again and I highly recommend it.	1
I was hoping for a little more tackiness. While it really seemed good at not leaving any residue as it claims, I personally will keep searching for just the right tape for my project. However, I will have this handy for a different project.	1
I do watercolors and rate this 5 star. I've even had a roll tucked away for 6 years and used it with perfect results, clean edges and no residue on the quality paper I use.	1
This is scotch artist tape 3/4 inch it holds paper down when you are drawing great price and delivery	1
Wonderful,  absolutely wonderful. Exceptionally satisfied.	1
Daughter needed this for art class.  She said it worked great and was a great value.	1
Top quality, as always.	1
Great purchase! This paint brush Is worth it.	1
Great purchase! This paint brush is worth it.	1
A great purchase! This paint brush is worth it.	1
I love this brush. Not only is it pure awesome in the hand, not only has my brush control improved, but it came via Royal Mail. Made my day, will buy more sizes.	1
Absolutely love my Winsor & Newton Series 7 brushes for miniatures painting! The number 2 is my "go-to" brush. I also own a handful of Rosemary & Co. Kolinsky brushes (manufactured in the UK) and I prefer the W&N Series 7. The Rosemary & Co. brushes run for about half the price so it is nice to have them as an alternative.  Great brushes, I highly recommend W&N Series 7 brushes for painting miniatures!	1

A beautiful artist brush, and extreamly good for small details.	1
Insanely high quality brush. Perfect for miniatures.	1
There are lots of products out there offered by numerous companies. Some are good while others are cheap imitations. How can you tell the difference? Easy. Just get this one...the brand you have known and trusted for years. It really is the best.	1
This tape is amazingly easy to use and easy to remove,  I did not know that anything like this existed until I saw it here.  It removes so clean and effortlessly.  If you are into art work or crafting where you need adhere and remove this is the tape for you.	1
As described	1
works well for my needs	1
Garbage!! I regret buying this stuff. I bought it to hold my wire together temporarily but it did not work out. I thought the low tack would leave very little residue which it does but it doesn't stick together enough to leave anything behind!!	-1
Insanely high quality brush. Perfect for miniatures.	1
Winsor & Newton Series 7 Kolinsky Sable brushes are excellent.  I am a beginning botanical watercolor artist.  This brush works for me.	1
Excellent	1
Used these brushes for many year...They are the best.	1
it's okay	1
I will soil my hands with no other brand of paint brush.  The Winsor & Newton Series 7 is the best paint brush you can buy.	1
Excellent brushes for watercolor and inking.	1
Great Product,good price!!!!	1
I live and die by these guys they make inking comic book pages so much easier....	1
I paint wargaming miniatures and do the edge highlighting that all the kids love these days. I hard previously done the top highlight with a Series 7 3/0, but I don't think I'll ever go back. This brush has a finer, longer tip. I feel like I have so much more control over the brush in every way. I'm about to order a second to have as a backup in case of disaster. It took several weeks to get the previous order delivered since it was shipped from the UK. International post is what it is. I may go ahead and get the 0 as well since I have a 1 and it's also fantastic.	1
just what I expected	1
Completely satisfied with this product.	1
It works perfect for my cross stitch projects. It makes the finish look smaller which make the details look better.	1
Love the color	1
Great fabric, woven well and the color is beautiful for the sampler I stitched on it. Will definitely buy again!	1
REALLY low tack. I got it to stretch my watercolor paper. It's not that good for that. If you have something you absolutely don't want the tape to tear, this will be good.	1
i keep this on hand for attaching a sheet of paper to my drawing board. it does not damage the paper surface and holds fairly well.	1
I love this tape. Before I was using blue or green 'painter's tape' to temporarly hold paper or art work in place.  This tape works better and removes easily without causing problems.	1
Very happy with this brush.  It is the first higher quality brush I have purchased and it did not disappoint.  Made painting miniatures much easier!	1
The finest watercolor brush money can buy.  It appears to be the same quality as it was when I started using these more than 30 years ago, although I am amazed that environmentalism has made these harder to obtain.	1
Perfect	1
Perfecto	1
Very good quality paintbrush! Clean it right and it will last!	1
A fine product at a fair price.	1
Great product.  Arrived quickly.	1
Awesome brush series... nothing better..!!!	1
Arrived in perfect condition and at a great price.	1
These are by far the best paintbrushes on the market today	1
These were not of the quality I expected.  My teacher said they were OK to practice on, but that's all.  They were thinner than I expected.  Over all I was disappointed.  Guess for the price I shouldn't complain.  Once again - it's that you get what you play for it.	-1
arrived intact and on time.  sturdy smooth surface.  good price. pre-primed adequately for me, but I always add another coat.	1
My 10-yr. old granddaughter will make a lot of wonderful paintings on these canvas panels!  They look to be of a very nice quality!	1
These are amazing! They have multiple sizes and they are much cheaper then any other quality canvases i can find.	1
Can't believe I found these! I've been searching forever for them. They're wonderful and have the perfect, sharp tips! The best brushes ever!	1
A treasure packed perfectly	1
Great brush. I use it a lot for standard miniature painting.	1
Great brush for standard miniature figures. My go to brush for most painting.	1
Best brushes for painting miniatures. They hold their shape better than most and, with care, will serve for a long time.	1
I bought this brush because the W&N Series 7 are well regarded by people in the miniature painting hobby. When it arrived I began using it, and for a few minutes it worked well. However the bristles soon began splitting into three parts. I washed it out with water and The Masters Brush Cleaner and reshaped the tip, then left it overnight. The next day I started painting with it, and after a few strokes the bristles split again. I've also experienced problems with paint flow, even if I load the brush up with watered down paint after a couple strokes it starts to dry out.  I couldn't believe all these problems were occurring with such a highly rated brush, so I did some more research and discovered that at some point in the last few years W&N's quality control began going downhill. This thing was a waste of money, I have cheap Army Painter brushes that perform far better.  Update:  A few months after my initial review I decided to buy two more of these brushes just to see if I'd experience the same problem. I ordered a #0 and a #1, and I'm happy to say neither of them have any problems and work great. The first one I got must have been a result of poor quality control.	1
Beautiful brush! Works great, I will definitely order different sizes of this brand.	1
Excellent Brush	1

i have been using Raphael brushes for some time now, mainly the 8408's and the 8404, they are nice brushes with a stiff snap, they create very nice straight thin lines with ink.  recently i decided to try out the W&N series 7 because people were swearing by them but i held off because i heard they suck now? i dunno, i got one anyway.  heres the thing, i like to ink comic books and for a long time with the raphaels i was having issues getting the 'professional" look to my line work, keep in mind a lot of facors came into play, type of paper, type of ink i used, and yes even the brushes. the moment i started using the series 7, i saw a huge change in my work, the line work was coming out a lot nicer, it was easier to get the desired 'pro' look to my drawings and i found the brushes are slighty softer as well and bend a little nicer.  according to the dick blick website, the W&N are pure Kolinsky where as Raphaels are Red Sable, which from what the site said isn't the same beast but rather any red haired weasel. maybe an experert can chime in but i do notice a color difference in the brushes and where the raphaels take time after not in use to be warmed up again so to say, the W&N's are soft right off the bat, they don't get that stiffness after not being in use like the Raphaels so im thinking its totally different hairs.  anyway, i am sold on the series 7 brushes.	1
Great brush -- and for an excellent price!	1
Arrived VERY promptly, safely packaged (delicate brushes!); great quality, just what we needed.	1
This was safely packaged and just what we needed; great quality, as described.  Arrived earlier than expected, plenty of time to put together gift box of art supplies!	1
Safely packaged; just what we needed in terms of quality.	1
I looked everywhere for this brush.  You had the best price!  Thank you.  I love the Series 7 brushes.	1
Looks like they'll be perfect for my project.	1
As are expected. I use these to host my own wine & painting parties.	1
Love FREDRIX  panels  and soo happy Amazon carries them  the panels I had been getting from another source were VERY BAD!	1
Awesome product for fraction of the price.	1
Use these alot	1
My daughter loves theses. They are the perfect size for her to paint on.	1
Work well for early oil painting practice.	1
not worth your money! i can get a 10 of these at michels for 10 waste of money! i would not buy again unless i was in dire need of canvas!	-1
Best brushes out there for inking. I get almost a years of extremely heavy use (a few hundred illustrations a year) out of one before it needs to be replace. When not in use even for a minute or two clean off the brush with water to help preserve the life of the brush. Recommend using a paper towel to dry brush as the paper towel with absorb some ink that is still in the shaft of the brush.	1
I waited for more then a month and when it finally arrived i was pretty excited. I opened the box and what do you know? light bulbs!! not planning on waiting so ill just use these light bulbs to paint with my winsor watercolor set.	-1
Very glad that you can get them. I'd be lost without them.	1
I've been painting for decades, and this brush is great. I can't believe how it's kept it's form without any effort on my part.	1
Excellent brush...holds it's shape and hold a lot of paint...	1
Very good brush but expensive....Lasts for years if taken care of carefully.	1
I have always like these brushes...they hold a lot of paint and blend great.	1
Perfect for jewelry redering.	1
I cannot say enough good things about these brushes. I paint miniatures and this is my go-to brush for most endeavors. -Holds a lot of paint -maintains a fine point tip -lasts forever.  Do yourself a favor, stop buying cheaply made brushes and buy yourself some series 7's and some brush soap. You won't regret it.	1
This is one of the finest brushes I have ever used and the customer service I received was top notch	1
Fantastic Brush.  Bought this W&N Series 7 Kolinski Sable 4 at my local art supply store.  Was able to test it and several other brushes in the store.  Held a perfect tip during a water test where other Kolinsky Sable brands did not.	1
I purchased two of these brushes for a painting class (2brush blending), these brushes are awesome!	1
The best paint brush I have ever used and worth every penny.  I have been painting for 23 years and using Series 7 brushes for 14 years.  My last series 7 Size 0 brush lasted seven years and never lost it's point.  I finally had to replace my last size 0 because it had lost so many hairs it would not hold paint effectively.  That being said I still use this old brush for detail work because the tip has held all these years.  My new brush is performing excellently, as expected.	1
Thanks	1

Looks just like the picture! Springy bristles, huge belly to hold paint. Holds its point, insofar as i have used it. Wonderful brush!	1
great brush	1
great brush	1
great brush well worth the price	1
great brush worth the price.	1
I love this brush. It was expensive but well worth it. It holds paint wonderfully and has definitely improved my painting. I recommend it highly. Even though it was shipped from Great Britain, it arrived in about 2 weeks. Very pleased.	1
Winsor & Newton Series 7 Kolinsky Sable Water Colour Brushes are by far the best brush I have ever used for smooth flow and control, and in keeping its original shape and point which is so very important in areas of fine detail. These brushes also have a longevity that is far greater than other brands touted as being similar in quality.	1
wonderful, freeing, friendly brush you must try to appeciate.	1
Works like a dream on the paper.	1
This is perfect for miniature oil painting. Shipment was great.	1
For professional artists, this is the only brush to have.	1
Wrong size.  I wanted size 1, don't know why I was sent size 6...need to return.	-1
Best brush for the money	1
when I got this, one or two of the hairs were sticking out and messing up my inking. I clipped the hairs and now the brush works like a charm. A great size for comic artists, its line varies from super-thin to nice and chunky.	1
Brush shipped in a padded envelope (manilla-air type), inside a Windsor and Newton storage/shipping tube (big enough to hold the brush and protect it, not one of those courier tubes), and the brush had the brush cap (small plastic tube that only covers the brush).  The brush cap is thick and well made, and doesn't appear like it's going to come off during shipping, and the actual tube for the entire brush is pretty sturdy.  I wasn't sure about buying a brush sight unseen, but this was a great purchase.  Holds its' point, well made, and overall a really high-quality brush.  Willing to buy the 3/0 and 4/0 when they are back in stock.  Also, please ignore the 1 star review where someone was upset that Amazon didn't give them the "customer is always right" treatment.  2/0 and 00 are the same thing, so the customer, in that case, was completely wrong, and seems to have copped an attitude about it; I don't see anything in that review that has anything to do with the brush being defective or bad in any way.	1
I am an oil painter and I do very detailed work. I have been using these brushes for years. They are by far the best I have found...well worth the money.	1
I've used this brush for 40 years in my cartooning work and have always been pleased.  When I was unable to order some new ones from US suppliers recently, I was able to obtain some through Amazon from a British supplier.  The only reason I'm subtracting a star in this rating is that during shipping the small package was crushed a bit, and the ferrule on one of the brushes arrived seriously bent.	1
It was larger than I wanted, but that's my fault for not researching. Beautiful brush. I also purchased a Raphael just a little bit smaller, they are less expensive than the WNs and just as good.	1
What more can I say, this series of Brushes are the best around. They are a bit expensive but well worth it.	1
This brush is amazing and its quality cannot be denied. That said, I recommend that any detail painters (such as mini/comic fans) Try the size 2 brush before this one. You will find the point just as precise, and the size 2 holds more liquid so your medium doesn't dry as fast on the brush.	1
This brush is AMAZING! I've never been happier with a miniature brush (including the artist brushes that consist of 2 hairs tied together :P ).	1
These feel great in your hand and do not shed!	1
I really love my Simply Simmons paint brushes. They are wonderful quality at a price that can't be beat. I had no hairs fall out the brushes while painting or washing. Hairs falling out is a sign of a cheap poorly made paint brush. There was none of that with Simply Simmons paint brushes. I will be purchasing more Simply Simmons brushes is in lots of different sizes and styles. Next time I want firmer brushes but they will definitely be the Simply Simmons brand.	1
I purchased the first value set when I was begining to paint with watercolor.  I have loved and purchased them for at least 7 years and they have not lost their value with me.  I am purchasing more on Amazon because I find them very easy to manage for watercolor and for acrylics.  They have given me a good start.	1
When a garment "gaps" in front--and this seems to happen most often in "formal wear"--one can use a safety pin or attach hook-and-loop closures, but these other options are more time consuming (adjusting the pin each time) or troublesome (the hooks attach to everything).  Until I looked on Amazon, I was having trouble finding black snaps, which aren't obvious on a black garment.  They work perfectly	1
I trust Kolinsky Sable brushes and they last a long time with care. I look forward to keeping it with me for all my watercolur fun.	1
Small detailed lines uniformly rendered are important to you? Then this is the brush you need. Often imitated but never duplicated. Bite the bullet and spend a few bucks up front for the brush that out performs all the rest.	1
These are splendid brushes that will last for a long time if properly cared for. I paint miniatures and these are the best I hae ever used and well worth the money.	1
This brush is perfect. Mine has outlasted many cheaper brushes and was easier to maintain and clean. I found that when I clean it, paint residue slides out of the bristles much easier than cheap brushes. Almost nothing sticks to the sable hair and it retains its original color and springiness over time.  Be careful and take good care of it, but in my experience so far, it's actually easier to take care of, so don't stress about it.	1
This is my favorite watercolor brush in my collection.  I buy a new size one about once a year because I wear them out I paint so much.  That is NOT because they are bad brushes.  They are amazing.  They keep their point up until the bitter end allowing me to do very detailed and precise work.  There are few things more beautiful than a brand new Series 7 brush.  This one came all the way from the UK and it came to me quickly and in very good shape.  I love it and I'd buy from this seller again.	1
I buy a new one of these brushes every year because I paint so much and a size 0 is so delicate and fine I wear them out easily.  But that is just me.  I would wear out ANY brush.  These keep a point better than any brush I have ever tried.  I can get great detail with this tiny brush and with the excellent point it's almost like I am drawing it.  I have used no other watercolor brushes except Series 7 by Winsor & Newton for 25 years.  I was having trouble finding them and was glad to find them through Amazon.  It is a lovely brush.	1
I'm using these for my Reaper Bones Kickstarter miniatures.  I just went to the local craft store and got some beginner brushes, which were adequate for my learning process.  My beginner brushes began to develop a curl or hook at their tips.  This makes any detail work impossible.  I'd trim the hook off and it would just develop again over time.  The W&N brush, though is fabulous at holding paint and transferring it to the mini.  I'll continue to use the older brushes for basecoats, but after that I'll use the kolinsky brushes for everything else.	1
This is the best brush for violin varnish touch-up, but it's probably the biggest size you will need before switching to flat brushes. This size is perfect for re-coloring the edge of a violin in one stroke.	1
This is the best brush you can use for violin varnish touch-up. You'll need a lot of sizes but this one is great for touching up moderate sized cracks and scratches. I highly recommend getting some of "the masters" brush cleaner along with this to keep the bristles like new.	1
Great product - did the job well	1
Doesn't adhere well, had to go over it three times on cotton setting to get it to "stick" and even then the top and bottom edges wouldn't completely stick. I used it to mend a seam in the waistband of some pants and by the end of the day it was completely separated. Probably works great for something that won't get any wear, but no luck for me. *however I did get the singer iron on patches and they worked great*	-1
Arrived promptly. Exactly what I asked for. Best price I could find it for online.  These brushes are the best brush anywhere for fine detail and control. I won't use anything else. They're expensive though. This one was a really good price.	1
I love these brushes,but I could ink with any round tip brush. You can get to your destination on any kind of bicycle .	1
If you need a brush that will hold a hairline point and deliver the paint in a constant regulated flow then this is the brush for you.  I have not found any better.	1
It's perfect for rather small paintings, especially leaves, palm fronds and flowers and can get in between for shadows with it's tip.  I use a bigger brush for a larger wash, such as sky.	1
not what we thought we were getting very  unhappy could have bought it any where for that  price not a deal	-1
In my opinion, the Series 7 is the best watercolor brush available. I use them exclusively for my rounds because they are excellently flexible and hold a point perfectly.	1
I have been using W&N series 7 brushes for years. They are excellent brushes. I use mine for inking comic books, so they get beat up pretty bad if you don't take care of them. But for watercolor, these brushes will last a super long time if properly cared for (Can't say forever cause eventually they will wear out) I actually use the size 0 and size 2, but I wanted to make sure there was an actual product review on here, so people didn't just see the 1 star review from an angry misinformed customer and be turned away from this fantastic product. Poor information and bad customer service does not make the product unworthy of purchase.	1
Lightweight fabric patch with good adhesion.	1
attached easily and repaired the hole.	1
I needed this to help a friend get his name in his clothing.  We wrote the info on it with a Sharpie, cut in half lengthwise into 1 1/2" strips, and ironed each piece in the neck of his clothes.  So far so good!  Best part I didn't have to roam through craft stores to hopefully find the right width needed.  Thanks, Amazon!	1
There's a reason everyone who still uses a brush to ink comics uses THIS brush:  it's perfect for the job.  It holds a point every bit as fine as that on much smaller brushes, but due to its size, the bell holds far more ink (or paint, if you're using the brush for watercolor) than the tiny brushes marketed towards painters of miniatures.  The W&N Series 7 No. 2 has been the comic book artist's inking brush of choice for decades, and it remains the best choice for the task.  I simply can't praise it enough.  And as an aside, if you're an aspiring comics artist and not sure whether or not you even want to try mastering the brush, try it with THIS brush:  it's so well-suited to the job that it makes learning far easier than you'd expect.	1
This brush was part of my second set of W&N series 7 brushes. I use them for painting miniatures. There's not a lot of consensus among miniature painters on many things, but I've never heard to the series 7 referred to as anything but "the best" or "among the very best" brushes for the task.  My first Series 7 brushes lasted for almost 4 years (They are still useable now, but can no longer hold the fine point needed for detail work). They're pricey, but well worth it,	1
These are great brushes and at a great price could not ask for more. They work real great for line work on ink and also watercolor.	1
I use black india ink (windsor newton brand) and these brushes work great.  Tip: To keep the point in the brush, lightly cleanse the brush in water and then shape the point with your tongue. If you are using India ink it can taste like a tiny skunk fart, but it's not too bad and the brush lasts longer and is ready for the next round of inking.  These brushes are a great price with some secondary sellers on Amazon.	1
I intended to order a W & N Series 7 size #2 brush. The item was advertised as size 2/0. What arrived was a #00, according to the packaging and the writing on the brush itself. Customer service was of little help, insisting that 2/0 and 00 are the same. That may be, but it strikes me as vague and misleading and I would have liked a bit more of "the customer is always right" and a bit less of "haha, that's why you shouldn't buy stuff on the internet, sucker!"	-1
very deceving, I, as well, thought  that I am buing seiries of 7 brushes, but received just one brush that is grossly overpriced. you can get brush like this one at  Dick Blick store on line for a fraction of this price. very disappointed, very manipulative seller.  eva	-1
I bought this brush on the advice of experianced miniature painters and am not disappointed. The brush holds water well, bringing the tip to a nice point, and makes the colours flow off the brush much smoother than a teeny-tiny brush does. Definitely worth the money to get a better brush!	1
I use this to paint 25mm scale minis. Great brush. Tip stays true and pointy, holds good amount of paint, proper pressure spreads bristles out to cover larger areas. I use this bruch for 98% of the painting and then go to a smaller brush for eyes and minutiae.	1
They are expensive but they are so worth the money. You must takes really good care of them. They are hand made and they real hair of the red sable squirrel. I only use my series 7s for watercolor only. Some professionals use them for inking also. They are great for ink but they will destroy them over a couple uses.	1
should work fine - a lot of tape for the cost	1
I made the mistake of not reading the description. I saw the picture and assumed I was buying a set of winsor and newton paintbrushes. When i received the package and realized i had only purchased one paintbrush, I had very high expectations. This brush went above and beyond those expectations and I am very happy that I purchased it. It's the best brush I have ever used and it is very durable as long as you take proper care of it.	1
A friend of mine loves to paint so I always get her art supplies as gifts.  I got her these brushes along with some paint and she was quite pleased.  These brushes are great quality and are fantastic for any painter.	1
The Series 7 Kolinsky Sable Watercolor brushes from Winsor & Newton (which were commissioned by Queen Victoria, an accomplished watercolorist herself who passed on the genes to Prince Charles) are the most exquisite and delightful brushes to use. Somewhat costly but worth the price as they will last forever with good care and one brush can do more strokes than appearances would indicate.  I plan to add to my purchases when this product is offered again at the reasonable price I was able to purchase the two brushes I own. Happy painting!	1
I used this mending tape to repair a tear in  my clothes.  Following the directions, I had no trouble making the repair.  It appears to be holding well with much use.	1
Yet somehow, it took three applications for this stuff to stick! Followed the instructions the first two times, then improvised. Haven't washed the sheet I used this on yet, but am very skeptical.	-1
Great product.	1
I have been purchasing this particular product for several years.  I make dog apparel and I used it primarily to reinforce the backside of the area on which I would be attaching the "D-Ring" for a leash.  I recently purchased 4 more packages.  WHAT A SURPRISE!  Dritz cheapened this product so much.  First of all the fabric is much thinner not substantial at all.  Second issue, the adhesive does NOT work.  I have tried and tried to get this stuff to adhere...no luck.  I am very disappointed.  Even if I used an iron on fusible tape under this, I would still have to cut at least 3 layers, in order to achieve the same thickness that the original tape was.  Shame on Dritz a name I used to trust and rely on!  Not anymore.	-1
Love it	1
This is a perfect stabilizer to add to your  candle wax. It made all the candles smooth finished and with no bubbles.	1
Not much to say as it's a ruler.  Markings are clear and is a nice weight.	1
Bought two more in different sizes	1
Gosh! I have so many rulers - why one more? Well - certainly appreciate this one. Not so big for the somewhat smaller piecing projects. Makes for much more convenient project manipulation for those multiple cuts. Also nice for packing for those day classes & of course = Omnigrid is so precise & easy to read.	1
product to use t make candles	1
great additive for making candles, provides great glossy finish to your candles, but don't over do it, you will create cavities in your candles.	1
couldn't wait to use this! I have been unable to make candles with a scent throw and used this for the first time now my candles smell wonderful! it was shoes fast also!	1
Works well	1
So far is the best transfer paper I've tried. The amount of paper that the package brings worth the price you have to pay. I think it's worth buying.	1
There is only one very thin page in there. I think it is way over charged for what it is.	-1
It did it's job but it was hard to get to to stick.	1
With 3 cats I use a lot of mending tape on my sheets as they jump up and slide down the bed.  This is a tried-and-true product that is as good an idea now as when it was invented decades ago!	1
ok	1
timely and just what was expected	1
Omnigrid is one of the best!  And this ruler did not disappoint. It is well made and precise as I expect from Omnigrid.  The yellow and black markings means it works on every fabric. They are very easy to see.  I use this ruler daily, and it holds up nicely.	1
great ruler	1
Love this ruler. This is my second one. Doesn't have that pesky1/4 inch added to the side. It's also easy to see - not so cluttered with markings.	1
Great price and works good	1
I bought this as a replacement.  It's a perfect size and fits perfectly in my sewing bag.  I would recommend it for anyone who quilts.	1
Very nice to have and take to classes.	1
Make sure you use this tape on heat-tolerant material.  The iron has to be HOT and pressure applied for a long time in order for the tape to stick, but it is worth it because it doesn't start curling at the edges and coming off after a wash or two like other tapes.  I use a "blotter" (old cotton dishrag) between iron and tape so material around tape will not discolor.  An old t-shirt is the best blotter.	1
I am kind of angry about this... the description header on Amazon and the top part of the product picture used say GRAPHITE transfer paper...well I opened it and used it on my very nice watercolor painting to ad another object in, see the thing about graphite is you can ERASE it, thats why one picks graphite over say carbon paper...well THIS does not erase off the watercolor paper ... so I got back and look at my label on product and it differs from the one shown, it is black not blue and it says grey transfer paper not Graphite...as show...I guess I expect to receive what I order not something different, Not to mention it ruining my art work. Include is the product I got, not the same as shown above.	-1
Good product	1
Transfer patterns to stock material with a stylus or just a graphite pencil. I used a mechanical pencil with thin lead.	1
Great price fast delivery and can be used over and over what has already been traced on. Would recommend .	1
Haven't gotten to this lesson yet, but it's great quality paper, & I know it will work perfectly for it's application!	1
Great transfer for watercolor paintings.	1
Good price!	1
I bought all 3 sizes. Love them!	1
Good cone.	1
Very nice product.	1
For a styrofoam cone this meets the bill.  I used a hot glue gun to attach items to this cone and it really stood up well against the high heat.  These are great for crafting and I've purchased in other sizes as well.	1
A good dea and nice sizel.  The large size allowed me cut one sheet into several appropriate sizes for different projects.	1
I found this to be a little expensive for one sheet of transfer paper, other wise very happy with product.	1
Love mod podge sealers. This is great for paper, be careful of inks on the paper.	1
I had used most all the varieties of Mod Podge, however this was my first experience with the "Paper Gloss" type. As usual this Mod Podge turned out to be a great product.	1
was as described and arrived in a timely manner	1
Walnut Hollow Basswood plaques are perfect for woodburning.  The size of the plaque allows for a great piece to hang around the home.  The basswood is so soft, it woodburns with the greatest of ease.  Just be careful not to bang it, as it will damage easily.  I always have a hard time finding un-damaged plaques when going to the store.  The wood does stain easily and the finished products turn out great.  Adding mounting hardware to the back is easy and the nails that come in picture hanging kits are the perfect size and do not come through the front of the plaque.	1
Got wood,  need wood this works for me,  as Described, it's wood hard to screw it up, true to size	1
Nice smooth surface, very pretty.  Need to sand with 220 sandpaper before use though.  Very nice plaque!	1
good	1
Perfect for my project/	1
The wood just peeled off around the edges. The more I sanded the more it frayed. Not good quality.	-1
Very limited on quilt size usage. Can't use on small quilts. Was very disappointed in the entire product.  I thought it would be made of a more flexible plastic.	-1
I am disappointed with Paper Mod Podge. It is much thinner/watery compared to the original Mod Podge. After buying Paper Mod Podge two different times, I realize the watery consistancy is common for this formula and not just a fluke. Most likely I will not purchase it again since I have not been able to get good results working with it. Also, it seems like I need to use a lot more of it to get the same results as I can with the original formula. There have been times when I had to redo a project completely because the watery consistency did not hold up and behave like the Original Mod Podge. I love using the Original Mod Podge, but the Paper Mod Podge has been a huge letdown.	-1
No one ever tells you the truth. The truth is people hype this up because they have low standards. If you hate wrinkling and want something that looks above a 2nd grade level, don't get this. It's Elmer's glue with water.  Get acrylic gel medium and it'll be worth all the money and don't both with this. Don't even second guess this with all the useless praise with this.	-1
Wics burn way too fast. After burning for about 20 min, the wick is completely burned away and you can't burn the rest of the candle.	-1
cat doesn't care to use	-1
First of all, this is not pure black, it's dark blue trying to pass off as black.  Cheap black dye is often like that.  Secondly it's very weak.  The directions say to use 1/8th per 2lbs of wax.  I wound up using 3x more than that and it still just looked blue.  If you're looking for a proper color, don't buy this junk.	-1
theysent me blue but the package says black	-1
I bought these and they did not adhere at all no matter how many times I tried.  Went back to amazon and ordered Iron Patches (company name) and product made in USA.  I have ordered their product in the past and they are amazing.  They are still on my other jeans after a year and being washed.  I	-1
I bought these to patch my son's jeans. They started peeling or completely came off after just one wear and wash. Very disappointing.	-1
Did not work	-1
I was very disappointed.  I tried every setting on my iron and still could not get a transfer.	-1
These are horrible, and they smear constantly. Even if you don't move the paper and are really careful the details get lost, or smear into a red blob. I would highly recommend staying away from this product.	-1
When ironing, some of the glue ended up on my iron -- utterly ruining the surface, and I can't get it off even with goo gone or a green scrubber pad.  That shouldn't be.  Second problem, when using this khaki patch on a lighter khaki/tan fabric, the patch's color somehow smeared onto the pants -- making a fairly large slightly dark smudge -- that resisted soap and "shout".  It's as if the dye lifted off, due to the iron's heat, and transferred to the cloth where it didn't belong.  I didn't notice this when using Navy patches on a Navy cloth, obviously, because the colors matched.  All I can say is, Beware!  If I patch from behind (i.e. on a twill pants leg, turn it inside out so the patch is on the inside of the ripped leg) it makes the area stiff, and adds an edge that my kid finds uncomfortable.  But the bleeding problem wouldn't matter that way.  Next time, I will use a piece of scrap fabric, e.g. sacrifice an old air of pants for material, and use a fabric glue (so far, Aleene's Fabric Fusion seems to do the trick) even though it's a bit more work to fold edges over and glue them before gluing on the patch.  Followup a month or two later... Aleene's Fabric Fusion has worked VERY well.  Sacrifice one old item, cut it up for patches (e.g. Kids' pants). Glue 'em up, put paper or index cards on either side to keep glue contained, press under a couple of books, and the patch will stand up very very well.  Buying these patches has not turned out well -- edges curl, entire sides of the patch lift off, they're thick and slightly uncomfortable for the kids, and ironing them on is harder than gluing w Aleene's.	-1
I tried to remove a picture  that I decided I did not want on the crib cover I am embroidering for my granddaughter.  I used Aunt Matha's red transfer pencils, and I can't get the pencil out of the material. I googled this, and apparently many other people have had the same problem. I have washed it, used stain removers, used a tooth brush with detergent on it, and nothing works. My next effort will be to use "Grandma's Secret Spot Remover" that I got at Hobby Lobby, but I'm not optimistic since none of the other stain/spot removers has helped at all.  Does anyone have any other suggestions?	-1
I got this to seal my wefts and the edges of my full lace wigs. On the wefts, I am not sure how well this works because the wefts I sealed were still shedding. On the edges of the full lace wigs it seemed to do a bit of a better job. DOn't use too much or it will turn white. I will not buy this again.	-1
I thought that the pencils would wash away after you finished embroidery them I was shocked to see that it didn't disappear after I washed it.	-1
I have red ones which work fine on light colored fabric. I was looking for black transfer pencils and nowhere in the product info is the lead color indicated.	-1
These are a RED color. If they were a dark blue or black, the transfers would probably be much more visible. When ironed onto an ivory colored cloth, it was not visible enough to follow the transferred patterns. A bit disappointing.	-1
Does not provide a durable carry case for my artwork.  It is a large paper folder with Velcro and a handle.	-1
poor quality, not even plastic-ripped already. Save your money	-1
I just received these.  Have not used yet. But the tubes of paint are super tiny compared to buying acrylic in a squeeze bottle, like Americana or Martha Stuart for example. I do a lot of decorative painting on furniture and rocks using squeeze bottle paints. I bought these to see how they compare-I think I will use them on canvas. Does anyone have experience to oust?	-1
I needed paints for a last minute mural that would have taken me a month to complete but had only 10 days.  When the yellow paint arrived it was already drying out and unusable, like a solid piece of rubber.  By the time I completed and job and recovered from a two week illness, I was unable to return this product.  Please think twice before you order from this company.	-1
Could be shinier this is very close to a gray. Not as shiny Decoart and Handyart thought it would be more. But it still fills the paper with not many strokes so it all depends on what your looking for	-1
Never go around to the UPS store to return this item and the delivery guy never picked it up when I put it out on the porch for him.  This little jar arrived with the seal broken and half the paint missing  The paint that is in there is dried up.  I have had to reconstitute it so it will not be suitable for my other works. Boo Hiss EREX	-1
Very thin and too flexible. I end up not ever using it because it's too bendy.	-1
The tops of these needles are so sharp, they stabbed me so many times I had to stop my project. They broke through the skin. Looking on the Web for something less sadistic.	-1
The holes are either way too big or way too small for a professional brush to be placed in on. Also, it is easily stained and is hard to remove the face painting ( which should wash off with soap and water ) stains that cause this item to appear very unprofessional with stains. I'm embarrassed to use this item. Because, when I'm face painting , the stains that I used multiple products to remove, never came off and so it looks gross when one is using it and there's people around that assess the stains on this item . Then, you appear dirty and unprofessional for using this , easily, stainable product.	-1
Too small	-1
The cord just doesn't hold anything with any weight.  It breaks and slips out of my fingers.  It isn't a good thread for me.  I'm thinking of getting another size or something else.  Just not sure what.  I lost very expensive Larimar beads all over the floor making up a necklace and bracelet set.  I was all done too when it broke last night.  The thing I do like about this Stretch Magic is the size to thread beads.  The size was perfect, just couldn't hold even the lightest weight.  I was so disappointed.	-1
I guess this is okay for quickie kid crafts. What is "magic" about it is beyond me. I have never found a way to knot it where it doesn't come loose with a little pressure. Melting the knot with a lighter or match doesn't hold either. There is no way I would trust it to last on a bracelet designed to stretch in order to get it on and off unless I could find some type of large crimps that really kept in place. Come to think of it, I keep it around only because it seems I'll find some use for it, but I'm still waiting.	-1
The Zinc and the Nickel are the same product with different prices. I could have just bought the lesser expensive but they charged 3.00 more for the same thing.	-1
It ran when I used it on 4 different envelopes. Had to buy gum Arabic to thicken it.	-1
these look very cheap and they don't even look like eggs...you can see the plastic seam, and the shape is 'off'' as to what you'd expect eggs to look like.	-1
Beautiful color, but clogged up on all my fountain and calligraphy pens. Even though bottle states it is for fountain and calligraphy pens.	-1
Could not do what I had hoped as an oil painter.  I need my cleaner to separate from the paint particles when I am finished my painting session.  I ended up with a ton of muck and cleaner I could never use again.  Waste of money.	-1
It works...barely.  The hole for the needle is round with no flat edge to keep the needle from turning before you insert it into the machine.	-1
Useless,  needle drops too low to properly insert in machine. Such a shame since I  gave to friends for gifts.	-1
I used this tracing paper with the red Aunt Martha's heat transfer pencils and it did absolutely nothing.  I followed the instructions exactly (ie placed the transfer pencil side of the tracing against the fabric and press with iron).  Nothing at all happened, not even a trace of the design.  I was using 100% cotton napkins.  Ended up having to use a lightbox to trace the pattern onto the fabric.  Maybe I'm doing something wrong that I can't figure out, but this was pointless.	-1
Maybe I'm just too impatient, but I can never seem to get it to preheat enough to be worth anything. Even after trying to fuse it on the fabric it seems like more gets stuck to my iron trying to preheat it than sticks to the fabric. Also - this will gum up your needle like no other. I much prefer Steam a Seam or Wonder Tape for my seams.	-1
This is not the kind of paper you would want to use for tracing maps or drawings out of a book.  It's super thick and hard to see through.  I guess it's meant for transfers, but then, I'm not sure it should be called "tracing" paper.	-1
This CANNOT be used for Christmas!  It is grayish-yellow!	-1
Apparently the offer was a misprint.  So they sent 45 x 60 instead.  I had a project going, so kept it.	-1
I have used other cotton batting before , even from the Warm Company, and have had no problems until now. This batting was the "LINT MONSTER"  I'm not talking about a little shedding, but constant shedding. It was like having to groom a pet on a daily bases. Thank Goodness for lint brushes. Before I had finished quilting I had filled a grocery bag. When I first opened the bag of batting I thought how soft and puffy. Boy was I in for a rude awakening. The backing of my quilt was navy and by the time I had quilted the first section (length) of the quilt the back became white. I became concerned about catching this lint in my stitches, so I brushed it between changing sections to quilt. I thought to myself maybe this is just an isolated incident, so I asked a question about it and I believe this is not an isolated problem. So if you do choose this batting have lint brush in hand.	-1
The magnet is weak, the case holds few needles and not any curved or long ones, I'll keep looking	-1
Both ends have now broke, I'd recommend the little metal hooks that you can get at joannes and such.	-1
I have used many battings over the years and just tried this in a large throw size quilt. Good quality, consistent throughout and even on the edges. I thought the thinness of it would make a light quilt for a southern climate with some drape to it. I quilted as I normally do; it machine quilted just fine. Even though it's thin, it makes for a very dense, stiff quilt. And it feels heavy. The quilt can almost stand up on its own. I have not laundered it yet and hope that will soften it up. But as it is now: It is not soft, fluffy, light, airy nor drape-able. I most likely will not use this product again. Back to 80-20	-1
ok for the price	-1
Was no more helpful for those of us with aging eyes, so I then bought the Dritz one and it's fantastic!	-1
Mine broke within a couple days	-1
Doesn't really work well for my Brother bobbins...the slots are too wide.	-1
came to me used ;(	-1
Really disappointed...to much space for the bobbins to float around meaning you end up with a thread mess.	-1
it is small and only one size. Can't adjust it even putting it in hot water to soften it up to size to your own finger. As soon as I took it off it went right back to its original shape and size.	-1
Doesn't work well as a bobbin case unless you have the entire thing filled. They fall over and start to unravel and if you  have smaller bobbins they won't sit well together. I recommend more the donut like bobbin holder since it's flexible and really holds those bobbins in place.	-1
I tried using both the thicker and thinner wire threader to thread an embroidery needle with six strand floss and it was too thick to go back through the needle. The thinner one broke when I pulled harder to try to get it through.	-1
Not comfortable to use. I expected it to be more cushioned. I do not like this product. Sorry.	-1
This didn't work for me, perhaps since I knit continental/portugese.  But the ring is tiny.  I have a little arthritis and it wouldn't fit over my index finger knuckle.  But not worth returning.  I'll give it to one of my knitting buddies...	-1
Not worth it	-1
So not worth over a dollar and Amazon overcharged for shipping it.	-1
This is made for a child's finger. Great concept but even if it fit's a child --it will break. Very flimsy plastic. Do not buy!!!!!! Junk Junk Junk!!!!!!!	-1
Very tight fit on my finger and did not stay in place well.  Ended up preferring the Norwegian Knitting Thimble because I could adjust how it fit on my index finger.	-1
Does anyone make one of these that fits an adult finger? This one is made for a small child. It isn't worth buying, and if you do it isn't worth throwing away. I gave it an extra star for concept, if it fit it should really work well.	-1
Too tight for my finger.  It might work for someone with petite hands.	-1
Completely fails to do anything but draw blood.  My God, it's 2017 and we still can't create a device for putting buttons back on shirts. I'm pretty sure this is why aliens are avoiding contact.	-1
This is not a bobbin box! and should not be advertised as such. Bobbin boxes have individual compartments so if you have one bobbin you can put it away securely....this is just a storage box and very misleading by showing all the bobbins in it!	-1
Great seller fast delivery. Item was not what I thought it should be did not work. Yarn would not slide kept getting caught on plastic.	-1
To small and does not really help.	-1
I decided to try this item to see if it would speed up my colorwork. The fit was fine, snug, but ok. My problem was that the item doesn't feel sturdy. It reminds me of the plastic used for cheap toys.	-1
This yarn guide will work perfectly with worsted weight yarns only, I tried it with cotton yarn and thread but it was useless. I even tried to weave the thread between the guide's teeth to try keeping the thread running through  slowly but it didn't work. Another thing that you should pay attention before buying the product, is the size , I wear size 6 ring , and it fit perfectly on my index finger (middle phalanx ), So bigger finger might not be able to use it. The guider is adjustable , but for me I won't take the risk of using it in larger fingers because the plastic seem to  break easily. To be honest, I expected that I will use the yarn guide each time I crochet, but since I bought it I used it only one time because it does not work with the thick of yarn I usually use.	-1
Others reviewed that this item was too small or tight for them. Because I have notorious slender fingers and small hands (smaller than all my daughters'), I was convinced it would be the perfect size for me. HA! I can barely slip this onto the first joint of my pinky finger, and the hard, brittle plastic is almost completely inflexible. I total waste of time and money. China should stop trying articles out on the children working in their factories.	-1
I tried to thread a needle the first day it arrived and the wire pulled out of the plastic holder on the first pull. It may be just this one, but it is a lemon for me.	-1
This thing is a piece of junk. I DO NOT recommend it at all. Don't waist your money!	-1
After putting on the yarn guide, which is very much made like the toys kids  get in the front of the store with the bubble gum, I realized that I use my left hand to pull the stitches closer the end of the hook as I crochet.  Having this on my pointer finger inhibits that process, and it just isn't comfortable.  It isn't worth returning, but I probably won't use it.	-1
I understood it would nail the Button down, but it uses plastic workaround tools for that.	-1
Useless	-1
still haven't figure this one out, will try again. But thought not worth sending it back.	-1
Too high a price for what one gets. I paid 3.99 - 1.00 is a more appropriate price i think - but who am I to say.	-1
I thought I was so smart making this purchase, but the bobbins spin around and no matter how careful you are, eventually you will end up with thread leaders everywhere.  Do yourself a favor and purchase the bobbin boxes that feature the foam/rubber cutouts inside to keep eau bobbin separate from the others.  Those work perfectly.	-1
I always read the reviews before I buy on Amazon. That's why I buy from Amazon. But this was just a bobbin case, so I didn't bother. Last time I make that mistake. This is not a bobbin case; it's just a little storage box that I'll find some use for at some point. Worthless for advertised purpose. The long slots are way too tall for bobbins and undivided so, unless you put enough in each open slot, they fall over and get tangled. May as well throw them back in your sewing machine's accessory box. They get tangled there, too, but they are more accessible. Oh, well...off to search for actual bobbin storage solutions. Very disappointed.	-1
very good	-1
Next time I purchase something I will not go by what the picture shows. No bonniness in the box. Its just a plastic box. Show the box empty then show what it would look like full. Not just a picture with bobbins in it.	-1
I'd been wanting a new Buttoneer but saw this cheap in Walmart. Yeah  - that was a total waste of money. It is nearly impossible to load & when you get it loaded, it doesn't work right. also, the instructions were worthless because the drawings weren't accurate.	-1
The price was great but the 10 foot sheet came in a box and it was rolled up and vacuum packed.  However when you unrolled the sheet and let it sit for days all of the marks from rolling it up did not come out.  The roll was permanently creased.	-1
Met all expectations, arrived on time and made a fabulous foundation for a chair restoration.	-1
DID NOT RECEIVE THIS ITEM EVEN IF THEY SAY IT WAS. MUST HAVE BEEN PUT IN ANOTHER PERSONS MAILBOX. FORGET IT I'LL BUT AT THE SEWING STORE	-1
I measured a piece of this foam and weighed it. A cubic foot of this foam only weighs 1.2 lbs! For an education, go to foambymail and look at their foam under foam mattresses, and the data sheets for each kind under the resources tab. You will see that they sell 1.3 lb foam under the name Poly Foam, and the description has "Poly foam is a fair-quality foam with a medium feel". This is one of the lowest quality foams they sell and has an ILD (Indentation Load Deflection) of 36 lbs. This foam won't last very long if used for cushions, but might be OK for light duty applications.  I was lucky to get the 2' x 10' x 3" thick piece for only $28.17 and free shipping from Amazon as a Prime customer, so I am not complaining. Amazon does have some incredible deals at times!  I bought a Full Mattress from foambymail which is 4" thick and made of LUX-HQ foam for $109.99 with free shipping, and it is very good high density foam which weighs 2.8 lbs per cubic feet, has an ILD of 50 lbs, and is rated to last from 12 to 18 years. It is much better than this foam. I wish sellers of foam on Amazon would list the Density and ILD rating so buyers would know what they are getting, as the words High Density don't really mean anything.	-1
The picture shows five rows of six bobbins each.  What you can't see is that there is too much room for the bobbin to move side to side.  Also the box is deeper than it needs to be making it difficult to get bobbins out of the box.  What I ended up doing is turning the bobbins sideways allowing 8 bobbins per row.  It's still difficult to get them out but at least they don't do a lot of rolling around.  I'd keep looking.	-1
The seam ripper is just a seam ripper. I bought it for the ergonomic design. I gave it a 1 star because the cap does not stay on. It doesn't snap on, so as soon as I set it down the cap is off. I've already stabbed myself twice picking it up  from the sewing box because the cap isn't on it.	-1
What a diasappointment!  Cap did not fit and tip broke off after only a few uses.  What a waste of $$	-1
The cap that comes with it does not fit! What the heck? I bought two and both of them have the same flaw. It fits nicely in your hand, and seems durable, but these are always prone to break. If they don't have a cap that fits they will break right away if you aren't careful.	-1
I loved this for a while.  The tip is so thin and with a little pressure it broke right off!	-1
I was excited about an ergo product. I deconstruct existing clothing to repurpose so I wanted one that was sturdy enough to handle hours of use. Okay, the handle might be, but the tip broke during my 2nd use. Soooo disappointed.	-1
As I opened the package, the cap went flying.  I picked it up and attempted to secure it on the seam ripper.  Not happening!!!  Although the protective cap does fit over the SHARP end, there is nothing to hold it on.  A sharp seam ripper without a cap is USELESS!!	-1
too thick to spread according to directions, covered 1/3 advertised.	-1
I thought this was what no was looking for, however there is no spacers in the rows that hold the bobbins so if  you only have a few bobbins in that row they roll all around and become unraveled.	-1
The tip of the seam ripper broke off after less than 6 months of use.  My $1.99 seam ripper has lasted years and this one less than 6 months.  I emailed them to tell them how dissapointed I was and NEVER received a response.  Not a "I'm sorry it broke", nothing - nada.  Lousy customer service.  It's like they couldn't care less.  I was an avid fan of Fons and Porter's products but will never buy anything from them again.  I wonder if they know how their customer service department treats their customers.	-1
The slots in this bobbin box are far to large to hold bobbins! They slide around and unravel. I wanted to organise my bobbins! This doesn't work at all.	-1
Bobbins difficult to pickup.  Box is too tall. Does not seem to be meant for bobbins. I should have done my homework.  Much better 'Singer' bobbin box  in Walmart for $2.97, with each bobbin in it's own cradle, so it is very easy to pick up the bobbins. It also has a  hinged lid. I paid $3.84. Recommend that you buy the Walmart Singer bobbin box.	-1
This is the best example of false advertising I have ever seen!  Although the product illustration shows bobbins with colored thread wrapped around them and then the bobbins placed IN the box, I was VERY ANNOYED that the box is just a cheap, empty, plastic box!  I HATE IT!  IT'S FALSLY ADVERTISED! BEWARE OF THIS MERCHANT!	-1
Not as expected.	-1
I used this product to make a crocheted rug non-slippery on a hard wood floor. Unfortunatly, every time I left the rug, there is a mass of sticky residue stuck to my floor. It scrubs off ok with steel wool but I would not use this again.	-1
This thread is already in the bottom of our sewing drawer.  We cannot find a use ... golden just does not work with out jeans.	-1
It's cotton COVERED polyester.  Yeah, it's thick, but polyester thread is a nightmare.  I wish I had known that before purchasing.  Now will have to look for 100% cotton thread!	-1
Ok have to keep smoothing tape down so that it stays on the fabric.	-1
I got this to stabilize shoulder, neck, and arm seams on a bias cut dress. It did the job as far as stabilizing seams, but the material is so scratchy that the dress is almost unwearable. I feel like a 7-year-old wearing scratchy wool for the first time. Not what I was hoping for. I think I am going to use this up and buy narrow silk ribbon instead--it will be harder to use but will not present a wearability problem.  The other reviews are correct that this is not fusible and that it has a woven texture.	-1
did not receive product, but some other "similar" product....if I had wanted a different product, would have ordered something different NOT AS DESCRIBED!	-1
The tape is not as bright as it looks, once applied to the ruler.  It does make it harder to see the fabric underneath as well as the markings on my Omnigrid ruler, so the way I am going to try and use is is to lay a line of it about an eighth or sixteenth OUTSIDE the line I want to mark. This way I can see the line, the fabric, and the perpendicular line markings clear as usual but I can easily see my cutting line. I tried this out cutting 17" squares with a 21.5" ruler, and it made it easier for me to zero in on the 17" square lines without impacting visibility. Given that it isn't much of a glow and I can't put it over the line directly, next time I'd probably just use very narrow masking tape.	-1
Did not stick to ruler or template well	-1
I bought this as I thought it was like my old one bought in the UK. However I was very disappointed to find you can not rotate to get to the back of your work. I had a friend add a couple of pieces of wood and drill for another bolt which now allows me to turn it by loosening the knob, but overall I was very disappointed. The quality is ok but not practical to work on without modification.	-1
2 stars as I like the idea of it...however the string that holds the leather together broke, after 5 min.  Haven't tried the next one yet...	-1
Don't buy this - totally worthless!	-1
It could be just me but I don't really like this item. It moves around too much. I will keep it and perhaps use it on occasion, but I will still keep my eye out for a thimble I can get attached to	-1
not bright enough to see yet too much opacity to see the fabric edge through - it actually made cutting more difficult for me. Useless stuff for quilting - maybe the preschool grands can use it for crafts?	-1
Didn't work well for me when I was transferring a pattern.	-1
these thimbles did not last more than a hour, no wonder they give you three	-1
These were a big disappointment for me. I quilt and was hoping that they would help me while still being able to 'feel' the fabric. They were way too big and there is not way to adjust the size. Another broke after one use.	-1
I have average sized fingers for a man and when I tried to put the thimble on my middle finger, the string that secures it pulled out.  This is not a "one size fits all" product.  Otherwise, it seems nicely put together.  I plan to rework the thimble to replace the thread with a longer version and see how that works out.	-1
<div id="video-block-R3MRXARNKSCOTP" class="a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block"></div><input type="hidden" name="" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71LKh1ur5gS.mp4" class="video-url"><input type="hidden" name="" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81wHlAo%2BvtS.png" class="video-slate-img-url">I am quilter and have a collection of thimbles.  This review presents the comparison of the thimbles along with images of how they fit.  Clover Leather Thimble set is made out of hard leather on top and plastic insert under it (the pink part). It is comfortable to wear, but the string that holds it together broke the first time I tried to use it (I was able to fix it by sewing it together). When I saw it in the store I liked its shape and thought I could use it to protect the tip of my finger (see photo of how I wanted to wear it) but they don't get much use as found something less fragile that works better.  I am attaching comparison and pictures of the thimbles in my collection.  The numbers in the images correspond to the numbers below.  1. Leather thimble with a metal plate (marked #1 in the photos) is my favorite, most versatile thimble. Because it is leather it become shaped to your finger and gets more and more comfortable with use. The metal plate on the tip allows to push through and not hurt your finger. It does not have an opening at the top, so it may not work for those who have long nails.  2. All leather thimble (marked #2 in the photos) is extremely comfortable, but because it has no metal parts it provides less protection. I often use it as a second thimble on the hand to protect another finger because it does not get in a way.  It has an opening at the top, so it works for those who have long nails.  3. Strip thimbles (marked #3 in the photos, the product in this listing) turned out not to be very useful.  The leather itself can be penetrated by the needle, the pink plastic insert does protect the finger. However the string that holds thimble together on the back broke very quickly.  I was able to repair them by stitching them together on the back to replace the string that broke.  As you see from the photo they don't cover the very tip of the finger, so they did not work well for me.  4. Plastic thimble provides good protection, but hard plastic makes it a bit hard to work with.  So I usually put it on only when my needle is stuck and needs an extra push. It has an opening at the top, so it would work for someone with long nails.  5. Thimble #5 is a thimble I made myself out of band-aid wrapped around my finger. I needed to protect my thumb, and my home made thimble worked best.  If you have hard time finding a good thimble, give it a try making it yourself out of Nexcare bandages.  They seem to hold the shape well, and I could put my home-made thimble on and off, so I could re-use.  6. Thimble #6 was a thumb thimble I bought, but I found that it got in the way because it was a bit too long and made my hands less agile. It has no opening at the top, so it might work for people with long nails.  So if you have to buy one thimble I would go with leather thimble with a metal plate.	-1
I bought this to mark my rulers with as I cut pieces for quilting. The tape popped off several times, and I did not use it after.	-1
I bought this device thinking it would speed the basting process and shorten the time to complete the quilt.  That it did.  But the plastic pins are so long that the layers were shifting while I was sewing.  New to quilting and eager to get to the end, I didn't check the back until it was too late:  Scores of unintentional tucks were everywhere on the back.  Furthermore, the pins are so thick and dull that they tore their way through the fabrics, breaking threads as they went.  A total mess.  My first quilt was trashed by this device.  I would not recommend this for anything but attaching price tags to old clothes at a garage sale.  Don't waste your money.  Hand-basting, safety pins or basting spray will serve you better.  I notice that quilt shops no longer caller this item.)	-1
I have been using something to keep my cord off my ironing for years.  Clamp similar to this with a  14 inch long wire that held your iron cord up and  away from your clothing.  Husband broke the clamp. Sullivan's cord minder is useless.  Cord doesn't slide through the wheel.  The "weight" to pull the cord away from you is useless, you might as well use a paper clip.  Removed the clip from this item and had husband attach it to the wire that I was smart enough to save.  Perfect.  Two star only because I could recycle the clamp.	-1
The cord minder did not perform as I expected.  My iron has 2 cords, an electric cord and a water hose.  I hoped I could keep the 2 cords separated but the clamp on the cord minder is not strong enough to remain clamped on my ironing board.  It pops off at the least amount of tension on it.  Disappointing.  I think the product would work if it had a stronger clamp.	-1
Missing needles in package	-1
broke all the time	-1
For a seam ripper it's adequate.  But the workmanship and quality certainly does not match the one I bought years ago for half the price.  Don't get me wrong . . . it will take out stitches you just feel the inferior quality of the tool when you use it.	-1
The glue doesn't stick very well and pulls away from the ruler.  Especially if the ruler has any flex whatsoever.  Disappointing.	-1
Instructions would be really, really nice.	-1
Delivery was on time, I have not opened the package yet but I can see the red coloring has flaked off and is laying on the shaft and point of the needles.  This makes me wonder if these are seconds. Not sure if I should use them or not!	-1
Didn't work the way I expected, and there are no directions included on how to use it. I searched You Tube videos, but didn't have much luck sharpening any of my scissors.	-1
Not as expected.	-1
I received this sewing gauge on time and packaged very well. Comparing this to my original gauge might not be fair as I purchased the original 25 years ago.  The measurements are marked accurately but the slide moves at will, the thin gauge metal is rippled after two uses.  Dritz has been a respected name in sewing sundries for many years. Hopefully this product slipped thru quality control alone. Sadly it is truly worthless.	-1
Arrived bent.  Gauge will not stay in position without slipping.  Very frustrating trying to measure 108 drapery hems. Will look for different brand.	-1
Very cheaply made.  It Bent the first time I used it.  The medal is so thin it will not lay flat on the material by itself.	-1
This is a VERY useful tool...while it lasts. I kept it close by while sewing because I was always reaching for it. But after a while the slide came out. I was able to repair it but not long after the ruler itself bent. It's incredibly flimsy metal. I hate that things are made to break. This is an incredibly useful tool that of made of better quality could serve a sewist her whole life. Why not make it of decent quality and charge more for it? I'm sure we'd all be glad not to have to throw this away and purchase a new one. So wasteful. I won't be replacing.	-1
Bought for daughters 1st sewing machine. She is enjoying it now and it is easy to operate with simple parts..	-1
I have brother's sewing machine I could use any kind of Walmart's product so far and it's been fitted pretty well except these. I don't know what's going on I thought I was doing wrong but as soon as I changed the needle the problem was gone. I bought even 2 packs. Dang it!	-1
I found this to be pretty filmsy. It bent after a few uses so the slide does work--definitely not my mothers, which lasted forever.	-1
Hate it. This thing measures 16" by 16 1/2, if that's not idiotic I don't know what is. As far as I'm concerned that certainly makes it useless for making anything square.  Being a 1/2" off makes it much to difficult to use.  I can't imagine why it would be designed a half inch off.	-1
Not as sturdy as i expected it to be, was afraid teh rottary would cut right threw the ruler, returned with no prpblems.	-1
Very poor quality - the sliding gauge (for lack of a better description) that marks the distance (the blue thing you see in the photo) is cheap plastic, rendering it pretty much unreliable and useless. Wish I'd gone with a better brand.	-1
This bobbin box is made of hard, fragile plastic. The lid is clear and the bottom part black. Unlike other bobbin cases, which use a pre-cut foam insert to hold the bobbins in place, this one has a blue hard plastic insert, which unfortunately does nothing to keep the bobbins in their slot once you open the case. The lid snaps shut, but there's no sliding latch, so if you're not careful the case could easily open during transport -- and spill all its contents. The same thing will happen should the case drop on the floor -- be prepared to deal with bobbins and thread scattered all over the place. For a couple more bucks, try&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/this-one/dp/B007P56B6K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">this one</a>&nbsp;instead (also from Dritz) which is made of soft, not hard plastic, has a sturdier hinge and latch, and uses a foam insert. There is also a&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/set-of-2/dp/B001R4T4VE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">set of 2</a>&nbsp;for a little more if you have the use. I'm really surprised this box received such good reviews (which is why I bought it). I don't recommend it.	-1
Every single one of the gauges I bought lost their black markings.  Really disappointed with the quality!!  Maybe Dritz should sell them with a plastic sleeve to protect them (they would probably rip).....  Dritz use to be a somewhat quality brand. I think they need to go back to the drawing board if they expect to keep their customers happy and coming back for more.	-1
This actually made the thread tangling worse for me.  I used it with embroidery floss.  I've learned to just cut a 10 inch piece of thread and it tangles less.	-1
Too small to use effectively	-1
The numbers stated wearing off after a couple of months	-1
I have a small omni grid rotary but needed a bigger 1, but when i received this and started to cut my fabric the rotary was very dull and would not cut a darn thing, so now i have to go buy another blade for it, very dissapointed..	-1
Disappointing.  This doesn't do much.  My thread still tangles and twisted.  Better off with some bees wax. Bummer.	-1
For general hand sewing this stuff is pretty useless.  I bought myself some as a treat for finishing  a sewing bag/organizer.  My old lump of beeswax is a far superior conditioner for hand sewing thread.  Maybe this works well for embroidery or threads of heavier  weights.  bummer for me.	-1
They show what is supposed to be 3 different Crochet hook packs.  The 12409 and the 82409 are EXACTLY the same!  Save your money, unless you are giving one set as a gift, even then, just choose 2 of the lesser price.  I gave this a 1 star due to duplicity.	-1
The adjustable marker is too stiff to move making it hard to move	-1
I needed a smaller cutter for my sewing projects and thought this one would work nicely... I was wrong.. I spend mor time putting it back together than I do being able to cut with it.. I think it was designed poorly... I really like my other Olfa products but this one is better off just left in the drawer..	-1
Cutting multiples of sizes is wonderful with this ruler. I use this often to tame my scraps. Cutting my own jelly rolls and charms is easy with this.	-1
Fell apart the first time tried to use it.  After putting back together had issues using it. Will not buy any more Olfa brand	-1
Will not be buying again.	-1
This is really too small to be useful.  I messed up using it and probably will keep it in a box and never look at it again.  Don't buy this...stick with other sizes for something really practical!	-1
I really like these hooks, but I think the size is off. The "N" on here is way bigger than my "N" from walmart, the metal cheapies. In fact, the "L" in this set is way bigger than my metal "N" from walmart.......I think the measured sizes are wrong, though I could be mistaken somehow. Either way, I am ordering a second set, cause the "N" in this set works perfect for a double stranded, tunisian entrelac pattern I am using, and i need two of the "N"s, whatever size it really is......	-1
The product itself is nice but I bought it specifically for the Easy Circle ruler. The blade is too short to reach the fabric underneath the ruler.	-1
not crazy about these started using and put them back into a package to give away to someone...	-1
not great and very cheaply constructed. Cannot change blade what is point?	-1
I was expecting something much better from Olfa. I hoped it would be small enough to cut out a circle using a tracing form, but no dice - it didn't reach through the 1/8" thick plastic. I have no idea what one would use this for, if it won't work for that.	-1
Breaks so easy I do not recommend this product	-1
This is only good for paper.	-1
I own several Olfa rotary cutters for quilting.  I used this 18 mm cutter to cut out small appliques.  This one kept falling apart and I would have to screw it back together every minute or two.  The larger 45 mm Olfa cutter I use most often has been great.  Not sure if I received a "lemon" on this small one or not,  But it does seem that the blade is not attached as securely on this small one as opposed to the larger size ones.  I'm going to try a different brand 18 mm and see if it works any better.	-1
I was rather disappointed. I was hoping it would make my embroidery projects work-up more smoothly but it made the thread knot up more than if I'd not used anything and so I eventually that is exactly what I ended up doing to finish the projects. While it was fairly easy to use now because the box is full, it would be somewhat more difficult as it is used up. As soon as I can purchase some I plan to go back to my beeswax in a container that lets me draw the thread through a special slot-not a problem applying it no matter how little is left. I never had trouble with knotting thread when I used that.	-1
I have used this with no noticeable results over bees wax.  In fact, for me, bees wax seems to do a better job protecting the thread, minimizing any fraying and helping the thread slide easier through the material.	-1
Not what I thought they would be.....the yarn does not glide on the hook making it difficult to crochet....	-1
I bought this for needle punch work. I really hoped it would hold my work as well as a gripper frame. Not even close. I was hoping as the Morgans come in a variety if sizes. Maybe for embroidery it would be ok, but I do NOT like it for needle punch.	-1
Would never recommend it . Total waste of money.	-1
It could be convenient, but the top won't stay on. It's way too loose, and needles just fly everywhere when it comes off. Great in concept, awful in reality.	-1
Uncomfortable in hand. Position in hand yells weird angle. Not sure if there dull or if it's the angle, but I can't cut with them. Non-returnable per Amazon Prime.	-1
Not as per expected	-1
New order, hoping it cuts we'll! Price was good & hoping the quality is as well. Have no other issues.	-1
I bought these for a very specific small space I wanted to put a pair of scissors into, that could take a max length of 2.75". These scissors are labeled as 2.5" but they are NOT, they are clearly 3" scissors. If you are okay with a 3" pair then these may be fine, keep in mind they are designed as a VERY compact set of scissors so aren't going to be easy to use particularly for someone with larger hands, but the additional length is in the grips so probably work better than a true 2.5" pair would. They do cut easily and are nice and sharp. They are just NOT the size that is advertised, so I have to buy something else since they don't fit my available storage space.	-1
I tried using this but it was very obvious where the patch was placed.	-1
Junk.  Very thin but the real problem is that the adhesive does not stick. If you follow the directions an apply the iron for 45 seconds, the patch begins to melt and the adhesive disappears. 15-20 seconds and it sticks a little bit. Additional heat does not help it at all.  It is also mostly plastic and will be stiff on cotton clothing.  Recommend you find a different product.	-1
I did not like the way this tourned out. My fabric still faded.	-1
Doesn't work the way I thought it would. I just misunderstood.	-1
BROKE	-1
I certainly expected this OLFA rotary cutter to last more than 4 months, but that's exactly what it did.  I'm very disappointed	-1
I'm very surprised. Olga is supposed to be a good product. My first day of use, regular cutting of single fabric thickness with a template, cut effortlessly.  Not so the next time. Now can barely cut thru. Extremely disappointed in the blade.	-1
I had to send these back.  The spring made it difficult on my hand to cut - and I'm a pretty strong woman.  The spring helps open the sheers, which is great, but then adds a lot of resistance to closing the sheers making them difficult to cut fabric.  I would not recommend.	-1
the corner was crushed and that was upsetting but the big one is handy.	-1
Blade cut nice, but this product feel apart pretty easy. I used it to cut small appliqu pieces of fabric and it just feel apart in my hand one day after I would say a few hours of use.	-1
My issue with this rotary cutter is simple! With ease, my index finger easily reaches to the cutting blade, instead of its resting on the ridged resting area. YIKES!  Instead, I suggest use of  the auto-close version cutters (45mm or 60mm). With auto-close, another danger is eliminated. With those, it's impossible for a finger (any age hand) to reach the blade! I cannot believe that small one has such an obvious flaw! Threat of danger is too high for my using it!	-1
I would have thought singer scissors would work well for cutting material ( fabric) No Way! Go buy the dollar store ones, much better. Or better yet buy these - Fiskars 8 Inch Everyday Titanium Scissors	-1
I love the quality of Gingher scissors, but these are not made for people with arthritis!  I bought them because I thought the spring would make them easier to use, but it actually makes them much harder to open and close and the locking mechanism is almost impossible to move.  .  I returned them and bought a pair of Gingher scissors without the spring and they are much easier to use!  Gingher really blew it when they made these.	-1
These are honestly just horrible. I would say you get what you pay for, but my first pair of fabric scissors was just $2 more and worked far better than this. I only got these because after a full year of heavy usage of my first pair, they started getting dull. We tried sharpening them and they actually got worse, so these were a quick backup. These cannot cut through multiple layers at all, even two layers of fabric proves to be difficult. My screwed up scissors can still do that. These even popped out of place after the first day of usage. Avoid these, NOT worth your time and money. They just don't cut well at all.	-1
The worst pair of scissors I've ever owned no way you could cut any fabric with the scissors maybe paper	-1
These scissors are for the birds!  They barely cut through 1 layer of fusible fleece, cannot get through two.  Only good to cut a single layer of non interfaced fabric, it can't even handle two layers without bending and snagging.  I sew bags, all fabric is interfaced.  These scissors used to work amazing.  I lost my pair in traveling, so I ordered two new pairs.  Well something changed...just like their machines.  They are junk now!	-1
Poor quality. Not sharp enough, had to keep tightening screw. Not smooth at all.	-1
I thought because the scissors are made by Singer they would be good scissors. They are dull. I tried sharpening them but that didn't help much. I went back to using some worn out but sharp scissors I purchased years ago. I'll do some research to find out about good quality scissors before buying some more.	-1
scissors not sharp enough to cut anything more than paper. I sharpened the scissors and they still don't cut well. Worst product I ever purchased. Any I believe in the quality of the Singer brand but these scissors do NOT meet Singer standard!	-1
I added these to my wish list based on recommendations from several friends and was super excited to get them, until I actually put my hand in them. I never even bothered to try them on fabric because I knew I would get an amazing amount of hand fatigue by the way they fit my hand. I am a tall woman, and I guess I have large hands, but it didn't occur to me to read the other reviews and I wish I had.	-1
I remember when Singer was a good product name, Used these scissors every day cutting heavy material, dull already in the middle of the scissors. Reminds me of scissors that sells for less in the thrift stores, only heavier. Wouldn't buy again. 2 stars for the couple of weeks they did do the job. Glad I bought a backup from a different brand to continue making mats for the animals cages at the Humane Society shelter-	-1
They dull quickly. I wouldn't purchase these again. I love singer sewing machines but not the scissors. I have purchased a titanium pair of scissors since and am happy.	-1
Don't cut very well.  Not sharp.  No good for fabric	-1
Fractures in the corner of the ruler.	-1
I just did not like these scissors, they did not seem to be that sharp and was not that pleased with the way they felt in my hands. I think I would prefer an all metal pair of scissors.  I was not fond of the comfort grip, because it made them felt to heavy.  Sorry, will try another pair. Would not recommend.	-1
I have found that adding various sewing gadgets to my collection has made a lot of projects easier and hoped that his Clover Finger Presser would continue that trend.  Maybe it is the various types of material on which I tried to use it or maybe it is the fact that I just don't have enough strength in my finger, but this hasn't worked for me.  I even thought that it might be something that would be handy in the laundry room when tee shirts, etc. come out of the dryer with the hem turned up.  It didn't work for smoothing the hem down either.  In fact, the time I spent trying to finger press seams, etc.  was substantially more than just putting them on the ironing board.	-1
You don't need this. It's silly.	-1
Not so ggod...wood is better	-1
This is one of the those things that look great on tv. But may end up in the cabinet never being used, as mine does.  There are much better ones out there much cheaper.	-1
I was super excited to get this portable ironing pad that I could use on my cutting table instead of hauling out the iron board.  However, the first time I used it, it wrinkled and is all mottled so its unusable.  What a waste.  I wanted to use for my quilting projects but it will be thrown in the trash... my money is hard to come by, so things like this really irritate.	-1
Instructions are not clear.  I didn't use it after the first time and was disappointed.	-1
I thought the rulers would be a little longer for god sakes why do I keep buying these foolishness	-1
I didn't find this helpful.  I have and odd shaped wooden tool with angles on both ends that is wonderful so I thought the plastic would be an improvement and I could add to my travel case.  Most likely I will give to anyone who likes it.  I would not do that with the wooden one. I would buy a friend a wooden one of their own but I would miss it to much to give away.  Biggest reason I didn't like is that it didn't really put a change in flattening the fabric just moved over it.  That was on cotton so I am sure it wouldn't like a heavier fabric.	-1
I had never used the Dritz Wonder Tape before.  I had only used the Collins brand, which was always great.  But I needed it for a class, and couldn't find Collins locally.  This stuff is horrible.  We were doing an "In The Hoop" machine embroidery project, that had a zipper.  It wouldn't stick.  There were several of us in the class that bought this stuff, and it worked for none of us.  We were left to use a different brand from the dealer, where the class was being held.  If I could find my receipt, I would return it.  I'd give it a zero rating if I could.	-1
I wish it would fit 1000 meter thread spools.	-1
First off, Amazon did a terrible job with packaging.  When it arrived 3 pegs were already broken.  When I opened the back legs for it to stand, the staples holding in the bar on the front were pushed out by the back leg.  The wood is very soft so I had could push then back in to place. I need 2 racks and would like them to match but have to decide if I should throw it away and start over. I am going to try removing the pegs, gluing the weak spots  with wood glue (like the staples that pulled out),  spray paint the rack and hubby has offered to replace the soft wood pegs with brass rods cut to size.  I had not planned on buying a project but guess I did.  I plan on attaching it to the wall so it should be stable once that is done. That said my spools fit on nicely but I had to turn every other one upside down.	-1
Its hard to pull off the paper to reveal the second sticky side! Waste of money!	-1
I tried this today and it would work well in theory, but it totally gums up the needle something awful...and the SMELL.  Oh the smell is a horrible adhesive smell.  I couldn't even work with it.  I'm sad, I really wanted this to work to add zippers to a pouch for my class of 10-11 year olds.  I guess I will have to stick with good ol pins!	-1
Doesn't fit my small spools of embroidery threads and couldn't cancel it fast enough. Plus I had to open it to put in a return slip otherwise I would have refused it..	-1
Quality did not match what I thought it would be. It's very light pine, also during shipping one of the pegs broke off.	-1
Junk.  The backing of the second side is nearly impossible to remove, and when I finally did get it off it left a residue that made it "unsticky" USELESS JUNK.	-1
Too small to really guide fabric well, but magnet is strong	-1
I ordered this one because YouTube videos recommend it. They don't. Maybe if you have really thin fabrics it will hold.	-1
Not happy with this. I thought this wasn't supposed to move while sewing to help guide, but even though its magnetic, it slides. Waste of money.	-1
So cheap and not happy with it at all!! It already broke !!!!	-1
Magnet is not strong enough, otherwise it's a good idea.	-1
Very disappointed! I have a new computerized sewing machine and thought the would be great! No, because when I received it I read on the back of package "do not use on computerized sewing machines". Company should add that to the description! When I tried to return it it was going to cost more than I paid for it to ship it back. Not worth ruining my machine or to return it.	-1
I didn't send it back because I was probably using it for something other than just ripping out seams, but was quite disappointed when something this expensive broke so easily.	-1
You need a fairly big metal bobbin plate guard for this to actually work. It is apt to slide if the whole guide doesn't fit on the metal plate.	-1
good idea, but not well done--does not stand up to weight of even a couple of spools--tips super easily--might see if I can use it mounted to the wall...have to figure out how to do that, otherwise, big waste of my $	-1
Doesn't hold well on machines that are mostly plastic. The magnetic piece hold somewhat, but not a sure guide. A quilting guide bar (slips into the back of the sewing bar does a better job and is usually more accurate.	-1
Magnet is very weak and not perfectly flat and wiggles on sewing machine; quality is not good and somewhat useless designed item.	-1
Spend the extra few dollars and get the larger style	-1
ok.	-1
My husband and son are in the garage trying to assemble this right now.  It was supposed to be assembled and one review mentioned "hardwood" neither are true.  I got 10 pieces of softwood with lots of exposed staples.  What a mess!  Maybe I'll feel better when it's assembled and working but right now I am a little crabby about the whole thing.	-1
returned as cannot use with computerize machine	-1
Description should have included that it cannot be used for computerized machines.  Waste of  money.	-1
This broke the fist time I attempted to use it. This was a disappointing surprise as Clover usually makes quality products.	-1
I don't even use it. It's not that helpful.	-1
Not particularly useful for marking quarter inch seams.	-1
So disappointed with quality of this product.  Plastic is very cheap unlike quilting rulers.	-1
not a very strong magnet. If I am working with heavier material it just pushes this out of the way.	-1
Item was in three pieces unable to use	-1
These things are the size I wanted but the points on the pins aren't great.  Very hard to use as the points don't taper much, so it's hard to slide them through fabric.  Wouldn't buy again,	-1
I did not like this.  It scratches my machine and gets in the war unless you are sewing a long straight seam.  Not a fan and will prolly not use it much.  Mole skin on the machine is cheaper and better.	-1
I had trouble using this because it is too thick to be near the needle where I need to gage the fabric.  It is a good product, just not for my brother sewing machine.	-1
didn't work for me, too cumbersome	-1
This was the second one of these I purchased. I will never purchase again. The middle thread holder to fish into the needle broke right off. Came out of the holder. This is junk to me. If you have had great luck, awesome. I would rather not waste my money on this item again.	-1
Did not hold up for threading needle after only 3 sewing projects	-1
Im doing fine cross stitch with needles that have a very small eye. The wire part on this was too thick to get through the eye. But Im keeping it in case I ever go back to wool yarn needlepoint.	-1
I tried this and it does nothing. The fabric just folds up against it. You'd be better off just watching the placement yourself and adjusting as you sew	-1
Did not work for me.  Moves around on my sole plate, ruining the purpose of it!!!  My machine must be made of metal, I cannot figure it out.  Why won't  it grip?  It just grips a little bit.  Maybe the magnet is too high up in the case?  I will do more research and re-do this review if I can get it to work right.  I see from other reviews that other people got it to work.	-1
Read a review that stated this could be used with a computerized sewing machine. Thought it would be small then.  It is not. Brother did not seem to think it safe either. There are a hundred and one ways to mark a seam line and most all would be safer than this. No need to take a chance with the cost of machines.	-1
I loved this little threader but it only held up for a little  over 1 month.  The little wires came out of the base.  Very disappointed.	-1
I've been looking all over for a seam guide since my Husky doesn't have the attachment.  Bought this one and couldn't use it at all.  The majority of the presser feet are metal.  The magnet slid instantly to the foot no matter how I placed it.  Even tried breaking the magnet and using smaller pieces.  Still didn't work.  Nice little gadget if you can use it.	-1
Very disappointed. I dropped it on the floor the first time I used it and it shattered.  I had no fun finding all the pins that went everywhere. :-(	-1
The wire is not going to llast long at all.  The two ends are great for the larger eye needles and yarn. I just bought thus one two weeks ago, and the wire broke.  I just  bought a different needle threader that is much better.	-1
New order, hoping it cuts we'll! Price was good & hoping the quality is as well. Have no other issues.	-1
The package was hard to open, and immediately the thin wire from this piece came off.  Not good quality.	-1
Broke the first time I used it.  The only one of the three parts I needed, the wire part for small needles, broke almost immediately.  I'd return it but who has time to bother with such a small item?  Don't waste the extra money.  Go with the regular cheap metal threaders that also break in a few uses.  They really don't make things like they used to.	-1
This threader seems sturdy, and it looks like a very good idea.  However, you have to use HUGE needles for it to work.  Needles that large are only good for knitting or sewing heavy material like denim.  It's impossible to use on smaller needles, which I use the most.  SO DISAPPOINTED.  $5 is too much for something that can't be used.  $1 would have been too much for this.  I broke 2 very heavy needles trying to use this piece of garbage.	-1
ok	-1
The medal is very thin and the pens ben easily.	-1
too flimsy to work. Decoration only. very disappointed	-1
This has got to be a joke. The largest needle in here, was made for an 18 inch doll to sew. What a rip off.	-1
Was bent when arrived	-1
way too thick for use in hiding my thread tails when quilting.  All of the needles are the exact same size.	-1
Can't easily thread it, have to force the thread in while holding the needle.  Because of how much pressure you have to put in it becomes very dangerous because it could slip and hurt you.	-1
I purchases these needles to use with my quilting, to be able to tie off and hide the thread ends.  Unfortunately, they do not allow the thread to automatically thread the needle, and instead the thread tears at the point it is trying to go through the open eye. At first I thought it was a problem with the thread, or maybe a defective needle,  but I tried several types of thread and several needles with the same results - about one time out of ten the thread would pull into the needle eye, and the other 9 times it would break.  I purchased another brand at a local store and they work perfectly. I will be returning these needles.	-1
They did not work	-1
I think I received knock-off needles. After my thread kept falling out of these, I noticed the dispenser looks different. It says SINCER instead of SINGER, and it's not in the usual Singer font. In my photo below my presumably knock-off pack is sitting atop a Singer pack I purchased elsewhere. I'm surprised since these were sold by and shipped form Amazon.	-1
Was NOT Singer brand. Package said Signer and was extremely poorly made. Cheap, ragged needles broke every thread I tried to sew.	-1
Not even one star!  These needles must have burrs on them because they break the thread when you try to pop it into the easy-thread notch! Very frustrating for my poor sewing students.  Next time I'll try a better brand.  Down with Singer!	-1
The theory of self-threading is marvelous!  The practical application of that theory failed.  At the threading end of these needles is a "v" area, into which the thread is placed.  Deeper inside that "v" area is a slit, into which the thread is forced, and during that forcing process the thread is often broken, at the very least it is damaged.  Too bad this isn't a perfect product, but I salute them for at least trying!	-1
These machine needles do NOT stay threaded.  Very Disappointing to me.  A neighbor even tried and they would still not stay threaded.	-1
Did not order this don't know why I'm asked to review	-1
I was very disappointed  as thought with the name brand it would not leave cut marks.	-1
I opened up the package and was greeted by the strong smell of motor oil. One entire side was covered in footprints and the other was scuffed and scratched. Completely unacceptable. It looked like someone had been using it as a floor mat. Buy elsewhere.	-1
Post op cervical laminectomy...this did not do the trick as far as pulling my shoulders back..handy though and easy to put on compared to other braces for the back..just doesnt work very well	-1
I received this today and it is a completely different mat than the one pictured. The one I received was an awful; dark black color with squares in the middle.  Sending it back.	-1
I purchased this product from another store because it was the right size and I've been impressed with fiskars products in the past. However, my sewing/craft room is in the basement and I wanted to be able to leave the mat out all the time on my cutting table for convince. But this mat made my entire basement smell so badly even my spouse was complaining. I tried airing it out, and about 5 different cleaning methods recommended for getting out smells from mats. After a month of this and no improvement I decided it just wouldn't work for me and I returned it without using it. The quality of the mat does seem heavy duty and like it would hold up for a long time. And I'm sure it works fine for it's intended purpose. I just couldn't deal with the smell.	-1
Dries up really fast. It was unusable after about 3 months. But when it worked, it was great.	-1
I have small cutting mats, and they have worked great for my smaller projects. As I have decided to jump into the world of art quilting, I needed a bigger mat.  There are no places where I live (The Boonies) which sell sewing supplies beyond a basic pack of needle and cheap 50-cent threads, so I went to my favorite place to shop (Amazon) to look for a decent, yet affordable mat.  There were several mats that had the dimensions I needed (one direction had to be at least 24"), but my budget was very limited this time. So, I was looking for decent without breaking the bank.  I have to say that I was very disappointed indeed. I have cut three binding strips that were two feet long each, so six feet of fabric, and trimmed the edges of my art quilt. That's all. I have four or five black lines (my fabric was black cotton) on the mat permanently now!  I cannot brush them off, and they did not wash off. I had a new blade, so it wasn't an old blade digging a rut. And a self-healing mat should be self-healing anyway!! Not that it should matter, but my cutter is also a Fiskars:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Fiskars-9521-45mm-Contour-Rotary-Cutter/dp/B000B7M8WU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Fiskars 9521 45mm Contour Rotary Cutter</a>.  I am really disappointed by this purchase. I needed one desperately, and it kept me from cutting the table, so I won't be sending it back. But good grief - permanently "scarred" after ONE project that wasn't even a lot of cutting??  I'll post a few photos. I see other reviews don't mention this. I wonder if I got a bad mat? Also, mine came shipped relatively flat in a large box, so I guess Amazon has changed the shipping methods and no longer rolls the mats. For storage, I just put up a small nail at an angle against the wall, both to save space and to keep the mat flat.  For those who care about such things, this board also contains the state of California warning about being made with stuff known to cause cancer. Thankfully, I don't plan to eat meals off this mat, so hopefully just touching it will not transmit anything horrible. Just to be safe, I washed my hands after using it.  Meanwhile, with a name like Fiskars, I thought this would lead the pack, not trail sadly behind. For shame, Fiskars. For shame!	-1
Does not mark fabric clearly. Dried up within days.	-1
package arrived with the cap broken. Given that this is an Air erase marker well you get the gist :(	-1
The magnet Inside the Pincushion is not strong enough to keep the pointed ends down, so when you come to take a pin you are always getting pricked, which is no fun when you try to work fast.	-1
Really unhappy with the item, and ordered 6! Ah well... My mistake. Not sure what I'll do with the stuff, since it won't work for the grand children's footy pjs! Terribly stiff and just a waste for my intended application.	-1
THis item is Very cheap and really not worth paying shipping and handling for this. Just buy at your local fabric store.	-1
I purchased this ruler for a specific pattern - because they said I needed it.  Well, I think there are much easier ways to make half-square triangles and measure than using this method.  Don't waste your money and end up sewing triangles on the bias!	-1
Not soft at all, I had to return it	-1
Very small quantity.  Joann's has mush larger bag for about the same price.  Quality is the same.	-1
I had purchased this product once before and wanted never to again.  I made the mistake of ordering this.  It is the worst type of fiberfill, very difficult to use. I prefer the fluffy stuffing. Not sure what this would be good for but stuffing pillows or toys is not one of its uses.	-1
These pins are disappointingly weak.  They are very easily bent.  Not very "safe" if the head can be bent back and the sharp point exposed so easily.  Or the sharp side can bend, and slip out of the housing.  Not recommended.	-1
Flimsy.	-1
I bought these primarily to thread elastic.  But I was running short on some pinning quilts, so I added these in the middle of a project.  Yuck.  They are far inferior to the dritz brand, same size ones that I bought CHEAP at my fabric store.  I assumed Singer meant quality and I was mistaken in this case. They are thinner.  And not as "polished" as the dritz ones.  They snagged on my fabric the one and only time I used them for quilt pinning.  They are lightweight and just not project quality.  I don't even think they are going to hold up to my elastic threading chores. Save your buck fifty.  Find the dritz ones.	-1
size is correct, but these bend incredibly easily. useless because of this.	-1
...they made the metal thinner and shoddier. When will manufacturers get it? We are fed up with them making merchandise smaller and crappier AND charging a lot more. The metal in these is the same gauge (but much more prone to bending) than the #0 size safety pins I bought in 2005. Singer's new #3 version is pathetically weak and I am returning them. Let's hope other pin manufacturers haven't followed this brilliant marketing model.  Some recent reviews for these pins are really high. I can't help believe they must have gotten older stock because the ones I just bought are downright unusable for anything except attaching immobile items weighing less than an ounce. They bend just looking at them.	-1
Needle leather sewing BROKE IMMEDIATELY.	-1
I was very disappointed two broke from the first sewing, very cheap needles.	-1
Bought a few packages but there is only one needle in the package. Poor quality control. Wouldn't you think when someone was putting it in the box, they would see there are missing parts??	-1
They break easily.	-1
I can't used to wearing it?  Seems so bulky.	-1
Not comfortable for me to sew with.	-1
It is too stiff and hard to use.  Does not want to give. I didn't like it. What more is there to say?	-1
If you buy the large set, they won't all fit.  Takes a lot of time to jam them into the tight spots.  I'm ready to toss it and use a small bag.	-1
It is OK, but with the soft touch handles it becomes bulky when wrapped.  I like the regular case better, but still, both need a place for scissors and markers or other crochet essentials.	-1
This was not the product that I thought it would be.  If you are using the Soft Touch Crochet Hooks then it would be perfect.  Product is well made	-1
This little case needs to be about 1/2" taller in order for my crochet hooks to fit in properly. I'm very disappointed. It's such a nice case but seriously, my hooks just don't fit. They stick out over the top edge, which makes the covering flap stick out. I'm not happy with it but since I only pull out my crochet hooks once every couple of years I'll put up with it. If I used them regularly, I'd send it back.	-1
My machine is low shank and I used the red attachment. I found two problems with the basic white attachment holder:  1. It did not "set down" close enough after lowering the presser foot bar,  2. While sewing the zipper, it slid freely along the little bar thus sliding under and breaking the needle.	-1
This invisible zipper foot and the presser foot shaft mounting clips did NOT work with my small Janome 1117S machine.  The plastic adapter pieces are too thick to fit between the back of the needle holder shaft and the presser foot shaft. The back of the needle holder is blocked by the plastic holder piece.  Your machine needs at least 6.5mm clearance for this to work, and there is no way to adjust the foot forward or backward over the needle hole in the base plate.  I am still looking for the old version of this attachment that snaps to the bottom of the pressure foot. :(	-1
So disappointed since they  don't work withy the Cricut Explore.  I think when the ad was written the "Explore" wasn't out yet.  Returned them with no problem.  Gotta love Amazon!!	-1
Too big	-1
I would not buy this for any child. Its confusing and the strands of yarn they send aren't long enough to get everything done. Great idea, wrong set up.	-1
Thank you!	-1
The photo shows big brushes, well the ones in this pack is very thin and tiny. Too small for a toddler/five year-old. The white dish is smaller than the palm of my hand. Was this kit made for Santa's elves? Because no one can use this. You'd think for such a high price it would be bigger and better quality. Well, it isn't either.	-1
I was looking for a thicker palette paper.  these are just sheets of paper with a high gloss side.  I wouldn't say I hated them, they just aren't what I expected.	-1
Almost all the pencils were hard and useless, all they did was scratch and scar the paper. The issue persisted through the entire core.	-1
I received these for my birthday (from my Amazon wish list) and just broke into them today to begin a new project. Previously I was borrowing a set from a friend, the exact same set only older.  Those ones were heavier, perfectly positioned and smooth. One handle nearly gave me a splinter, the back is rough and unsandedsuper uncomfortable. This won't be easily fixed because there is a shiny coating on it.  Besides this, most of the handles aren't properly aligned with the metal pieces. Check out the picture.  Super bummed. ):	-1
The fit and finish of this knife was on par with what you buy next to the checkout line at a gas station. Way over priced for what you get.	-1
I guess if you know how to carve wood, this kit works, but if you're new at carving, get instructions!!! I got my money back by selling it on Craig's List	-1
Seems that the quality of these pliers is very poor. The teeth on the pair that I got were poorly formed, and the nose was not straight, so the tips did not come to an even closure. It's possible that I could grind the tips down to make it close better, but the teeth are still uneven. From the side, you can see how poorly they are cut. While it is possible that the item was used/damaged, or returned, it looks like the damage is from manufacturing.  I have ordered some higher quality pliers from a japanese manufacturer:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Fanout-Curved-Jaw-Breaker-Grozier-Pliers-for-Stained-Glass-Work/dp/B00BJ23WSK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Fanout Curved Jaw Breaker Grozier Pliers for Stained Glass Work</a>	-1
The front face (plastic part) arrived damaged even though it was in proper packaging. I doubt a replacement one would be any better. They need to figure out a better way to package this clock. It also looked very cheap and was lightweight when I pulled it out of the box. Would not recommend. I ordered a small Casio clock afterwards and it was pretty good, although kind of small.	-1
Too bad. Most thread boxes are cheap little plastic boxes that break. This one is no exception. I liked that it can store the thread in a flatter profile and holds lots of spools. But the hinges are little 6 little hooks that pop out easily. And they did pop out and one broke so easily while I was trying to get it hooked back in.  The only reason it got two stars instead of one, is that it is a better layout than most, I think.	-1
I purchased this mat because it was the perfect size to trim my slacks for hemming and for ironing down the cuffs. And it also fits into my sewing machine carrier which was a definate plus. But the handle curled upwards towards the pressing side and scratched the surface of my iron and melted...what a mess. Also it is not self healing after a few cuts the surface has became rough and unusable. It snagged the fabric and dulled the blade of my cutter. I really wouldn't recommend it because it only lasted through a few cuts.	-1
This item is not like the older version mat which contain more tackiness to adhere paper.  This mat requires more tacky glue to use more than three times otherwise your paper will not stick to the mat.	-1
The mats received are not as pictured. Anyone familiar to Cricut knows the difference between the original mat and the new which has bad reviews for stickiness. I was disappointed not to receive what was pictured as I have been happy with those. Shipping was expensive too.	-1
I recently ordered 2 packages of this item. I have only opened one so far, and am very disappointed. I have used both of the mats in the package. The first full page of cuts worked great. The mat held the paper. By the second piece, the paper kept slipping. After repeated tries, I finally gave up and went to the second mat which was nice and sticky being new. I am now having the paper slip again. I am contacting the company to get them replaced. I asked Amazon if they could have been old stock. They assured me that they were brand new.	-1
When I ordered these mats, I specifically ordered them because they had the green edge, and were not the white edged mats that I have seen lately in some stores.  When I opened the package, I was disappointed to see that the mats were the same white edged ones I had been trying to avoid.  Since I was in a bind, I had to use them anyway, and I am very unhappy with these mats.  There was very little "tackiness" on the mats from the moment I took them out of the package, I could not even get a lightweight piece of scrapbook paper to stick to the mat without shifting around.  My old mat (with the green edge) had been so tacky in the beginning I was able to cut fabric with my cricut without any problem, and this mat will not even hold a piece of paper still.  If provocraft is changing the design of the mats to this, I hope they reconsider.  Like many others, I too have been checking out ways to "re-sticky" the mats, hopefully this will make the mats usable, because as they are right now, they are not.	-1
It sticks fine but whatever you put it on it comes off I cannot explain it. Don't waste your money unless you have a sewing machine to keep this on where you put it on it will just come off.	-1
DI NOT buy this--it is garbage--does NOT stick at all--peeled right off	-1
this was a terrible product.  the stuff wouldn't even come out from the gun and just collected on the fancy glue gun.	-1
Bought this to use with the webcaster. Unable to use it because the material stuck to the house and when I try to remove it, it took the paint off the house	-1

this was a terrible product and waste of money.  the sticks only melt and stick to the tip of the gun.	-1
First of all, mine showed up missing parts... so I ended up having to return it.  The brush was one of the missing pieces, but I tried using one of my brushes  I'm an artist by trade and have tons, so it wasn't a crappy plastic-bristled one so I can't blame it on that.  I tried it out. I was so, so, so, so, unimpressed. It dried SO quickly that I couldn't even finish even the most simple design before the beginning had faded completely. But, if I used any additional water it just dripped like crazy and ran down the board.  There was nothing "therapeutic" about it. I simply hate it.  Just grab an untreated board of wood from a pile of scraps and do the same thing to it. It works exactly the same, but it actually holds the water for a little but longer and costs nothing.	-1
These are too big. They don't even fit in my bigger thread containers. You can see from the pic attached the ones on the right are the paper bobbins and they stick out.	-1
A couple of issues.  The front surface is shiny so if using felt markers they smudge.  I also wish they were stiffer.	-1
was looking so forward to getting this kit. the colors are somewhat different as my monitor showed but that is to be expected. The problem is there was NO blending filament as advertized in this kit. It was one reason that I wanted this kit. As I am handicapped it is difficult to go out just to buy the thread to add to this kit. I hope Janlynn will make this righ.	-1
It's okay but you get what you pay for.	-1
These seem fine for the price except for one thing: No protective cover? I planned to put a blade in the handle and keep this little knife on my crafting table in a can with my scissors and pliers and a couple pens, like my boyfriend does with his Exacto knife, but I can't do that and it's extremely inconvenient.  I feel like selling this product without a cap to go over it (like the Exacto knives have) is like selling a freakin' pen without a cap. Totally ridiculous.	-1
I just didn't like it at all. Not as easy to work with as I had hoped. I should have returned it.	-1
The thread is fine, but the color is nothing like it shows up on my computers.  I checked several besides mine...the colors shone are sofft and airy and the colors I got are not soft at all, and not as close to pastel as the swatch shone here.  I will probably never use it. If I do, it will be as an accent.	-1
Tiger in hiding has way too many small areas and numbers unreadable.  I gave up.	-1
This was not a unicorn paint by number it was a paint by number of fish and I was hoping it was a pain by number of a unicorn so I could give it to my mom but know she don't want it because it is not what we order.	-1
I bought this item to paint as a gift to my friend who is addicted to her cat. I was so exiting to get this set... What a disappointing when i began to realize this paint because: the paint colors don't match the real photo; the quality of the paints is really terrible, they are old... Following the instruction You can't obtain the color You need, I'm doing this by intuition using the paints I bought for the other projects...  Next time I will think twice before to buy paints from Royal Brush	-1
paints don't cover the numbers  Painted 3 times and then gave up threw it out have had simmilar problems with royal paintings before  Iwont have them again	-1
Of late, I have completed several pbn paintings.  Never have I seen such a horrible example of pbn.  The paint is way too thick, the colors are atrocious, and there are areas marked with a number and no paint for that number included.  Thin, probably artificial canvas is much too fragile to be stretched as it was.  All in all, this was a waste of money.  I am keeping it as a reminder to never buy from this vendor again.	-1
the worst!  In every way this product is horrible.  No reflection on the vendor.  I am sure this might work for some people, but I did not like it at all.  Fabric would not stay taught.  The hoop came apart too easily.	-1
These hoops are my sister's favorite, so I ordered them. I don't like them so much. The aida slips and gets loose easy and also I got my floss caught more then once around the silver handles. It was very frustrating. Lesson learned. I guess I am sending these to her. Happy birthday sis	-1
This product is advertised as a tension hoop, and instead what you get in the mail is a pack of wood beads. really. Told amazon about it, but buy with caution--this product page may be a tear in the fabric of time-space, and you may not get what you see...	-1
I bought this "kit" for my 8 year old daughter thinking it would be great to do together.  I used to do these when I was her age and loved them.  This is not what I would consider a kit.  It does not include the latch hook tool nor does the canvas have a pattern on it.  The canvas itself is super rough and impossible to lay flat making this the most disappointing buy of the year.  Absolute waste of money.	-1
Way to hard for any child under the age of 10.	-1

I wanted to give my daughter a latch kit like I use to play with as a child.  This set has a cute picture, but it is not printed on the mesh.  Instead they printed a grid on the mesh and provide a chart like you'd use in cross stitch.  My nine year old could easily follow it, but I think it would have been more fun for her if the image was printed.  Also, the yarn quality is very cheep and scratchy.  It does not resemble the soft plush kits I remember from childhood.  I think if it had a better tactile feel, my daughter would have enjoyed the kit more and we would have ended up purchasing more sets.  If this is the quality, than it really isn't worth the money or time.  Also, as noted in the description, it does not come with a hook so I purchased that separately.	-1

Same Review as with the previous orders. This appeared to be a pattern for a kitty cat pillow. It was not. All it has is the yarn and a picture of a kitty cat. This was not what I wanted and it wasn't what I thought I was ordering. This is major disappointing as I was going to make it for a Christmas present. Won't ever be purchasing anything like this again. Totally bummed !!	-1
Most confusing. Product description and some reviews say the picture is printed on the canvas. IT IS NOT PRINTED ON THE CANVAS. It is a graph whick is not waht the person i purchased it for can do. Very disappointing.	-1
Doesn't work for me.	-1
Was a gift. I already responded.	-1
The product description is wrong. The canvas is NOT color coded.	-1

PATTERN NOT ON MESH GRID.  NOT KID FRIENDLY	-1
The image of the cupcake is NOT on the hatch hook grid.  Major thumbs down	-1
Too difficult for a child of 8.  Purchased for a gift and since it said "Latch Hook Kit" there would be a hook.  You have to purchase that separately!  Also, there is NO guide or template on the canvas grid.  It is too difficult and frustrating for a younger child.  I will have to mark it out in colored marker for the 8 year old child to start/finish.  Very disappointed in this kit and will not purchase this brand again.  A 14 year old said it looked too difficult/time consuming to do without a template to follow.	-1
pretty color and would have been perfect IF it measured the 6" as described...measures 5.5" exactly & will not work for my application...	-1
Use a regular table knife instead.	-1
As with the other Wonderart Latch Hook Kit, this one was disappointing.  There are supposed to be 40 rows across.  As I'm working the rug, I noticed my count of colors was off.  I counted, recounted, took out the yarn & started over.  The actual rug is only 39 rows.  If I had not caught the difference, I would have run out of yarn near the end.  I don't feel Wonderart is very good with their products (counting difficulties).  I probably would not purchase any more products from them	-1
If you want something that sheds all of the place as soon as the package opens, then this is for you. It was extremely thin and so poorly made, I was embarrassed for having opened it at a friend's house because the feathers just fell everywhere. Do not buy. You are better off going to the dollar store.	-1
A shedding machine if you can call it that.	-1
Did not like this at all	-1
No pattern on the canvas! That should be stated in the description!	-1

I bought it to make my daughter's birthday tutu.  I think I got a bad batch because my roll of tulle was super still, and it wasn't an entire full roll because it was cut off in several places.	-1
Disappointed.  The picture isn't printed on the canvas even though it is sold as "beginner/intermediate."  Of course, after it arrived, I came back to Amazon and read the reviews.  Lesson learned - read reviews BEFORE ordering.  I wanted a few of these kits for my middle children (7, 10, 12) to work on while we do our daily read-alouds.  But without the picture printed on the canvas, I think it would be just too frustrating.  (My 12 year old is developmentally delayed)  So I returned it.	-1

Bought this for my 9 year old grandson. Returned it as it was way to complex. They did not imprint the figure on the mat	-1
Bought this for my 9 year old thought it had the picture on the rug and you just had to follow the colors like they use to make them when I was younger but no the rug was too complex for her to get	-1
It wasn't what I thought, as a kid I had one of these but the picture was on the rug all you had to do was follow the colors thats why I bought this for my 7 year old but I guess they don't come like that anymore.	-1
No latch hook in this "kit" and the weaving canvass is blank.  Not good for children.	-1
Be aware there is no latch  hook in this "kit" and the weaving canvass is blank.  Not good for children under 10	-1
Be aware no hook included and the pattern is not printed on the wearing canvas so not the best item for children under 10	-1
received it when promised but the kit not including the tool needed to work it and having to buy it separate was not to my liking. Trying to teach my daughter how to do this and now having to wait longer for another piece to come in, it is called a kit it should have came with the tool.	-1
Do not buy this if you're going to use it to cross stitch. The fibers separate because they're so thin and weak. This thread will snag ALL. THE. TIME. Seriously, avoid this item if you intend to use it for cross stitch since you will have to spend a ton of time rethreading your needle and/or doing work over again.	-1
I bought the Gemstones one and it is pretty as can be but it is worthless.  I used it on thin broadcloth and the first pass through the fabric the shiny, pretty part was stripped off and I was left with red thread.	-1
It didn't come with the hook so we wherent able to make it yet.	-1
I was surprisingly disappointed with this purchase.  I typically love Sakura products, but these arrived with several half dried out.	-1
Received instructions for the butterfly, I guess I'm on my own with this one, very disappointed	-1
Runs out of ink if your stroke is longer than two inches. Was hoping for more of a steady flow.	-1
Would not bond any of the fabric I used whatsoever. Tried with synthetics and cotton, no dice. It seems others had luck but following the instructions as is, did nothing for me. Maybe holding them even longer but I was afraid of the material burning.	-1
When I wrote my first recommendation shortly after I purchased this frame, I gave it 4 stars.  Now that I have used the frame all summer for a large cross stitch picture, I am not satisfied with the  way the frame is put together.  The screws tightened up so much after a few weeks that I was unable to turn them at all without a pair of pliers.  I am still using the frame because I want to finish my project, but I am sure I won't use it again afterwards.	-1
Very disappointed. It arrived late had to email the company twice in order to find out where it was. The holes that are drilled in did not line up at all. The tips of my rods got bent due to the poor construction of this frame. I love the idea of it and it does work great after you fix all the flaws from the manufacture. I could have sent it back, I know. However, who's knows how long it would have took to get another sent out.	-1
Waste of money...it doesn't stick AT ALL...had to purchase the web & that sticks...	-1
won't work.....	-1
Some colors shows no difference, but the paper shows difference. It ended up looking off than the picture. Unlike..... big time	-1
Does not work at all.  Fabric never sticks, so it comes apart immediately.	-1
Followed directions, didn't work.  Tried suggestions from others across the web, didn't work.  Didn't stick to vinyl, polyester, or nylon.  Started with heat per instructions, then normal heat, and eventually worked up the heat until the iron was so hot it was starting to melt the things I was trying to stick together.  At no point did this material adhere to anything except itself and the iron.  I see others gave it 5 stars, so it has to work for someone.  If it's possible for this material to age, then I guess that's what happened.  From my perspective, needle and thread would have been significantly easier - without wondering if it would work.	-1
This kit did not come with any embroidery thread.  I have embroidered for MANY YEARS and this was the first time I came across this.  In the small print it is stated thread not included.  How many people would run out to find a store selling threat, not to easy these days!  As far as I am concerned this was a cheap kit never should be sold without thread, very thoughtless and stupid. Sincerely Mas	-1
does not stay on	-1
Runs Out of Ink too fast	-1
VERY DISAPPOINTED FOR THE BRUSH TIP QUALITY. TIP IS WAY TOO STIFF, DOES NOT WRITE FLEXIBLY AT ALL. I WISH I COULD RETURN IT BUT RETURNING IS A HASSLE SO I WILL KEEP IT BUT I AM SURE THAT I WILL NOT USE IT.	-1
The holes are too large and round. I'd hoped to use this for cross-stitch, but unlike 14-count vinyl weave/vinyl Aida, it doesn't look nice because of the hole shape and size.	-1
Paid too much for colors that are so dark they look black, i.e., purple, blue. I wanted BRIGHT, instead I got dull.	-1
It stinks! Waste of $$! Does not cut paper straws and "kit" does not tell you if straws are wax (not appropriate for bird toys) or paper. Bought paper straws and this piece of crap can't cut them!!!	-1
I bought one of these at Hobby Lobby. It's crap. The construction of the nib is dumb. It's a solid, only slightly flexible core, surrounded by a soft foam in the shape of the brush. I thought I would be able to get very fine lines, and very the line width easily, but I couldn't. if you apply too much pressure the inner core will cause the outer foam to get damaged. It started to fray, and I would have like a secondary parallel line. It's like the quality of a crayola marker. The outer foam is so soft, that it's difficult to control. I could get a finer, more predictable line with a Prismacolor brush marker for around the same price, and it's way bigger, but that one is a kind of rubbery foam throughout. I couldn't believe for the price, how crappy this was. Normally, I really like Sakura pens, especially the .005 and the .1, but I was not happy at all with this.	-1
Colors are not good except for red.	-1
Decided to try this after reading the rave reviews, but it just didn't work well for me.  It doesn't cut smoothly, so it's easy to cut yourself on one of the fine wires sticking out.  And it's pricier than Acuflex.	-1
Crap .. my necklaces and bracelets keep wearing and breaking. Not strong. Waste of money. Very disappointed. And VERY bad for business.	-1
my brother se400 didn't like this. it gummed up my needle, shifted my design and causing threads to gather underneath my fabric. I find that a heavier stabilizer ( a felt like that came w my machine) worked great and had absolutely no issue.	-1
Not  really  HEAVY duty	-1
Nothing wrong the product, but the description was false when I purchased it, it said and I quote "Euro-Notions Embroidery Machine Needles, Size 11/75, 5-Pack"  I only received one pack.	-1
these work well on a basic machine like a PE-400-700 BUT!!??  on a high quality mach like a dream 8550d  do not use these. The  eyelet hole is to big and the thread cuts itself -shreds and gets caught in the take up spring . then you have some serious problems. lots of broken needles . with that said they do a good job on a lesser machine?  use the emb 75-11  for best results.	-1
they were the needles for my machine but they broke so easy, that  this pack of 5 didn't even last thru 2 projects.  the same needles bought locally at JoAnn's last 10x as long.	-1
I bought this to color in some shapes on a 22"x22" bandana - it ran out of ink before I was half way finished.  Very disappointed.	-1
Whether this item is useful or useless depends on the person.  I can see where someone might find a gadget interesting or helpful, but I found this particular item to be a bit unstable and unwieldy.  I attached it to my bobbin box and tried to wind.  It took a few tries to find a rhythm and all the while trying not to pull up so that the winder would stay attached to the box.  I found it much easier to just wind each bobbin using my hand and tossed the winder aside.  I see no circumstances in which the convenience of this winder would replace the efficiency of doing the winding with my fingers.	-1
Too hard to use.	-1
I think this is the most useless thing I've ever bought on Amazon. I couldn't even use it, it's so flimsy. Just wind them  by hand, it'll take you way less time and effort, trust me!	-1
Did not like it. I don't use it. It doesn't work for me and seems to be made cheap. I don't like to give bad reviews, however; I must be honest. Nothing against the shipping or shipper it was shipped good. For me it was a waste of money.	-1
Takes s home adjusting to using.	-1
The box arrived open and taped , not recommended	-1
The bobbin winder was not what I  expected. I was thinking it would be made of stronger material. It is made of a flimsy plastic. Ibhsve to mount it on the inside of my floss box not the outside causing my hands to hit the box while winding the floss. I would like to have better control of where I can put the winder.	-1
It is difficult to use from bobbin to bobbin, I really don't know the purpose, If you need to use a different color the you must find place to put the thread if you don't have another free bobbin, I have wasted a lot of thread....	-1
When you clip it on a the container to wind, it looses its balance.  I don't use it, as it's easier and quicker to do by hand.	-1
I see why this was an 'add on' item... it's garbage!  No matter what I clipped it on it would fall over and wobble as I tried to wind the floss onto the bobbin.  I can hand wind a bobbin much faster than using this.	-1
What a waste of time and money!  Doesn't stay secure so need to use two hands.  Faster to wind bobbins by hand!	-1
This mallet is NOT as described. It is 6 inches long and not well constructed. The mallet ends weren't on all the way when I received mine. I was able to work with them to get them to stay on. Wouldn't recommend.	-1
This ribbon holder is really inadequate. The slots to hold the spools of ribbon don't  even fit the smaller ribbon spools! pretty dumb design! only fits half as many as its supposed to! but I'm keeping it and just storing some ribbon spools in it! Not worth the money, but will use it and try another type ..maybe ask my husband to make me a ribbon spool holder!	-1
These will only hold 3" - 3 1/4" diameter ribbon spools. 4" will not fit. These simply do not stack well. Unfortunately my storage/craft area requires stacking.	-1
Way too small. Really flimsy. Not even worth returning, so I will find a way to repurpose this somehow.	-1
not sure how it got cracked it was packed with ribbon but its cracked in 2 places one of the places the cardboard is also ripped not too happy its broken was going to give this as a gift next weekend	-1
I'm not sure why Beadalon is not listening to their customers but let me say it again, I want to buy a qty of 600 2mm silver crimp tubes, I don't need or want every size you make. It makes us buy a product from someone else because you don't offer what your customers are telling you that we want. Please make packs of one size so we don't have to buy elsewhere.	-1
I purchased this intending to use this as soon as it arrived for my next project. Description should have included the fact that it was only HALF of what was needed for using this system.  One package is to attach to the scroll rods, another package for the fabric. However if you read the description it says " molded hook side for fabric" and later in the description says "sticky back loop tape attaches to fabric".  I wasted money on this as it still sits in the package.	-1
Did not work. My t shirts stuck to this mat. I'm sending it back	-1
it shows being clear, but it is hard to see through, returned item	-1
NOT FILL MY EXPECTATIONS BECAUSE IS LITTLE FOR MY FINGERS.  I DO NOT SHARE IT WITH OTHERS BECAUSE MY PROBLEM  BUT I THINK TO OTHERS IS A GOOD TOOL	-1
This has jammed and smudged in every inkjet printer I tried it in. I tried it in a Canon Pixmo Pro 100, a Canon Pixmo Pro 9000, and in an Epson 1430, all results the same.	-1
