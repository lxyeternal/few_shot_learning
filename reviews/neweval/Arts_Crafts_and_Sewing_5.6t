I used this to make circles for bingo cards I made and they were the perfect size. I looked a long time for 1/2 inch and was glad to finally find this...still wish I could find it in a die cut so I can cut more at a time.	1
I use these in my crafts. They are of good quality and the styrofoam does not flake off when using.	1
These are perfect cut in half for tea-cup arrangements. Dry foam works best with dried flowers I found out. They are a little softer than regular styrofoam and the adhesive clay does not stick as well on this surface. I wish I could have found the regular styrofoam for silk flowers. We did make them work and the arrangements turned out beautiful.	1
I use them for my artificial plants on my porch. I've had them outside for a while now, and they are working great. I've had compliments on the planters & have been asked what I used to anchor the flowers.	1
Perfect!	1
I cut them in half for taller flowers in my vase	1
This punch works well for a lever punch, but I much prefer the slim style by EK Success nesting circle punches, and so while I still have and use this as a backup, my go to punch is the slim version.  Still, the prices on these are coming down and they do get the job done.  Recommend.	1
Well, I have a theory why the handle is yellow. Because these cut through hardened memory wire steel like butter! Seriously, my first pair of memory wire cutters cost twice as much and didn't work as well as these do. This just cuts the memory wire so easily and nicely. I'm over the moon happy. They were so much better than expected, and so affordable that I can buy a couple backups to share with my daughter.  I've also used them on the 16 gauge aluminum wire I use for armatures in some of my projects, and that my son uses for sculpture. I expected to see a pinch cut, but instead it sheared a slight angle. It went through the wire very easily and well too.  For thicker wires, I recommend buying a pair of bolt cutters.	1
Works nice. It seems like a nice tool for the price!	1
Too wide for my hand.	-1
Great item,it cuts very close on those pesky edges. Very sturdy tool.	1
After ruining several cutters trying to work with memory wire, I finally found this. It really cuts like I hoped it would. After writing the review, the cutter has not worked, only bends the wire instead of cutting.  I bought a piano wire cutter which works better.	-1
These cutters work wonderful when cutting memory wire . When i tried cutting with regular cutters it killed my hand but with this Parrot Beak Wire Cutter it cut with very little effort . Great product and I highly recommend .	1
Honestly, I only used it once and it worked as stated.  When/if I use it more often, I will add additional comments but so far I like it.	1
Maybe this is meant to be used immediately after adhesive is applied to the wrong area but I've not found it to be particularly effective.  I use it to remove chalk instead.	-1
This is great! I purchased it after seeing a demo on utube. I was hesitant because my artgum eraser seemed to do the job of removing unwanted adhesive. However, the EK Success Adhesive Remover is better and definitely leaves less mess. I'm glad I got it.	1
Great product... works well removing adhesives without disturbing your paper or project and the product itself does not break down or disintegrate.  The point it good for getting into small areas.  If you are a "must have it unique item crafter" this is one for your arsenal.  Enjoy	1
I ordered this item after reading the reviews but remained skeptical that anything could eliminate glue remnants or goof-ups.  Well, to my surprise this little piece of magic really works!  If you use glue on paper this is a must for the toolbox!  Get one, you won't be disappointed.	1
These blades are very sharp and seem to last quite a long time, but still I like to have spares on hand for when I need them.  I found the price here more favorable than the local fabric store.  I like the plastic case that keeps them safe.  Changing them out in the handle is easy.	1
I love my 28MM olfa rotary cutter, and I love the idea of having a 10 refill so I do not have to go to the store as often to get blades	1
Great blades.  Last well.  Sharp.  Round.  What else can I say.  Smooth, pretty.  Fit my cutter perfectly! Love the yellow case too!	1
is an excellent tool	1
sharp, as expected	1
A chain store I shop regularly no longer carries these.  I prefer these when quilting and using minimal fabric size and thickness.  So glad I could purchase them online.	1
A	1
So much cheaper than buying in a local shop.  They come slightly oiled which makes them last longer.  They are stacked so be a little wary in handling them.  I use a tweezer.	1
Great price	1
They seem to stay sharp for a long time	1
Love the storage container!	1
works great for cutting fabric.	1
Nice and Sharp.  Quick to ship.  Will do business with again.	1
Great price for Olfa blades.  I haven't used this pack of blades yet but expect them to perform as well as all Olfa refills.	1
just what i needed	1
Good sharp blades. Well packaged.	1
Didn't want to fit with my Fiskar rotary cutter.  I got it to fit, but the shield now only goes behind the blade so I don't know if that is going to work for me.	1
great deal	1
Nice blades, very sharp.  Darrell	1
I was really nervous buying this after seeing all the mixed reviews, but bought it anyway, cause there where no other cheap options. Really pleasantly surprised!! Used it to cut up big rectangle styrafoam boards into small squares. Only complaint is that I wish the wire would be longer allowing me to cut bigger pieces and thicher styrofoam.	1
super great quality, price	1
I prefer this size rotary cutter and want extra blades on hand, so they are sharp.	1
Easy to use- I was able to switch out my craft cutter blade easily. It really helps with fabric cutting if you use a new blade!	1
These blades are extremely sharp and long lasting.  I use 2 sizes, the 45mm and the 28mm.	1
Like the blades. good price	1
great price	1
THANKS SO MUCH WILL ORDER AGAIN	1
Just what I needed.  I have no drawing abilities and trying to paint on wine bottles looked like a kid had drawn on them.  This stencil is nice and makes my work look so much better	1
These little stencils are wonderful and compact.  I use them to trace designs or stencil the pattern on cards and such.  They are well made, they clean up easily and they hold up well.	1
This stencil is a sturdy product, and it works exactly as promised. I would have no problem recommending this product.	1
great price, good to go! Order more and get add-on pricing on applicable items!	1
Convenient packaging and works great.	1
For crafting or quilting these blades are exceptional. I would buy them again.	1
Olfa blades are great and really hold their edge.  I bought the 10 pack refill because I use the 28mm cutter so much, especially when I am making shorter cuts.	1
Like the flexibility of the cordless cutter.	1
Great product nice quality.  Shipping was on time and packaging was perfect.  I will be back again to shop.  Thank you, Jo	1
I love this thread! It is just what I needed to do hand embroidery on my crazy quilt. I am going to order the gold color now.	1
strong, very small spool. Probably because it is so fine the spool doesn't need to be bigger.	1
good value	1
what a great buy this was!  Thank you to seller for quick delivery.	1
I've used OLFA blades for several years.  I bought another brand a few times but OLFA stays sharp longer than anything else I've used.	1
Great price for a good quality blade.	1
Great quality rotary cutting blade, especially for curves.	1
stencil is nice quality	1
As described  No issues	1
received this item and I'm very happy with it.	1
The stencil IS the size mentioned but the picture is a lot smaller on it than I expected. I may still be able to use it but not for what I'd planned. Appears well made.	-1
Love it	1
this is a cutie thing, even its very small i still love it	1
Work perfect in both my Olfa and Fiskars. OH, and they cut verrrrry well (just ask my finger!).	1
I always reorder these as I have found that they work well.	1
Great product.	1
OMG, cutting with a 28mm blade is game changer.  I really like the control, especially when you are doing small trimmings in paper piecing.  Plus the blades are ONE HALF the cost of the 45mm.  I paid approx. $11 for 10 Olfa 28mm, compared to approx. $24 for 10 Olfa 45mm.  Even the cutter works easier.  Get this size cutter to add to your collection.	1
Great price and blades!	1
good deal	1
Where was this 25 years ago!? I have been using knives, saw, anything to cut Styrofoam and wasted just as much as I needed! This is an awesome tool. Cuts the styrofoam like butter and so much faster!	1
I will Like this when I use it	1
After many other tries I finally have the size stencil I was looking for for months.  This is perfect and will last a long time.	1
Didn't pay attention to the size, assumed larger but the stencil itself is sturdy.  Will place other orders!	1
Great price for blades	1
not good quality blades	1
Just what she wanted	1
Great blade for thinner fabric and smaller pieces.	1
Every one in the pack were knicked and dull. Will not buy again. Very disappointed. If I would give it 0 stars I would.	-1
Perfect.	1
They were exactly what I was looking for.  Very good service.	1
Very Good	1
substantial and easy to use. I really like it.	1
This product is exactly as it was described & came in a very timely manner.  I can't wait to use it!	1
Love it ..Thank You	1
WONDERFUL  VERY HAPPY WITH THIS AND SHIPPING WAS GREAT	1
These blades are not as sharp as the Martelli blades, but they are good.	1
great use these all the time.	1
Exactly as described.	1
Not much to say, they are the good blades I use all the time! I love the 10pack. so they are always on hand	1
These are so good I need to reorder again	1
Great buy for the item	1
great purchase and received in a timely manner before due.	1
Good	1
Yes, the Stencil was perfect. Thank You!  Jeannette	1
This is a perfect embossing stencil	1
a little smaller than I though	1
it works very well. The key to stencils......use just a little paint, and dab dab dab.....fill in better with small brush once you remove the stencil.	1
Quality product	1
Very nice. Love it. Would definitely buy again. Recommend it to others. Very study and good quality. I can use it on almost anything.	1
BTW, these are OLFA blades, states as such on the package in English	1
Based on 20 years of using new blades from the store, I swear these blades are old blades that have been re-sharpened. They don't cut as crisp as new blades in the package from the store and they wear out MUCH more quickly. These are perfect for paper cutting or if you know you're going to be cutting just a little bit of fabric. But I had 60 yards of cotton to cut for charity quilts and it aggravated me, having to change the blades more often than before.	-1
Awesome price!	1
Razor sharp blades. Great quality. Very happy with the product. The blades stay sharp longer than i expected.	1
Very good	1
These were right size. Very sharp.	1
Use these all the time.  They hold up pretty well.	1
Beautiful and easy to work with. I use it for wrap bracelets. Going to see if they have multiple colors. Great buy!	1
I had been looking around at the local craft stores for some of this leather cord and there were very limited colors and quantity.  I ordered several different colors in different sizes after looking at the sample color charts on the website.  I am very happy with what I received.  The quality is very good and I thought the pricing was very reasonable.  I would not hesitate to buy from this vendor again.	1
Looks great on the necklaces I make	1
Good deal on large quantity. Had glue residue on a lot of it.	1
I purchased this for my jewelry business and I love it. It's great quality and at a good price. I will be buying this item again.	1
I am using this leather to bind together wood covered books. It works really well. It does have some breaks in it but I expect that of leather.	1
LOVE THIS ITEM MAKE GREAT NECKLACES AND USED IT  TO TIE TOGETHER MY SCRAPBOOK I MADE FOR A GIFT FOR HUBBY	1
This is a great deal for leather cord to buy in bulk.  Shipped as promised.  Great seller.  Nice cord, works well for jewelry making.	1
This is very well made, smooth leather cord. No flaws or imperfections. What else can I say, it's leather cord!	1
Appreciated the performance of this product, easy to work with, and it added to the project of making bracelets.  Thank you for prompt delivery.	1
Defective and could not be used.....already cut and had kinks that could be be straightened out.	-1
Love this for bracelets	1
Exactly what I wanted.	1
Awesome company to work with	1
I like to buy in bulk and I thought the price of the memory wire was appropriate. The wire looks nice when you have beads on it for a necklace and place it around the neck and it keeps its shape.	1
This is SUCH BEAUTIFUL memory wire!  I was used to seeing the old, rather ugly, stainless steel memory wire.  Now I am SPOILED!  This is gorgeous just by itself, actually, but it is really fun to space some beads on it so some of the gorgeous wire shows through.  It holds its shape, is a gorgeous color, and the silver plating makes my jewelry look expensive!  I highly recommend it.	1
Having bought several small pkgs at local craft stores I caved and bought this.  I'm happy with the quality seems on par with past purchases of leather lace ( though my use wears them all out ) I am happy to have so much	1
I bought this to replace lace on a small, great leather pouch. Made it long enough for a cross-over bag, this time. Great!	1
This Round leather is very strong you can't brake it by pulling on it, Works well for any project you want good strong material for	1
I am so happy to find this. It replaces cording I bought at Michaels that was going to be the END OF ME. It was spliced together and you couldn't tell until you wore the necklace for a few weeks and then it would simple come apart! Being new to this, I worried that ALL cording was like this. so I'm very happy to report that I'm on 3 months with no issues.	1
I use a lot of glue (I'm a mixed media artist), including glue sticks. I want one that's permanent and acid-free. Pioneer is both of these, but what really sold me is the square shape. I find it easier to cover surfaces with the flat square shape.  If you use glue sticks, I recommend this one.	1
Just as advertised (and it didn't dry up in the desert air over a year of unuse!)	1
Great for signing artwork.	1
This is the perfect gold for my greeting card art work.  A very fine point and easy flow. I love this	1
works perfectly for signing photographs.  Smooth, clean lines.  Color goes on perfectly	1
Even though I carefully capped it it only worked the first time I used it. Very dissapointing	-1
I couldn't find the larger rings at the local craft shops, so finding them on line worked great for me.  The rings are just right!	1
I couldn't find the larger rings at the local craft shops, so finding them on line worked great for me.  The rings are just right!	1
It took 15 minutes of trying to get the paint to flow but Once put away, I could never get it to work properly again.  On my third attempt the tip came out of the pen and spilled paint all over.  I had high hopes for this project, as I do a lot of very fine gold work on paper and this looked like the perfect solution.  Unfortunately, it was a colossial waste of money.	-1
Lovely paint pen color and like I stated previously buyers need to make sure they clean tip off after each use to prevent clogging and tip from drying out.	1
- Exactly what I needed - flat, evenly round, strong, cleanly-soldered.  - I do wish it was "silver" ((stainless steel)) but this one is as close to perfect as I could find.	1
This is a stocking stuffer for my husband who has just gone back to school in Electrical Engineering. These templates are wonderful for the basic elements he must show in his technical drawings.	1
The ring was welded at the seam. It was a gold color. I spray painted it and used it to make a dream catcher. It's light weight. Inexpensive in comparison to craft store prices.	1
ordered for my Aunt, they were exactly what she wanted...	1
Worked for what I needed, and cheaper than the local craft store. Perfect!	1
Sturdy hoop and a way better price on amazon than I could find locally.	1
These templates are very sturdy and come in their own case. I am very happy with this product.	1
This is a nice, solid brass ring that can be used for all sorts of crafting purposes!	1
I've bought numerous of these in different sizes. I use them to make wire wrapped Suncatchers. I wish they came in different colors, but I just wrap colored wire around them, so not a major issue. They arrive quickly.	1
I purchased this to make mobiles for my company Christmas party. The rings are sturdy and great quility. I can't wait to see how my mobiles will turn out	1
Used to make unique diaper cakes and diaper displays. Work perfectly!	1
Exactly as described	1
This little puncher has been great to me. It punches with ease, and never sticks or jams, and the edges are always clean and smooth. I purchased another puncher by Marvy also here on Amazon, and it sticks in one spot and gives me frayed edges and a terrible time, making me appreciate this one so much more. I guess I'm going to have to spend the extra $ and get another big punch in this brand as well.  Recommended.	1
Thanks to this seller for providing the product # and the actual punch size!  EK success has awesome quality punches, nice clean cuts and never jam up.  I like the way the black and chrome case looks too. (silly, I know).  Even though I have the electronic machine, I still use these manual punches 100 times more often than the machine.  I like the hand punches because you can choose exactly which part of the image you want to cut out.  Just quicker, and so much more control.  I need precision for most of my projects.  Anyway, I'm not going to ramble on too much because I've already rated 2 other ek success punches and gushed over the quality of the Paper Shaper punches.  (See my other reviews, if you really care to know that much more about a craft punch!)  Who would have thought I could have so much to say about a simple square or circle punch?!  Lastly, I will repeat this part:  This brand is often called EK Success, EK Nesting Punches, EK Paper Shapers, or EK Whale of a Punch.  As far as I can tell, they all look and work the same.  I always choose the EK brand, if I have a choice.  Even if it's more expensive, it's worth it.  (But I'm not sure it is more expensive).	1
I REALLY Like it when the seller includes the actual DIMENSIONS of the punch they are selling!  I'm amazed how many punch listings don't give these details!  I mean, geeze, take a piece of scrap paper, punch out a circle and measure it for us please!  Is it just me, or is this exasperating?  Mega, Giga, Medium?  What the heck.  That means nothing to me and I really shouldn't have to do that much research to make the purchase of a circle punch.  So whatever seller I bought this punch from, thank you for providing the useful details I needed to make my decision.  Okay ... end of rant.  Anyway, I do love these punches from EK Success.  They are the best punches out there, if you ask me.  They make nice sharp cuts and never jam up.  Some of the other brands are so difficult to squeeze that it's impossible to flip it over to see which part of the paper is being framed.  Those McGill punches are the absolute worst.  The only way to depress even a small McGill punch is to get leverage on a tabletop and use both hands to get it to cut through. Awful.  Fiskars and Marvy Uchida are okay.  But not nearly as finely tuned as the EK Success Punches.  They have a nice sturdy weight to them, the lever works like it should, the sizes are true.  And they don't look like a toy on your desk!  This 1 1/8 size is great.  It's amazing how often a 1" is too small, and 1 1/4 is just way too big.  It seems kinda crazy to have this many circle punches, but I truly use them almost daily!  (And I'm not even a scrapbooker!)  I think 1.125 is the measurement for a 1 1/8 circle.  Just in case you are trying to compare apples to apples.  Also, I thought I'd mention that these ek punches seem to go by several different names:  ek success nesting punches, ek paper shapers, ek whale of a punch.  As far as I can tell, they all are the same product and seem to work with eachother and look good together.  There is also one of those rubber stamp companies that carries this line of punches with their own exclusive designs. They are equally as nice.  I think these punches are really wonderful quality and would always choose this brand if I have the option.	1
works well for my projects with felt	1
Great product.	1
If people will read and follow instructions this product works great. I use the, one,one thousand,method, to count my seconds when ironing.	1
Satisfied. Good price compared to local craft store.	1
Great projects will be made.	1
Great item as expected.	1
Heat n' Bond, I can never have enough.  Love it.	1
Excellent item with lightning fast delivery!	1
This was the hit of the presents that I gave my sister for her wedding! She cannot wait to fill it up!! The price was great, and the packaging was great! Thanks!!!	1
Our local scrapbooking store only carried this scrapbook in baby blue and I wanted different colors for my other 2 children.  These scrapbooks are amazingly made and very beautiful.	1
Great stuff	1
Not as stiff as some fusible. I like it a lot	1
Love this stuff. I use it to make iron-on patches. The roll is a little inconvenient though, I usually just buy the sheets which are a lot easier to store and cut. Product works fine though.	1
Great product!	1
Nice product.	1
Thank you	1
Love these for school pictures	1
Very elegant. I'm glad I found it after spending so much time browsing for an album that was not dotted with flowers and girly nonsense. I needed it for my son's communion pictures and I'm happy to say it is great for thus purpose.	1
I was so glad to still be able to get this album. I got my first one for my first grandchild 7 years ago and have added two more in other colors for the next two. I love that this has rings that open to add pages instead of posts.	1
Used this for a craft making onesie station at my friend's baby shower.  We created iron on fabric pieces and it was a hit.  I was wondering if this would be enough and I can assure you it is more than enough for several baby shower events.  Glad I didn't purchase more than one roll.  I will say that it works for crafts but if you are expecting the fabric to stay on long term with this then you will have to stitch around it.  The iron on fabric does not last beyond one wash.	1
I love this album! It's a great size and good quality. You can fit a lot in it and the color is gorgeous.	1
Gave as gift.  Looks nice.	1
Excellent product	1
works really good	1
Thermoweb is great for applying appliqu&eacute;s before sewing around the edge.  It securely adheres to all types of materials.	1
I am happy with this product	1
This stuff works great! Very happy with it, really securely bonds my felt pieces together when heated correctly.	1
These are the best scrapbooks ever.  I've bought at least twelve if not more and am going to order more of them. I'm 76 and have saved everything through the years.  Now I've gone through boxes of birthday cards, Mother's Day cards, letters from Christmas cards, birthday party invitations from the grandchildren, etc., and sorted them out by which child they are from and then organized them in these scrapbooks and given the books back to the children, who appreciate having all of this again. Then I undertook an oral history project and used these scrapbooks to place historic photos, articles gleaned from newspapers.com, etc., starting from 1900. I made 3 duplicate scrapbooks for each set of years researched. Presently I am using six of these scrapbooks for photos and misc. literature that my daughter has from a three week European vacation this fall. Love how the top comes down and ties and makes it into a box. They stack really well that way. Can't say enough good things about these.  Highly, highly recommended.	1
Beautiful book very sturdy, only complaintis that I wish the pages were reinforced where the holes are.	1
Love it.  Excellent product and will buy more.	1
Love making my own iron things...Tshirts, photos for fabric printing and ironing on tees.	1
I love this stuff. Last Christmas i made all my own holiday pillows and this made the job so much easier. Pretty easy to use and the appliqu&eacute;s i did have held up really well.	1
Works fine for applique.	1
Beautiful album. Well made.	1
So beautiful. Ordered a second one.	1
These are my favorite scrapbooks!!!  This is my 5th one, I am scrapbooking for my first granddaughter from birth on. They hold a lot and are nice to look at. I will keep buying these as long as they are available.	1
Product as advertised. Fast shipping.	1
So awesome! I actually used this to stiffen my finished cross stitch work before I sewed it into my first pillow. Stiffens it enough to keep a solid flatness but flexible enough to work with! Very happy with this!! And it can be used for a multitude of things!!	1
Using with fabrc for scan and cut machne.	1
Just found this amazing product and it is the answer to my dreams for bonding two fabrics together before cutting on a Sizzix Big Shot manual cutter.	1
Thank you, just as described.	1
works great!	1
5 stars.	1
Works perfectly. No complaints!	1
I like it	1
I use these books to put momentos in of my girls birthdays each year. love that the pages are basically in a box so that I can make the pages bulky and they still fit.	1
Great product. Wife does a lot of scrap booking and has about a five of these ones. Over the years they have held up great.	1
I got mine for my senior memory book! I love it!	1
Love-It	1
Just what I wanted!	1
Good quality. Perfect for a 'Confirmation' scrapbook.	1
Love! Ordered two, going to buy another I fit my six standard scrapbooks into two of these babies and they're pretty darn good looking, they're three ring binders and come with full page scrapbook sleeves and white paper  Update ordered a third! Bought the Amazon warehouse deal and it said it had 'damage' (small) but I was pleased to find it was in perfect condition.	1
I was surprised by how nice this binder is for the price. It has a very nice finish and feels very solid and sturdy. It's quite satisfying when you have it filled because it feels substantial.  One minor complaint is that the picture window in the front could be bigger. The rings in the binder worked flawlessly and I've been opening and closing them frequently. They come with plastic page protectors and I found them to be of good quality as well.	1
VERY VERY Strong!	1
I love this! I would buy it again. Has great storage capacity and i love that it ties to close. Large size and very professional looking it.	1
Have been purchasing this heat bond for some time now. It has worked with all my material crafts excellently. This has also been the best price per roll that I have found in my area.	1
all good	1
works alright...not sure of how long it will last	1
I've used this to repair a few of my sons school pants instead of throwing the pants away and these have held up through wear and tear. I haven't washed the few pants I have repaired just yet so Im not so sure how this holds up after being washed I will update my review. this is also perfect if you want to add patches to things.	1
great product	1
Love it	1
brought as a gift for my daughter and I weekend get away	1
Perfect	1
Good product.  Great price! Will buy again.	1
Ideal size of purchasing interfacing and reliable product.	1
Great price for this product.  It works for all my applique projects (and some other sewing as well).	1
Beautiful album..Once all the pages are filled, though, you really can't add more pages.  Which is no problem because there are lots of pages.  Perfect for a gift..	1
So nice and elegant	1
its okay	1
I have now ordered this twice and almost ready to order again. It has worked great.	1
Bought this on amazon because they were sold out in Joann. Great product.	1
These are wonderful albums.  Very high quality.	1
Worked on a curtain!!	1
This is a great product for appliqu&eacute;s, adhering fabrics, adding strength or stiffness. It is NOT for use when you will be sewing the fabric. It can gum up your needle and your machine. You need the purple package for use when sewing. This particular product has a strong hold. I love that you get a lot in the package!	1
Excellent product. It worked so well for making iron on fall leaves. I will buy it again.	1
Thanks for the sale.	1
Good product. As described.	1
These photo, scrapbooking albums look amazing.  I have never scrapbooked before, both of these albums are perfect. For the price the quality is amazing, they are both beautiful!	1
This is one of the nicest scrapbooks I have ever seen. Its very heavy duty.	1
Love it, exelent material!	1
This is very well made and it shipped exactly on time.  An excellent buy.	1
Does the job right!!	1
I do a lot of applique and love this product.	1
It is a high quality paper I recommend it %	1
use it all the time	1
I love the product and would recommend it to everyone.  It is great and I would purchase this item again.	1
I purchased this stuff to make face castings with my kids.  Item was as described.  Cloth cut up easily, very easy to use and the masks came out great!  Would recommend this item.	1
Great item	1
excellent	1
Very nice , picture doesn't give it justice !!	1
Gave to a friend.	1
I really like the way the scrapbook looks. However, I got the brown one and it shows fingerprints really well and I can't seem to wipe them off. I might end up getting another one because of that. But overall good quality and very durable. It's pretty big, I have 25 sheets in there and there is still plenty if room for more sheets.	1
This scrapbook is very high quality. I have actually purchased 3 of these total and plan to buy another one soon. I really like the D ring instead of having to screw in the pages. Makes adding and taking out the pages a breeze. I also love that it ties closed.  This is a good quality scrapbook!	1
Very useful for bonding material for fabrics. While hot the bonded fabricsandwich can be molded and the shape remains on cooling. Much heavier than Steam-a-Seam 2.	1
Great product,  just what I needed for my project.  Was delivered quickly and in fine shape ready to use.	1
Love this iron on fusible product to make applique so easy. I will continue to buy this product.	1
Works great	1
Perfect for bags!	1
Worked exactly as described, and for $7 or so bucks, I can't complain. You might find it cheaper at an arts & crafts store, but I don't have any near by, so this worked out fine. I used the product combined with some cheaper 100% cotton fabric to make book cloth, which is historically expensive. If you plan to do the same, this would work out great for you.	1
why sew when you can iron?!	1
This is a beautiful well made album.  I love the color and quality.	1
I used this album for my son's wedding photos.  Everyone who sees it remarks how nice the "box" album is.  By the time I finished, the album weighed about eight pounds!  The box has held up under all that weight.  Prior to this, I had only used Creative Memories albums; however, the ease of inserting pages into the ring binder has convinced me this is the wave of my future scrapbooking.  I will be order several more of these in a variety of colors.	1
The front of the book began to lift and separate from the body within a month of purchasing this. Otherwise-the design is great-its like a box so its nice to keep documents and things in one place!	1
Used for our wedding, great size to hold multiple things, easy to find more pages to fill in.	1
Works just like it's supposed to.  I used it to cover a cardboard mask form, and once it was dried was quite solid.  I forgot how awesome this stuff could be.	1
We never could get this stuff to really dry, even though we waited until the first layer was dry before we added the second layer.	-1
great	1
Yay! Now I can make a fake cast and get some sympathy!	1
I bought this material after books and DVDs by Johnny Goode about papier mach sculptures. It's a fabulous material to use to give strength to a project. I painted a small end table with colorful parrots that came out beautifully. The legs are weak and very thin. I wrapped this plaster cloth around the legs and later painted vines up them. Makes the little table much more useable. Now I'm planning to do a manatee table for the lanai using this material for strengthening the base.	1
I finally used this to make patches for some stretch denims and when I wore the pants the patch started to fall off the fabric.  Probably best not to use on stretch type of jeans.  I had to sew the patch on for it to stay on	-1
Great.	1
okay	1
I love this stuff, use it for sewing of appliques, to make better bags, linings in clothing and etc..it is very useful and this was a great price will buy more, thank you Thermoweb----------	1
good item , thanks	1
I got this for my secret santa person and was more than happy with the product and timely arrival of it, more than exceeded my expectations ive purchased another in other color and still love the price	1
This is the most amazing scrapbook! You can put a multitude of pages in this book and because it's in a box, your pages don't move or break away from the binder from the weight of the extra pages! Love this!	1
This scrapbook is even more beautiful than I thought it would be. It's got a very solid feel to it and is "box" style, meaning the lid lifts off and there's a binder within, but the sides are raised so the pages aren't damaged by any outside source as long as it's lovely ribbon is kept close. My husband and I are creating a scrapbook of letters and pictures from his dad's friends and family because he has cancer and we wanted something for him to be able to hold on to in the hospital, and this scrapbook has a great feel for a grown man who was a Marine and is a man of culture. I can't wait to have this put together!	1
Love using this with my cameo cutter.  It bonds and stays put.	1
This stuff is great!	1
I used this for a baby shower I was hosting - we used this to iron on fabric cut outs to bibs/onesies! Worked really well, and it's not too stiff which I'm sure the baby mama will appreciate when it comes to dressing her baby with the creations.  Just remember to wash and dry the onesies and fabric pieces before using (you don't want them to shrink in the wash once the baby spits up on it once)!	1
a ton of material will last forever for our cubscouts/boyscouts. great alternative to sewing.	1
I us this for fabric appliqus on my kids shirts. I don't know what the trick is, we have a few shirts that have been washed a ton after using this and the appliqus still look great and we have a few that immediately peeled after the first wear. I try to adhere it to the fabric with an iron on a low setting then my heat press to adhere it to the shirt. I must be getting my temperatures wrong.	1
A staple in my sewing room especially for Christmas.	1
Ordered this after seeing a craft video on You Tube regarding botanical casting.  The only draw back is that it is a small amount.  That is good to find out how the craft works.  So far so good.  I have more on the way and am pleased with the product and the results.	1
easy to use and requires very little technical skill. If used per directions, there is little mess and easy cleanup. Dries in a reasonable amount of time and is durable. I use it in my mask making process. Love it.	1
Had for a bit, have not tried it yet, but thinking about playing with it now actually. Going to check it out.	1
Awesome product helped me create unique onesies for my sons babyshower. Applied this product to the back on the fabric I wanted as an applique, attached the fabric to my silhouette cutting mat, used that to cut the shape and then peeled it off, attached it to the onesie, ironed it on and BAM, unique and amazing onesies! *dont overheat, that can result in melting off.	1
Love this stuff! And can't beat the price--thank you!	1
Love this product!  Lately, I have gotten into making bags.  The heavyweight interfacing to make a bag stiff doesn't come fusible and I don't like to sew it in since I like the fabric and interfacing to be like one thing.  So I use this to fuse the interfacing to the exterior bag fabric.  I made the bag in the photo last night.  Also, in the end when I pull the exterior of the bag through the hole in the lining to turn the bag right side out the glue holds and the fabric and interfacing do not separate.  When it is stiff like that there is a lot of folding and pulling to get the exterior through the hole in the bottom of the lining fabric.  I did not purchase this on Amazon.  I got it at Walmart but I just wanted to post what I thought about it.  I also used it to fuse three pieces of heavyweight interfacing together to make a stiff piece for the bottom of the bag.  It makes a nice stiff bottom that way.	1
Works perfectly, will need to order the lite version as well to finish a project.  Very easy to use	1
Love and so easy to use.	1
I initially bought this pen because I found a gorgeous card with a gold tiger on the front. I thought gold ink would be perfect for signing the card. This pen worked wonderfully and had me thinking that it would also be great for Christmas cards. There are some things you should know about this pen to make it more effective. First you need to have a scrap piece of paper handy. Then simply press the pen down until the ink starts to come out. Then test the pen out and then use it to write. If you don't do this it is likely that the ink won't come out properly and you will mess up your cards. Otherwise it is a great pen and the gold ink is pretty.  ~The Rebecca Review  P.S. I used one pen to address and write 25 cards and there is still ink left...	1
I love it, perfect for our needs! Thanks!	1
Awesome product. I use this for fusing homemade interfacing for bags, backpack and purses. I also have used it for making appliques.	1
Perfect for my appliqu needs!  Ironed easily and cut easily!	1
A neighbor has used this binder - I love that all the sides are enclosed - keeps contents dust free - would pay more for upgrade on lining - picture on front is so fun - very satisfied - highly recommend!	1
This is such a beautiful and professional looking scrapbook. I am so impressed and so happy that I ordered it.	1
I have never used this before and was not sure how it would work. you iron it on to a piece of fabric, cut out your applique or whatever, peel off the remaining paper backing from the applique, then iron it on what ever you are working on. It is great stuff and I wish I had bought this a long time ago.	1
I used this to bond counted cross stitch and heavier needlepoint Christmas ornaments to felt.  It worked beautifully.  I turned under an edge on the needlepoint and did a braiding stitch to give it a nice edge before I fused it.  For the cross stitch, I just fused and then trimmed one square away from the stitching.  Everything holds really well, no shifting, lifting, or fraying.	1
What I needed and a good price.  Thanks.	1
Great Product & Great Value!	1
good	1
These pens are horrible	-1
Really great gold! It shines so nicely and is very opaque and even. It smells quite strongly, but it's worth it since I haven't really been satisfied with other gold pens I've tried.	1
OMG--- I LOVE THESE! They flow great, does not get plugged and they are not hard to get started even when you have not used them in awhile. I have been using them for some detailed work on my Coloring and I have not had any bleed through yet. I have not tried them on thinner paper so I would imagine it will bleed a little. The ink does not come pouring out so you don't have to worry about it making a mess. The metallics are bright, reflective and show up really well.	1
works.	1
Awesome pens- look so beautiful when you write with them... just wish I had better penmanship!	1
I use this to fuse fabric to chipboard.  Works like a charm.	1
I use this to seal the back of embroidery patches and it does a great job.  Had to order it twice because the first shipment never arrived, but Amazon gave me a very prompt refund.  I use the EK Tools Scissor Pro Circle cutter on this when I need backing for round patches.	1
I wanted to make 3D fabric snowflakes from Shabby Fabrics website. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfPFaFrTh4M They were great.  This product was difficult to find and of course I found it on Amazon. Love this product and Amazon	1
Bright and fluid. Just as described	1
My favorite paint pens and the only ones I continuously re purchase!	1
I purchased this to do glass art on the back/flat side of glass cabochons and blobs. Clean with really high grade rubbing alcohol (I was diabetic, those alcohol wipes are great for this) then let dry and shake and depress tip on something flat a few times. Ink will flow down into the white tip and it's obvious, then write or draw. The nib gets kind of squishy and can shed or gain fibers after a bit. It made nice opaque lines quickly, but not as opaque as I wanted at times. However it did the job well. I sealed the art with fast drying clear acrylic lacquer before over coating with color (and sealed that before glue-up). Otherwise the paint can take the background tint and turn a different color after just a few days. Also sealing between this paint and glueing or the backing layer means it will stay the color you want. Smell wasn't bad, drip and leak didn't. Around the barrel there is a sticker labeled DO NOT REMOVE. Do not remove this, it a sealing strip that must stay there unless you want paint all over and your marker to dry out. Lasts a decent amount of time. You will not be able to draw to a fine point freehand with this. The nib is sort of stiff, not a soft flexible brush. It will bend a little with use and time but it is not a paintbrush. If you want more traditional type painting with a brush you will have to use a brush, not this pen. I bought a second so you can understand it gave me a nice shiny gold color (not high gloss) and covered fairly opaquely. Value was good.	1
These are great: very controllable with good color. I used these to restore an old ebony chair with some gold decorations. The y worked well for small touchups and I was able to spray lacquer over it without bleeding.	1
pen works great thank you	1
Worked as Needed! Will not purchase again.	-1
Gorgeous copper color with a really nice flow to it, even over a rough chalkboard background.  Wish they made more colors.	1
The pen quality itself  and shipping of pens was as promised. The problem with these pens is that one pen addressed only 10 invitations so I went through ten pens - making the whole process much too expensive.	1
I did a lot of research looking for the perfect scrapbook album for all my wedding momentos, this is absolutely perfect, not cheap looking at all, with plenty of space	1
It is beautiful! Quality is better than I thought. Made a beautiful wedding scrap book with pictures. Closes up and looks like a pretty box. Bride absolutely loved it.	1
Two the three pens ceased working almost immediately. I have used these before (bought at local arts store) for years without problem. Maybe my package was exposed to heat or some other malefaction issue. Unfortunately my previous art store purchase only ran out a couple weeks after i received this order, hence past the official return date. I only await now Amazon's response to my request for reimbursement. So, these pens have been good in my past experience -- so the issue might have been a one off bit of happenstance.	-1
If you're looking for a truly METALLIC, reflective-type gold paint pen, this is it.  The shine on this ink is brilliant.  I used these to embellish my wedding invitations and they turned out amazingly well - pretty close to a stamped or hot gold foil look when two layers are applied.  I tested four different brands of gold pens and this one outshone them all!	1
This is a great pen -- doesn't bleed through your paper, dries very quickly, permanently, and doesn't smear. I've used Sakura metallic pens many times before. I highly recommend this pen!	1
These pens are great for signing holiday cards.	1
I bought these to sign my photos and they work great. I can use as fine of a tip as I want, and there is no bleeding. Dries very quickly as well!	1
I have been purchasing this style of photo album for years (ever since I started scrapbooking). It is by far the best album on the market!	1
I really like this leatherette scrapbook.  I made a scrapbook for each of my grandchildren.	1
Nothing I use stuck.  I tried some appliqu&eacute;s, then my wife tried them, but despite several tries nothing we tried stuck.  Maybe it's meant for big stuff and all of our attempts were 2-4" in size.	-1
As described.	1
Great product.	1
Very nice for signing pottery!	1
Obsessed! Super opaque and writes amazing on wood	1
Do not like this. Is not what I thought I was ordering from the descriptioml	-1
My wedding invitations would not have been the same without this pen! I addressed around 150 envelopes with this and the gold ink is exquisite. Highly suggest!! Practice using it a little bit before you start your project, and make sure you do not press down too hard while writing or ink may puddle out.	1
Just as advertised!	1
This is perfect - has a frame on the front so one knows what the scrapbook is about, plus it ties to keep all lose papers together.	1
I prefer the 3 ring type scrapbook since it's so much easier to add pages. This book does get harder close if you put enough in it, but it holds a lot before that becomes an issue. Very nice cover, worth the price.	1
I ordered this to keep a historical accounting of our Quaker Meeting.  It fits the bill perfectly.  I love that it's folded in a way that it makes a box so the edges are protected.  It's simplistic but it's also elegant.  My only concern is that the outer edge is tied with a ribbon and if the ribbon breaks it could be a problem.  There is a fairly good supply of sheet protectors and white pages so you have all you need to get started with your project.	1
I use this to make iron-on patches with my Brother SE400 and Brother PE770 embroidery machines. I've now made a couple hundred patches and love the product. The patches adhere very well except to especially tough fabric such as denim.	1
Nice product	1
I love this stuff for making book cloth.  Works flawlessly for me, and the 5 yards is a good deal.	1
This is an excellent Heat'n Bond product.  I use this to make book cloth for book binding and it works well for my purposes.  It also would be a great product to use to make your own iron on patches.  My reason for giving this listing a four star rating is that I found it at a local store for $7.99 instead of the $9.99 I paid here.  I will be saving myself two dollars and buying it locally from now on.	1
works to keep things in place until I sew around the edges. It would never hold on its own without stitching, though. And I have rolls of it. Every time, by the time I am sewing around it, it has begun to peel off. Usually I sew it in a matter of minutes. But it is exactly what I need to keep my applique in place while I stitch.	1
Does a super job, I use this for my applique quilting, Heat' n Bond is my favorite adhesive web.  I have tried them all. LOL	1
I'm very pleased with this album.  I bought it to use for my daughter's scrapbook and it will work perfectly.	1
I purchased this as a gift to give my friend for her bridal shower. We used it as a guest book for the actual shower, and then we made a quick photo album in the same binder. It's good quality and very heavy, substantial and nice book. I love that you can add additional pages and make it fit your needs, will last her a very long time and lots of happy memories!	1
These metallic pens have been my go to for many years. Not only do they keep their fine point, but they also don't dry up like so many do.	1
Exactly what we wanted.	1
works great on porcelain	1
I use this in my art frequently and I really enjoy it. Will def buy again when I need another one!	1
One of my favorite tools. I wasn't sure if it would work well with my tangle art but it's wonderful.	1
The pen is lovely but the gold is not metallic gold  it is a little dull so test it if you are using it for any type of touch up.	1
Love this product!  I use it all the time.  Found it cheaper at Walmart (even in this large size), so I've started buying it there.	1
Love this stuff!  I'm a quilter use this stuff for appliances. Easy to use ,stays in place.	1
Excellent Quality Item!!! More than Expected!!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!THANKS! Will purchase more later!!!	1
If you own a cricut, new blades are a must have.  They will eventually need replacing and it is a 'must' to have extras so it is great to get them in a multi pack.	1
this fit my needs and exceeded my expectations.  I bought this to keep art work and paper notices or certificates from my son.  It holds a bunch and I like how it ties shut.  It looks pretty and is a very nice quality.  It wipes clean very easily if it gets dusty (i leave it out on the shelf)  Definitely worth the money.	1
These Pioneer albums are the best.  Have purchase in pink, brown, black, red, and blue. Like that they hold a lot of pages too.  The fact that it ties for closure is another plus.  Highly recommend.	1
Bought it as an additional wedding album, good quality, holds lots of pictures and the size it's just perfect. Gives extra protection thanks to the possibility of closing it as a box.	1
Did exactly what I needed. Thanks for shipping so quickly. Would order again.	1
Good quality product	1
I use this for bonding fabric to Cheer ribbon, etc. It's great. Super strong hold, and easy to use. 5 yards for 10$... Can't go wrong. Be cautious, that when using thicker fabrics, it may go stiff, but otherwise, it's perfect!	1
This is the heavy duty heat and bond. Tip... after you use this, leave the fabric alone for at least an hour before you  work with it. It really sets up very strong if you do so. I use this for many applications in my business.	1
as with all these types of markers, it needs to be 'primed' when you first open and use it. the spring loaded tip needs to be gently pressed several times before the ink (paint) will start to flow. once it gets going, it works perfectly. this is the 'fine' tip...not the 'extra fine' tip...so it's not for super small writing.	1
It was sooooo difficult to find a metallic calligraphy pen for my navy wedding invitation envelopes I tried five other pens from Michael's which were either too translucent or had too thick of a tip for legible writing. This one had the perfect fine point tip and the ink went on smoothly and not too thick. I definitely recommend this pen for colored papers.	1
I was actually hoping the markers were more like a regular pen. However, this one fits my requirements to seal important legal documents. Once you get it writing it works great!	1
I just tried it, I think this will be one of my new favorite pens for cards and special notes.	1
Lots of letters, good price.	1
I ordered the ivory for my wedding photos.  Heavy duty and very well made book.  Fast shipping and way better than I expected for the price. Highly recommend this product.	1
i realy y y y loo o o o  vee e e e e ee e e e e it.!	1
This is a great product. I have an embroidery machine, so I can applique however I like. Often I choose the simplicity and ease of this product. I learned to use it making church banners, of all things. It works better on thinner fabrics, than thicker, though you can still get it to work. I even used it on fleece.  One thing to note: if you're having trouble with it not holding, you may be ironing it too long. I noticed that on a project, you could see that the glue had soaked into the fabrics because I had heated it too high for too long. Follow the directions and once it adheres, resist the urge to do anything further and just let it cool in place nice and flat and it will hold great!	1
they are nice but I didn't pay attention they are bigger than the one I had. I'll give them away for someone who can use them	1
I purchased this scrapbook for a Christmas gift for my daughter and son-in-law who got married last May.  I filled the scrapbook with over 250 pictures and artifacts.  I love the pocket in the front where I placed my favorite picture of the two of them.  This really is the perfect scrapbook!	1
I wouldn't expect it to perform any other way. Easy to order. Easy to use. Economical. Plan to reorder. The end.	1
I used this for a baby shower onesies decorating table, and it was a hit with all the guests.  Easy to use, worked well.	1
This is a good option for someone living in the digital age, yet caught needing a keepsake album. I don't do 'scrapbooking' and have snickered, for years, at anyone who tried to sell it as a hobby. Give me a photo album and I'll let the artwork do the talking...which is why this album-box is PERFECT. It's well made and the perfect size. It's not a large album (realize that before you order) and it does not come with many insert sheets. I guess that's the only downside; in order to use it as a photo album you'll need to order more photo sleeves. Still, what a terrific option for an event keepsake. Mine will be a wedding album, with no satin bows or kitschy gold borders, that can also hold a few wedding cards and letters, even DVD's.	1
This Pioneer scrapbook is the epitome of praticality. It's got it all:  - Lots of space - Sturdy sheet protectors - Rings, so you can reposition pages as needed and add regular-size sheets - Box format that doesn't fall apart, is easy to carry, stays closed - Great quality - Many of color choices - Reasonable price  I buy one every year and use it to make a scrapbook for my son that includes photographs, pictures of his artwork, birthday letters, etc. Why stop after the baby book? Every year deserves its own book, and the Pioneer scrapbook makes it really easy.  The only cons...really heavy once it's full. I can't picture us moving anytime soon!	1
This is super-quality stuff but it is fairly firm on the fabric when applied. I would recommend this more for items that aren't going to get a lot of rough use or lots of washing, such as wall-hangings or other decor items, more than on kids' clothes or bibs, since it is a little hard to sew along the edges of the applique.	1
there were two tiny cracks/splits in the leather cover where it was folded around corners. Compared to other albums I have looked it seems that is not too big of a deal. All together very well made.	1
I love this album because its so easy to use.  No more taking the whole spine apart to add or rearrange pages.  I love the easy rearranging with the 3 ring binder system.  And I love how I can add bulky items to my pages and still have a nice neat album due to the box system.  I also love the album cover window.  I used to have to take my albums apart after they were filled then ship the album cover to a vendor to have the album title embossed on the cover but no more.  Now I just make my own title and pop it in the album cover window.  Its so easy.  This album meets all my scrapbooking needs - love it.	1
Both I and the client really loved the box style of the scrapbook. The edges were peeling in some places and I had to re-glue them down but overall good scrapbook.	1
Just as advertised! Thank you	1
Great timing and great product	1
I needed fresh blades. These were as described.	1
necessary to have when making lots of invitations	1
If I could give these negative stars, I would. I've had my Cricut for a year and have never had a single problem with it. I was in the middle of a project and decided to put in this replacement blade. From there, I was literally unable to cut a single thing! No matter what I put the setting to, the material I used or how many times I took the blade out and put it back in. It wouldn't cut vinyl, paper, etc. I even spent hours adjusting the cut pressure on my machine. I am beyond disappointed! I went back to using my year old blade that came with my machine and it worked perfectly.  Note: The blades I purchased were not sold by Amazon which could be why they were problematic. Amazon was awesome about rectifying the issue.	-1
cool	1
As described.  Good price.	1
I haven't used it yet.  Looks oik	1
I have used this product for over a year now.  The white labels come off easily, especially if in a warm room.  The protectors are a good place to store photographs.	1
I bought these photo protectors to use with our Cropper Hopper, and they work like a dream.  They are a great way to keep photos safe and dust-free as well as super organized.  Easy to put together and label.  Great product!	1
there is nothing better than a cricut with a new blade - this was very reasonably priced in comparison to my local michaels store	1
as expected	1
As advertised.	1
Got to have them. What can I say?	1
Provo quality!	1
Works perfect	1
Needle to replace the dull one on my circuit cutter. Exactly as expected.	1
Jewelry cutters arrived promptly and serve the purpose I needed them to. I am using these to upcycle old, mismatched earrings and pins into cute, new rings. These work great!	1
As described. These are my 3rd set as sometimes I cut larger wire than I should with them and do get dull and dings in them.	1
Great item fast shipping	1
Excellent value and good quality cutters.	1
Works great	1
awesome	1
Now I can do more crafting without the preoccupation of wasting my blade. Love Cricut	1
They work fine in the machine	1
Great product and affordable!	1
Works great. Good price.  5 Stars	1
Dulled and broke after a week of use on 20 guage wire. Not good quality.	-1
Very comfortable to use and cuts well.	1
An excellent cutter	1
Perfect.	1
Good product, what I expected	1
Always need blades should always have a spare pack on hand so you don't have to run out during a project.	1
Wife needs quick response for this product and she got it, happy camper.	1
Easy to insert	1
Great	1
this is a great product	1
Thankyou	1
Absolute garbage. Worse cut than the $2 wire cutters I bought new at the swap meet.	-1
This cuts my stainless steel chains, I am pleased with with the product	1
Exactly what I needed and well made.	1
Great blades, only complaint would be they are EXTREMELY sharp when you use them for the first few times they nearly tear through your paper. I had to adjust the setting on my cricut machine so that it would cut at a much lesser cut than normal so it didn't tear through the paper. I ruined a few sheets of paper before I figured out the right setting. After a bunch of cuts it cuts great/normal and you can adjust the settings back.	1
Cuts	1
Good sale	1
Worked just like always.	1
Nice cutter.	1
Works great. Easy on the hands. Arrived on time and as described.	1
The clipper blades are a soft metal for cutting other metal.  I tried to cut a wire and it left a divot in the blades. These cut jewelry making wires quite nicely. But be careful and don't use them for other things. They kept their alignment so they are still usable - just have to stay away from that spot on the blades.	1
Arrived well packed, on time, and is just what was ordered. Works well on softer wires. Not heavy duty.	1
Work great.	1
good cutters	1
Works great!	1
Great	1
I am amazed how long these last. I cut intricate designs on glitter stock alot. This blade lasts me at least 6 months. It's amazing.	1
Arrived on time. Fair price. Nice replacement. This is 2 blades.	1
These blades did not stay very sharp very long... so if you have a big project, I suggest ordering more then 1.	1
Great.	1
A very useful tool, much better for close cuts than my heavy duty wire cutter.	1
great	1
Use this only for dead soft or half hard. I like these because they cut through soft side crisply, instead of crushing it. However, I accidentally used them in steel wire, and ruined them. At least at this price I can get another pair!	1
Great quality, very sharp, cut perfectly.	1
Great price...great product.....cuts the wires with little effort.....love this	1
fast delivery, works as expected	1
Blades were dull and would not cut anything. I had to reorder blades again. I was very disappointed in this product and will never purchase from this company again.	-1
A+	1
perfect	1
erfect fit	1
Nice product for the price!	1
Using these cutters is easy.  I have bad hands and these are easy to cut with.	1
love it	1
Great item	1
I don't do plastic canvas, but have decided to try it at least once to make a recipe box for my Tia Boo.  I want it to be original and one of a kind, just like she is.  I probably will only do this once, so the quality for the small price of these great little cutters is fantastic.  I think I can even use them with jewelry making ... something I also want to try a little of.	1
My original tool was Craftsman, given to me by my husband, and I used it for several years with my scrapbooking, cutting 28g wire all the time.  Moved into jewelry crafting, and a few eye pins later, that tool had gouges in it.  :-)  I went for a jewelry cutter this time and it is standing up nicely to the wire and pins.  The grip is not too stiff but not too loose either.  Very happy with this purchase.	1
perfect	1
thank you	1
Im sure she will go thru alot of blades doing a lot of cutting....	1
Great!	1
great!	1
Did just the job needed!	1
Love Cricut products.  You get quality for a reasonable price.	1
Perfect product for jewelry makers, great seller also.	1
very nice tool for the price	1
Works great	1
works great	1
Perfect!!!  Thank you:-)	1
Love this product. Without I would be out of business!	1
I love these little cutters.  I wouldn't know what to do without them!	1
I had no idea these existed until I followed a tutorial and someone was using them. Best purchase ever! Boy have the made a difference in my jewelry making!!!	1
i got these and jafter cutting bead pins they are all groved up no use to me now waste of money	-1
Good deal and work great for cutting dies apart.	1
Not usually a Cousin or Darice products fan, but these are good at the holiday price. They don't hold their sharpness for a long while, but again, not bad for the price. For first-time users, be sure to use the correct edge to make a flush cut or you will need to use a wire rounder.	1
These are the best pair of snips. i have bought a few pair in the past. Most of the ones either bent out of shape within a few projects. These ones have been sturdy without anywear. I cut iron baling wire. Awesome quality..thanks.	1
This is an amazing product... I do so many cool things with it!	1
I haven't needed to replace the original blade that came with my Cricut but I have to assume this will be equally useful.	1
Great Product!	1

you can never be more prepared than to have replacement cutting blades when working on your design.  nicely packaged and small to fit in the compartment of your machine....	1
ok	1
Did the job.	1
Great price!	1
Great for crafts.	1
Cute little clippers.	1
These didn't last long and I'm a little disappointed.  I was wire wrapping some cabs and they were cutting great on 20 gauge copper, dead soft wire.  I hardened some eye pins of the same wire and these didn't do the trick.  The cutting blades got all dinged up.  Description of item should be updated to reveal what hardness and gauge wire these are designed for.  They worked great until I hardened up the wire!  I would buy them again for use on soft wire.	1
These pliers cut all of my wire, so far up to 14gauge, perfectly flush, love them	1

Great item. Fast shipping	1
Ordered this to try a new craft project. Very pleased with the results.	1
Loved it!	1
Works real good!	1
works perfectly!	1
i love this stuff.  i am an etchaholic	1
thank you	1
Fits my Cricut perfectly	1
great	1
You can never have too many blades. These were a great price and fast shipping!	1
It was getting the small 2 to 7 Oz in stores.... but this is awesome and I got it at a great price!	1
Arrived and works as expected.  It does have a strong oder so work in a well ventalated area.  And apparently it will damage ceramic sinks so rince it off into a plastic basin with some baking soda, let sit for a bit, and then dump.  I used it to make many of my christmas presents this year and they look fantastic.	1
Fast shipping and great item.	1
Works great, just doesn't work on Ikea glass pans (be forewarned).  Otherwise, this stuff etches glasses and Pyrex pans GREAT!	1
Big size for the money!	1
Works great	1
We bough this cream to etch glasses for our wedding.  It etched the glasses perfectly and consistently.  Although we did have to leave the cream on longer then instructed to get the desired effect.	1
Love it! So easy to use!	1
I have a vinyl cutter and decided I wanted to try glass etching. This stuff works fabulously!  My process was to cut my design in adhesive backed vinyl, weed out the parts of the design I wanted to etch, apply clear transfer tape to the front of the design, peel off the backing paper on the vinyl, apply it to the glass I wanted to etch, carefully peel off the transfer tape, apply a thick coat of the Armour Etch Cream using a foam pouncer, wait at least 5 minutes, wash the cream off with running water and then remove the vinyl.  Here are some tips to get the best results: 1. Make sure the glass is very clean. I wipe it well with rubbing alcohol to ensure there are no oils that would prevent the etching cream from etching evenly. 2. Rub the vinyl hard to make sure every edge is completely adhered to the glass. If it isn't, the cream can bleed under the edges. 3. Apply the cream thickly and as evenly as possible. I pounce it on rather than brush it to avoid brush marks in the etch. Make sure it's so thick that you cannot see through it at all. 4. The directions say to leave it on for 5 minutes but longer is fine and makes a deeper, more frosted etch. 5. Work on a covered surface and wear gloves. If this cream gets on anything else, it will etch it, too. Remember, this is an acid that is strong enough to etch glass! Also, I suggest working in a well ventilated area. I do it on my front porch.  You can etch all sorts of things. Some I have etched are glass tumblers, mugs and steins, glass dinner plates and platters, glass bakeware, mirrors, canisters, jars, bottles and window glass. Etching your name onto platters and bakeware ensures it gets returned to you. Etching names and monograms onto simple glass mugs or plates turns them into fabulous gifts.  This is a fairly big bottle of etching cream and even applied thickly, it will etch a lot of glass.	1

I love these blades for every little craft I make. Be sure to keep an extra hand at all times. I try to have a different blades for the different materials I cut. The hardest thing I have used these on so far is the thick card stock glitter paper but these bad boys cut like butter.	1
This product has gone a long way for me	1
Super easy to use.  Used this to put names and the date of a wedding on 10" round mirrors for centerpieces.  Put stencils on the mirrors and spread a little of the cream in the stencils.  After a couple of minutes the cream rinsed off, and it rinsed easily.  After removing the stencils the mirrors look like they were bought in a store.  Came out better than expected.  I would recommend this to anyone doing glass etching.	1
You can't go wrong with Armour Etch.  I have used it on multiple projects for glass etching.  I love getting creative with it.  Make sure to wash items off in a bucket or tub and not directly in a ceramic sink.  It will eat away at the ceramic finish if you don't wash it off quickly enough. Smells horrible, but does an amazing job.	1
Cuts perfectly	1
I ordered this etching cream because it was listed for a pretty fair price. When it arrived, though, I opened the bottle and took the cover off there was no foil seal on the top of it. I have never purchased this before, so I'm not completely sure whether it was supposed to have a seal or not, but it did really surprise me that it didn't. The bottle was also not filled to the top which was also a not what I expected, but again, I'm not sure if it was supposed to be all the way full. I have not had the chance to try the product itself, but so far I'm kind of disappointed.  (The picture attached isn't that great of quality, but it is a picture of how the bottle of etching cream arrived)	-1
Cut too deep. These are packaged as standard but cut like deep cut.	-1
Didn't work on my cricut	-1
I received an open and totally spilled and broken bottle. Huge and poorly packaged box. I hope to get my money back please. money and time wasted? cry, impossible to send back is trash ... I would like my money back please.//Recibi un frasco abierto y totalmente derramado e inservible. Caja enorme y mal empacado. Espero recibir mi dinero de vuelta. dinero y tiempo perdido? llorar, imposible enviarlo de regreso es basura...quisiera mi dinero por favor.	-1
I finished my smaller bottle of Armour Etch "New and Improved." I had ordered 3 cases of bottles that I planned to frost and design. I had no problem with the coverage with Armour Etch "new and improved". The reviews were good for this Armour Etch (not "new improved") so I got a large bottle. It is a terrible product. It left streaks from lack of coverage on my new expensive bottles. Some had hand made designs that couldn't be duplicated. I attempted to re-coat those with simple designs. I had to cover all of the area I had done before to prevent botching and I left this Armour Etch on for 20 minuted to be sure of an even coat. I rinsed and it still did not cover areas. It still left ugly streaks of "frosted vs clear" areas. I can not recommend this product unless you are only planning a tiny, tiny area. It "may" work for that. Not only was this was a total waste of money but it also ruined 4 new bottles which I am most unhappy about! Thank you Amazon for refunding my money!	-1
Did not work at all. I used it both with a damp towel and without a damp towel. I held it on the fabric for 30 seconds repeatedly, instead of the 10 seconds recommended in the instructions.  Only positive thing was that the steam opened up my pores pretty nicely. DIY facial. Whee.	-1
i don't know how these are suppose to be used. I went to replace my old blade to find out they are nothing alike	-1
buy some other rollers.  You don't need these, and they are fairly cheap.	-1
You're better off just sticking chewing gum to your item.	-1
Like another user said, won't make it through the wash. Pulled up immediately even after applied with high heat.	-1
This says bracelet wire - but it really isn't appropriate for bangle bracelets. You need much thicker wire for that. Not sure hat type of bracelets you could use this for.	-1
Just sharpen the blade that you have... why buy another?	-1
Beware!!! I bought these from the Blade Factory and after I paid I noticed that the picture on my invoice was a generic picture. I contacted the company immediately asking about it and telling them if they are not the Cricut blades as in the listing I don't want them. They sent me an email saying that they were indeed generic blades and not Cricut blades and that it's Amazon's fault that the picture AND the description are of Cricut. LIARS! THEY list their own items. There are plenty of generic blades here on Amazon that have photos of their generic blades and are not misleading people by using Cricut photos or Cricut descriptions.  They refunded my money, which they SHOULD have done since they are falsely advertising their generic items. I wouldn't have given any stars but in order to review an item you have to give at least one star.  DON'T BUY FROM BLADE FACTORY!!!	-1
The blades were not Cricut but a generic brank.  They pictured Cricut brand.  I like to know I'm getting what I think I ordered.	-1
Didn't work for me. Candle wax stuck in mold, making a waste of time and money. Not happy with this purchase one bit.	-1
Didn't realize these were the "soft grip" latex that I'm allergic to	-1
Kind of works, but do not puff as much as I thought they would	-1
Gave as a gift.	-1
They arrived bent and i had to return them	-1
Do not believe the positive reviews! These are dollar store garbage. Used once for a small project of making pillow covers. The second time I went to get them they were dull. Impossible to cut the fabric. Talk about a product that doesn't last:((	-1
I tried using this and couldn't get it to work.  I might have done something wrong.  Please look to other reviews, mine might not be the best, this is a new product category for me and I'm still trying to figure out how to get this kind of ink to get "fluffy".  I bought it to make a bunny tail.	-1
These worked great, long enough to cut out a pattern. They started to stick, the spring would not open the blades all the way. I cont to cut with them hoping it would resolve itself. Never did so returned for a replacement. I hope they work, as these are the best scissors I've ever used, as far as cutting fabric.	-1
For the cost of these blades I really wished they lasted longer. I'd say I go through 7 packs a year cutting bazzil cardstock and SU! cardstock. While not recommended by the manufacturer I have started sharpening them after they dull using a sharpening/wet stone. It works for me and my expression is 2 years old so the warranty has expired.	-1
These do not work as well as the original black and grey scissors. Very disappointed.	-1
Not very good. The screw will not stay tight.  When the screw is tight the scissors are perfect for arthritis hands	-1
These are supposed to be one of the best names in scissors - these despite the name and the fact that they are made of Titanium, did not hold their sharpness or even arrive that sharp to start with. I got them for cutting upholstery fabric (a thick version of a satin), and they were chopping it up and making it fray and show uneven cuts	-1
The ink in these pens tend to come out quickly and messy.	-1
The blades on this set of scissors are bowed, so the blades actually have a gap between them at the prime spot of the blades where I'd like to cut fabric, so they are surprisingly frustrating to use. The blades meet at the last inch of blade at the tips, so they're usable for smaller cuts, but most of the length of the scissors just chews up fabric, rather than cutting cleanly. I'm quite disappointed, Fiskars used to be a brand of quality, and will be sending these back.	-1
I have had many pairs of this scissor and they used to be great. The last three pair were terrible. The lock  broke and the spring kept falling off. I don't what they did but they are no longer worth buying.nFriskars are great but this pair has been, somehow, redesigned in really poor way.	-1
These pens are horrible	-1
Worked as Needed! Will not purchase again.	-1
Two the three pens ceased working almost immediately. I have used these before (bought at local arts store) for years without problem. Maybe my package was exposed to heat or some other malefaction issue. Unfortunately my previous art store purchase only ran out a couple weeks after i received this order, hence past the official return date. I only await now Amazon's response to my request for reimbursement. So, these pens have been good in my past experience -- so the issue might have been a one off bit of happenstance.	-1
Do not like this. Is not what I thought I was ordering from the descriptioml	-1
I bought this etching medium to use on glasses for my wedding.  I have used a similar product before in a class and thought I would try this brand because it was cheaper and easier to find. The bottle has little to no instructions - just "Shake well. Stencil, brush, sponge, or stipple." There were no directions on how long to leave on the stencil, the medium, whether or not the final product could be washed, how to care for it...the list goes on and on.  When I logged on to the company website, there was not much more in the way of instruction.  I ended up scrapping the project because I didn't have enough time before the big event to buy something else to try.  Very disappointing!	-1
I'm a big fan of Fiskars scissors, but these are a disappointment.  The sharpness is okay, but the orange locking button continually gets stuck in lock position while I'm cutting...that's hugely annoying.	-1
I am very annoyed with Cricut. I recieved my cricut as a gift and have invested more money in that thing than if I had just bought a sillouitte. It's very limited as to what you can do. These mats are pieces of crap. They don't hold their stick very long at all. I have used a gluestick on the back of vinyl to keep it stuck to the mats. I'm out of luck with paper. If it doesn't stick to the mat it completely destroys your paper. The sizes are SO specific there isn't really any alternative. If you are a frequent cricut user- you will need to buy a new one of these every month or so. It's not worth the price.	-1
Does not fit my Dremel, the shank is too thin. This could be very dangerous!	-1
I have had two pairs of these scissors; with the first pair, the spring fell off.  The second pair soon became dull.  I would not recommend this product.	-1
These pages stick together and are flimsy..not of good wuality like some others I have purchased. I do not want to order this brand again	-1
I purchased this product when I first started using resin and molds. It was a waste of money. Just clean your molds after each use and wipe down the molds with a little oil and wipe it off. Make sure you let the resin set up for the alloted time. To make getting the resin out of the mold easier just put it in the freezer for about 10 minutes. You will be amazed how easy they come out. I found no help in using the mold release spray, matter of fact it was actually easier not using it. Don't waste your money, buy more resin instead.	-1
I sprayed and sprayed this and it doesn't help any better than cooking spray or dw40 would. I finally asked someone who sold jewelry and they told me to use fiberglass resin wax release. good luck	-1
Your better off using baby oil or vaseline. I thought this would be worth is but it's not. It has the consistency of water and it says to spread it around, meanwhile it just pools around the corners of the mold rather than actually coating the mold	-1
not a fan. could not get the mold release from resin. im probably doing it wrong	-1
This stuff has some serious issues. I'll tell you first that I'm not even sure if it worked at all. When I used it in a plastic mold for two-part slow cure resin (a small simple project of just a dome to be used for a cosplay brooch), I had to practically break the mold to get it out. It pools and beads up on the mold itself. The instructions say to spread it around evenly (which it will still bead up after you spread it around and leave some areas with too much product and some with almost none) and then wait for it to dry. The pump spray is a joke. I got more mold release on my fingers and my table than in my mold, and the nozzle almost immediately got clogged. I don't see a reason to use this on silicone unless you're using a material that will stick to silicone, which my particular resin (and most that I'm aware of) won't. Maybe it's best used as a cleaner. I dunno. It'll probably just sit on my shelf. At least it doesn't smell bad and it didn't stain anything that the bad nozzle sprayed all over.	-1
i didn't seem to work,....i think i was doing something wrong.....MAYBE	-1
NOT RECOMMENDED AT ALL!!  This product did not work at all.  I lost my original and the mold I was building.  It had no effect on mold separation (a two piece silicone mold stuck as if it were cast in one piece) and when used as a release agent (as advertised) caused significant bubbling and what can only be described as an "orange-peel" texture on the resin casting.	-1
I think it sucks! My resin works much better using coconut oil and now I'm stuck with 2 bottles of this crap.	-1
We've used this on 3 different materials of molds and sprayed a lot on it. It doesn't work any better than using no release at all. We just got a rectangle shaped paperweight stuck in a new, smooth mold. The wax works perfect. I just ordered professional mold release from CRC like we use where I work to see how that works. I don't recommend this spray.	-1
does not work as well as other products	-1
Came with two yellows instead of one yellow and one orange:(	-1
doesn't work...ruined my casts...ruined my mold...please don't buy...	-1
Doesn't work, followed the directions... shook up the stupid think sprayed it into my resin mold, let it dry... even did a second coat to be safe and It hasn't aided in getting the freaking cupcake out of the mold. Smells like a... weird rain. I don't like the product I don't even think it works for silicone molds! I can't tell a difference in the pulling ability from silicone molds with and without this stupid crap. I do not recomend.	-1
went in the garbage	-1
The clay was more like melted butter and was hard to work with	-1
get silicone spray instead. this epically failed my use.	-1
I followed the directions and even did two layers of spray but this mold release didn't work at all, everything stuck together. It's a very thin liquid and honestly, it's like spraying water on my mold with just about the same effectiveness.	-1
I have no idea as this was a gift to a kid who never told me anything about how she liked/disliked it --sigh kids!	-1
I ordered this to spray on my molds to keep the resin from sticking but when I spray, it doesn't spray even and it is patchy with more in one area than another.  The spray comes out more like a stream, not sure if the sprayer is defective or what but I can't use it in my molds.	-1
Leaves a chunky residue even after shaking for several minutes it sprays a mist of stuff with chunks in it.	-1
I am giving this 2 instead of 3 stars only because I am a beginner, and there could be something I'm not doing right.  But first and foremost, if a product comes in a spray dispenser, you should be able to spray it.  Not so with this spray bottle.  Once you depress the spray top, it stays depressed until you pull it back up with your fingers for the next spray.  Or wait a couple of minutes for it to come up by itself.  Very very time consuming and infuriatingly frustrating.  I actually monitored this closely, and only 1 out of 10 attempts allowed me to spray 2 shots in a row.  On top of that, the angle of the spray is very very wide, so it's impossible to cover your entire form.  I end up using the sprayer (with difficulty) to get some liquid into the form, then using my finger to spread it around.  Not good!  Now, I'm using "Easy Cast Clear Casting Epoxy" by Castin' Craft and a variety of molds in different sizes from Environmental Technology.  Can't really tell you what difference the mold release spray made, but I didn't have a whole lot of luck getting the casting out of the molds.  The bigger the mold, the easier it was to remove the casting.  The 3 1/2 X 6 came out fairly cleanly and easily.  The mold that's more like 2 X 3 was more difficult and the 2 X 2 was impossible.  Well, not impossible, I used a hammer, which cracked the mold, thereby releasing the casting.  Effective, but you end up going thru a lot of molds that way. :)  I did find that sometimes it helped to wait an additional 24 hours and try again, and the casting released a little easier then.  I'm going to try some of the other alternatives suggested in other reviews here:  among them, wd40 and cooking spray.  Might even try something like baby oil.  If anyone else has something that they have found to work, let us all know, ok!  : )	-1
I get the same results when using this spray and not using this spray. Seems like it was just a waste of money.	-1
I've found that baby wipes work just as well and are much easier to use. They are also much more affordable and smell good!  The best ways to get your resin piece out:  Wipe mold out with a baby wipe. Mix resin correctly. Let it cure fully. Flip mold and try to pop is out by applying pressure to the back of the piece.  If your resin doesn't come out easily there is a very simple way to get it out, just lay the mold face down and give it a gentle whack with a hammer, the mold pops right out and easily every time.  With that being said, I bought this mold release as a beginner and it's a waste of money. It's too much money for a bottle with a sprayer that doesn't even work most of the time, I had so much trouble just trying to get it to spray where I was pointing it. There are also a ton of precautions for it, do not get on your skin, don't use in closed areas, ect. In my opinion it's too much of a hassle to have to shake it *very* well for a few minutes, spray it just right because the sprayer is wonky and then wait for it to dry. It's truly a useless pain in the butt.	-1
I used this stuff when making a mold, followed the instructions but it was horrible, the best fix for me was to use candle wax on the container instead of this stuff. Using wax I got a clean silicone mold with absolutely no rough edges at all however I can see the thin strokes of wax in the underside of the finished piece. I ordered Mann Release instead of this stuff after seeing it in a few youtube videos. If you are using a relatively expensive mold making material and want to NOT have to peel silicone off your original do NOT use this. It can work... but will it work for you... I'd say you have a 60% chance you'll regret using it and I would never ever use this stuff making a two piece silicone mold, it isn't worth the risk.	-1
Save your money because this product does not work. We use plastic paint palettes as resin molds because they have a lot of interesting shapes. Most paint palettes are pretty flexible and it is easy to pop the cured resin shapes out. We recently used a more rigid paint palette and tried this mold release ahead of time, following all instructions. Absolute waste of time because the resin was impossible to dislodge.	-1
I tried this in hopes this would help release my resin pieces easier. Nope. One the liquid just pools into the mold and this is with spraying it lightly once. Then I remove the excess, and when I pour my epoxy, it pools on top of the epoxy. Very frustrating.	-1
I was expecting more from these pencils but they're pretty bad, don't waste your money and buy carb othellos or just about any other brand of pastel pencils, maybe these are ok to sketch with but that's about it, I use generals charcoal pencils and I like them but these are really bad	-1
Very small and expensive, I returned it. Good old food coloring work just as good. The only color that would be difficult to create would be amber but for the price of this small bottle, no amber for me. Seller performance was fine, but I would not recommend this product as it is just expensive food color.	-1
I tried Staz On because of the claims that it adheres to surfaces like a sharpie pen ink.  It doesn't.  I am an engineer and a chemist.  I received StazOn today and did a side-by side test of a black sharpie pen and my new StazOn ink pad.  The StazOn Ink smeared of onto my finger after 30 min of drying at room temp.  The sharpie ink was dry in about a second.  I need pad ink for a logo I am stamping.  StazOn  does not stay on compared with Sharpie.  I am still looking for ink that works exactly like Sharpie.	-1
I measured exactly, stirred as the directions said to and seven days later it has done nothing, I only hope I can somehow salvage my project	-1
It is true that these scissors are good for cutting intricate pieces of paper or thread.  Beyond that I would not expect them to hold up.  While truly sharp and finely pointed, the rest of the scissors feel like they are going to fall apart during use.  I am being careful with them but expect that they will bend and/or break soon.  I've never had any scissors as "wobbly" as these; they feel like the folding style scissors.  They are cheap in price (although apparently they cost more originally) so I guess I should have expected this but I'm still disappointed.  It's not worth sending them back so I will use them as long as they stay in one piece.	-1
It never tried fully. 2 months later and it is still wet. Followed directions to a T.  Update: still not dry!!	-1
I've been trying to put my finger on what exactly it is I hate about these scissors and as I tried using them once again this afternoon, the reasons started coming.  #1  I have fairly small fingers and when I stick my thumb and index fingers into the holes, I can't get them back out without a struggle.  It's not like my fingers are too big, I don't think.  It's more like the material is 'gripping' my skin and holding on (if that makes any sense).  At any rate, I'll just say they don't slide on or off your fingers.  #2  I do a lot of fabric 'repurposing', which means a lot of ripping out seams and then clipping the loose threads.  These scissors don't really cut well, even for  just cutting loose threads.  And when added on top of the struggle of the finger holes not allowing for any slide.... It's just too laborious to use these things.  I ordered another pair, different type, same size, from another vendor, and they are working out so well, even though I pulled these back out today to give them another go, I know I won't ever use them... so in the junk drawer with all the other sewing tools I'll never use but just can't throw away...  Good luck if you decide to buy these.  I'm sure they are suited for someone's use ... just not mine.  can't say I wish I hadn't bought them because, well, that's just dumb.  I did buy them and that was dumb enough - lol  On the upside --- .. the order was prompt in getting to me, so whomever was in charge of shipping, did a fine job.	-1
I'm very upset because I bought this product easy cast and I got pour-on. I already started a project with easy cast and I was short so I but one more and I got something else...no I cannot finish it or I have to buy again. I am no like to return products and I stuck with it but Amazon should have more careful with vendors	-1
Handy but only fair quality	-1
Didn't set up properly, despite carefully following the instructions exactly. It stays slightly tacky and flexible. I think I got an old batch. The hardener is slightly yellow, and the date on the bottom is January 2016. Beware that it's not returnable here on Amazon if you get a bad batch. So I suggest buying it in a store so you can check the date on the bottom of the bottles and make sure you get a fresh batch. I've since tried the resin from Little Windows, and that sets up hard as a rock.	-1
I didn't care for them too much. The action isn't very smooth but the blades are very sharp.	-1
Ordered 3 of these. First one I opened was fine. Results good. Second one I noticed the hardener had a yellowish cast. Had already opened it so I went ahead and used it. Afterward, I got online to check what the yellow color meant. Results...product was past its shelf life. It wouldn't cure and 6 days later it's still tacky to the touch. Very disappointed as this is a very pricy product for small amounts. Will return 3rd one.	-1
What a shame, but these are absolutely terrible.  Don't waste your money.  Spend an additional $5 and get something better.  The blades stick because they aren't properly aligned or die cut and the blades aren't sharp enough for cutting paper let alone cardstock.  They tear rather than cut.  I wouldn't fussy cut any of my Graphic 45 paper with these.  Cannot recommend.	-1
not very sharp	-1
The warnings should scare you off. If it isn't EXACT, then you've ruined it. Too much mixing, too many warnings.	-1
I bought this for my husband who is using it for a repair on an antique glass lampshade. It does not want to dry well even days later. Directions were followed to a "T" but it still stays too tacky. I will have to go back to my old brand.	-1
This stuff doesn't set well. I've used it four times--following directions and mixing the correct amounts--it's pretty much hit or miss. Wouldn't buy more.	-1
I tested this product for use in making fairly complex shapes for jewelry, using silicone molds. The poured resin is a two-part deal. You mix the contents of two bottles, according to the instructions on the box they come in, and pour into your mold. Easy!  Sneaky. Those are the instructions you see before you buy the product. They're the ones I used when I made my first piece, and it did not harden. I was lucky to get the goo out of my mold.  There's an instruction sheet INSIDE the box. Much more detail. The bottles have to be at a specified temperature, 75 degrees. I do not have a thermometer that reads in that range. You have to combine equal volumes of the liquids in one container, stir for two minutes by the clock, pour them into another container, and using a fresh stirring stick (?), stir for another timed one minute.  I managed all this, although it was a messy process. The mold I picked was a lacy one, and it wasn't possible to keep the resin from filling the open spaces in, although I tried.  It did harden overnight. It's supposed to be kept within a specific temperature range while hardening, and I used my digital bread proofer to keep it at its ideal temperature. I don't know how well it would have set if I hadn't had that.  I had a lot of detailing to do this morning to remove material from areas that were designed to be open, and to make the carved-out edges neat. A solid mold would have been a better choice for pourable resin, that's for sure.  Given the amount of mixing, there were bubbles. Some were internal, which wasn't a problem. Some were surface, which affected the quality of the shape. No doubt these could be filled, but that's another step and more time.  I don't think this product is useful for anything detailed or complex. Maybe for cabochons.	-1
I've gone through two boxes of this brand and I end up with failed attempts every time. I've tried everything ever suggested and found online. I just can't get it to work.	-1
I purchased this machine on Amazon through FlexShopper.  What a nightmare!  I've been sewing for 30 years and I've never seen so many problems after only a few weeks of using a machine.  Light weight fabrics get sucked into the feed dogs, no matter how much you adjust the pressure. The tension is moody and hard to manage.  The LCD display is a joke as the image quality is very poor. The needle threader jammed into the downward position and even though I managed to push it back up, now the machine will not sew because the needle threader catches on the back of shank as it tries to move.  I had to send the machine off for warranty repair.  Beware, if you don't have an authorized Brother Dealership or Service near you, Brother requires you to pay to ship the machine off for repairs! What a joke!  With 7.5" of throat space, an additional LED light wouldn't have been to much to ask.  My former machine, the Singer Quantum Stylist 9960 has an additional light in the throat area, comes with 18 bonus presser feet, has a much better LCD screen, an extra wide extension table included, does a much better job when free motion quilting with automatic tension, and costs $50.00 less.  If you want an extension table for the PC-420PRW, you'll pay $50+...I'm done with Brother!  I bought the new Juki DX7 and it is a stunning machine!  Yes, it's pricey but you get what you pay for.  I also sold my Brother serger and replaced that with Juki as well.  Juki machines are the most amazing machines I've ever used and don't cost $5,000 for a decent model like Brother's VQ3000 machine which is no better than my new Juki DX7 I just paid $1300 for, minus some high tech bells and whistles that the more practical among us don't even need.  My advice is to either finance or save up for a good machine.  There's nothing worse than playing musical sewing machines!  I'm so glad I finally have good machines I know I can count on for years to come.  Thanks to the helpful folks at Sewing Machines Plus, I'm back on track and ready for a fun new year!  :)	-1
Disappointed.  I got my first Brother PW 4 years ago.  Started quilting; became 'hooked'.  July 2016 the switch to lower the feed dogs broke.  It was going to cost $90 to fix a $185 machine, so instead I bought this one.  I was excited to have a thread cutter and other features.  In November the needle kept falling out.  I contacted Brother for service.  The closest place was over 100 miles.  Neither company would let me ship the machine to them.  Fortunately I had purchased the extended warranty with Square Trade through Amazon.  They said I could take it to the shop 30 miles away and they would reimburse me.  Great!  Went without machine for 8 days!  Six weeks later the FMQ would not work; back to shop.  There was thread wrapped around something inside.  Removed.  This happened again yesterday.  That's it.  I'm done.  I am going to shop for something else.  Keep shopping for better machine!	-1
Not very happy with this machine as either the bobbin doesn't wind tight thus allowing the bobbin thread to get caught in the sewing machine needle shaft or the sewing threader doesn't thread the sewing machine needle and you have to retread the thread sometimes as many as six times. I may send this machine back.	-1
Plastic parts.  Stopped sewing after 6 months.  Will never own another Brother product.	-1
tore up with in two months,I absolutely loved working with this machine,then in the middle of a quilt it just started sewing sideways and bunching up threat, sounded like a thrashing machine,I was heart sick because it sewed so beautifully and to just tear up so quick, made me sick. I gave right at $500.00 for it and sure thought it would last longer then two months. I am so thankful for Amazon's return policy	-1
This machine has tons of stitch functions and attachments, of which I will say I love the knee-lifter. The thread cutter is nice, however I find it slows me down. I am a 5th generation quilter and have been doing creative sewing for years...I can honestly say I was willing to give this machine a try, but the quality just isn't there. My machine is now broken. I dropped the "feed dogs" to sew on satin, and they won't raise again. I was offered a P.O. to send it in for repairs, but that would mean packing it back up and shipping it out.  My Janome Threadbanger (a collector's edition TB12 now called something else) and Janome TB 30 have served me much better to be honest. Emphasis here on QUALITY over "quantity" (of stitches, attachments, etc). The Janome machines are simply made better. My advice to anyone interested would be this: if you are either new to sewing or have been sewing on mainstream sewing machines for a while, you may be quite happy with the Project Runway machine because it would be considered an "upgrade" to a regular machine bought in traditional stores. However, if you are a "purist" like myself, and have been accustomed to sewing on a heavy-duty machine you might not be happy with the quality of this model. I learned how to sew from my Grandmother, on a White sewing machine...very heavy duty. We relied on our own creativity and being used to that, it's hard going to an electronic machine that is a bit more delicate and tempermental.  If you are into making clothes, handbags, quilts, home decor, etc., the more basic and sturdy machines are what you want. I've sold many home decor items at shows, and the fun stitching isn't what you see so much as, say embellishments you will add or how you put it all together. It all depends on how you like to sew, and what your expectations are.  The key here is if you want a machine to do a lot of the work for you and help you along with the creative process of sewing, this would probably work well for you. If you already have the creativity on your own and can guide the machine to do what YOU want it to, then pass on this and go for a Janome. Hope this helps!	-1
The machine won't work properly after only 8 months and there are no service centers nearby, the one they did send me to doesn't even handle Brother machines and they do not work on them! They have plastic gears and are a piece of high priced junk. They want me to drive an hour away to their service center, they do not offer shipping or anything else for their piece of junk, if it breaks and there is no service center close then forget about getting any warranty work.	-1
Not so good. About 1/2 of the studs went in crooked. Very flimsy plastic construction. Not through instructions!	-1
total waste of money and time. This thing drops stitches NONSTOP, there is no way of knitting continuous thing with it. it grabs the fibers in the yarn (plied or non plied, doesn't matter, tried different weights, same result) and actually cuts the yarn! it completely ruined one of my expensive yarns. Compared to cheap kids singer knitting machine, a $20 machine did MUCH better job. Returned it instantly.	-1
This item arrived with a broken needle, after replacing the needle with one of the extras included it still dropped stitches. I have returned the item for replacement.	-1
Makes loud noise and is hard to crank.  Screws also looked stripped in a few spots and handle is loose seems like it's a used machine although it came in original box.  Not sure if this is a refurbished or I just got a bad one.  Disappointing quality compared to the price.  Update.  The company sent me a replacement that appears to be working correct. Disappointed in the request from the company to pay out of my pocket to fix their mistake.	-1
Wel-l-l, it was fun for awhile, but...after you use it a few months, the counter function goes haywire and starts counting by 2's, then gets even more erratic.  I sent the first one back (they have lifetime warranties) but the second one was just as bad.  The salesperson then told me the units all do the same thing.  So why doesn't the manufacturer fix the problem?  Mine was relegated to its box and now sits in the basement with the other flops I've bought over time. Incidentally, I should mention also that the machine has a nasty habit of dropping stitches.  I used some jimmy-rigging with little rubber bands to ameliorate this somewhat, but still had "fits" with it.  I dunno--maybe it just ME?	-1
I gave this 1 star because I bought it as a gift and it was a duplicate so I returned it.	-1
I would like to get this item	-1
I bought these beads to replenish my supply of Swarovski Fire Opal crystals for a special necklace that I was designing.  The crystals I received were not the same as those in my inventory.  The Fire Opal Bicone Swarovski crystals I have in my inventory are "two tone" and you can actually see two colors and the results are stunning.  The beads I received are distinctly one color.  The difference between my crystals and the crystals sent by the vendor is distinctive and measurable.  I notified the vendor and the vendor said that they will give me a refund.  In the meantime, I lost a good customer because I am not able to meet the deadline to complete necklace.	-1
Would not recommend.  Does not fix anything tothe surface.	-1
The package was open and 2 needles (the size I wanted)  were missing.  Other than that the needles are just your standard embroidery needles, work fine. Upset there wasn't a full package though.	-1
This altered the paint color to a milky, bland color tone. Mixed it with a dark brown and it made the color tan which is what I didn't want after mixing both. Mine was runny also, not sure it should be from other reviews.  The clothing was still a bit stiff when dry so I'm not sure it did anything there either. Should've went with Liquitex brand.	-1
It might work for some but this didn't work at all for me. I'm a serious crafter who had no success with this product.	-1
I ordered this thinking it was the normal 7 ounce skein I buy at the craft store.  I was stunned when I opened the box and saw how small they are.  They are only 3 ounces, so if you are thinking of ordering this be aware of that fact.  I don't see anywhere in the description that says it's 3 ounces.  This is not going to be enough for the project I was planning. The yarn itself is actually very pretty, though.	-1
Maybe I got a bad batch but it was very liquidity. I just threw it away!	-1
Small size, scratchy.......won't  buy this brand again.	-1
I was disappointed. This "Lamp Black" is a flat black paint, I haven't seen many flat black lamps. I wanted to use it to repair small chips in a black panther lamp and this DecoArt flat paint stands out horribly. At least it washed off with plain water.	-1
you do not get any where close to the amount you pay for	-1
it is way too small amount of yarn for what you pay for it, I have learned my lesson NOT TO EVER BUY YARN from online again. I feel really stupid for  way over paying for what I got	-1
I was very disappointed in the yarn and delivery. It was 5 days late and very inferior to the yarn Red Heart usually puts out. I crochet for 4 charities and I use a lot of YARN everyday. I could only use this for trim. I stil had to go out and buy other yarn.	-1
not good forwhat i needed,maybe can use another way	-1
I'm not going to buy this kind of paint again. It is so chalky and gets dry even in the bottle. Sorry.	-1
I have used red heart yarn for many years and have used hundreds of skeins; the color Mexicana among them. The yarn is wonderful but the price being offered here is expensive and to then pay a huge fee to ship the yarn is rediculous. I do not understand how these sellers can justify their shipping charges. I did say that red heart yarn is a good yarn but to pay over $10.00 for a skein of yarn once you add the shipping !!!! it is not that good.	-1
terrible directions, Sue	-1
I assumed it was a metallic gold, it was not. Just a faded yellowy colour. Dries too slowly and a bit too liquidy.	-1
It's OK, but the bottle is SO tiny, that I am not even sure what I will use it for. I guess. 2oz? Not sure about that.	-1
It didn't work the first time I used it.	-1
Dries darker than I would have liked when I think of "gold metallic" paint. When mixed with a medium such as Floetrol, it losses its metallic look and is simply just a gold color.	-1
You need lots of room to get the tool in place. If you manage that it's hard to keep the snap part in the indentation of the tool. Finally sent it back for a refund. Thanks, Amazon.	-1
Thin consistency. Not solid coverage, you should paint with solid thick color first and use this as a supporting for a shimmery or glossy finishing	-1
Product is silver gray.  Would better if a brighter metallic and thicker. It shrinks badly when dried.	-1
Not shimmery as described, but applied nice with one coat.	-1
I tried to determine the actual color of this paint from the photo and was pretty satisfied I had done so when I placed my order, but it turned out to be a reddish-gold shade. I needed something completely different, so I won't be able to use this one. It's probably not possible with differences in computer monitors and such, but I do wish there was a way to feature more accuracy in paint colors sold online.	-1
Purchased as an add on item.  Bottle was unsealed and half empty.  Won't buy again.	-1
Didn't work at all!	-1
So far the cutter works ok with very soft and thin copper wires. The other two will need some mending to be functional. This is an inexpensive set but, at least need to be functional at receiving.	-1
I don't like these tools.  I have used them for 2 days and the wire cutters are dull, the tool for eye pins sucks, the needle nose pliers are the only thing that was worth while in this package.	-1
Not the best. It get mushy and clogs. Not good for paintings.	-1
I bought this in the Matte finish to seal a Mod Podge decoupage project, also in the matte finish - it made the entire project GLOSSY!!!  I hope my customer finds the result palatable, elsewise, I will change the rating to one star.  Oh, and yes, I followed the directions!	-1
Hate it!!!  Hate it!!!  Too small, not as described....very tiny, too tiny for the project that I wanted it for.  Bad description; would not order again.  No use for this.	-1
Hate it!!!  Too small, not as described....very tiny, too tiny for the project that I wanted it for.  Bad description; would not order again.  No use for this.	-1
Too small, not as described....very tiny, too tiny for the project that I wanted it for.  Bad description; would not order again.  No use for this.	-1
This item was delivered by PRIME with no wrapper, full of dust, and the plastic lace had already been cut. (Another of the same arrived in a sealed wrapper, clean and uncut)	-1
I'm used to the s'getti and got 3 spools of this not knowing it wouldn't knot.  No way to make anything as it all comes apart.	-1
This description says red but it is definitely a pink color in person.  Was going to use for school colors but now just stuck with it.	-1
the packaging was poor, so everything was crumbling down to dust, cant use them for anything, so they are going in the trash.	-1
I purchased these thinking they would be great quality, lost shape quickly and can't even make a leaf with a nice straight edge anymore, not impressed	-1
Mine was not one yard.  Only 34" long and almost 18" wide.	-1
Not shiny silver like I was expecting.	-1
When I received this cording it ;looks to be a good 1/2".  Packaging says 3/8.  I measured it and it measures 1/2".	-1
Hmm...strong for gripping a bit oily, sad looks a good tool but sides don't quite match up to use for crimping ...too much a bother to return ... probably end up buying a different one: /	-1
doesn't crimp well	-1
I would have posted a pic but somebody else already did, showing the same problem... Half the reason I bought this stencil was for the cool spiral swirls, but unlike the product picture, it has these weird round spots and are all disconnected. I do not like the "spirals" AT ALL on the stencil I actually received.  I would have given another star or two because the rest looks okay and the plastic isn't too flimsy, but I feel LIED TO for receiving something different from what I ordered.	-1
it was opened inside box, got no use out of it	-1
Too thick to do what i wanted with these.....they are sturdy stencils though if that is what you like.....must use a brush.  Can not be used with gelli plate very well	-1
Small, like dust.  Not good for my application	-1
Man this was messy.  Maybe I should have expected it, but I was anticipating larger white flakes.  This makes me think someone took a cheese grater to those Styrofoam craft balls and made Styrofoam dust.  It jumped all over my when I opened the bag - seems like some static business going on.  And I just tried to put a little on my plate and it got all over the table.  I think it is so light that it is difficult to contain.  But it does look like snow.  Might be nice in a jar or vase filler if you plan to open once and never touch again and don't mind a little clean-up.  But not good for kid craft which is what I was hoping for.	-1
I like this paint but the value isn't there.	-1
This snow was a disaster! It looked pretty and sparkly, but as soon as the children tossed some in the air, it immediately was in their eyes. We spent part of the party cleaning the snow out of the play area and nursing crying children's hurt eyes with cold wash cloths. It is just too tiny to use as fake snow. It was harmful to the children. Other snow similar to this is larger, like torn plastic bags, and we have used that in the past for snow play time that the children love, but it was sold out at our Walmart store. I will never buy this again as a substitute, just stock up on the safer fake snow when it is available!	-1
These are flimsy and fall apart.  the metal comes right off the wood handle just running under water.  Would not recommend	-1
It came a crumpled mess. Stencil is completely useless. Horrible.	-1
So far, both Delta stencils I've ordered have arrived warped, which makes them unusable for many techniques.  (They've been under heavy books for two days and are still warped.  The only way to make it flat is to hold it down with two hands...leaving none to work with!  Surprisingly, the plastic is thicker than many stencils.  HINT TO SELLER:  Today, I received a more delicate stencil from another brand and it was in perfect condition because they took the time to put the stencil between two sheets of cardboard before mailing.	-1
thin plastic, cheap	-1
Not very easy to use with paint! Does not come out like the stencil.	-1
I would give it a zero star if i can. Worst stincle ever. It is just a stupid plastic for kids to play with	-1
Not a fan of this product.  It's so hard to use for a chalk board, which is what I bought it for.  I guess if it's used in some other medium it might work better...just not "chalk" lol	-1
Don't use for painting. Might work for pencils, markers or tracing. The paint went everywhere even with pressure	-1
Found at a cheaper price. Many places getting rid of these products because they aren't good sellers so you can get the iron itself plus accessories for the same price	-1
This stencil does not come in a package, it was just shoved into the box. It is really bent and not usable.	-1
Bought two different types-  this is not easy to use, shoots the rings all over the place.	-1
This Baby Pink yarn is terrible! As I have been using it there are thin strands that are barely held together. There are strands that are totally frayed and I had to improvise as I was crocheting! Very disappointed. I have other skeins in many colors and not one of them is like the that.	-1
I gave a 1Star bc the striped pattern that was created was nice. With that said this yarn split while crocheting making it horrible to work with.  I also saw  this identical name brand and colors in a fav store for half the price.  Not buying this yarn again	-1
It is very fine. Not as described. It seems more like a thick string than yarn.	-1
Opened package to find yarn had been cut in several places	-1
This is beautiful yarn at a really horrible price.  For $7+ I thought I was getting three skeins and it even said that in the description (or so I thought).  Alas, no.  So the yarn is nice, the price is not.  Don't be fooled.	-1
I ordered this because I misplaced the one I had owned for years.  what a disappointment,  the original was metal and had a sturdy case.  this was has a very cheap plastic needle painted a fake metal cover and a flimsy case.  I will put extra effort into finding my original because this one is worthless.  once again made in China really says it all.	-1
The cost of this Zebra color is ridiculous.  REALLY......3 times the normal cost.  Just a ripoff.	-1
The needles are roughly textured. Will keep only because my old Chibi container broke. Trashed the needles.	-1
The yardage,is very deceiving. This is extremely expensive for the amount of yarn in the skein. I was expecting 364 yards many others who ordered it, but the actual skein is 236 yards. I will never order yarn from Amazon again.	-1
This yarn is probably fine for kids' craft projects and maybe some lessons in the most basic of knitting or crochet stitches, but it was a poor choice for crocheting a hat. It's not soft at all, and it's so very inelastic. Even having made my gauge swatch, I ended up with a hat that was too big simply because the ribbing didn't hug in like it was supposed to. It stayed stiff and extended. I made the exact same pattern with an alpaca yarn and it came out beautifully, but the hat from this yarn I'll chalk up to a learning experience.	-1
Not pleased I order three balls yarn for 15 I needed one more and had pay 8. Some bs	-1
I thought that this was the larger size skein because the description said ECONOMY but it turned out being the regular size skein (I didn't know the size by ounces at the time). Just so everyone will know... I would of never paid over $7.00 for what I could of got for $3.00 at Walmart. My bad!	-1
I liked the product but have discoverd it was wsyyyyy overpriced!!!	-1
This yarn should not be called "glow" anything.  It is misleading.  I would not have purchased it had I known it does not glow.	-1
Took forever to arrive and the can was so much smaller than I had assumed.	-1
This yarn was way to small for the money	-1
Having tatted for less than six months, and having tried metal bobbin shuttles and Aerlit bobbin shuttles, this quality is not impressive.  The bobbin slips too easily (on first try), and the hook feels as if it will fall out.  Not impressed, won't be buying again.	-1
I ordered because it stated it was light grey. It's more silver and does not match a light grey I was already working with.	-1
It was terrible.  It consisted of very rough yarn that was not in one piece skeins - in three or four foot pieces periodically throughout.  Very disappointed.  Have used super saver for years and never bought such inferior yarn.  Will think twice before buying again.	-1
This yarn is horrible! Color is beautiful and the price is good but I found several small knots and it's extremely fuzzy! I have others by the same brand that are fine but this one is awful	-1
I have bought this yarn previously (Aran) and was satisfied.  I recently bought two skein and found them totally flawed.  Consistanly varied as to the width, the twist and one skein was knotted twice.  I will never again purchase Red Heart 4 ply again.  Where was the quality control? On to another brand.  Milli	-1
Very expensive small skein of yarn.	-1
not large and not really useful...	-1
Description said 364 yard., What I received is 235 yards this is not what I paid for	-1
It is not like the color pictured.  I was disappointed.  If you're not looking for a perfect color match it's okay.	-1
Way over priced for one small skein of yarn. I thought it was the jumbo with a charge of over 7 dollars a skein	-1
i was disappointed as both skeins of yarn had some yarn unraveled, and all knotted.	-1
stuff and dry and left dust so do not use without a brush, actually left residue to if a watercolor is following- color won't stick so no more for me	-1
stripes to far apart could not use it	-1
Horrible yarn. Inconsistent from skein to skein; some will be relatively soft and okay to work with, and the next will be much thicker and rougher, which will cause gauge to be inconsistent. The rougher texture will also be uncomfortable to work with. There is good reason this yarn is cheaper than others. Go for a better yarn and you will enjoy working your project much more, and the end result will be far superior.	-1
I ordered 10 skeins of this yarn and every skein has two to three places where they had tied it together.  I cannot use it for certain projects I wanted to because of that.	-1
BUYER BEWARE. Right in the middle of this skein was a knot with frayed ends. As in, they two two length of yarn and tied them together. So, halfway through a piece that was to be a gift, I have a knot.	-1
Not as soft as others I've bought in the past.	-1
Over priced for product	-1
Overpriced for the size, this product can be found at Wal-Mart for half the price, when I read economy size for 8 bucks would have been a good price if it was in fact economy size which it is not	-1
Way too expensive. When I saw supersaver I thought it would be a larger skein. Can buy that in the stores here for half the price.	-1
I called red heart and complained about the inferior quality of this yarn.  Red heart apologized and I am waiting for a new supply of it to come to market	-1
Be aware that the Williamsburg Print, along with all multi-colored skeins,now contains only 236 yds not 244. Red Heart has decreased the amount of yarn in their multi-colored skeins ( not the price though).  This is a very tiny skein. I will find another brand if they continue this practice.	-1
I'm not a fan of this brand of yarn, I won't buy it again, but that is just my personal preference. It snags and unravels a lot more that the yarn I am used to.	-1
This particular skein of yarn was SO thin compared to others of the same exact brand.	-1
I picked this color due to description "Measures 364-yards length" yet only 236. I cannot do the project I needed it for with this yardage.	-1
These are awful maybe it's be but I couldn't get these to work for me	-1
very cheap, thin plastic	-1
The color is NOT shocking pink - it's more of a boring mauvey-rose pink.  If I had known the true color I wouldn't have ordered this yarn :(	-1
This is usely a good yarn for price. I pitched 3. The first one was really nice when I started on my blanket. Half way through it was not twisted as well as at the beginning but still it was fine. The other two was separating and catching on the crochet hook. I was making a baby blanket but because of the separating of the yarn I decided to make it a smaller blanket for my grandaughters dolls. I would not buy this again because of the time you lose when it splits on the hook and the stitches are not always smooth.	-1
Not very easy to use with paint! Does not come out like the stencil.	-1
I have made a lot of afghans in my many  years of crocheting but always used Red Heart wool and I thought I was getting wool this time. The  texture of this yarn was very loose stitches and split a lot.. I need to make another one after this and hope I can go back to wool.	-1
Only 364 yds, for the price($7 +} I was expecting the 744 yd skein. I don't know if this is an error or not.	-1
Poor quality, yars breaks easily  while doing crochet	-1
This comes up when searching for glow in the dark but doesn't glow at all	-1
Big ho-hum on these butterfly stencils. They are just boring. I have stamps that are better. I tried them on several designs and each time found myself having to cover up the area where I put them. I don't know why I bought them. It was a mistake.	-1
WASN'T WHAT I EXPECTED & TOO FLIMSEY TO HANDLE AS WELL & STUCK TO THE IRON TOO FOR A TIRESOME CLEAN UP	-1
Does not work well.  Even with several applications, the brushes are useless.	-1
The yarn came without any protection.  It has several dirty spots on the yarn.  Very disappointed!	-1
This shade was a completely different size yarn than the other red heart super saver colors I bought. Much thicker and coarser. Ruined my project.	-1
I had a $25.00 gift certificate that I used to make 3 separate purchases of knitting yarn.  They were sent separately becuase they did not qualify for shipping alone.  That is perfectly OK by me.  Trouble is, the gift certificate was a birthday gift, which I used to pay for the yarn.  However, I had to pay for all three, because you did not honor the gift certificate.  Please check your records and apply the $25.00 gift card.  Thank you--Geri Goodson.	-1
Look online for MUCH better prices.  Not worth it.  Plus, the other red heart supersaver pics -well, the colors are all off.  Coral is called pink, etc. so you don't know what you are gwtting.  Go on the red heart site.  Prices and sale prices are much better, shipping is more than 0 as prime members get but it's not worth getting any yarn on amazon.	-1
I will never buy this again. It continually unraveled and falls apart. You get what you pay for.	-1
For the items I wanted to seal, that is, metal pieces of jewelry, it did not have desired effect I needed and had to remove said paint and used polyurethane instead. Despite the surface being very clean and free from any dust, it did not work for me. I wanted a hard shiny surface to protect the delicate engraving. It does state `glaze`on the advertisement and the finish was indeed glazed and took away and distorted the work I needed to preserve.	-1
Over priced	-1
Very hard to use	-1
THIS IS NOT SUPER SAVER ECONOMY YARN LIKE IT SAYS!!! It is the smaller size! Now I have to order the same amt to have enough!	-1
I decided not to buy from this supplier because of the sketchy picture depicting a 14oz skein when it is not. 14oz are also considered jumbo which this is not. I would recommend changing the picture to reflect this detail. When asked if this was a 14oz skein, you answered honestly which is why I gave you 2 stars.	-1
This is the worst yarn I have ever used.  I have used many different colors of red heart yarn, they make great hats, slippers etc.  however this color was so stiff.  The hand warmers I made are rough, going to try washing and drying with a softener to see if they can be used.  I have no idea why this one color or dye lot is so bad.  I can't say don't buy this brand as I use a lot of it every year, just wish there was a way to return it to red heart or at least an explanation.	-1
the yarn is rough in texture like it was painted and the paint made the yarn crispy and scratchy. I hate working with it.	-1
This yarn is SUPER scratchy & likes to unravel itself when trying to crochet it.	-1
I paid $9+ for 364 yards of yarn!!!  TOTAL RIPOFF!!  These were supposed to be DOUBLE SIZED skeins!!!  I pay $2.50 for 364 yards at local stores!!!  I want a return label unless I get 2 more skeins, one of each color!!!	-1
This arrived in good condition and on time. The canvas is a nice size and seemed good quality. I painted on the canvas with acrylic paints the day I after I received it. The morning after that, the frame was warped on one side! Very warped. Needless to day I was very disappointed. The painting I did was for a gift, so I had to try to make it work. I put it painting side down on a sheet and set bricks in three places on the warped end. Then I had to place some thinner wood between the painted side and the ground to add some pressure to bend back. It bowed backwards away from the front of the painting. That worked...........for the time being. I realize that frame, over time, can warp but never expected that the first day!!	-1
This yarn is pieced together. When you try to ball it it unravels, knots and the color is inconsistent. Especially the orange colored ones. Red dye is dropped throughout. It actually looks like someone bled on it. Comparing it to other yarns it isn't soft either. I prefer Vannas choice or Bernat. Do yourself a favor and spend a bit more on quality.	-1
They broke within a couple months. Waste of money. Would have bought metal ones from the start.	-1
Very unhappy with this yarn.  Very scratchy and a lot of knots.	-1
This set is decent, although I find the two smallest sizes to be very sharp on the curved undercut edge of the hook. However, I am extremely dissappointed that in a set that comes in it's own pouch, with six slots - each marked with the hook size the slot should hold,... That the rightmost, green, 6.5mm hook is missing! Will be contacting Amazon/Seller to fix this.	-1
The yarn was joined twice in the first skein.  After the second joining of the yarn, the yard split into four pieces which makes it very hard to crochet.  The yarn is not as soft as I would have liked it.  Very disappointed in the yarn itself but the color was wonderful.  I'm not going to order the Soft Red Heart yarn and give that a try	-1
My mistake, when I saw glow, I thought it was glow in the dark yarn	-1
I expected this to be like other Red Heart worsted weight yarns I've purchased--5 oz Super Saver--but this is not at all soft and would not be comfortable to wear as a hat which is what I intended to make with it.	-1
After one washing, the pads are all bunched up.  Not good quality at all.	-1
Bought these hooks because of all the positive feedback, but I am not happy with mine, the. Ends of the hooks are so rough and sharp, I can't use them, they catch on my Yarn and I cannot get them to go through a stitch, so I have given up, am hoping my husband can file them smooth so I can use them.  I must have gotten a bad set of hooks.	-1
The product appeared to have been used.  The Red Heart label was completely torn from the yarn.  The yarn appeared to have been unwrapped from the center (not the pull out end) and to have been cut -- as the end of the yarn was frayed.	-1
hooks were very ragged  and seperated yarn so bad I cannot use them.....	-1
Very small skeins, smaller than I expected  for the price but this was the only place I could find some more of the color I needed so I kept them. Wished the description had listed ounces since that's what I am used to working with.	-1
These crochet hooks are terrible.  They are all pock marked and rough edges.	-1
Cheap and ugly, but I should have known that when I bought it.	-1
I too bought these late at night and very tired... had no idea I was purchasing something dollhouse sized...pretty dissappointing when you were expecting something much larger	-1
This yarn was the worst yarn I ever bought! It  kept separating and also cost twice as much at amazon then it does in a store. I ordered it because the store was out of it and I had a project I was working on. I thought for the price it was a bigger ball of yarn. [O	-1
I have purchased  these hooks for more years than I care to remember , but would not recommend  them to anyone now. I could not imagine why they were so difficult to work with. ,then found they were as jagged as saw teeth . I then compared them to my older ones and found the new ones ore from Mexico.  Quite a difference in quality . Unusable. !!!	-1
Over priced!	-1
I usually very happy to buy my yarn here but this specific item came to me yesterday and the colors were faded and off...	-1
The color is the shade of teal I needed, but it is not wool, but acrylic. My project is felted and acrylic will not work.  There was no receipt in the package for me to return it.  I continue to save it in the wrapper if I do receive a recept.	-1
splits to easy not good on my knitting loom	-1
Love the way colors work, but yarn keeps separting. Am used to a much better product from Red Heart. Never had an issue before.	-1
This crochet hooks were highly rated, for the most part, and that is the reason I purchased them.  It seemed like a good value at the time.  However, these hooks snag on my yarn and are not well made. There are sharp-ish edges , which is not good for crocheting.  They scratch my hands as I try to use them and even my kids don't like them.  I have been using the Susan Bates silvalume hooks, which have a bamboo handle. They are much more comfortable to use and I don't feel fatigued in my hand nearly as quickly.  I plan to make my next purchases an even higher quality hook, like the ones made by Furls.	-1
Lots of thin spots, frays easily.  Not the quality I expect from Red Heart.	-1
I was disappointed with the quality  of the crochet hooks. The F hook had a rough spot on the hook that had to be filed down, it was catching on the yarn.  I will know better next time,I should have ordered quality tools.	-1
Definitely "economy" yarn!  Very rough and scratchy to touch. Great if you are crocheting patterns like baskets where you need the extra stiffness to hold a shape. Terrible for items you would wear.	-1
This yarn is a great color, but the quality isn't great. It's a little thick and course which makes it hard to work with. I didn't expect much better for the price.	-1
It was not quite what I was looking for	-1
To be honest, I'm actually disappointed with the quality of these.  They are sharp and edgy (actually cut my finger on them) and they tend to split the yarn and don't pull through the stitches smoothly at all.  Such a shame.	-1
There were pieces of red or pink spun right into this yarn here and there. Disappointing. Usually Red Heart yarn is fine. Could this have been a batch of seconds or manufacturing flaws?	-1
Chinese-POOR QUALITY	-1
The color represented in my screen is actually not as bright as the final product, and the screen made it look pretty bright.  Returned.	-1
Ok	-1
Yarn is good quality, but from the photo I thought the platoon is white, grey, and black. Instead the coloring was in the beige and brown family.	-1
This yarn is soooo horrible I don't even want to  use it. Its hard and stiff.  Rough feel	-1
Yarn	-1
Bought this to decorate for my sons street art dance hoping for more glow. However there was not a lot of  glowing coming off this yarn. Did look neat latticed across the ceiling but white would have done the job just as well. Two stars for being a great product, strong, well packaged just not much 'glow'.	-1
I cannot use this yarn. It started to shred as soon as I tried to cast off.	-1
Has a terrible feel	-1
The color transferred to my fingers and made my exzema flare up is rougher than the other colors of same brand yarn. Havent washed it yet am afraid it will bleed a lot.	-1
the product description is for 14 ounces. I purchased 4 skeins. They were 10 ounce skeins. I contacted the seller and was told they were out of the 14 ounce skeins. They made no effort to correct the shortage. I wrote back and told them I was not happy. They wrote back to thank me for my feedback, blah, blah, blah! This is false advertising. I am surprised that Amazon hasn't done anything about it. Addendum: I failed to mention the product came from fabric.com.	-1
I love the red heart yarn as I have used it previously, but I was very surprised when I got this and it broke every very minutes. I kept having to piece my project together	-1

This yarn is really economic and big but this yarn isn't soft it is really hard.	-1
wrong color	-1
Not glow in the dark	-1
I was sent Cherry Red instead of the Soft Navy I ordered. The packing slip even said Soft Navy. But I needed to finish my project for mailing, so I did not have time to send it back and wait for the replacement. I just made the article smaller. I was so disappointed.	-1
This yarn was crap. Frays super easy. I let my daughter use it for practicing her stitches as it was useless to me.	-1
Color too bright. Much brighter than advertised. Makes a good companion to to the advertised pumpkin color yarn. That is if you like screaming colors.	-1
The sellers price is nearly double the suggested retail price. I believed this was a Super Size skein but it was only a regular 7 oz skein. I wouldn't pay this price again for cheap acrylic yarn.	-1
So... I started crochet with the cheap plastic hooks several years ago and then took a break. A few months ago I started going amigurumi (small crochet animals) crazy and then all of a sudden my hooks start breaking. So I began to hunt for something better. I tried the Susan Bates Silvalume Crochet Hooks in the Pouch (Sizes F-K). I took them home and tried them out on a current project - the one that had the broken hook, and I had such a difficult time finding a rhythm - these hooks were not polished enough and kept catching on the yarn. I then tried the Boye Aluminum Crochet Hook set - same thing - they kept catching on the yarn.  I spoke to a store employee and she said that I should try wood - bamboo - both wood and plastic hooks are warmer than the aluminum and glide better. She was correct. I did like the bamboo hooks.  At this time I also bought a Tulip Etimo Crochet Hook - which, though aluminum, glided so smoothly through my yarn I was EXTREMELY pleased by it. I also tried the Clover Takumi Getaway Soft Touch Crochet Hooks Gift Set - and it too was amazing. I believe this is because the quality of the aluminum and the craftsmanship is so much better than the Boye and Susan Bates ones.  Conclusion: If you're beyond the plastic beginner stage - invest in some quality hooks.	-1
I've been crocheting since i was 8 and susan bates hooks just ruin crochet for me.  THe hook shafts are far too short. I've got large hands for a woman and these needles are so short that i can not rotate my wrist properly and see the yarn over my hands while i crochet. Also i do not like the way that they snag and split the yarn when i work with them.  I prefer Boye needles. hands down.	-1
Spring green : warning...the actual colour is a lot duller than it looks on the screen	-1
Super scratchy! Also was able to rip it easily. Trash yarn!!	-1
I am just learning to crochet and selected this yarn because it had great reviews, the skein was large and the price was low. The color is as vibrant and wonderful as the picture would lead you to believe, and the skein really is huge given the low price. I figured this would be a great yarn to learn and practice on. However, I think this product is for those who have a lot more experience working with yarn than I do. The yarn kept splitting apart. Very often my hook would go through the yarn itself, instead of through the stitch, causing catches and knots in my work. I found this very frustrating and it slowed me down a lot. Finally I gave up and passed this yarn on to a friend who is a lot more experienced than I am. The yarn is beautiful, but a nightmare for beginners like me. (Plus, it's on the scratchy side; it squeaked pretty loudly against the needles.) I recommend Lion's Brand yarns instead. They are somewhat pricier (and the skeins are usually much smaller), but I found that yarn to be much easier to work with.  P.s. - If you go to a specialty site dedicated to yarn crafts, like Love Knitting, Red Heart is pretty low down on the list of "most loved" worsted weight yarns. Not a good sign.	-1
This yarn was beautiful in color but the quality was horrible....so bad I'm thinking of writing to red heart.  It separated into separate strands almost through the entire skein, and I used 9 skeins out of the 10 I bought.  I would not buy this again...which is too bad because the color was really pretty!	-1
it had black ashes on my white yarn no  one wants dirty yarn	-1
This wool might work well for crochet but for knitting the wool comes off as threads.	-1
Colors are great. The big problem is the marrakesh color is advertised at 364 yards but is actually 236 yards according to the skein sleeve. False advertising? I do know that  no 2 skeins of red heart are the same length no matter how they are marked. But 128 yards falsely advertised is ridiculous. I bought 4 skeins so I got shorted 512 yards or about 2 1/2 skeins. Received 20 more skeins today, 4/20. All were advertised as 364 yards per skein but in actuality were 236 yards. In other words I was fraudulently shorted over 2500 yards more with this order. The total shortage for all ordets received so far is just over 3000 yards.	-1
splits hard to use on my knitting loom	-1
iTS OK	-1
It did not meet my expectations.  I was expecting a light shade of coral.  It was nice and soft though.	-1
It is very rough feeling yarn...too bulky.	-1
This is worst yarn I've ever bought. Instead of the strands being together it's like working with four separate thin strands. This happened with two different colors. I'll never buy this yarn from Amazon again!  I'd give it zero stars if i could!!	-1
its a pretty yarn but not what I ordered. I ordered purple tones and got the candy color.	-1
This yarn is advertised as having 364 yards per skein.  It only has 236 yards.  I can buy it cheaper at somewhere else.	-1
Too tough! Cannot wear on body, only for carpet.	-1
Love the color, however, the yarn gets stringier as you use it until it is very hard to use due to extreme stinginess. The yarn threads do not hold together, after project is finished I will not purchase again. Very disappointed in Red Heart Quality. Have used Red Heart for decades, maybe I got a bad one????	-1
Yarn has a beautiful color and it is soft, however it is pretty thin, compared to other Red Heart yarns.  In some areas has some knots that needed to be cut out.	-1
Beautiful colors but very thin. It's more like a size 2 baby yarn without the softness than a size 4 worsted weight. Also it cost too much. You can save almost $5 per skein by buying the same brand at Wal-Mart ($2.88 each).	-1
In the past, I've bought this yarn from Walmart and really liked it. However, it hasn't been available for a while, so I thought I'd just order it online. The packaging looks the same, but the quality of the yarn is not good. It's thinner than usual, and it's difficult to work with because it snags easily.	-1
It is just what it says ECONOMY yarn, cheap but poor quality in my opinion.	-1
I realize that ordering yarn online means there may be some color variation from what I see on the screen. I also realize a yarn called "pumpkin" should be on the orange side. This yarn appeared to have more of a yellow tint online and it is nothing short of neon orange! I ordered this along with another color that showed up as a very green color, nothing like what I expected, and now I have neon orange and green for a project I was really looking forward to...	-1
Does anyone know how many ounces is in this skein?  Pattern go by how many oz of yarn you need.  Is this a 5 oz skein or 7 oz skein?	-1
color is much lighter than it appears online and when order arrived the one skein was frayed and unusable	-1
I found out that this yarn is way over-priced when I finally took a trip into town (an hour away) and saw it for sale at Michaels for $3.19 instead of the $7.97 price this seller is asking. The yarn itself is dull and coarse and rough on the hands.  I decided not to use this yarn I was overcharged for and get better stuff at Hobby Lobby.	-1
The yarn seemed more of a vibrant color in the photo. But my main issue  with this yarn is that it was such a poor quality.  It was difficult holding the tension when I was crocheting because the yarn was so flimsy. I'm reteaching myself to crochet after having putting down my crochet needles over 10 years ago.  This yarn started to fray even before I had to pull it apart to redo a couple of rows. In my humble opinion this yarn was not worth the over six dollars I paid for it. I certainly would not use it to crochet gifts for family and friends.	-1
I ordered a few different yarns from red heart, since i loved using them before. Sadly this time when i used them, the package was stolen off my porch and they refused to give me a refund or to resend me the yarn I ordered. Very disappointing.	-1
I've been using Red Heart yarn for years and it's always been nice and soft and easy to work with.  However when I chose this variegated combination to use in my current project I noticed it's very scratchy and rough feeling and also hard to work with.  It doesn't slide off the crochet hook easily.  I love the colors they make in this combination yarn but there is something about the fabric content that makes it scratchy so I won't be using it again.  I compared the content to the plain colors and it's the same so they must be doing something in the color process that makes it rough.  Come on Red Heart I know you can do better, your yarn has always been so great to work with and such a bargain to buy.  Don't mess it up now!  I'll stick with the solids.	-1
This is not a super saver yarn. Super saver is a lot BIGGER size at the price I paid It should have been a pounder size. I'm going to return this order. It is way over priced.	-1
If this item had been available, it would have only been priced at $2.44 per skein. I needed the yarn to Complete a project that I was working on, or I wouldn't have ordered it at the price that it was sold. I checked stores In a 25 mile radius before I ordered online.	-1
This yarn is very coarse. It was not nice to work with. The colors are play, but I hated crocheting with this.	-1
Guess need to know the ounces on yard as I paid 7 for this and can get it at Walmart for 2.69 Not ever going to get yarn online again	-1
Working with this yarn on plastic canvas is not recommended as it broke apart to easily and shredded apart to easy	-1
Since when did Amazon become the yarn police? I was only allowed to buy four skeins when it says there are 19 available. Now as a long-term Prime member not only do I have to spend 25 $ , I am limited to how many I can buy. It's like saying you can only buy two cups of flour when you need four. While I am at it...Amazon use to always have the best prices but not anym ore. I doubt I will renew my Prime Membership	-1
I did not like this yarn.  It was a very scratchy yarn and the colors were much duller than the picture (think army green instead of grass/tree green).	-1
I was disappointed in my purchase.  The yarn was priced to imply that it was 14 oz skeins, but was really only 7 oz.  Also, the yarn has many knots in it, making it unusable at times.	-1
It really took a long time to get here. Found what we needed at a local store to complete the project.	-1
Wrong item description! It is stated that it is 364 yards and when received it the yarn is 244 yard. This is overpriced for the yardage. WalMart has 244 yards for $2.50	-1
This is another to good to believe. they give you  a great price on the product but pad the shipping cost pretty badly. and trying to get a proper refund is a laugh so buyers beware. I haven't been able to place a claim because the system is not working on this one.	-1
I triple checked the numbers before I ordered, and they didn't match what I had.  I made due, but was unhappy.	-1
The painted desert yarn  is very thin and texture is rough i have used red heart many years and haven't had this problem	-1
When I purchased these two skeins of yarn I was under the impression that the price stated was for the 14 oz size per skein not the 7 oz for the same price.  I was excited that there would be no fee for shipping and handling but upon receiving the product I was disappointed to get something that I could go to Wal-mart for a pay only $2.77/skein.	-1
I can't believe this is even made. It is the most unpleasant feeling yarn I've ever felt. A total waste.	-1
If you want a soft green color do not buy this! This is a bright green color, not at all like the picture shows!	-1
The pumpkin color is more tangerine then what is shown in the preview.  Would be nice if they had a more true to color picture.	-1
The yarn itself is great, and exactly what I use (I use about 20 skeins of Mexicana a year for lanyards), but the description for what I bought said 364 yards. The skeins I got were only 244 yards. I went back and looked at the image after my order came in, and the picture does show 244 yards, but I trusted the description when I ordered. I didn't mind paying 7.87 for 2 of the 364 yard skeins, but that is pretty high for 2 of the 244 yard ones.	-1
I have used a LOT of RED HEART yarn over the years but never have I used anything this stiff and unyielding. I bought this because I thought it was pretty. I knew I wanted to use it, but wasn't quite sure what I wanted to make. I ended up using it to crochet 5 squares of a 25 square blanket. This was the most difficult yarn I've ever worked with. On the bright side, my blanket is beautiful...	-1
I have been knitting for a long time and have always liked Red Heart yarn. My favorite source for yarn went out of business and I was delighted to find Red Heart on Amazon. Thank you.	-1
Amazon claims this measures 364 yards in length. When I got the yarn it said right on the package 244 yards. If I didn't need the yarn to complete a project I would return it. It is completely overpriced for what you get.	-1
The price for this product was much more than I would have paid in the store, but I needed it and could not find in any stores.  The color was slightly different although they were both light gray.  I will definitely make sure that I have enough of the necessary color before I start another project.	-1
The picture is totaly differant than what I received, will have to use it due have project to complete now. Love Red Heart products but the picture does not correspond with the actual product.	-1
The final product was very scratchy.  The yarn had several tie-on knots.  Two of them were only a few yards apart.	-1
I purchased this on line because it advertised the skein was 364 yards of yarn, not 244 yards. Had I known it was only 244 yards I could have purchased this at my local yarn shop for $2.99 each. Instead I paid over $6.00 each. Falsely advertised the skein was bigger than it actually is.	-1
Color is a Bright Pumpkin Orange NOT golden yellow as shown. The color recieved is a nice orange for pumpkins and pumpkin hats so I did not return.	-1
I only rated this 2 stars for the price. I just bought the same yarn. Same weight and length at Walmart for 2.77. That's half of the price they have it on here.	-1
Right color but not good to use when making stocking caps as product does not give. It also takes quite a bit more as this yarn is very thin!!!!!	-1
The campaign for safe cosmetics published a study in 2009 on lead, nickel, cobalt and chromium in childrens' facepaint kits. You can easily google it and find it. They report Snazaroo's had the highest lead content of the 10 facepaint kits they tested, 0.56 parts per million (page 8 of their report). This is 5.6 times higher than the maximum amount of lead allowed in candy, 0.10 parts per million, and almost 40 times the maximum allowed in water, 0.015 ppm (pl. 13).	-1

Not worth it.	-1
Not what I was hoping for.  When I finished a face painting design I tried to apply some of this to add shimmer but it's very wet and removed paint instead of just sticking to the top.  If I add some AROUND the painted areas on dry plain skin it did ok.	-1
a ok product,looks nice	-1
Not quite what I was expecting. The coloring in the picture did not match what I received. My feathers are not as near as pretty as shown.	-1
Doesn't hold fabric well as the plastic is smooth and it slides. Can't get it tight enough to keep what I am embroidering on taut.	-1
Stencils are flimsy in that if you try to paint in them the color runs everywhere even with pressure. Maybe would work with markers or to trace.. but that's it!	-1
I love Susan Bates crochet hooks so when I got these and tried using them I was really quite disappointed.  The yarn catches on them so much that these hooks are useless to me.  Even though the plastic material is smooth you would think that there are little burrs sticking out.  I thought about using furniture polish as someone suggested to me to make the hooks slick but that would just transfer over to the yarn. They were very inexpensive so I can't complain too much but if I could help someone I definitely suggest to get the metal ones.	-1
didnt work for me really, i was hoping for everything to crackly up and whola rustic city, but no:((	-1
This medium does NOT crackle under any conditions.  I tried everything and could not get it to work.	-1
Doesn't work. Followed instructions but no crackle finish.	-1
I have used many different crackle mediums over the years and this is definitely the worst.  In fact I once did a 13' x 13' library, with floor to ceiling bookshelves on all sides, with a crackle finish.  I let this product dry overnight - about 12 hours.  When I put the topcoat on it ran on any surface that wasn't horizontal and the horizontal surfaces look more marbled than crackled.  It's a given that all crackle mediums are finicky but this one is impossible.  I am getting ready for a craft show tomorrow and my display case is ruined.  Wish I could get my money back or had started a month ago so I would have time to sand this all down and repaint.  Very frustrating.	-1
broke and bend and do not catch nicely.	-1
The wheel I received was totally smooth, not serrated. It doesn't work for marking very well as a result. The packaging did label it as "serrated", so I am not sure if this was a fluke by the manufacturer, or if the supplier is trying offload a bunch of seconds.	-1
The larger hooks are ok but the smaller ones bent easily. Flimsy like disposable plastic cutlery, maybe at this price they are meant to be disposable. The size markings are terribly hard to see. The hook material doesn't glide smoothly, feel screetchy working on the yarn. I'm ordering the aluminium hooks set to replace it.	-1
I am a big fan of Susan Bates hooks but not of these.  These are too flimsy. Hook part is stiff enough but the handle flexes too much. I won't be able to use these but aren't worth returning. Save your money and get the metal ones instead.	-1
too small	-1
I sewed a pair of overalls for my little grandson, and I was using these around the area where you unsnap for diaper changes. These snaps do not have much grip to them. I ended up taking them all off and creating a better solution than those snaps.	-1
Product came with missing pair	-1
all of them are too small for me and not worth my trouble returning. I did a search for large sew on snaps and this came up. I thought the large would be size 3 which is what I also searched for.	-1
This needle was recommended as a 'must have' for making Swedish weave/huck embroidery afghans using monk's cloth.  While it's length does save some time in stitching long pattern 'runs,' I feel that the size of the head is too large for the floats.  It does go through, but not smoothly.  I much prefer the smaller tapestry needle that I've been using.	-1
this is okay if you are using two strands of worsted weight yarn. It is not effective for smaller gauge looms with one strand. I'll stick to my straw.	-1
This tool works OK with 1 or maybe 2 strands of thinner wool, but the hole is too small for bucl or chunky yarn to move freely through the tool. The small opening also makes it difficult to thread. A McDonald's straw works way better for me, I cut it in half and a crochet hook fits in it so it's easy to thread. I would not buy these again.	-1
So short you may as well use your fingers! Total disappointment and a huge waste of money :( made my own from ballpoint stick pens - faster , easier and more comfortable to hold!	-1
I was using the stencil area where it i the strip of leaves, and one of the leaves fell apart so it ended up looking bad after stenciling	-1
I was very disappointed with this purchase. The quality was below average and not representative of the picture. I've purchased lobster clasps of superior quality for less than what these cost. Additionally, these are very small and difficult to open and close. Don't waste your green on these!	-1
I ordered this one because it said "Lifetime". It is very thin and cheaply made. When we finally went into town (2 hrs away)I saw this at JoAnn's for $1.36. The 2 stars is for the product and description not the price since it was delivered and on time.	-1
I can barely get an inch of careful hand stitches before the thread separates,tangles, and then breaks off. Useless. I had to end up buying a totally different brand of thread. Don't bother with this.	-1
This stencil was very hard to work with as it is made of a very thin peace of plastic.	-1
Very, very thin. Teachers do not buy for students.	-1
If you need small pins this is fine, there is only 2 medium sized,  but no big ones. I got gyped	-1
This looks like the cheapest hoop I have ever seen.  It came with no means to tighten the outside hoop. I don't know if the screw was broken or if it is missing. Either way - it does not function.  It is not worth the shipping costs to return it. Live and learn.  You get what you pay for. I am greatly disappointed with this and will thus never buy another Susan Bates product again.	-1
These pins were too thick for quilting. I wanted a bigger pin then 1.5, yes, they are bigger, but wow, so thick. Pass on these for pin basting if you quilt.	-1
I ordered two packages of these to use for the days I was bloated or for bras I wanted to wear but had outgrown.  They come off the bra occasionally and show a "bulge" through knit and tighter-fitting cloth shirts.  I decided I will have to pay for new bras in the future as although they are inexpensive, they have more cons than pros!!	-1
Cute for decorations; but don't ring or make any noise except rattling.  Bad buy.  Need tiny bells; but maybe they don't even exist.  I'll buy squeakers instead..	-1
I wanted to use it for limo clay, but it seems to be too soft for this kind of tools.	-1
This item is useful but the quality may need to be adjusted.  the metal pieces come off the wood fairly easy.  I had to secure them myself.	-1
Not very useful for polymer clay	-1
the product might be good, however, it never arrived.	-1
The old saying that you get what you pay for is true. These are cheap because they're cheaply made. The smallest hole cutter--the size I really needed--is the one is isn't quite true. The metal part is not perfectly centered in the wooden handle, making it hard to cut a perfect circle. I've worked out a way to grasp the metal part instead of the handle to cut holes more cleanly. Compared to other hole cutters, the angle of the cutting portion is not as steep, making it harder to clean out the clay that invariably gets stuck.	-1
The product image looks great, but in reality, this embosser-puncher didn't produce.  The cutter feature sometimes unexpectedly "ate" my paper on the first cut and the embosser left random dimples around the pattern that made it look sloppy.  Great concept though, but failed to produce.	-1
While the pages are beautiful, the smell is atrocious!  I even tried to put the sheets in a box with a container of baking soda to absorb the smell, but no dice.  I have to keep these locked up, because I could smell them when I walked in my house, and they were in the back bedroom!  I did use some, for small projects, and the smell wasn't so prominent.  I wish I could figure out how to eliminate the smell completely, though.  As pretty as the pages are, until the smelly issue is addressed, I CANNOT recommend this product.	-1
What can I say? Thin colored paper to add accent to things.	-1
overpriced and lacking in quality and quantity	-1
Doesn't really feel like tissue paper.  More like thicker paper with a plastic finish.	-1
Just get it at the dollar store. Its easier and the same quality.	-1
Nice for wrapping small Christmas gifts.	-1
Same thing as the other people who wrote reviews.  Description is TOTALLY misleading.  I am returning it for a refund- it's just 1 pack with 10 sheets!  Geez!  It's tissue paper - nothing special.  Why the ridiculous price????	-1
WOULD NOT SPRAY OUT!	-1
Good handles	-1
Bad... Just bad. Bad metal badly made and also came rusted.	-1
I purchased these couple years ago and gave it away and  buy again and set was competley different, the v-gouch is more like a w than v, it is very wide, not pleased with it, i cant use it, have to buy a v- gouch again and they are longer so not the same.	-1
sorry this time, Amazon!  But will be returning!  Cheap metal and feel they won't last long .	-1
What you would expect for the price. Had to re-profile the cutting edges and then would not hold an edge. My mistake.	-1
Most the colors were pretty ugly.  BAD idea to buy sight unseen.  They show lovely colors... NAAAAAA	-1
Disappointing selection of colours and 2 were damaged. Would love to send the pictures but not sure how	-1
These were the WORST stoes that i have ever seen. First of all, 2 out of 7 were broken on arrival. Not chipped or cracked but Broken into many pieces. Second of all, i have yet to see such POOR QUALITY in all the stones that i have purchased on Amazon or Ebay. The colors were hideous, sickly yellows and horrible white and oranges-how will i make a jewelry piece that i could sell with such poor quality stones. They were very brittle, and only 4 had been drilled for use in a necklace. I did not find a single one that i felt was mediocre enough to use on the jewelry i made. The few that have not completely broken i have saved to remind me of the incompetence of your companies wares and to worn others to NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM YOU! So you may have taken a few dollars from me, but the bad name and reputation that i will be passing along will surely see to it that you will be out of business very soon. I am a respected person in my art form and i do not take kindly to the kind of scemes that you chose to perpetrate on me. I will do everything in my power to see you out of business, including my uncle who works for EBAY and assured me of the quality in the first place. I would recommend that you do not get too comfortable with your company, as i do not feel it will be around much longer. With Contempt and Disrespect, Kimberly Ann Walline	-1
Smaller than expected and 3 were broken.	-1
All dark and dreary, 2 of 6 have enough color/variation that I can make pendants from if the necklace cord and wrap are very colorful. 3 it will be luck if I can convince someone to buy.  Non of mine where worth buying for resell.  Note customers won't be wearing these under bright spot lights to bring out the colors. Barely get two to show color in the window, but not clear enough in center for even window art.	-1
Came broken in many pieces. *WARNING* *DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY*	-1
These needles are not sharp and several of them have broken on me. Very poor packaging as well.	-1
too small - eye -hard to thread	-1
Thread keeps sliding out from the top of the needle.	-1
I gave these needles a 2 star because I was very disappointed in the thickness of them.  I needed some large eye needles (and if these could have been thicker, they would have been much better).  These needles are too thin and hard to hold on to.  What I found the most while I was shopping for large eye needles was blunt end and I needed the sharp ones....hence the reason I bought these.  I doubt they'll ever be used and I can't send them back because they are out of their original package.	-1
Came to me completely destroyed, bottle open, all over inside of box. Wasn't even enough left to scrape up and put in a teaspoon.	-1
Not at all pleased with this product.  There are little globs of goo in it that don't dissolve when even when mixing.  It's very slow drying (24 hours recommended between coats) and all in all a Big disappointment. Wouldn't recommend this product.	-1
I can't believe I wasted 10 minuets of my life with this ridiculous thing! It seemed like a nice little to project to relax with at the end of the day. This was the most irritating "masterpiece" ever! First of all, the directions are a mess in the little pamphlet, I didn't know where to begin. It makes is seem like a clear coat goes down first because they refer to the paint as "color glaze"... it's just super cheap, thin, sort-of acrylic paint. It instructs you to gently SCRUB the color into the AREAS of the gray scale canvas. What? The paint brushes included are the size of kindergarteners brushes, make out of something like brittle horse hair that falls out and breaks off all over the picture.  This whole thing is just scrubbing and scraping really thin cheap paint over a shadow of an image, so you can see through the paint, and see the weird little picture under it. This is supposed to look good? Seriously, just buy a paint by number, they look fantastic compared to this!	-1

The glue works, but trying to put the plastic wire back into the hypo needle is a nightmare.  The glue oozes out of the hypo so you can't see where to put the plastic wire.  I threw it away in frustration after using only 15% of the glue.  There are too many glue products out there that are easier to deal with for me to waste so much time on something this difficult to cap.	-1
Works well but dribbles... cannot insert sealer pin when done using	-1
This I bought because of the reviews, I have to say it is the worst smelling basting spray I have ever used, it has butane in it, and that is what you smell, awful, and it does not stick the fabric together very well, will not buy again	-1
The product is fine. But when it was delivered,  I got woke up. Never again!	-1
Only one angle	-1
Pretty terrible to be honest. Hold is weak and the nozzle is poor.	-1
Ink was runny and didn't work with any stamps I had. Very disappointing	-1
takes FOREVER to dry ... ughhhh  ink all over  gross !!!  not happy at all  idk if it said  long drying time in the description but if so i missed it and it is just making a total mess out of what i needed it for  (thank you cards)	-1
Okay color... BUT THE INK STAYS TACKY/SMEARS FOR MORE THAN 24 HOURS!!!!	-1
I followed the directions exactly and the dye did not hold. The shirt ended up very faded.	-1
I bought this because of the pigment and archival quality to stamp the back of trading cards and oh my goodness its awful with its constant smudging, and the lid does not secure well but worst is that the text stamp I have it does NOT stamp cleanly. You can't even read the text at all from the stamp I will be switching back to STAYZON ink pad as it works much better.	-1
This ink simply does not dry. I've tried it on printer paper, I've tried it on craft paper... it simply doesn't dry. I purchased this in two colors, Black and Cranberry and both are the same and never seem to dry! Even after two hours, the craft paper I stamped still smudged and almost rubbed clean off. This is a waste of money and a waste of whatever you try to stamp.	-1
Arrived in a crushed box. leaking the sand.  About 3/4 of the bag was already gone when it arrived.	-1
I do not think this is walnut, in fact I am sure it is not	-1
This box certainly did not live up to expectations.  I had been planning on using it as a gift, but after putting two coats of white paint on it, the seams cracked in the lid and bottom box, and now it won't close.  I'm already on a deadline, and now I need to see if I can find another box to use for my project.  Very disappointed.	-1
Ive tried to use this glue over and over for years now. I love it's precision tip and small nozzle. I hate it at the same time. The cap has a stick in it to help keep the glue from clogging. While that's great and all, and it actually seems to work, I have yet to figure out how to keep the tube itself from gooping up. The tube becomes unusable about half way through and I notice it takes a lot of glue and effort to get any out.  It's almost like the glue begins to solidify inside the tube, making it virtually pointless to use. I've quit using this product more times than I can count, but keep returning when I see a suggestion for a project online, recommends using it. I'm beginning to think this product is being used because there isn't too much out there like it. (the precision nozzle, the glue itself is ok, not better or worse than some other well known products. )  I only recommend this glue if you plan on gluing a lot of items all at once. Then the glue can't get goopy inside the tube and you'll have more control over its application. Currently I couldn't glue a single stone without leaving glue streaks all over the place around the stone.  As for it sticking to fingers. I disagree with other posters. Maybe they are gluing projects for personal use or not for sale, but I know it does stick to fingers. I found that it isn't obvious or annoying though. Currently my finger tips on my right hand are coated with it. I tried the old 'rub it off' method when it was wet(ter), that only spread it out and made a fine layer. It's still there, just not as obvious or intrusive as other glues on finger tips.  After the little bit I can get out of my no more than half way used tube, I'm officially quitting this product. I do not recommend for use sparingly.  And will not recommend to fellow Jewelers or artists.	-1
turned yellow	-1
Totally disappointed. Used this  product one time to gloss a polymer clay bracelet . Put it on the shelf for a couple of weeks and when I went to use it again it changed consistency. Was a big blob of geletin like glue. Totally unusable. Will not buy again!	-1
Love this product	-1
Not the same color as presented	-1
This is not the same color as what you get in real life! It's actually a frosty green color!	-1
This ink pad was very dry and I contacted amazon, who took care of the problem. Thank you amazon.	-1
I really hate leaving negative reviews, but in this case I just have to do so.  This tray went back a.s.a.p.  It was so poorly made.  The bottom was falling off, likely because of the use of lousy staples and no wood glue.  The staples were not in correctly. The bottom didn't appear to be the same wood as the rest of the tray, either.	-1
I bought this sand to cover my indoor houseplants soil to keep out the little flies (they breed in wet topsoil). While it worked for the flies, the white sand quicky turned a lemon yellow, which is really awful looking. Not sure what did it but i'm going to have to scrap all this lemon sand out and start over. I wanted white sand, not yellow.	-1
only get 2-3 uses and sold for a lot more money in this form vs for other applications.	-1
Brush came with the bristles bent backwards in the protective cover.	-1
I am really horrified at the quality of these brushes. I ordered the #1 and #2 size. The attached photo is after ONE use, and I am a gentle painter. I was using them with Winsor Newton watercolors. As you can see, they are horribly split and frayed. My WN Cotman brushes are much better. I am so confused as to the poor quality...did I receive fakes? Conditioning did not help. I can't get them back to any sort of point after just one gentle use. Buyer beware.	-1
PROS:  (1) UNIQUE SIZE: The dimensions on this box are rather unique. I looked for some time for a box of this size, and wasn't really able to find these exact size specifications. Specifically, the exterior dimensions of the box is 12 inches long, 9 inches wide, and 3.75 inches deep. The interior dimensions of the box is 11 inches long, 8 inches wide, and 2.75 inches deep. ___________________________________ CONS:  (1) PLYWOOD: In the product photos (and from the seller's description), this box from the photos appears to be higher quality or at least a non-plywood construction. However, its simply textured plywood (i.e., walnut plywood). Since this box is plywood, it has unsightly blemishes in the wood. These blemishes appear more pronounced when the box is stained. (Please see the photos below to see the blemish that I am describing).  (2) SPLITTING CORNERS: When I stained the box, the corners of the box split because they were only glued together. Generally boxes are held together using corner joints. I have never seen a professionally sold box that was simply glued together on all sides. Because of this unprofessional construction, the box split on the corners once it was stained. Also, glue doesn't stain--so the edges of the box appear white.  (3) UNEVEN HINGING: The box, likely as a result of the splitting corners, does not close evenly. Essentially, the hinges appear to be off by about 1/4 of an inch.  (3) WEIGHT: The box is extremely light weight because its made of plywood. Since I was hoping for a sturdy box that I could store a game in, the boxes weight posed a real issue. _______________________________________ OVERALL: This box may be great if your intent is to paint it because the paint may provide re-enforcement to the glued together corners. However, if you intend to stain the wood or leave it untreated, I suggest you look elsewhere. The box is cheap plywood and I am sure you can find something better suited for your needs.	-1
Sadly, I must say the other reviews were correct, this stamp pad is not even close to being blue.  In truth, it is a lighter shade of algae-green.  Since it would be more of a bother to ship it back, I will figure out something to do with it, but it is very disappointing.	-1
First of all - Winsor & Newton is an excellent brand on every level, especially for the quality and presentation of their products. As a fine artist, my absolute favorite brush is a Winsor & Newton Series 7.  However, this seller is sending fake-outs, factory rejects, or something similar.  The #2 brush arrived, crushed, in an envelope. The hairs were splayed, the ferrule was bent, the handle was scratched up, and the tube that holds the brush was just taped at the ends, instead of having the end caps they normally come with. The hairs are the biggest problem, though. Even after using Masters brush soap to condition the splayed hairs, the brush is useless. Winsor & Newton pride themselves on the brushes holding a sharp point, but the hairs of this knockoff brush want nothing to do with each other, splayed out in every direction, and refusing to hold paint.  I will be ordering Winsor & Newton brushes again, but not from this seller.	-1
Awful.  I should have returned this guy.  Out of the packaging it was already split, but I thought my conditioner would get it into a nice point after reading so many good reviews.  I still used this brush all the time to justify its price, but it honestly works as well if not worse than my pack of 15 brushes I already owned for half the price.  Stay away.	-1
After everyone telling me "this is THE brush you need for miniatures", I bought one. What a waste of money. It's soft. Only slightly springier than camel hair and holds a tip just as poorly. I've spent two weeks conditioning the brush everyday with masters trying to lock into a nice tip. It can only hold a tip for about three strokes. I spend more time fiddling with the brush than painting.  The most expensive brush I own will now be regulated to the only thing it can do well. Drybrush.	-1
Really pretty unhappy with the brush.  Tended to split right away.  After talking with other painters, Winsor Newton 7's may have a quality control issue.  Some are very good, but some are just junk.  My offbrand cheap Walmart brushes were better.  I picked up a Rosemary & Co brush for about 1/2 the price and it was so, so, so much better.	-1
This company is rediculous. This is the second time Ive ordered series 7 brushes cus they are supposed to be the best. First order #1 round was splayed all to hell. Not fixable. Second order: all the sent were the tubes. WTF!!!! There weren't even any caps where maaaaybe the brushes fell out the corner. Shipping bag was totally sealed by the way. My recommendation order from an art supply company	-1
These brushes come very highly recommended, but my first one was not very good. I've only used it twice and I have loose hairs that won't go away and the brush is already forked. I'm no novice to painting miniatures, I made absolutely sure not to get paint in the ferrule. Extremely disappointed considered how much I paid for this brush.	-1
I should've returned the brush when it arrived with a splayed tip.  I was ignorant and thought that it just needed a little conditioning and it would be fixable.  After 3 months of constantly trying to get the point to hold a shape, I've given up all hope.  I have some other W&N brushes that don't have this issue, so I guess I just got a lemon.  BE WARNED that quality control is extremely shoddy.  If your brush arrives looking like this, RETURN IT IMMEDIATELY!	-1
Bought a size 00 for painting miniatures bristles are bent and do not hold to a point. I've got better brushes from a 10 pack for $8 than this single brush, supposedly the best, for $14. Absolute trash.	-1
I have always heard about how awesome these are for inking and watercolor, which are my two main uses for a brush. I usually buy my brushes when they go on sale for half off so at my local art store, a brush usually costs me about 5$. So when I finally broke down and spent the money on one of these I was pretty excited to see how it would perform. In one word "Terrible"! It is by far the worst brush I have ever used and DOES NOT hold a point at all. I spent more time trying to just get this brush to hold a decent point for inking than actually inking. So frustrating to have heard so many people praising the Series 7 as the best brush around and then come to find out a size zero brush is only good for blocking in sections of black and is useless for detailed line work, that makes no sense at all. I recommend that someone looking for a brush to ink with stay away from the Series 7.	-1
Good thing, but almost 1 month shipping time is way too long...	-1
los pelos de este pincel se abrieron rapidamente y no mantuvieron la forma. Hace tiempo que pinto y cuido materiales y me soprendio ver lo malos que me resultaron los Kolinsky, por el precio. They didn`t resist 2 uses, the tip lost its shape and the hairs were messy. I have been a painter all my life and I know how to take care of brushes, but for the price I would buy another brand. Won't buy this again.	-1
I bought this and then read the reviews, I liked the raised feature and it was inexpensive and right there on the shelf so I bought it.  Once I got it home and cut the cellophane wrapper off I was surprised to realize that it doesn't really close, it just sort of has a top that sits there.  Not at all air-tight.  So I asked the question here, and was told it should snap, but mine doesn't snap at all, so it's going to dry out fast--maybe.  Since I was here I read the reviews and noticed that lots of people have problems with this ink air drying.  Unlike anyone here, I had bought it to stamp polymer clay, so I didn't worry about it, I went ahead and stamped my project, and then figured I'd give it a day to dry.  Other things got in the way, and I finally got back to the project 12 days later, and without thinking, I swiped my finger across the ink to be sure it was dry--imagine my surprise, it was not!  My conclusion is that this stuff does not air dry.  If it did, it would come with more air-tight packaging.  I would think that it would only be good for projects where the moisture in the ink would actually be absorbed into the medium it's stamped onto.	-1
I want to ask people interested in sable brushes (no matter which brand) to please consider synthetic sable instead because the hair used in these brushes is gotten by extremely cruel means. Please research this for yourselves. Thank you.	-1
I've been painting for 18 years, and can say when you get a GOOD version of this brush type, it will be the best brush you've ever owned. However, of the last three purchases of this brush, two of them have been poorly made. A brush should not splay and fishtail on day-1 of use (and this is with highly diluted acrylic paints mind you). Due to the extremely poor quality control at Winsor & Newton, I will permanently be switching to the Raphael 8404 brush series.  If you opt to buy one of these brushes, be prepared to make returns until you receive one in good condition.	-1
This brush is brand new and useless. It does not hold a point and fans out almost immediately. I am not sure if these are genuine or not because I have other Series 7 and they have been solid for years. I am seriously disappointed and would NOT buy these again.	-1
Garbage. I'm not sure how winsor and newton series 7 quality can differ so much. I bought a size 8 from Amazon. It splits with varying degrees of water in it. I have da vinci (series 10, 11, 35) and they are BY FAR SUPERIOR and most importantly CONSISTENT. I'm returning my series 7 for another series 11 da vinci. I've noticed my escoda reserva splits, but only with lower degrees of water in the brush. When saturated it's perfect, but as the water is removed it splits. But my series 7 split literally sopping with water. When it was damp it looked like Albert Einstein. See photos of brush with varying levels of water and splitting.  With all this said, I do have a couple smaller  series 7 brushes that are fine - 0, 1, 2, 4 and 1/4 flat. But once you go above a 4 it's over. The 8 I bought from Amazon and the 10 I bought from Jerry's were both garbage and returned.  Do yourself a favor, get a da vinci. Their quality far exceeds series 7 but most importantly when you spend the money you will consistently get a great brush. Series 7 brushes of the modern era are just mass produced garbage, from a company resting on its laurels.	-1
This was bought for my Dad, who has been doing a LOT of the adult paint by number paintings lately.  I knew he would not spend this much for a brush and I wanted to get him a nice one since he is wearing out the ones that comes with the pictures and they often aren't small enough to do some of the thin line areas.  I had bought him a set for about half the price of this brush that had 00 brushes.  After hundreds of hours of painting they would no longer hold a point so I thought this would be a great surprise for him.  Boy was it a surprise he thought he had this great brush and in less than 5 minutes it started fuzzing up and he tried all the usual stuff but he could not get it back to a point.  He said if I reviewed it to give it a negative 5 stars.  Couldn't do that so it's getting a one star.  Hope this helps someone else from wasting their money.  Sad thing is his sister taught art for years and paints and twenty years ago bought a brush for $20 that she still uses so he knows a good one should last.	-1
Ok. I bought a size 2 and heard these were awesome brushes to ink with. Wrong. At least in my case. It doesn't keep a point at all! I bought the masters brush cleaner and didn't let ink into the ferrule and everything. So I went ahead and bought a size 1 thinking maybe the size 2 was just a dud. IT WON'T KEEP A POINT EITHER! don't waste your money.	-1
The #12 brush is very disappointing. Given the $220 cost and the reputation of Series 7, I had very high expectations. It maintains a sharp point with only the exact right amount of water, after just a couple of stokes it is spread to an unusable sharp for anything but washes - this is not what you buy a brush like this for. A good synthetic brush is a much smarter purchase.	-1
Will not hold a point. Fans out in use.  This vendor should not be aloud to sale on this sight.  This item is too expensive to not work.  This is supposedly one the best Kolinsky sables on the market. Hope no one else was this unfortunate	-1
This was broken when it got here.	-1
Color is just awful.	-1
I love FREDRIX panels, but the ones I ordered  were flawed at the corners,, and covering up would only made them worse.. If they hadnt had the flaws, GREAT panels//  had to return  / Really a shame, and I really don't like to write this review in a bad light, because they are a great company with great products!	-1
Without a doubt the worst brushes I've ever used.  Obviously seconds.	-1
Purchased both a size 1 and 000.    The size 1 likes to split after one stroke like a snakes tongue, and then after the second acts like its full of static electricy ( Hairs going everywhere).  Needless to say not happy with this brush at all.    The Size 000 on the other hand works really well.    Not sure why one is good the other is trash.  Have to wash and reshape it after 2 strokes.	-1
This brush only lasted through one model kit. I was not impressed one bit. Most of the hair has fallen out. I have a $4.00 chinese knock off that is way better than this. Would not recommend.	-1
The one on top is from Amazon, and the one the bottom is from dickblick. The quality sucks on the brushes. They won't hold a tip and they split down the middle. I bought two and both come out the same. I'm not sure it's the same manufacture but they look different.brushes. Next time i'll order from dickblick.	-1
It may just be my eye, or that I have never painted this kind of kit before, but I was totally unsatisfied with the results.  The  finished painting didn't look natural or even close to natural, the colors were off.  The instructions weren't exactly understandable, so I don't know where I went wrong.  I did keep the plastic tray and will use it when mixing colors for other kits.	-1

This is supposed to look good? Seriously, just buy a paint by number, they look fantastic compared to this!	-1
bad	-1
I hear this brush (singular) was created by a deposed Nigerian Prince. Really good value when you think about it....	-1
This is a scam listing attempting to make you believe you are ordering more than one brush, thus justifying the incredibly high cost.  Please note that you can order brushes for much cheaper from Winsor & Newton directly.	-1
The product listing uses the word 'brushes'...plural. The product photo show 'brushes'.....plural. I received a very fine 140 dollar brush....singular. Not happy.	-1
Wonder if I was ripped off here--No where does it say Kolinsky brushes except on the box.  The round 8 is already losing hairs andw hold a point.	-1
A great brush but I received it in poor quality. Tip was already ruined. Maybe I was unlucky.	-1
As a child, I grew up using liquid embroidery by the company Artex and we had a  fantastic time with those.  These are so lane in comparison.  I bought them to introduce this enjoyable pastime with two kids I spend a lot of time with.  When even a grown woman can't press these down hard enough to expel a decent stream of liquid, you can imagine how frustrating it was for the kids.  I do NOT recommend this product at all.	-1

Doesn't fit a dinner plate! It's too small for much more than a cup and small plate. It's really flimsy and not worth the money.	-1
I bought this thinking it would be at least the same quality as the stuff you can get at the craft store. It is not. It was rough all over, needed to be sanded heavily. It looks like they didn't even bother to finish cutting the pieces properly, just broke them when it was mostly separated. As for the interior of the tray, there was really nothing to be done there. It's rough, and the wood lifts and splinters. I was really disappointed by this.	-1
I bought this glue hoping it would do the trick for my lace. Before I even got a chance to test it, the lid popped off and the glue poured everywhere. I'm absolutely ticked to say the least.  I made sure the lid was on tight and still  with a gentle squeeze, it came right off. Big waste of money, thanks zip dry!	-1
