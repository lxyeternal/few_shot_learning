It's an all or nothing install. You can't change the install path if you want to partition your drive or use a SSD in combination with a hard disk(SSD for OS hard disk for apps). Very resource heavy,uses about 3 gigs of disk space for an install. Plus they jacked the price up by 5 to 10% over 2013.  Stick with 2013 until they get this one together or just skip it.	-1
Download didn't work even with Amazon tech help.  Enough said?	-1

Barf. And double barf on having to create a ms account to activate this crap.	-1
Works as expected.	1
Quirky, Some files open fine others don't. I would not buy this again.	-1
This is a rip off. I get a error message when I try to download it. WARNING TO ALL IT IS A CONTRIBUTION i COULD GIVE NO STAR IF IT WERE POSSIBLE.  I SEE NO WAY TO GET A REFUND.	-1
I'm not a hundred percent sure why a lot of people are having trouble with the downloads and executing the program period I have Windows 7 and I have no trouble downloading it nor do I have any trouble accessing it on my computer each of the four files open properly and I can create new files as well as open up my older files very easily.  The only trouble I may see in the future is if I decide to get rid of my laptop and want to actually put this program on a newer laptop I may have to get Windows involved.  Otherwise it's advertised for one computer and that's how I plan to use it.	1
Getting this installed via Amazon was a major headache because their invoice provided the wrong information.  What was listed as the Product Key was actually a Redemption Key which is used to get the Product Key.  I had to go through Microsoft's tech support to get my software installed which took nearly two hours to accomplish.  I was not happy and will never purchase Microsoft software from Amazon again.  I was moving up to Office 2016 from Office 2007 so it is a major change for me.  One thing I've noticed is that my old Office 2007 applications can still be used even after installing Office 2016.  Outlook 2007 is the only application that didn't work and had to be uninstalled.  This was a plus for me because I don't have the money to shell out for the full Office and I can still use Access 2007 without problems.  The only problem I had was Word 2016 couldn't handle one of my custom macros and my Quick Access Toolbars (QAT's) had to be recreated.  I use the QAT's so I don't have to search through the ribbon to find something.  I also haven't found a way to tag documents that have been opened like I could in the 2007.	1
works great on windows 10	1
I love it- because my wife quit complaining about needing WORD. It has a lot of changes from the old days that she is still getting used to though. EDIT: 1 year later Wife's PC crashed I was able to just go back to my AMAZON, and re download :)	1
It took me a while to review the software due to some initial bugs that caused my Mac to stop responding and maxed out the process. However, the manufacturer released a few bug fixes that addressed the major performance issues that resulted in a much better experience.  Computer Used with Dragon 5.0 for Mac  MacBook Pro Retina, early 2013, 13-inch Processor: 2.6 GHz Intel Core i5 Ram: 8 GB 1600 MHz DDR3 Operating System: Mac OS X 10.11.5  Overview of the Key Modes  Dictation Mode: Prior to the last update, the application would peg my processor and hang fairly often. I tried shutting down everything I could find running, but the app continued to use between 85 percent and 110 percent of processor and RAM. After the update, the processor worked between 40 percent and 55 percent of the total capacity. The drop in needed processor capacity was significant.  Voice fine tuning: I went through each of the voice ID tuning session that was available to try and improve the amount of content Dragon got correct. However, after multiple attempts using both the external microphone and a headset, the correct dictation rate never got beyond approximately 85 percent correct.  Number mode: This feature still has the most promise, but I was disappointed by the level of correct input until the release of the latest update. Prior to the latest update, I would dictate five to ten cells of data  then the application would either hang or place random numbers in the cells. After the last update, I was able to dictate one hundred cells of data with only a handful of errors. I did notice that the app was  sluggish when more than one workbook open at a time. The one issue that continues to appear deals with decimal points. Dragon 5.0 does not recognize the command to place a numeric decimal point well.  Transcription mode: This mode works well when you use recordings from a source repeatedly. However, if you work with unique sources each time it tends to have a low success rate. The accuracy level with unique voices was about 65 percent, but that was also 65 percent of the original report I did not have to type.  In the end, many of the shortcomings with the Dragon 5.0 software have been addressed and the software turned out to be quite useful.	1
I've used Dragon for a few years and this new edition, 5.0 for Mac, works fairly well. I'd give it a 95 percent accuracy rating -- which if fine because I just use it to dictate notes for me each evening. Basically it writes my journal.  I type at work all day and it's great just to sit back and just speak freely. I guess I am used to the voice commands and do them without thinking much about it. The process reminds me of an old movie or TV show where the secretary is taking dictation for the boss. I guess I feel a bit like Mr. Mooney -- however Dragon listens a bit better than Lucille Ball did on her show. :)	1
We found that it had a lot of difficulty understanding us - and we don't have that much of an accent!  Many of the words we found we were having to correct manually, and it seemed that it was a constant struggle to get it to perform at the same level we were used to with the PC version.  After a while, we just gave up on this particular package.  We still love and use our Windows-based version of Dragon, but the Mac version has quite a ways to go I think before it will be an equal player.	-1
This software actually works. . . BUT. . . There are a few things you need to be aware of.  First, you need a good headset.  It doesnt necessarily need to be an expensive one, but a good one. I like Plantronics, myself.  This does NOT work well with a built-in microphone.  Second, you need to speak CLEARLY.  If you mumble a lot. .. . if you say um a lot. . . . if you have a thick accent. . . . its going to be much more challenging to use this software.  Third, you have to give it time.  Yes, it works out-of-the-box, but it takes a bit of time for it to learn your voice.  If you throw-in the towel, after only using it for a day, then you're really not giving it a chance.  Ive used Dragon for Window with success.  This is the first time Ive tried the Mac version.  I know that some have had issues with past versions, but so far, I like this one just fine.  I still like the Windows version better, but thats really more of a personal preference.  Is this software perfect?  No.  I don't think the Windows version is perfect either.  But overall, it works for my needs.	1
After using Siri all day on my phone, I wanted the convenience of voice activation on my pc.  I tried Dragon over 10 years ago when it first came out and was less than impressed.  I'm loving this latest version!  It was easy to set up - it takes minutes to walk through the steps and you're ready to go!  You need to speak clearly when using and it has trouble recognizing unique words.  Dragon even automatically capitalizes obvious Proper Nouns like names.  I dictated a paragraph to Windows built-in speech recognition and compared it to the same paragraph read via Dragon and Dragon outperformed and had much less errors.  No Contest!  I have the software for MAC but the Windows version is compatible not only with IE and Chrome, the obvious, but Firefox as well!  I'm a huge fan of Firefox but not all software plays nicely with this outsider.  I am seriously considering purchasing the Windows version but the price is steep for the convenience.  I have the feeling that I am missing some functions as I'm not a techie but this software does an amazing job for my purposes (writing letters and speeches, Facebook posts, etc.)	1
I hadn't really explored the built-in Mac dictation functionality before Dragon, so can't compare.  But just the whole new time savings associated with being able to dictate and when multi-tasking (like ironing!), is pretty amazing.	1
I have never ever used any Dragon software before. I have been quite impressed with this software so far from Nuance Communications. I installed the software and flew from there. I didn't have to use the tutorial and figure it out from there, though one is available. Basic dictation is so easy to use, you literally install it, set it up, plug in a microphone and begin! I find this software to be pretty awesome. I was surprised how accurate it was on dictation. I've just been getting the hang of it, but, it is very easy. For isntance in order to end a sentence, just say, "period" or "question mark!" I didn't have to look that up, it just came naturally. I can see that this will be very helpful for me in writing stories and such. There is also an app that can be synched with the new Dragon Anywhere Mobile App, but I have not used this. The possibilities are pretty impressive. I am very, very happy with this software!	1
Hard to use, takes a LOT of time to set up before it works in any fashion that is usable. However, tech support is quick, helpful, and nice. One you complete the gauntlet of setting it up, it's not bad. But still, I've watched too much sci fi to expect less than a perfect translation.	1
For me this is an upgrade, as I used a much earlier version of Dragon.  Setup was simple, with a quick audio test and an update to setup the user profile.  I love the option to either do dictation or transcriptions. I haven't tried the transcription feature yet, but I will. I found the accuracy to be excellent, especially after going through a round of training. It takes a little getting used to to get Dragon to recognize when you do PAUSE-punctuation, because you normally don't speak like that. However, after using it for a little while it becomes second nature.  I am using it now for the first draft of my book, and I am finding that it is really great for getting the words out onto (electronic) paper.	1
No problems at all.  I have had dragon for mac and dragon for PC.  I got this product for free -- and probably wouldn't have bought it, because the older versions worked, but were klunky. This is a better version, and I use it on my desktop MAC.  I took off my headphones and set them on the desk, had a phone conversation on my cell -- ooops, my whole conversation was transcribed! It works well, no problems.  I only use it to "write text" into word; I find it easier to just point and click to do other things.  No complaints, even with the Mac version.  It is worth the purchase.	1
I use Dragon Naturally Speaking on my Window desktop so I decided to give the new version of Dictate a try. It installs and runs in the background like a service.  Make sure you update to  Dragon 5 for Mac version 5.0.4 released in December.  In Word is does a decent job of dictation which is my primary use but it still produces extra spaces and seems to forget the mic now and then.	1
Dragon for Mac is incredibly easy to use, and quite intuitive. In fact, I am dictating this into my MacBook Pro which is running Mac OS 10.9, and it is working flawlessly. Dragon is easy to use right out of the box with a simple tutorial, or simply open a document or an application and go to work.  Is a list of commands built in, and with the exception of knowing how to spell my last name, it's flew through the first thing I was writing 99% right. That 1% was the spelling of my last name, by the way. I'll figure out how to program that shortly, but interestingly, I opened a Ted.com speech and began to record it. This is new territory! Imagine being able to capture a television news program, or something that you need to keep as text. Well, here I am doing just that.  The commands are easy to learn, and the tutorial takes just a couple of minutes, even for a goof like me. I'm impressed.  Dragon can be used to open an application, open document, and speak all manner of commands.  Dragon has already surpassed what I expected to do for me. This is just freaking amazing!  Oh, by the way; one caveat.  Make sure that you adjust the volume so that it understands your commands and words clearly or else you may find odd things flying through there.  Outside of that, have a blast!  Dragon is worth every penny.	1
If version 4 was 3 stars, version 5 would deserve none.  There is no way to correct your mistakes.  It simply does not select dictated text to provide correction options and to learn from the mistakes.  That simple.  It really does not do a bad job at speech recognition itself and the provided vocabulary is of a really high quality.  However, its usability sucks big time because of its poor interface and usability issues.  It has tremendous potential otherwise.  Maybe the developers will get a clue by trying to use the software themselves.  If you would be happy to just dictate, ignore all of your mistakes and correct them at the end, then the current incarnation might serve you well (version 5.0.04, build 16361).  However, detecting the mistakes will not always be easy (spell checkers will not detect correctly spelled nonsense).	-1
If you're a writer, this is a godsend. You can just install this and create a few shortcuts so that you can insert common grammatical elements like a comma followed by a space and an open quote and then a period and a closequote and you are off to the races.  It's just so nice to be able to just leave the keyboard alone for a few minutes every now and again.  Installation was easy and it works exactly as advertised.  It understands my speaking tone and inflection perfectly.  Couldn't be happier.	1
If you are used to Dragon naturally Speaking Windows version, then you will not like this product. As I understand the speech engine is same as Dragon Naturallyspeaking, but somehow, the performance does not transfer to the Mac version - and this is version 5!  Most software for Mac has better user interface compared to Windows software; but in Dragon's case, it is the other way round. Mac version is not user-friendly and difficult to use, installation is very tortuous, takes a long time, and instead of starting with your previous version 4.0 profile, prompts you to start all over again with a new profile. And then program repeatedly hangs up and freezes. Does not work well with Google Docs, Evernote and Microsoft Office on the web.  But I must say, compared to Dragon Dictate version 4.0, it is a little faster and the accuracy is better. The user experience is not any better though. Dragon microphone window is very obtrusive.  I have used Windows Dragon Naturallyspeaking for 15 years and to me Dragon for Mac 5 is difficult to use, buggy, slow to start and the correction accuracy does not come close to Windows version. If you use speech recognition for work or use extensively then I would recommend Windows Dragon Naturallyspeaking. For Mac, probably MacOS built in speech recognition is easier and faster to use than Dragon for Mac. Dragon Dictate 5.0 is definitely better than Dragon Dictate 4.0, faster and accurate but still very painful to use.	-1
used to love this...now they have gotten political and change their business practices based on demands by snowflakes who think more laws will prevent violence...well your activism can have a negative effect as well...	-1
I started with Norton 360 which in turn  became this product. Though it does not due everything that I liked 360 for, once it is installed, you can stop worrying. That's what I truly value. I do use other products in addition, but this is my mainstay for protection from the outside.	1
Been using Norton since Peter Norton invented it for a MAC. Have no hackers or malware on my PC	1
I like Norton Security products, but shop CAREFULLY!  This product, Norton Security Standard for only 1 Device, is often more expensive than the other version than&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Norton-Security-Deluxe-for-5-Devices/dp/B015724OVG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Norton Security Deluxe for 5 Devices</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Norton-Security-Premium-for-10-Devices/dp/B015724RQI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Norton Security Premium for 10 Devices</a>.  Features can be compared in the chart provided by Norton in the product listing and frequently with Norton more ends up costing less which is one crazy pricing strategy.  Also, when your year is coming up it's usually less expensive to buy the new version here on Amazon than renew the one already installed!  With Norton it can really pay to comparison shop carefully. Often you can get a much more capable product for less.	1
The deals that include 5 or 10 computers (or devices) are a much cheaper and wiser buy. Norton's policy for when you buy a multi-device product is that the subscription time for all devices--whether you installed or activated it in another device or not--begins to count on the day the first one is activated. So time runs out on all available subscriptions at the same time and not by the date on which you install it on another device.  Unfortunately, I already have all my other devices covered with one of those and had one solitary laptop that needed protection so I had to go with this one.	1
item as seller described	1
The product does as expected however when a software company gets involved in politics and does not support a constitutional amendment I will not buy again.	-1
I have used Norton for many years...and I have never had a problem with it.	1
Working well so far.  I moved away from Kaspersky for several reasons...price, reports of hacking, etc.  Unlike Kaspersky, Norton installs easily and has minimal impact on system resources.  With Norton I can continue working with minimal impact.  I gave Norton 4 stars only because I have been using it for a short time.  Perhaps after a few months use it will earn its wings.	1
I bought this as a renewal license for my iMac and our Android phones.  I had Symantec tech support "install" it for me to ensure I didn't lose any days bridging my current subscription into this one.	1
Norton is a great security tool..	1
I helped an older lady buy this since I recommend Norton to everyone I help with computers.  The only issue is that when it comes time to renew I either have to help them renew or they go on the auto renewal program with Symantec.  The problem is that auto renewal is usually much more expensive than just finding and buying it online or on sale locally and using that product key.	1
I have used several different virus protection products over the last 5 years or so. These have included McAfee, Avast (both free and premium), and, most recently, Kaspersky. I haven't used a Norton product for probably about 10 years or so. I am so happy that I decided to switch up this year, as I was not happy with both McAfee and Kaspersky in the last few years because they both really bogged down my machines and made them run slow. They both had a lot of unwanted "features" that didn't even work correctly (such as functions that keep your other software "up to date"--forget it--neither of them could figure out when my browsers and other software were up to date and I kept getting blasted with bogus warnings!).  My problem with Avast was that the free version didn't catch all the malware, and the premium version also bogged my system down. Plus, I had to go through hoops just to cancel "automatic" renewal with Avast. It was a mess.  I am so happy with Norton. They really run a very, very thorough full scan. The most thorough out of all the other products mentioned above. Their software does not slow down my system at all. This product was easy to install, and runs like a dream. I highly recommend this product for complete computer security.	1
I'm an extreme Internet user, business and personal, and I've used Norton for years with absolutely no security instances. One of the few Internet tools that I count on to do what I expect.	1
good	1
Good overall protection for your PCs. Price is reasonable.	1
This product is a no-brainer. I have used Norton consistently for the last 10 years and it's the only product (I've used MacAfee, Kapersky and others), that has kept my PCs--and now phone and tablets--free from viruses. The best!	1
Download went smoothly. Product is excellent as all Norton products are!	1
Works eally  well and you feel alot safer using the web. Bob	1
Easy installation, so far on 3 of 5 devices.  Norton does a good job of keeping current, so I expect the same good performance from this copy as I had from last year's copy.  The PC overhead is fairly low both in CPU and memory usage.	1
September 17, 2017 Was able to uninstall and reinstall. It has gotten WORSE. Now Norton Security uses 83%-91% of my CPU. Has completely choked up the computer.  September 14, 2017 I can't uninstall it! It gets stuck on the screen " preparing to uninstall" Said it would take two minutes to do so. It is been over 20 minutes! Norton is like a bad cancer you can't get rid of. And I'm supposed to trust this incompetent bunch of morons for my computer's security? *** I can't wait until this subscription expires so I can switch to another app. I clicked TaskManager to learn that 87% of my CPU is being used on "Norton security" What on earth is it doing? Nothing else can run. I thought it was temporary.  One evening I decided to let Norton security run all night hoping the CPU gluttony would end. Over 12 hours later and it was still running at over 80% CPU usage. What PC you can run with  Norton security eating up all it's CPU capacity. And I am to trust the security of my PC with such an incompetent app?	-1
Good	1
A good security suite with an easy to use menu.  I've been using Norton for several years and the software has improved significantly.  It is no longer a major drain on system resources although an exception exists with MS outlook, I especially appreciate the identification of safe web sites when you are using a search engine such as google.	1
Doesn't matter how far away your family is (some 2 hrs. away) this is a great buy for home and college students. Or a great gift for the grown up kids  just getting started on their own.	1
Works well	1
I have used Norton internet security for years and have been satisfied. I have had no problems with viruses.	1
Great price.	1
Ordered this got information to get it  downloaded from Norton.  After several attempts the download did not work and kept taking me to an old account I had.  I had a person "Chris C" come on line Chat and send me instructions and ask if any questions while I was typing the person terminated the chat and not to be heard from since.  About the 7th attempt I got an error message MK4647B and to call 844-383-8998, a person  called who did not speak English very well I told him so and he  told me "That's your problem."  I did make out that he wanted control of my computer - no way I told him he hung up.  Now someone who can't speak English want's control of my computer, I get at least 1 call like that a day!  The guy called back and rudely made some comments, I hung up on him.  Now I got no software and Amazon says no refunds in their add for software. Amazon has indicated that I will get credit for the purchase, but still will never buy Norton due to their customer service.	-1
I have used Norton products for two decades, and it has protected me well. It's cheaper to buy Norton Security from Amazon every year than it is to renew it from Norton at list price.	1
Received as expected	1
A needed software at a good price	1
I bought McAfee and used  the program for several years -- I actually have over  a couple hundred days left on my subscription.  Then I just lost confidence in their program.  I also tried Kaspersky and didn't like the program.  So now I have switched back to using Norton.	1
This has been my go-to security package for years.  Better each year.  You may want to opt for the version that provides backup in the cloud.  I use the Win10 backup to a dedicated external hard drive.  A network drive will work as well.  Recommended.	1
this company is greatest company i like Norton every year	1
I've used Norton for many years and have never been unhappy with the product. Very satisfied. I have it installed on all house-hold systems.	1
Works well.  Easy install. Must do a good job, never had a virus.	1
SO glad I found this on Amazon and didn't use Norton's auto renewal (at a much higher price). Installed fine and working just fine too! HINT - I bought it at the low price, but waited til my current software was about to expire in a day or two, before INSTALLING IT......so I get the full 365 days use of product before I need to renew again.	1
Seems to do the job. Have been using Norton for 5 years.	1
Great product	1
I have used Norton products for a long time. Bought the renewal cut and pasted the key on 3 computers. No problems. I Echo the advise of waiting till the day before to buy as you will lose whatever time is left on your original subscription	1
This is WAAAAY cheaper than buying it directly from Norton. Just keep in mind that you will lose any remaining days you have left if you are upgrading, so be sure to wait until just before it's about to expire. If you already have this and are just renewing, you don't have to install anything. Just click on "renew" at the bottom of your Norton window until you get to the screen that says something like "I have a keycode" and just enter the keycode you got in your email when you bought this.	1
Norton is still the best out there.  Easy to use, reliable, and fast, it just can't be beat.	1
I have been using Norton products for over a decade and this is another great product.	1
Norton Security Deluxe is the next generation of last year's Norton Security. This package is for 3 devices and at the time of this review is almost twice as much as getting it for&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Norton-Security-Deluxe-for-5-devices/dp/B015724OVG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Norton Security Deluxe for 5 devices</a>!! Go figure. Lesson: It pays to shop carefully for Norton products because often "more is less".  The biggest changes I see in this product from last year's Norton product is the branding on the box. To be sure there are incremental improvements. Norton Security Deluxe is like the older Norton Security without  Backup for 5 devices. I think this isn't too bad. I like my security software to evolve and improve more than radically change.  Norton Security Deluxe comes with licensing for 3 devices: Windows, Mac, IOS (iPhone/iPad) and Android. This should be enough for many families but maybe not all. You do not get the same features on all devices. I have Windows and IOS so I'll share my experience with these.  Buying a new subscription is less expensive than renewing an existing one. This is a long pattern with Norton products and buying new can save quite a bit.  Windows Setup:  **NOTE** If you have Norton Security (with or without backup) installed and you get this new subscription you will need to remove your device from the Norton control panel. In theory this will uninstall the older product from your computer (but not remove the IOS app for iPhone/iPad devices). In my case I had to manually uninstall Norton Security and reboot my computer before I could install the new subscription.  Installation is pushed out of the Norton account control panel. AFTER I removed old versions I was able to install Norton Security Deluxe very easily and without problems. I registered the product in my existing Norton account to activate 5 devices I could install. The download went smoothly and installation on my Windows 7 desktop was faster than with older CD based Norton products and similar to Norton Security. I did have to restart my computer.  I found it interesting that the installation branding and the control panel branding is still Norton Security reinforcing my perception of a simple evolution and mostly branding changes.  The controls in the GUI are simple and clear coming from Norton Security.  There are lots of on/off controls to customize how Norton works. There is a small gear icon for settings on the main screen of the GUI and many controls are hidden in there.  In operation on Windows I feel Norton Security is continues to be "noisy" than pre-2015 versions; I don't feel like I'm constantly being marketed to death. It has the same light impact on PC performance as the previous version.  This is a very good thing! The initial full scan came up clean which is no surprise ince I had last year's version installed before this one.  Application Compatibility Problems:  Unlike last year's version I have had no application compatibility problems. Last year's version has issues with VirtualBox. Good news!  Mobile Support:  The IOS app is better than before, but not all that much. It has anti-theft features. It does not include any virus protection. The Anti-Theft features include: 1) locate your phone: this placed my iPhone 6 a quarter mile away!! Also letting it run GPS in the background significantly reduced my battery life. 2) it can ring your phone: I can just dial the number. If the phone is locked it can't be answered... 3) it has a "scream" function: makes your iPhone put out an annoying siren like noise  If the "scream" actually sounded like a scream this app would at least have some entertainment value. If you have more devices than the 5 allowed in this product, don't waste one on an IOS device! The IOS does not do much for me and the GPS locator drained my battery. I have read that Android devices have better support against malware. I don't have an android device to try this out.  Conclusions:  This incarnation of Symantec's Norton line of retail/home security products is pretty good. It finds things other anti-virus software misses. It does not seem to slow things down noticeably. With this version I had no application problems which is an improvement. Mobile support for iPhone/iPad is poor. The user interface is simple and there are advanced controls available if you need them.  If you have last years (or older versions) of Norton installed, be sure to remove it from the Norton control panel and device before installing the new version. I could not find a way to move a device from an old subscription to a new one unless I renewed through the Norton site at a higher price. That's annoying.  Because it's a great product for home users, having to reinstall if you buy a new subscription (vs renewing) and the IOS app remains quite limited I'm giving Norton Security Deluxe 4 stars. It a good product with a few gotchas.	1
Using Norton Security products for many years. Current package of Security Deluxe for three devices via Amazon is a productive order for me. Buying direct from Norton occasionally created problems.	1
I used Norton Security System years ago, but switched after a couple of bad experiences. Now I'm hoping they have improved, and am trying them again. This version seems to be a little more aggressive however. I'm not sure I'll stay a customer past this year. Hard to maneuver around in for this 72 year old. For example, every time I want to do an Internet search it puts me into Amazon.com --- amazon.com doesn't have the information I need.	1
makes you feel safe online	1
I've been In to Computer's since 1993.  I've also had a "Hobby Job" fixing and consulting other peoples PC"s..  I've always have had a couple PC's,  Laptop's and Tablet at any given time..  I've used most of the most popular Antivirus Software...  I always come to the Conclusion that Symantec is the BEST...  It seems to always place In the Top Two in the PC Magazines that have  Annual Reviews of the top Security Suites.  I've been using Norton Security Deluxe, (Solely) for the last three years and I think it is the best..  It does like all Security Suites costs $45-65 dollars, but I've found that if I watch the price on Amazon or else ware,  I always get it for a sales price of under $30 for a 5+ license, before my current license expires..  At that price it comes out to paying $6 per PC per year which is about the lowest you can find for one of the major Security Suites....  And Once Again, ( In My Opinion) the BEST Security Suite...	1
Been using Norton for years. So far, no problems on my computer.	1
works ok	1
I have had years of good experience with Norton and continue to do so (knock on wood!)  I got this 5 device download even though I only had two devices I needed it for. The time (the yearly subscription to the service) begins to count when you initialize the first item. If, a few months later, you add another item, that item's subscription is based on the first item you initialized, not on when you installed it. Something to keep in mind.	1
I've used Norton ion all my PCs for years and I've never experienced a security breach and it doesn't appear to hinder the performance.	1
I had no information how to down load, my Norton was running out, had to go to Norton and they down loaded theirs. take charge off my account, I will not pay for something that I did not use.	-1
I do a lot of online shopping and my identity was breached several times in 2014 and 2015 when there was a major breach in several big box stores (I happened to have shopped online and in person at the very specific time dates). My credit card info was stolen and long story short I had to file a police report and a long process of disputing. Never Again. You can add this to 2 devices (including your smart phone) and I haven't taken full advantage.	1
Year after year, Norton provides very solid protection from online threats.  One feature that stands out is that is it very unintrusive:  You simply install it and pretty much forget it and let it work in the background.  This is very ideal to install for someone who isn't a computer expert, thus taking away most of the decision-making away from their fingertips.  It is barely a resource hog, although with the powerful machines these days, the days of anti-viruses slowing down your PCs are long over, unless you are still running an ancient system.  You no longer get a disc--You only get a code in the box!  Which makes sense because most of the time when you get a CD to install, chances are its already outdated and you have to install an update out of the gate.  This also keeps the environment cleaner.  Although why not just e-mail the code and not send me the box at this point?  You should also register this product on their website, just in case you need to re-install the CD, as the serial key is already stored there as well.  Power and simplicity--What else would you want from your Web security program?	1
Norton has always been the best and always will be in my opinion.  It was very easy to download this on my laptop and get it working. I haven't put it on my phone yet so that should be interesting. Will update my review once I have a chance to try it on my phone.	1
Works great!	1
These days, it has been more of a battle of the brand name in regards to finding the right security software protection with trying to protect and help your computer. As a result, many people have chosen to pick brand names over service. While I have at one point used brands like McAfee and Norton for protecting my computer from any viruses or spam. I did because it worked well back than. But now and then, it doesn't actually work as strongly as it has claimed to have worked, and that has left more of vulnerability than met the eye. That hasn't changed, and with Norton Security Deluxe, it has had the same flaws where it doesn't work strongly, and takes too much room on my computer hard drive to where it doesn't run as smoothly as my computer once did. As a result, I removed the program, and switched back to Bitdefender which worked more flawlessly on my computer, and didn't clutter it with any faults. Overall, if you really have the office space on your computer, than you'll really want to get more of a brand name like Norton. But if you really want a product that delivers well at protecting your computer, go somewhere else like Vipre or Bitdefender.  Price: D  Convenience & Setup: C-  Overall: D+	-1
Pretty decent security, has more features than I hope I ever need.  The only complaint I have is for some reason this June Norton added some features I don't plan on using with annoying popups reminding you it is there.  You just have to click on the don't ask me again option, but I would rather not be bothered to decline features that I didn't want to begin with. I hate popups, I don't want my security software to come with them.	1
I've been using Norton products for years, and this is a good program.  Although I've not had a problem myself,  professional reviewer's critique Norton for needing better zero day identification.  I will echo that comment in hopes of an avenue for improvement.	1
Norton Security Premium is the next generation of Norton Security with Backup for 10 devices. The biggest changes for me is the branding on the box. To be sure there are incremental improvements. Norton Security Deluxe is like the older Norton Security for 5 devices. I think this isn't too bad. I like my security software to evolve and improve more than radically change.  Norton Security Premium comes with licensing for 10 devices: Windows, Mac, IOS (iPhone/iPad) and Android. This should be enough for many families but maybe not all. You do not get the same features on all devices. I have Windows and IOS so I'll share my experience with these.  The cloud backup is something use for non-sensitive information only as backup. The identity protection and contact sharing is interesting but are not features I choose to use.  Buying a new subscription is less expensive than renewing an existing one. This is a long pattern with Norton products and buying new can save quite a bit.  Windows Setup (UPDATED): If you are using this to try to renew, DON'T follow the directions to activate the product at norton.com/setup. Instead login to your control panel and select renew. Select the option that lets you enter a key you already have (this one). Enter the key and if it is compatible with the version you are renewing this key will supersede the expiring key. One caution: wait till the old one is about to expire before plugging in the key so you don't lose your remaining subscription!  IF you followed the activation directions this will be installed as a separate product subscription and you will need to do the following:  **NOTE** If you have Norton Security (with or without backup) installed and you get this new subscription you may need to remove your device from the Norton control panel. In theory this will uninstall the older product from your computer (but not remove the IOS app for iPhone/iPad devices).  Installation is pushed out of the Norton account control panel. AFTER I removed old versions I was able to install Norton Security Premium very easily and without problems.

If the "scream" actually sounded like a scream this app would at least have some entertainment value. If you have more devices than the 10 allowed in this product, don't waste one on an IOS device! The IOS does not do much for me and the GPS locator drained my battery. I have read that Android devices have better support against malware. I don't have an android device to try this out.  Conclusions: If you have last years (or older versions) of Norton installed and want this to be a renewal, DON'T FOLLOW THE ACTIVATION DIRECTIONS!

It a good product with a few gotchas but worth navigating around them.	1
This is the latest revision of Norton Security. I've used several others including McAfee and Trend Micro but I think I'm standardizing on this brand out of familiarity. The Deluxe version handles 5 devices. I'd really suggest you use the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Norton-Security-Premium-10-Devices-Download-Code/dp/B015724RQI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Norton Security Premium - 10 Devices [Download Code</a>] because you can fill up 5 devices quickly (desktop, laptop, your spouse's--there's three or four, kids....) and it has a few more features for not a whole lot more. In retrospect, I should have bought that one but Norton can be confusing to buy. I should knock off a star for that confusion, but over all, I can recommend this software. As it is, I've rated it four stars because really, the Premium is the one I should have bought for a few bucks more. If you cover your phones and your tablets, you'll need 10 device capacity, no doubt about it.  I also should knock a star off for installation: I broke a regular rule of mine--de-install before installing new, but I followed the on-screen directions and it didn't say to do that. However, as I was upgrading from the 2015 and a different version (I had premium before, see how confused I got?) I should have de-installed. To upgrade from 2015 to 2016 SAME product (ie deluxe to deluxe or premium to premium) you don't need to de-install. It's hard to remember what you did previously and the words "deluxe" and "premium" are easy to confuse.  So I had to chat with the tech support when my install ground to a halt. I couldn't proceed. Something seemed wrong--and it was. The chat person (possibly out of Palo Alto) was absolutely marvelous. We stepped through the re-installation after de-install by having her do remote-PC and at several points, watching the chat for when you have to re-enter your password (encrypted) because the tech can't do that, nor should they. It did take the 45 minutes she told me it would, and afterwards, my install was perfect--because it was handled by Norton. I give five stars to the tech support chat and no stars to the installation protocol, which should have checked for previous versions and suggested de-installation.  I did feel kind of stupid, but then last week, I did a flawless hardware malfunction diagnosis and repair on my same laptop so I guess "D'oh!" and "Woo-hoo!" canceled each other out.  Bottom line: Unless you have to save that six bucks, buy the Premium. You will be happier. Check previous versions of anti-virus. If it isn't the same product, de-install the old product before installing this one. I actually believe that would apply to competing software as well.	1
Works wonderful with 10 devices the whole family is covered!<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Norton-Security-Premium-10-Devices-Download-Code/dp/B015724RQI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Norton Security Premium - 10 Devices [Download Code</a>]	1
Product is always reliable and I trust it to do the job.  Im not always happy with the marketing messages that sometimes are displayed that take up a large part of the screen..... Im ok dealing with them but family members sometimes panic that there may be some action required right away.  Id much prefer just an email to learn about whatever the marketing message is about.	1
Love Norton. Please keep up the great work and always be a leader.	1
I am an IT consultant with over 25 years experience.  I recommend this to all my home and small-business clients.  Some "computer experts" will claim that it takes up a lot of resources, or that it is not as good as other anti-virus/security products.  Neither is true.  I benchmarked my own computer both before and after installing Norton Security Deluxe, and saw NO appreciable difference in performance. As for the "not as good as other products," I can't tell you how many times I have seen problems with other anti-virus applications, especially the free ones.  I have only seen one situation where Norton had a problem - for some reason, it locked down access to shared files from the local computers.  And that was an easy fix.	1
Heck of a deal and WAAAY cheaper than getting it from Symantic.	1
It is good for what it is at the moment. I have used Norton products since the 90s and a few years ago, I had severe concerns with the "Vault" and these things were never answered. Basically, I wanted to save my information locally, not in the vault, however this is not an option, which I find to be a problem, especially with the downtime of the vault. The vault now is supposed to be the repository of the ID and Password collection, similar to what I now use with KEEPASS. Breaches of the cloud storage areas are now more common, but to shut off an option that was convenient to me, and was, I felt, more secure on a local device or drive, is not the best idea. The rest of Norton's capabilities are quite adequate, but the iOS coverage of the iPad air and Mac air is totally lacking. I have got more quality AV, malware and security with ESET. So, if you are happy with Norton, then go with it, but just realize that there are other products out there that do a better job.	1
Good enough seems to do what you paid for.	1
What can I say have used it for many years Easy to load on 5 computers. No problems.	1
i have 11 months and three weeks left on my 15 month subscription and the ENORMOUS popups are every day often several times a day. this issue began plaguing me last week. worst for me it totally disrupts my concentration, focus while working. there is no way to disable this other than to uninstall the product.  yesterday while working once again front and center one of their sales popups but this time it resulted in me losing time, work (their popups cover 20% of the screen area) i wasn't certain what the last item entered in the string series was so i had to do it all over from scratch. i lost part of the days work let alone the stress,.. but it all comes down to greed imho.  a few years ago bitdefender began doing this same type in your face popup ads months before it was time to renew. their product forums were filled with angry long time users that when faced with popups chose to leave in droves. i will be going with another vendor when this subscription runs out, assuming i can tolerate their ads for the next 11 mos.	-1
Works well and worth having. Many other "anti-virus" products seem to really slow down your system. This one works without problems.	1
I have been using Norton security products for many years. The recent versions pretty much stay out of my way (other than the promotional popups that can be switched off.) I like the automatic download scanning and I don't find performance to be impacted by running the product. Norton is what I put on all my relatives' PCs when they ask me for "support" and none of them has ever been infected by malware (neither have I).  I appreciate Symantec's recent licensing policies - 10 devices of different kinds for a low cost per year.	1
item as seller described	1
Love it.	1
I have used Norton for years, recently Norton 365.  Now it is upgraded to Norton Security Deluxe.  I have 5 devices (tablet, 2 phones, and 2 computers).  I feel safer using this product on my devices.  The only regret I have was that I didn't opt to by the 10 device package that includes cloud storage.  I highly recomment this product.	1
the norton safe identity broke last aug and still is not fixed for firefox and works poorly in chrome. won't be fixed maybr aug, 16 so be warned an advoid	-1
I have been in I.T. for almost 30 years and recommend Norton over other virus applications, especially free ones.  Norton has minimal impact on performance, and it does a great job protecting your data and computer.  My only complain is that the My Norton site is not very well organized and a bit confusing.	1
The instructions in the box are inadequate. The trick is that after activating it on one device you have to log in to your account and download it from there to additional devices. You do not activate it for each device.  The activation screen has an option for if you have already activated the device. If you notice it, you can try that route. However, it asked for my email and phone number and found no account, apparently their bug because when I went to norton.com I could log in from there. Once in my account I found that I could download to the device from which I logged in. I have had other problems with Norton in the past. One  year I returned it. My take is that they did a poor job of testing there user interfaces and provided inadequate documentation for the current release.	-1
It does the job well but I have noted my PC is a tad slower when installed.  I uninstalled this software after working on my sister's PC which had this software installed by her cable company and her PC was so infected that I had to wipe and reinstall windows again. Her better half clicks all links emailed and I believe that is where their infection problem came from.  I did not have confidence with Norton and installed another big name companies security suite.  In one day my spouse asked me to come look at the PC and it was infected with malware.  I reinstalled Norton and it cleaned up everything, no further issues, so I am staying with Norton.	1
I'm a Security Software Tech- Read an independent AVcomparitives  review that ESET AV doesn't protect from Ransomeware (Very buggy too!), and gave Norton Security Premium a 6 month try?  Every time you make a program change, it updates the backup database... (even with backup disabled)- I could hear my 10k rpm WD VelociRaptor HD thrashing. It also didn't support my Opera browser, and I had to try Chrome (YUCK!). I don't like their forced on you Password Manager (I use LastPass free). You have to keep rebooting..., or Virus definitions don't update (same with ESET)! BTW- If you decide to uninstall NIS..., you will be stuck with their Password Manager unless!-  Uninstall in Safe Mode  (no internet), from the "Start Menu", Right Click on Uninstall/ & elevated "Run as Admin..." (This gets rid of Drivers... too!).  BTW2- I have pretty fast 60mbps Internet, and now have inexpensive Webroot SecureAnywhere AV (boxed version (key Code...), or you get auto-buy). It's in the cloud (internet), no user ever infected with Ransomeware, site advisor for Opera too (forum for Procedure, instantly protected from new threats, and 36sec daily virus/keylogger scans (32gig Win7 Pro).	-1
Works well but needs more help with Edge browser	1
Work very well, but slows down the PC.	1
deal	1
Norton Security Deluxe 5 Devices does what its suppose to do. Hope Norton stays on top of the game. Best place to buy is here.	1
Works as It should and great price.	1
I had used Norton Internet Security for many years and decided to try the 360 last year which was okay but expensive. I didn't want to spend as much again this year and was happy to find this 5-device Security Deluxe on Amazon for twenty bucks, and since it is pretty much the same as the Internet Security I used to use I jumped on it.  I love it for our computers but was disappointed to discover that it does not provide the same for your cell phone and/or tablets so keep that in mind.	1
This software works well for me.  I have been using it for many years.	1
The download process was as flawless as possible. The ability to send an email to download on other devices was perfect. The protections offered worked first time and continues. A small footprint and nimble execution only adds to my joy. I would buy this product again.	1
For the price I always purchase the 10 device license because over the period of a year I never know what devices I will be installing it on.	1
I have yet to install this 2016 version but have been using the program for years.  It is always rated high by the different ratings services.  It does not use nearly as many computer resources like it did few years ago.  It seems to keep my computer clean especially if you use other programs along with it and be vigilant on the internet.	1
My previous subscription to Norton antivirus was expiring and got the typical daily warnings from them each day for a month.  Since it was far more economical to buy a new version than renew, that is what I did.  All I needed to do was use the new license number provided in the new purchase and I now had another years worth of coverage.  There was really no new download, just continuing the current version with new daily virus updates.  If you choose this method Norton will continue sending renewal messages for quite a while, it appears they don't know you replaced the old version with the new one.	1
Easy to renew my subscription on all my devices with this code.	1
good	1
very nice app	1
Good program, as always. Been using this brand since the late 90's, Don't know how anyone can have a problem downloading it. It was a breeze this time.	1
I'm the multi-generational extended family 'tech guy' so naturally I get all sorts of calls about computers being broken. Broken is defined by the rest of the family as pretty much anything on a computer, tablet or smartphone that confuses them. A few years ago I noticed that with a single exception nobody had any antivirus/firewall/etc. on their systems after the trial periods of manufacturer bloatware ran out. Thank goodness for Norton multi-device&platform security products. They are pretty easy to install, not resource hogs, reasonably priced and generally can be made almost invisible to the user. No one has been compromised from what I can tell. The 4 star rating is related to the spammish marketing of non-security related features Norton throws at you.	1
Do not buy - Amazon not offering an obvious return choice and Norton does not recognize the code provided as valid!	-1
Excellent security!	1
For 7 years running, I have been a loyal Norton customer. I used my multiple device subscription to activate my license here in the US and for my father who resides in Asia. This year, it only activated my device here and not that of my father because the license is no longer valid in another region.  There are numerous good security packages in the market and I have stuck with Norton all along, despite it being more expensive than the competition. But the regional restriction is the last straw. I will now switch to another security package that doesn't have the hassle of such regional restrictions. Norton, you have just lost a 7-year old customer.  Separate from the regional issue, I had one month remaining on my Norton subscription in the US and instead of adding/stacking to my existing subscription time, Norton reset the clock so there is only a total of 12 months (rather than 13 months (1 +12)). Tw0 strikes, and unfortunately you are now out Norton!	-1
This is the best, most affordable option if you have multiple PCs in your home.  Never do the automatic update in your Norton Security app on your PC. Always buy a new serial number each year. If you do an auto update, you will pay 4 - 5x more than a new 10 device purchase.	1
Excellent product for Pc and Android systems	1
easy to use/install - amazon library helpful.  10 unit pricing very good	1
Good item fast shipping.	-1

Great as usual	1
One of the first things any computer security class, seminar, or whatever will tell you is that you need to use a good anti-virus, a firewall, and a password manager is recommended.  The password manager allows you to log into that one system and it stores all of your passwords that you can now make as complicated as you should, and you don't have to remember all of them individually.  This software is all of that in one package, from a company that has been around for almost as long as I can remember.  With this package you can also put the AV software on most of your tablets, phones, laptops, computers, and maybe even other products.  My wife and I for instance each have a phone, tablet, laptop, and one desktop.  That is 7 devices all covered by this one software suite.  I've used Norton for years and I highly recommend them for the everyday user.	1
Great product for the price. Works as expected. Everyone should get antivirus for their devices if they are to transmit financial data.	1
can't beat Amazon for price or ease of resubscribing to Norton. I know people may not like Norton but it works good for me and where are you going to get 10 devices download and cloud backup. This has worked for me and they have always came through.	1
good	1
this is a good product as Norton always is and my second year with this version. My only complaint is that when it is bought on Amazon which I do because of your incredible pricing, this year $29 for a 79 dollar item. Norton makes it difficult for you to set up if you did not buy from them. You have to download the entire version where their website says it takes only a few  minutes when bought directly from them. I have been using Norton for over ten years and I had to go to their customer support to get it up on my Win 10 machine, It was easier but still lengthy on my two Win 7 machines. I wish they did not do this as it puts a bad taste in your mouth when there is no need to. Thanks again to Amazon for your excellent pricing and followup when you have it at a special price.	1
Requires you to create an account with Norton.  Well, apparently I already have one with my email address.  So I ask the system to send me a password reset.  Three requests and I have yet to see a password reset email, that's supposed to come instantly.  Just let me download the darn software and install it on my computer.  I do not feel I should have to sign-up for your biker gang just to get my freakin' software!	-1
Reliable software I continue to buy	1
I have not installed it yet and have been using Norton 360 for many years.  When my 360 subscription runs out I will install Norton Security and use it's backup feature.  I have been using Norton products for over 20 years and, while it has given me fits at times, I doubt there is anything out there that is perfect. AND, I couldn't beat the price as I use it on a multiboot laptop with Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8 and 10, another PC with Windows 7, 8, and 10 and my main PC with Windows 7.  So, I need one security program for, technically, 8 devices (I don't use it for Windows XP).	1
Another great Norton product. I have been using Symantec products for many years and find Norton to be the best available software out there. I bought this in the Black Friday period and got an extra great deal on it. I have tried other anti virus software over the years, and gave up after a while, going back to and staying with Norton from then on	1
I've been into Computers PC's/Mac's since 1992. ( I work with other peoples PC's) and also have about 7-9 myself..  Almost every year one or more of the Major Computer Magazines has reviews of the top 10 Antivirus Programs, which I started reading about 20 years ago,  every time I'd read the reviews (Probably 15-18 Times), Norton would always be in the top 4 and usually it would place 1st or 2nd..  So I've been using Norton Antivirus (Several different) versions for the last 18 years... I've never gotten a virus except for Tracking Cookies (everyone gets Tracking Cookies), which Norton always Deletes them...  Always if you check Amazon Often they will have some version of Symantec (Norton) Antivirus for a VERY LOW price..  This one I paid only $24.?? for this one, and that's for a 10 Device Licenses (PC/Mac and Android), some years I have to buy before, my current Version hasn't expired. But that's no problem I just wait until the present version installed on my PC's expires and Install at that time.	1
I found CyberLink PhotoDirector 7 Ultra to be less than advertised. Its functions have been present in some form in virtually all better photo editing software for several years. Although the same functions are available in virtually all of the better photo editing software in such software it takes a bit more effort to implement those functions. However, the additional effort produces better results. For example; To achieve satisfactory results with the "Background Removal" in PhotoDirector use of a cloning tool is needed to smooth and blend the automatically replaced background. In most cases unwanted objects and background can be removed simply by using the cloning tool in virtually all better photo editing software. If you already have such software stick with it and learn to use the tools available.	-1
Now, this is somewhere between novice and intermediate skill-level. Even though I have been using this (and many other comparable) this program for years (and years), I can still put myself into a newbie's shoes and see how intuitive and "exciting" this would be. I cannot even find areas that could be frustrating or "a mystery." This software is extremely forgiving and very welcoming to all of all skill-levels. (And, it has so many playful options, that it is perfect for teens in encouraging creativity).  As a professor of film, I use this and PowerDirector to create lessons in color theory, framing, etc. It is exactly what I need. I think this may apply to many other teachers/professors of the arts.  This is perfect for teens, those in the teaching field ... and even those just wanting to add a creative flair to their pictures! I have encountered no glitches, bugs, or any other issues. (If I do, I will post an update here).  Highly recommended for all!	1
I liked all the options in this software. There were a lot of filters you could use. You could transfer objects in and out and change things you don't like. You can work in layers.  I thought this was very user friendly. Of course I needed some instruction and had to get used to it but overall it was not as difficult as some of the other photo editing programs I have used. I really enjoyed testing out the different features. It's amazing how much you can improve your photographs.	1
I've been using this software for over a month now and still impressed on all it provides for an everyday user.  It easy to understand how the features work and plenty are offered - many filters to provide flattering or artistic results, corrections for bad photos (red eye, etc.), and online posting options, collage or film choices, and many others that give an uncrafty person (me) options that make me look like I take much better photos that I do.  I love how it allows me to save a key photos that need some work and provides a finished photo that looks 10 times better than what I started with and it this with a few clicks of my mouse.	1
I am a serious photographer and use several different photo-editing software programs including:  PhotoShop; Lightroom ; and Photomatix,among others.  I am always looking for something new so when I got a chance to try this program out it jumped at it.  I am so used to operating my other software that it is hard to make a fair comparison between and something that I have to learn all over again.  Still, I will do my best.  I think that this is a well thought out photo editing package.  It does many of the things that PhotoShop Elements does.  I can see this being a good program for students or beginners.  I still think that PhotoShop is a better choice for the professional photographer or those wishing to become one.	1
I have played with many photo editing software programs over the years.  This one is fairly straight forward and fairly easy to use.  I had to hunt and peck for awhile as I was new to it's layout.  But, overall after you see the breakdown, etc. it is not too hard to navigate.  It does have some powerful abilities, but in my opinion not as powerful as photoshop.  Although, it does allow layers to be built and merged which is similar to photoshop.  I did not see a quick way to control each layers transparency etc. as I am accustomed to in Photoshop.  I originally opened the program with a photo to edit and simply wanted to flip it horizontally.  I looked for a long time and only found a way to rotate it. Which is not the same at all.  While continuing to feel my way around in the program, I ended up importing another pic and then discovered that via layers, you could flip the pic. It will take a bit more exploring and learning the program's abilities to get the entire ease of it's use - but overall it does seem to be a strong and solid editing program for it's price range.	1
I had high hopes for this program. I have been looking for a NON-Adobe product that does more to enhance my photographs than the free program I currently have. This promised great potential, since it is supposed to allow you to layer images, substitute faces, etc.; however, I did not find it lived up to my expectations.  My first clue that this was not the product for me came with its installation. One the one hand, I was impressed that this program came with a CD which I can keep as a back-up, or provided a link to allow me to download a digital version. It also has QR code for users to scan to link them to aps for their Android, iOS and Windows versions for other devices. But then I found out this is an "all or nothing" software. I like programs that let me determine what features I want installed on my computer. CyberLink doesn't let you do this. You get everything written onto your hard drive, and you can't disable anything. Not only that, but you get periodical pop-ups that nag you to add this or that for a price.  Like everything else these days, this program wants you to put everything in the Cloud. Not happening! That's a security risk I don't want. My stuff is mine, and I want it to stay that way--particularly creative work. Thankfully, this program gives you the option, but doesn't mandate saving images in the Cloud.  My biggest problem was importing pictures to be able to edit them. In the free version of Picassa (my current photo-editing program), all you do is double-click on a PDF or other image file, and it opens it for viewing (I set it as my default viewer, so it would do this). Then I click a button in the viewing pane that says, "Edit in Picassa." Bam! It's there, and I can start playing with it immediately. With PhotoDirector, you have to click File, then Import, and then go through this long rig-a-marrow to bring a photo into the program to edit. With Picassa, once you open a folder and start working on one picture, you can systematically scroll through all the files in that folder and modify them one-by-one. I tried this in PhotoDirector, but never figured out how to make it work.  Making the changes is not as easy or "intuitive" as some users made it sound. In most cases, you have to do a lot of clicking, tweaking, checking, etc., to get the enhancement you want. I really hate the crop part, in particular, because it consistently wants to retain the original aspect of the photo, even when you click that you want something else. You can do some fun stuff with people's bodies and faces, but I am not into caricatures as much as correctly representing people. The layering and background modification would be super useful for a graphic artist, but that's not my thing either. If I want to build a great-looking graphic, I find it's a whole lot easier to do it in Publisher.  My biggest beef with this program is how it saves stuff. With Picassa, you get your picture, change it, and then save it directly to the original location. You can either do a simple Control-S or click Save; or to rename and create a new file, do a Save As and put it wherever you please. To delete a file, you just right click and tell the computer to delete it, or drag it to your trash can. With PhotoDirector, it doesn't automatically save a single file to your original folder; you have to tell the program you want it there, and it saves multiple files at once--kind of like when you build an html file. If you want to delete something that has been through PhotoDirect, you have to close the program, or it won't let it go. If you are doing a whole folder of images at once, this gets to be a super time-consuming pain! It also changes the dates on your modified photos, so you don't have a record of when you originally took the picture and then modified it; you just have a set of dates logging the photo as having been created and modified on the day that PhotoDirect had it in its clutches. When you go back some other time to put photos in chronological order to create album pages, as I like to do, this makes your task really hard.  While this program has some cool features for the person with a lot of time on their hands and a truckload of creative energy, it is not for me. I like something quick, simple and direct, that doesn't make me jump through a lot of hoops to get what I want done. I want to control what goes onto my computer, and I don't want a constant barrage of ads to entice me to upgrade to a more expensive package or add features. I will be uninstalling this as soon as possible.	-1
This is my initial take on this edition of Cyber Link Photo Director 7 Ultra, to satisfy the needs required by Amazon Vine.  I have thus far only installed this on my Windows 8.1 laptop computer. I have a Windows 10 driven computer coming and will update the review upon installing it on that desktop. I also will install this on my Mac Mini, version 2011, as soon as I finish installing the new operating system upgrade.  At present, though, I am going to report my first impressions of my experience on the laptop.  Long ago, Adobe Photoshop leap-frogged me so badly that I am unable to justify the expenditure for their premier photo editing software. If I were seriously involved in publishing, though, I would be staying with them.  I have used their Photoshop Elements, though, and find it to be a good program for the hobbyist, as is Corel's version. Cyber Link's Photo Director 7 Ultra, though, seems to me to be a cut above the above alternatives, and worth every penny. Organizing the photographs is an item I am still playing with.  Bear in mind, I'm not interested in many features, such as editing out people or objects to make for a cleaner view. In that sense, I'm more of a purist, interested in improving upon the view, but not in so dressing up the picture to satisfy or stun my audience. What I mean is, I am more of a photo journalist than an artist.  At a future point I will describe the great features of the organizing feature, as well as it's weaknesses. Also, I will give the free mobile app a try, this week, and report on those results.  If you already have good photo editing software that you're happy with, this may still be a nice addition to your options. But, if you have no acceptable photo editing application, by all means, this is worth every penny, and works on Windows 10 very well. More on Macintosh later.	1
This is a security code and a URL to a website. There is no disk included. The product overall is good and reasonably priced. Just remember to never renew this (or any other security software) from the company that makes it. Always go to amazon.  Why no disk? They give several reasons that include saving the environment but the best reason is that if they need to upgrade the software you will automatically get the most up-to-date version when you download.  Installation: If they aren't going to give a disk then they should make it easier to get the right software. But you go to a website and then it's click here and then pick an OS and then pick a software and then choose the download manager and the whole thing was confusing. I can guarantee that my wife would not have been able to figure out what links to click on. When it finally downloaded everything the download manager ended up behind the web browser page so I didn't realize that it was completed. Once the installation started it did remove the old security software very easily with no more intervention than telling the old software that it was OK when prompted. When it restarted the PC the installation software started right up again without any prompting from me.  There was a long pause between the completion of the installation and the activation screen so that left me wondering if it was done or not. But overall it was OK although it did take an hour for the full installation.  Quick Scan: The Quick Scan took about 15 minutes to run. It is easy to trigger as there is a big button labeled quick scan right in the middle of the console and you can set it to automatically shut down when the scan is complete. It will do some optimization although having had a security software with optimization it didn't save much.  Start up: Start up took about 2 to 3 minutes but that isn't any different than the old software. This an older PC that I was installing this on.  Overall the software is quite acceptable and I have no real complaints.	1
Finally, a security product that doesn't slow down your computer.  I installed this on my new Lenovo laptop and have been very pleased. It downloaded without issue and appears to be working well. While I prefer CDs to key cards, I must say it was hassle free. this suite will accommodate up to three devices. the packaging was excessive for just a little piece of paper but other than that I have no complaints. This product provides reliable protection without bogging down your device or cluttering it with unwanted extras.	1
It was going to take some doing to get me away from my stalwart security software suite, Kaspersky. With low overhead in processor & memory use, along with some impressive features Kaspersky was the best in class as far as I was concerned.  Trend Micro's Maximum Security has done the dirty deed. I am now an unabashed fan of it. Interestingly, you will get the product in a box but there will not be a disc, instead you'll have a link to download it. It's not a massive package so download is quick. Trend Micro explains that they do this for a few good reasons (and I mostly agree): most laptops don't have CD/DVD drives anymore, for starters.  Installation is quick and you're off to the races--it nicely handled uninstalling my Kaspersky product without issue. Now, in addition to the anti-virus software, there are other bits of software that I would normally discount, but that I have found quite useful: a password safe, which I quickly tested and found functional but then uninstalled the Chrome add-on because I use the excellent LastPass. A social media management system that reviews your Social Media accounts and suggests privacy enhancing configuration changes. This is quite nice and I appreciate it, but there are some brain-dead suggestions it gives, such as setting your twitter feed to private, which kind of goes against the idea of twitter. A site link checker which highlights in green any link it finds to be good before you click on it--and it does this cleanly and without imposing on system resources or making a mess out of the web page formatting.  With next-to-no CPU and memory overhead, Trend sits there unnoticed except for notifications on startup that it is running. You will not be hampered in any way by it, which I love and absolutely require. By the way, this is running on a Windows 10 laptop, but I am given to understand you can also install it on Android devices as well, which counts towards the 3-user license. I have not installed it on my phone or any other device so I can't say anything about that.  The usual features are there, and intuitive to use: scheduled scans, parental controls (which I don't need or use) and configuration settings for what to do when malware is found. All in all, this is my new favorite security software.  [Update: I have installed this on my Android phone and I am amazed at how well it's doing there as well. Low to no overhead, though I found it annoying that I had to change its configuration to remove the rather obnoxious "YOU ARE NOW PROTECTED" message & logo resident on the home screen. It pointed out what it thought were privacy concerns and did not find any threats. It does perform a threat analysis with every new installation as well. You can also use this as a remote wipe interface in case you lose the phone.  More new features on the PC edition: I also happen to like the secure delete feature, the vault--for keeping sensitive files with a unique feature of locking the vault if ever your PC is lost or stolen. Capital idea!  Now for the reason I've taken down the review from five to four stars: for the price, you should be getting a firewall, but what comes with the so-called "Maximum" edition is an "enhancement" to the built-in Windows firewall.]	1
My husband and I love this software.  It is not a resource hog and you don't even notice it's there.  That's what I want in an anti-virus, in addition to having no issues that get through the software.  His Trend Micro expired last month and we decided to just go with the free company that our cable provider offers but quickly regretted that.  It seems to slow down the computer and I actually got some kind of malware with it last year.  The year prior to that my husband had the other big company antivirus and he actually had a ransomware attack. I was so excited to get offered this and we are switching back to the Trend Micro.  It's safe and easy to use.  It doesn't stick a lot of extras on your computer either.  I installed it easily.  You just go to their website, download the software and then put in the code that is mailed to you.  They do not send you a disk. When you get to the download page for this software, you will see different ones for the same - the difference is the 32 bit and 64 bit.  I made the mistake of doing the 32 and it informed me I needed the 64 so I had to change to the correct one.  It all took just a few minutes and I was up and running.  Highly recommend this brand over all the others.	1
Trend Micro has made a decent antivirus fir decades. This version of Trend Micro is better than McAfee and Norton because it isn't quite a boggy as it could be. Even so, it does slow down older machines, which means you'll be pulling your hair out if you have an anemic netbook. But it does protect your machine, which is worth it.  Somebody else mentioned in the reviews to not renew the antivirus and just buy a new one.  Yes, that's the correct way to do it. Don't get ripped off with subscriptions.	1
I have been using the free version of Avast but got tired of the scammy upselling. I've used Trend Micro in the past and been happy.  This time, unfortunately, things got off to a bad start. I don't mind that the box does not contain a CD/DVD. Instead, you receive a card with instructions and key. I do mind that the main argument is to save the environment, which, if true, they should go with a smaller box or even no box--just an email with the essential info.  Anyway, when I went to the website (as instructed on the enclosed card) to download the program, I found a confusing page that was unclear about what I should download. Apparently I made a mistake because the installation would not accept my key. After a phone call, I did get kinda...maybe not so much...customer service, but by then I'd already figured out my mistake.  Finally, after the drama, I was able to install the program. It's really laying low which is generally good, but I'd like to interact with more of the extras. And I'm finding it difficult to find all of them.  One extra I am interested in is the password manager. I've needed one of these for a long time, but kept chickening out. This time I went through with it, and so far it's working well. I did have a few hiccups during installation, but it does seem to be making my life easier now.  Since I haven't used the program very long, I will check back in after some time has passed. Hopefully I'll still be happy.	1
Good anti virus and firewall !	1
ok	-1
Works as intended.	1
I downloaded and installed 360 Total Security on two of my older desktops - Windows XP Pro and the other Win 8.1 Pro. I really  like it. Pretty darn fast, and takes up very little resources. Since then it has upgraded, to the newest version, no problems and added some cool features which I was able to pick and choose.	1
It works great as describe and it tells me how good my started is each time I start my computer in the morning and it allows me to clean my a lot of junk that I do not need.	1
potentually bad for your laptop. don't download !	-1
Don't	-1
Several years ago I purchased the online access to Rosetta Stone.  I don't know if that is still available but the months went by and I ended p paying a lot of money.  I actually don't think there is much difference between that and this....the features that I remember re all comparable.  I didn't end up using it enough.  Really, you should just pay for what you need and I believe this is what I need.  I took a year of Spanish in college and I just don't remember enough and I need to learn it now.  I can't wait to see how quickly I progress with this.  I will update.  If you are trying to decide which software to buy, I definitely recommend this.  I don't have a DVD drive on this computer, so I just downloaded it and entered the code on the sticker in the package,  It was very easy.  Great product.	1
This is a pretty cool interactive Spanish immersion course that is much cheaper than Rosetta Stone. It comes with a CD for your computer, a DVD for your TV and  a MP3 for listening. There are "people" who speak it for you and you can repeat it until you understand and speak the words.  There is a lot in this package.. much more than I can tell you about. You can pick and choose where you want to start or go, which is nice. But the best thing about it is the price. This provides you with three levels of learning to speak Latin American Spanish. I'm not sure I'll be visiting Mexico or South America soon but it will help me understand what is being said here in America by Spanish speaking people.	1
For the price this is a pretty decent language program, but it's pretty basic. To break it down, you get several items in this set. First there is the pocket guide, which in my opinion isn't really sized for a pocket. It's a 7 x 20 piece of cardboard that is folded so that it's 7 x 5 when closed. There are six-pages of words & phrases printed a bit too small for my eyes (about 5pt). The small print and high-gloss finish made it hard for me to read. Second there is an smart-phone/tablet app, which is apparently the new feature for this package. The app was easy to install (I downloaded it from the Amazon appstore to my Kindle HD 10). There is an access code that you have to put in to download the Level 1 Spanish language module. The app is pretty basic, with a male and female speaking each word. I actually like this as there are some differences in the pronunciation, which I think helps to make it easier to understand the different way people can say the same thing. It's a bit disappointing that you only get the module for the one level. I think you have the option of purchasing others.  The bulk of the language package is the software and the interactive DVD. The software was simple to install and worked well on my computer with MS Windows 7 Pro. While I've used the lesson/tutorials, I haven't played with the Oscar Lake game much. You can also record yourself as you're doing the lessons so that you can compare your efforts to say the words and phrases. I didn't have a microphone so I haven't been able to do that yet. The lessons seem to be broken down well, and are easy to follow. The interactive DVD is pretty clunky, you have to advance through the individual parts of the levels using your DVD player remote. I'm not really sure what you get out of doing the DVD over the computer program  you pretty much cover a lot of the same material in the same way.  As I mentioned, I think this is a pretty decent language program, and I think eventually I'll be able to pick up some basic Spanish from using it. But like learning most things  you have to put in the time and effort to make doing this successful. You're not going to learn Spanish overnight.	1
This program initially seems more similar in style to Mavis Beacon Typing than Rosetta Stone. Rosetta Stone wastes no time grading your word pronunciation and feels more immersive right off the bat.  Instant Immersion initially starts out grading you based upon how many modules you complete. Eventually, you'll get to sections where you're required to understand the words and select the correct answers to be graded accordingly.  It's initially a little confusing to self-navigate.  Thankfully, the PDF help system will get you up to speed.  The lessons are entertaining and like every other program out there, Rosetta Stone included, your success will most ly depend on your level of commitment to truly learning by doing.  If you simply run through the paces and expect to magically know Spanish at the end, you'll be disappointed.  This is true whether you spend $30 on a program or $300.  In addition to the software application, Instant Immersion also bundles in a companion iOS/Android app, a conventional DVD with additional practice lessons and online access to lessons.  It's a very well-rounded package and absolutely worth the price.  In fact, I would suggest starting with this before dropping a few hundred on more an expensive program.  I've used everything from the cheapest bargain bin language programs to the biggest bundle Rosetta Stone offers.  I can tell you from experience that this is just as good a starting point as any other program.  As I typed previously, it doesn't matter how much you spend.  Your commitment level is way more valuable to your success than any amount of money spent.	1
THE QUICK TAKE:  Instant Immersion Spanish offers a lot of content for a reasonable price.  Like all language programs, you get out what you put in - it takes work.  This package is a reasonable option if you're looking for a less-expensive way to start to learn Spanish.  FULL REVIEW:  Instant Immersion Spanish has a number of features that reflect their experience in offering language programs:  + There is a diverse range of content and different ways to learn, which is important with language: computer software, tablet software (for Level 1), a DVD and audio. + A PDF of the audio script is included, so there are written materials as well.  I like to see the words, not just hear them. + This new version allows multiple members of a household to use the software.  In my opinion, that's essential for language software, so each individual can pick up where they left off. + The software can be installed using a download, which is very helpful for the newer devices that blur the lines between tablets and computers (such as our 2-in-1 laptop with no optical drive). + The tablet software is fairly nicely done, though it could be a little better.  It offers a few different learning approaches (listening, speaking, spelling, multiple choice).  I find the tablet (in our case, an iPad) works particularly well with children - and easy to pick it up and get started, anywhere.  No need to sit down at a computer.  (Of course, it makes me wish it covered all of the levels.)  But there are some concerns: - The DVD seems to use Spanish as it is spoken in Spain, rather than in Latin America. While the differences are modest, that's a surprising thing to do to new learners. - The DVD lessons are OK and worth doing, but not particularly effective or appealing.  They need an update.  One other thing to note, if you're planning to use the audio while driving - it's a little complex for that, though you could review or preview it that way you'd still want to listen when you can give it your full attention.  Also, it's unfortunate the audio doesn't start out with a little conversational Spanish, rather than 3-4 lessons on the alphabet.  Given the value price and the substantial amount of content, I wanted to like Instant Immersion Spanish more than I did.  I'd give it a moderately positive recommendation, if you're looking for a budget option.  I suppose my expectations were fairly high, as I've used a number of different approaches to language learning and inevitably compare Instant Immersion to the best of each of them.  So I compare the audio to Pimsleur; the tablet app to DuoLingo; and so on.  Instant Immersion wasn't the best in any category.  The bar has been raised in another way as well: with so many free resources available through the internet, language software has to offer a lot of value for the price.	1
Instant Immersion Spanish is a tool to learn Spanish using exactly what the title indicates: immersion. We all learn our native languages that way and it is typically the best way to learn additional languages. This software package gives you the tools that you need to help with doing exactly that: immersing yourself in the Spanish language. To accomplish this, you get a variety of tools. You get the actual software for your computer with easy to follow lessons. There's an interactive DVD (especially good if multiple people in the house are learning the language). There are audio lessons for those who are auditory learners. There are games. This package has pretty much everything. The most attractive thing about it is the price: it is a fraction of the cost of other immersion software and provides much of the value. If you're on a tight budget, this is a product to consider.  The other aspect of immersing yourself in the language is to have conversations with those who already speak it, watch TV shows and movies subbed, dubbed, or initially filmed in Spanish, and to even start using it regularly (write your grocery list, to-do list, etc in Spanish). This package isn't everything, you still have to practice and incorporate your new language into your everyday life. The software is a tool, nothing more.	1
Instant Immersion is a brand name, as Rosetta Stone is a brand name. Instant Immersion offers multi-level language learning as Rosetta Stone does. This learning system is way cheaper than Rosetta Stone, and has similar teaching techniques. This contains levels 1-3, and can be downloaded onto 5 computers per household! Directions say, this is not for schools or businesses, but for household use only. This comes with1 software DVD-ROM with four programs, 1 interactive DVD for your TV, 10+ hours of audio learning on 1 CD-ROM, level 1 companion app, unlimited household computer license, Who Is Oscar computer game, and a bonus pocket phrase guide. This contains fun language games for the whole family! You can play on the TV with your DVD player and remote control. Requirements: Microsoft Windows XP/Vista/7/8, 960x600 color display, sound card, DVD-ROM drive or Internet access for installation, microphone (recommended), DVD Player/drive for video disc. We got this yesterday, and already it's so much fun to learn! Highly recommend this!	1
We're only a few days into this an we have picked up a few catch phrases already. It's also neat because it has a level 1 companion app that you can take with you. It has 3 levels, from beginner to intermediate. It comes with 1 software DVD program and 1 interactive DVD. My favorite is the CD that contains 10 hours of audio listening, so I can drive while learning. It has a computer called Who is Oscar Lake & a pocket  phrase guide. Level 1 starts off with vocabulary, level 2 expands to the complex phrase and conjugations of the verbs & pronunciations, level 3 gives you some advanced dialogue and conversation. I like everything that comes with this package. our family will definitely benefit from it. Worth the money if you'd like to expand your knowledge of the Spanish language.	1
Seems to be just as good as the competition.  I was always hesitant to buy anything other than Rosetta Stone but I guess that was way back like a decade ago when everyone else just couldn't compete.  But I think Instant Immersion Spanish from Topics Ent powered by Eurotalk is looking good and working great.  The installation went smooth without a hitch on Windows 10.  The interface is modern and quite nice to look at.  Level 1 gives you First words, Food, Colors, Phrases, Body, Numbers, Time, Shopping, Countries and a game.  Level 2 gives you The Alphabet, Business, Emergencies, Getting around, Greetings, At the hotel, Leisure, On the phone, At the restaurant, and Shopping.  Level 3 gives you Family, Hobbies and Friends, At Home, At School, Sport, "Emails, Computers and Technology", Travelling, At Work, The World, and Vocabulary.  There is even Level 3 Business which gives you "Banking/Finance/Stock Exchange/Accounting", Careers, "It/Internet/e-commerce/Communications", Marketing/Advertising/Pr, Business Meetings, Negotiations, On the Phone, Trading/Buying and Selling, Business Travel, and Vocabulary.  Quite in-depth.  You also get an interactive DVD for TV usage and an audio version to bring along with you.  The only hitch some users might not like is that you HAVE to register if you want to begin, otherwise no big deal.	1
I took a chance on this Instant Immersion Spanish software because the product description said that it was only for Windows; however, the photo showed "PC and Mac" on the spine of the box.  Since I knew that the all-access portion worked on iPads, I figured that reinforced my hunch.  And yes, it does work with Mac and iPad, as well as Windows 8.1 machines.  (I have not tried it with Windows 10.)  To start learning Spanish, all you need to do is pop in the software DVD and install it on your computer.  If you do not have a DVD drive or if you are installing on a tablet, you need to visit the website to enter your email address and product key to begin the download.  The box also contains an interactive DVD and an MP3 audio CD.  I like that I can copy the audio to iTunes, although it's a little weird how it adds files to my Mac desktop in order to accomplish this.  It sounds like an extended game of Pong.  The software itself is pretty good, although your success will depend in part on how well you tend to grasp foreign languages.  All the PR around Instant Immersion language courses compares them to Rosetta Stone.  I can't make the comparison myself, having never tried Rosetta Stone, but I do know that this is a relatively easy method of teaching yourself Spanish, as long as you take advantage of all the tools.  I find that the trio of reading, speaking, and listening to the same words and phrases helps me learn faster.  I've tried other language courses that leave out one or the other, and that's much more difficult.  The pocket phrase guide, while extremely portable, is difficult to see with older eyes, and it's not necessarily easy to find what I want, even though the words/phrases are grouped by subject, such as days of the week or transportation.  Still, it's better than no guide at all.  This software teaches Latin American Spanish, which is great for most Americans but not so great if you plan to go to Spain.  I cannot find a way to change to European Spanish, so I assume that option is not available.  The iPad Talk Now app mirrors the computer version, which makes it easy to train yourself on one, then switch off to the other.  The Oscar Lake game will appeal to a wide range of ages.  I've used an older Instant Immersion program for Italian, and I find this newer version of the software to be less clunky and visually more friendly, something that's important if children will be using it.  This program is best for learning a smattering of Spanish, not for an in-depth learning program that covers the finer points of grammar and word nuances.  If your aim is to be able to converse a little or understand important written words, this is a great program.  -- Debbie Lee Wesselmann	1
I've tried 2 other top selling courses that are substantially more expensive and Instant Immersion is actually superior at a fraction of the price.  First of all, the breadth of the program is wider, with the computer program, tablet App, DVD and audio files.  As such, I can make progress at home or on the go.  In addition, the program has a scoring game that allows you to track progress and gives you identifiable benchmarks in terms of assessing your progress.  Given that this program sells for less that $75, I didn't really expect much, but I was very surprised.  Installation was a breeze and I've encountered no problems so far. In addition, the family license is broad and doesn't freak out if you install in multiple devices.	1

I installed the Magix video editing program on a large DELL desktop machine, a Studio/XPS 9000 i7 quad core with 24gigs of RAM, and a ATI Radeon HD 5800 Series graphics card with 1 gig of dedicated video memory (my C: program and cache disk is an 1TB SSD).  The installation program asked if I wanted to ALSO install Simpliclean (a register booster and register cleaning tool)  I said NO.  I have other tools already that I know and trust; Simpliclean is one I have not used before, and it felt like bloatware.  During installation  messages talked about some of the features that I might want to be aware of, including --  Stabilization  Object Tracking (of objects on in the scenes)  Mobile Video Editing for (or on?) Android  A sound archive for slideshows and videos  Sound editing  Showfy for sharing (hmm, Id rather use YouTube or Facebook directly)  The latest offers, always up to date (hmm, it better not try and sell me something every time I turn around, like Pinnacle products do!)  It made me close MS Outlook for the installation to work (it actually stopped during the installation and complained that Outlook was running, and asked me to close it thats a first! - Im not sure what it would be messing with that Outlook would also be using)  The online registration was easy  using the supplied very long key code, I did have to give it my name, email etc., to create an account with them, but thats no big deal to me.  I then ran the program, and found their _Demo project and clicked on it, (just a hunch that was the right file) and wow, it loaded up the timeline with the tracks and fades and transitions, picture in picture, show-speed, fast-speed, etc., all very nice.  I played the demo project on and watched the timeline, to see how this thing works.  * NOTE, I usually use Cyberlinks video editing products for most of my projects, but I also have Pinnacles products, and Adobe CS6 and Sony products too, along with ProShow Producer, so Im familiar with how video editing companies think, and thus how they build their editing tools, so with a little trial and error, I was able to navigate around Magix without any trouble.  I will say that on my PC, the live playback within the editing tool window was very good, better than Cyberlinks (once Cyberlink creates the shadow files, then things get better for real time editing and real time play back on the screen while you are editing, but its still not as good as I was seeing here with the Magix product!)  That was cool!  I do feel that the world probably has enough video editing tools, so seeing this one made me think, oh well, another mouse trap, and this one is probably better in some respects than the more popular Adobe and more established products such as those from Cyberlink or Pinnacle or Sony, but competition is good, and this will force the others to get better too.  Yes, there are YouTube videos for help (no printed manual comes with this product, but then no one reads those anyways).  However, theres a lot more on YouTube by professional and amateur people on how to do things in the other more established and de facto products, so while this one is good, it might not matter the others have more info on them already.  If youve never used one of these programs before, this one is very powerful, has all the nice options, but the learning curve will be steep to master all the options.  I will keep this one, and add it to my collection.  I liked the easy way that it handled speeding up or slowing down video within a track (and, I will look harder now at the other products that I have to see if they can do that as easily too).  Sometimes Ive done this the long and hard way, by making a clip, slowing it down, and then including that slowed down clip within a project.  Thats a lot of steps, whereas Magix made this look as easy as adding a fade or transition!  Cool!	1
Movie Edit Pro is a competitor to Adobe Premiere Elements (Adobe Software) and Corel's Video Studio. I've used both these competitors, and of the two, in terms of stability and ease of use Video Studio has it over Adobe. So how does Movie Edit Pro, from Magix measure up? I've used Magix music software with good results, so I was curious to see if Movie Pro would be an easy video editor for the home film maker.  The good news: this is an easy-to-use software. The less than good news is that the installation requires that you do a lot of downloading after the initial installation, so it's a bit lengthy to get going. However, it's not a bad package and if you like their Music Pro, you may well enjoy this.   For one thing, the 2016 version is definitely designed to please the GoPro user.  In particular, they include Mercalli Image Stabilization (a third-party plug-in specifically for reducing the inevitable hand jiggle that comes with vidcams, especially GoPro.  The Pro version comes with V2. If you want V4 (and also some extensive effects filters, the Premium edition has NewBlue Action Cam included.)  Plus and Premium also have 360 degree editing, Pro does not. If for some reason, you import a 360 degree file, it will be a normal video file in Pro.  Note: Video Editing is a resource-heavy task. You need to have a computer that has enough power, especially with the CPU and the graphics card. This is not a task for a small laptop aimed at web surfing and email.  Requirements: Processor  Quad-core processor with 2.8 GHz or better recommended (minimum is 2GB) RAM Minimum  2 GB Recommended but 8GB recommended 8 GB Graphics card Minimum: Onboard, minimum resolution 1280 x 768 512 MB VRAM Hard drive space Minimum: 2 GB for program installation Internet Connection for installation.  The help menu is very good. As you create a film, if you are not familiar with a feature, you can go to the Magix website for tutorials or a user forum. This isn't unique to Magix, but it is good that it is there. I find the EASIEST way to learn any software is to take on a task, and then learn as I go, picking up a tutorial or working through help online.  Then, I pick another task and slowly, I become familiar with the software's features.  When you start up the software,  a dialogue box appears  with various choices for what you wish to do.  Your choices are to start a new project, with new settings, to open a project that you are already working on, or use a "Easy Mode" quick template with preset items for a guided editing session.   As you become familiar with the software, you can skip past this and go directly to your choice of task.   Some great features--you can have up  to 32 tracks of media in one project (99 in Premium),  You can also import from wireless devices and export to your phone, to Facebook, to an SD card. You can burn DVDs or Blu-Ray.  You can download a 30 day trial--and I'd recommend that. In particular, the Plus and Premium versions have so many more features, including FISHEYE CORRECTION, that you may find that it's worth it to buy the more advanced version. Right now the limited "Plus" edition is available for a short time for the same price as the basic Pro edition, with some of the Premium features so it's worth it to compare.  Summary: This isn't a bad video editing package, but I would recommend downloading the PLUS limited edition at the sale price rather than the base version I am reviewing.	1
I like it because I'm familiar with this software, via their Edit Pro MX.  This 2016 version has some improvements over the older versions, and a bug fixed on the title function (I can move the title bar anywhere, and the video bars stay where you leave them).  It's easy to overlap, fade in & out, black out, reduce volume or remove it; sharpen and brighten.  I don't like the fancy effects; just good, solid editing is what I need. This one works for me.	1
I am yet to put it tru its paces but so far no problems, no freezes	1
This day and age  many people have a lot of different devices for recording video. I, myself have a number, including two cell phones, and ipod touch and ipad, several android devices (including a few Amazon Fire tablets), a dash-cam in my car, and a couple of the small action cameras. Not to mention some regular style camcorders and a digital point-and-shoot camera that can take videos. I was given a drone for Christmas that had a video camera  but it now lives in the top of a tree somewhere in a Louisiana bayou (story for another time). Plus, I'm slowly working on transferring old VHS tapes to digital format. So I was happy to try out this new version of Magix Movie Edit Pro 2016 for the past thirty days. I've been using an older version of similar software from another brand (Corel VideoStudio Pro X3) and wanted to tryout something newer.  Installation was typical for a software package like this, and you need to activate the software and register it at the company's website (you'll need to set up an user account). The package also comes with a code that gets you some bonus content. I had problems with getting that. There really isn't any clear instructions as what to do with the code. I went out to the CATOON web site and couldn't figure out where to input the code. Doing a little research I finally figured out that you had to access the website through the web portal inside the software itself. Then I had the problem of how exactly to do that  the icon/button isn't marked very clearly (IMO). But I eventually found it (upper right-hand corner of the screen, black square with the letters CO and a blue dot inside the O). Since I had already set up an account with the Catoon store all I had to do is put in the code and check out. Make sure that the amount shown is $0.00 otherwise there was something wrong with the code. At first I was a  bit underwhelmed with the downloaded content, but after taking a better look at it  I changed my mind. You get three folders of stuff,  Videos, Songs, and Sound Fx. For the video, you get ten short abstract video pieces ranging from 5~27 seconds in length. You can use these for a variety of things. Songs, you get twenty pieces of music, and for Sound FX you get forty various generic sound effects. Not a whole lot of stuff, but some pieces that might come in handy. You can look around the Catoon store while you're there and check out some of the free stuff, but be aware  there is licensing on all the content there for the specific usage of the material. Be sure to first check to see what you're agreeing to before you use something you got for free.  The Magix Movie Edit Pro 2016 was easy to jump in and get started using  but then I've had experience using similar video editing packages in the past. Someone new to video editing will probably be facing a pretty steep learning-curve trying to use this software for the first time. The company has provided a fairly detailed 400 page PDF user manual to read, but my suggestion is to go online and check out the video tutorials that are available on the companys website. These short videos are more a overview of someone demonstrating many of the software's features than actual tutorials  but you do learn something from viewing them. I first worked my way through the software by having one of the videos open on one of my screens and the software up on the other, and following along as the video played. This is probably a good place to mention something that sort of irked me about the tutorial videos. There are three different versions of this video editing software available (Pro, Pro Plus, and Pro Premium). The tutorials aren't very clear as to what features are in what package (well, they sort of do, I just didn't pick up on it). So after viewing the videos before I actually got the software, I was a bit disappointed that the Pro version didn't include some of the features that I was really wanting to try out (screen capture for instance). Still, go check out the videos if you're just starting to use this software for the first time, or are considering buying it.  The interface and actual operation of the software was similar enough to what I've used in the past that I was able to get started with no problems. Like I mentioned at the start of this review, I've got a number of video device (too many really). The issue with that is there are a couple different video file formats each of those produce. But the  Movie Edit Pro can handle all of those. I'm able to import and edit everything. Some of the features I like with this new editing package are  the title / subtitle feature. I make a lot of video sideshows for people using the photographs and I found that titling images is something that a lot of people appreciate. Having the ability to choose a location for the text and changing up the look of the font is really helpful. I also like that you can choose a stock menu when you burn a project to a DVD or  Bluray.  I also have Magix's Music Maker 2016 Live on my computer, and like that the music files made with it can be directly used for this video editing package. It's great to make a custom soundtrack for a slide show in Music Maker and then simply drop it into the audio track in Movie Edit.  I could probably go on and on about the things I like with this software, but that's enough. I have to say I really enjoyed checking this out and think it will be something I'm going to keep using for awhile. I'd recommend it to anyone needing to edit the videos that they too probably have piling up on their computers and devices.  Just in case it might be helpful - I'm running this software on a five year old computer  a HP HPE-190t desktop with an i7 processor and 12GB of ram running Windows 7 Pro. I've got two monitors, a 27 and a 24 which works well as I can set the main program up on the larger screen and use the smaller one for the video pre-view window.	1
This product will let you import many different video formats , track objects in your video with text attached, stabilize the image, add effects,optimize your image, and optimize the sound. It is easy to use for beginners, yet sophisticated for more advanced users. You can also download the software to your 64-bit windows windows system if you do not have a DVD drive. If you are going to do 4k / HD video editing, then the recommended hardware is quad-core and 8 GB of RAM	1
Oh, Boy, where to begin? So many problems. This is an unusable, bloated 4GB+ piece of shoftware.  I'm using this program on a Windows 10 (64-bit) machine with Intel core i3 and 16 GB RAM. The program kept crashing. Each time I get the message: "Attention! The current project was saved automatically. However, internal memory structures may be damaged that do not enable correct saving. It is recommended that the movies are saved with new names for further editing. <Continue program> <Close program>."  Although I'm given the options to "continue program" or "close program" the program doesn't respond to clicks on either option. Right-clicking the Windows taskbar to "Close window" doesn't do any good either. The only thing that works is the "End task" function in Task Manager.  The user interface is unintuitive. Examples: (1) the drag-and-drop to add media is limited to a tiny column in the timeline interface. I found this out only by trial and error. (2) Drag-and-drop of effects (like transition) results in the effect being applied to the beginning of the clip, not where you drop the effect. (3) I haven't found a way to apply the effects to just a part of the clip and not the entire clip. I was sure there's a way, which was why I consulted the help function, which brings me to the next point.  The antiquated Help user interface looks like something from Windows NT. That's not my real beef however. What I have a problem with is the help information doesn't direct you to the navigational breadcrumb you can follow to perform the function you're seeking help on. For example, a search on how to rotate a movie results in information on how to set the angle of rotation, how to set the rotational axis, etc. but nothing on how one might navigate one's way through the layers of navigational menus and buttons to access the rotate function.  This next point I'm bringing up is a BIG problem. The thumbnails on the timeline is so small I can't make out what part of the video each thumbnail corresponds to. They might as well not be there at all. Inserting or overlaying an effect or sound at a precise location without the aid of [usable] thumbnails is a real pain!  I want to be fair and provide a balanced view of this program. This program does some things well like sharpness, brightness, contrast, color, and other adjustments. If that's what you're using this program primarily for, it's fine. But for anything more sophisticated (like adding lots of effects to your movie), not so much.  I've used Sony Movie Studio, Pinnacle Studio, Windows Movie Maker (free), and others. This has got to be the bottom of the barrel. It has stability issues (at least on my machine) and usability issues. I would not recommend this program. (Note, I'm not endorsing any of the aforementioned programs. Do your own research and pick the program best suits your needs.)	-1

It's easy and produces MP4 results I can upload to many sites. I've tried more complex software and returned to my old favorite. This one may change my mind. It is still easy, but has much more flexibility. It also has two wizards that make slide shows and soundtracks even easier. You have multiple tracks to work with. It took me a while to find the export mode, I was looking for, but it was there. (I like to save MP4s to my computer and then upload them to various sites from there. The settings I needed were hidden under export as MP4. You can choose settings that will make smaller files if you look for them (the default is enormous). There is a site associated with the program that offers media (some free, mostly for sale.) I was nervous about this, because most of it (from the link) was in another language. Quite a bit of music , along with other media, is included without using the site. For those who want something a little more advanced than Movie Maker, but not as complex as a professional production program, this one is worth a try.  (I've included a short video I made while trying it out--hope it uploads.) Be sure to watch the included sample video--it reviews all of the program's video effects including slow motion, collages, and a picture (video) inset into your video,	1
I wanted to like this software. I wanted something a little more than what Windows Movie Maker has to offer...and in that regard, this doesn't disappoint. It's semi-complicated if you compare it to something basic like WMM, but the wizards made basic video and slideshows easy to navigate.  What I don't care for is the small font size  between looking at numbers all day at my bank job and then coming home and trying to make a video beyond a basic one  well, let's just say my eyes were too worn out for this.  And then when I did get a video edited that I felt was good enough to upload, 25% of the time my computer locked up on me and I wasn't able to save the video or even close out the Magix software.  This software is installed on a 2 year old Windows 10 PC, 64 bit, 3.4 Ghz processor speed and 4 GB memory.  According to the software box, my computer has more than enough for the MINIMUM requirements, but not enough RAM for 4K/HD editing, which I wasn't trying to do.	-1
I finally ended up uninstalling this on my main PC. Most of my systems have Windows 10 on them, and even though it is supposed to be compatible, it didn't work. In addition, it took a lot of resources to work. It doesn't help that W10 takes up a lot of resources already.  I'm an Adobe user. If you are familiar with the product then you know it's not the easiest to use.  So I use Corel VS7 for those faster projects. I was hoping to use this one for when my grand daughter wants to make home movies.  I have a laptop with Windows 8.1 on it. I will try that one	-1
Long ago - only a few years actually - I was a big fan of Magix products.   They delivered tremendous value for the money even though they were often unstable.   That was then: this is now.   The budget movie editing software market has lots of entries. MACIX Movie Edit Pro is just one of them and while not at all bad, it is not a stand out.   Cyberlink PowerDirector, TrakAx inexpensive and very much worth trying), Adobe Premiere Elements, Corel VideoStudio, all of them and more provide virtually identical features.   MAGIX Movie Edit Pro 2016 isn't bad by any stretch of the imagination. The Plus version for a few dollars more is a better selection.   Stability on an Intel i7 box running Windows 10 was okay: I had no crashes, though I didn't work the program really hard.   If you've used other video editing programs, there really isn't a learning curve. If you'r enew to video editing, download the manual from the Magix site and the trial version and grant yourself the time to work through it. Don't assume that you'll instantly be a competent video editor.   On the whole, MAGIX Movie Edit Pro 2016 is a pedstrian offering: nothing bad, nothign really great. It will get the job done for you as long as the job isn't very demanding.  Jerry	1
I had problems with Magix Movie Edit Pro 2016 Plus software from the beginning. I upgraded to Windows 10, so I don't know if some of the issues I encountered were due to the upgrade, but the box states that Windows 10 is a compatible platform. One disclosure is that I have no GoPro or action camera footage that I was working on. I converted my old home videos to digital MP4 format and this was my primary source material. Many of the video tapes were half full while others had blue screen blanks that I wanted to delete.  First, I could not use the disk that I ordered. My laptop has a disk drive and successfully reads Kaspersky Internet Security disks, movies on disk, and other software I have ordered on disk. Ive never had an issue until this software, so I was forced to download it.  Once downloaded, I could not register the software, so I could not use it. I received a cryptic message (error -24 serial number is used by another email). Users need to email customer service first and wait to receive a trouble ticket before they can call. Once I received an emailed trouble ticket, I tried for more than a week to call a customer service number that I looked up on the Internet but there was never an answer. Finally, I discoveredd a number among the package literature and reached a live person. This person told me to uninstall & reinstall the software. The problem was that during the registration process where I am led along from screen to screen, I had used one email address for verifying registration and used a different one for product emails. This is a no-no, but I could not have known this in advance. So I uninstalled the software & downloaded it again.  Once it was registered properly, I watched the tutorials. I confess I did not wade through user blog forums. I had difficulties because in the tutorial, the sample screen and pointers to items were different than my own product screen. I could not find options that were shown on the tutorial. It was exasperating. Finally, I asked my brother to help me since he is the family movie maker and uses numerous, popular video/film software. He could not figure out what to do to work on a MP4 video during his visit and spent an hour or two fooling with the software features to no avail.  This software has an extremely steep learning curve and is unlike most of other popular film editing software.  I have been at this since May on and off. I dislike this software despite its host of features since it is not intuitive or user friendly.	-1
I've been using this to convert old family videos to a modern format.  It's been working beautifully.  It's powerful with an intuitive user interface...at least if you've previously used similar programs.  I don't know about your old movies, but my thirty year old ones needed a lot of work.  Image stabilization was nonexistent in my earliest cameras and was pretty weak in the later ones.  Exposures were okay when the swim meets were outdoors, but iffy for indoor events,  Magix Movie Edit Pro really helped make those old videos viewable again.  Thanks!	1
I was not previously familiar with Magix products, which is a European company.  This program is a video software suite.  It should be noted that this software if for a 64 bit system.   Once loaded, this program has an impressive array of features.  The largest issue is naturally the learning curve for absorbing the program is kind of steep.  Although I am familiar with some of the other leading brands, each program is a bit different.  Here, this program has a straightforward deck.  I simply loaded the desired photos and video and started to edit and play around.  The best learning for this program was just simply playing around with the various features.  At this point, I am initially messing with this program and as I continue to utilize this for various projects I will update this review.  Overall:  I am very impressed with the power of the software.  Its fantatstic.  A bit of a learning curve as suggested above, but lots of neat features.  The titling templates are very useful.	1
While I consider myself very computer literate there remains one type of software I can't quite wrap my arms around: video editing software. Having played around with this product for the last several weeks it appears the mental block is still firmly lodged in place.  Flashback. When I first started really using computers in the late 1980s I had a tremendously difficult time understanding the concept of the "root directory." When I started dabbling with the Apple OS in the early 1990s I had a similar problem understanding the concept of the "alias." Looking back I'm amazed at how difficult I found what now seems to be such simple and straight-forward concepts. But then, ugh!  I bring all of this up because the fault with this software lies not with the software but with this user - Yours Truly. What I've played around with and read about in the very detailed user's manual (.pdf version is included) points to an incredibly powerful software suite. But I still can't quite figure it out (yes, I know even young kids are editing video these days, but it's also true that 2-year-olds seem to have no problem speaking Finnish either...!). I'm having a tough time even loading raw video footage and knowing what to do with it. It's not almost embarrassing; it's embarrassing.  The closest parallel I can come up with was when I had to learn WordPerfect 4.2 while in grad school. What an incredibly steep learning curve, but once conquered what incredibly good software. This is how I feel here; I can sense how good it is even though I can't quite get there yet.  Sad to say, then, that I am utterly unqualified to provide any real insight. But that might be the best thing I can contribute to the review database: there seems to be a steep learning curve, but if one perseveres the gains are sure to be there.  I know I'm going to keep plodding on in the hope that down the road I'll look back and wonder why I found it so difficult to use. I'm also hoping that I'll be able to look back and see that I've mastered the task (just like I did MS-DOS, Apple OS, and WP 4.2! Don't think I'll be learning Finnish, though!).  Summary: 4 stars. I can see how good it is (even if I can't quite get there). Doesn't change the fact of how silly I feel not being able to provide a better evaluation.	1
While I have to admit that I don't use extensive movie editing software often, I've used the simplistic Movie Maker that comes with Windows. It is really easy to use and has basic transitions and editing capabilities. I did not find Movie Edit Pro to be very intuitive and it took (as expected with a learning curve) quite a bit of time for me to learn enough to do some simple video import and editing. While my second experience did go better, it is still a little clunky and awkward for me. But it has a ton of options that I will continue to work with and learn.	1
It works fine on Windows 7. I've not tried it on the other computers in the house but I figure if it works good on 7 then it will work on others as well. It was an easy download and things went smoothly. There is a free trial version you can get from the company if you want to play with it awhile before deciding whether you want to buy one or not. If you are into taking movies at home, school, work, wherever, you will really love this and have a great time using it. I have used other programs before but this one is by far the easiest to use. It's best if you do the tutorial unless you are already familiar with how to do it. I have used others but since they are all different I tried the tutorial first and that made it easier for me. I wish this had all been around when my daughter was born because I would have loved to have videos of that time period. As it is the pictures are fading and the slides are obsolete and useless now. This would be great editing school ball games as well or those special moments like weddings. I love this program!	1
A good value for the price, easy to install and use.  Overall I found it it to be fairly easy to use and very user friendly which makes it a good choice for beginners as well as more experienced users.	1
This software is amazing....so  simple to use!  I should mention at the outset that I am NOT a professional movie maker or anything along those lines.  I am a dad who likes to take HD video of our vacations and family outings, and who likes to transfer those experiences to Blue-ray disc without deterioration of their quality.  I also like to layer titles on top of the main events, like "Christopher's 13th Birthday," or "Our Arrival in Anchorage," things along that line.  Lastly, I like to have a snazzy opening title that you click on at the beginning to start play, just to kick things off in an impressive way.  This software allows me to do all of that and more.  Also be aware that I have used many different options in an effort to achieve the above, including (to name a few) Adobe Premiere Elements (worked well, but then would not open anymore for some reason), Corel Video Studio Pro (one of the better ones), and Cyberlink PowerDirector 14 (terrible...kept locking up my computer).  This one from MAGIX is about the best one I have found as far as easy to use and simple to maneuver around in.  The AVCHD (.MTS) files from my SD card loaded amazingly fast into the timeline.  Titles were simple to apply.  Burning to a BD disc was also simple and fairly fast (about an hour for a little over 60 minutes of HD video).  Note that as you process a project for the first time, the software tells you that it needs to go online for certain codecs, and once you click "Okay" they're loaded in about 15 seconds.  Cool.  I should add that you do need a little experience with this kind of editing software to feel your way around...or at least that significantly helps.  If this is the first time you've ever used software to edit your videos, it may take you a little longer to figure out how to move forward.  To help with this, as you move your cursor over each option a pop-up message tells you what each is for.  It does come with a little booklet in several languages, but that just tells you how to load the software, which really is a mindless exercise.  If you do need help as you get underway, you'll need to make use of the help option within the software itself, or go online for this.  Overall, though, I am highly pleased with this option for video editing. It is not overly complex, but it gives me everything I need to save my family memories to disc or to file.  Highly recommended!  I hope my experience with it helped, and if things change as I use it more and more (which I will), I will update this review.  Thanks for reading!	1
This new upgrade of MAGIX Movie Edit software is the "plus" version with the most extensive features they offer with their editing suite. This is the version that comes with an installation disc although you can also obtain an online download installation of the program. This package offers a full range of tools for professional quality video editing. The interface is pretty user-friendly and you will be able to quickly learn the workings of this program, including exploring some of the more advanced editing features. Just be sure to have a strong processor, lots of RAM, and plenty of disk space when working with this - if you don't then the program will crawl or freeze up your system. This program is of similar quality and scope to other popular video editing applications, and you may find it a bit easier to work with than some other programs. Overall I have to say this is a good value.	1
I am not an expert at editing video/movies but enjoy doing it.  For this reason, I need software that is intuitive and not with a steep learning curve.  That is why I like the Movie Edit Pro by MAGIX.  The software downloaded smoothly, easy to install and I was able to immediately start using it with the minimum of instructions.  There are other features that may take more time, but you can produce very nice movies and photo shows without getting bogged down in details.  Having the option to learn more, however, is also helpful.  If you enjoy editing videos/movies or photo shows and want something powerful but easy, this is the software to buy.	1
There are many competitors in the very crowded market for video editing software.  This one has a good feature set and is pretty easy to do the basics with, but learning the more advanced features is time consuming.  If you have used previous versions of competing products, I wouldn't switch at upgrade time because of the extra learning curve.  If, however, this is you first purchase of this class of software, this product will do the job for you if you have patience to learn it.	1
The Movie Edit Pro has as many features as other software of a similar type, but the 3D section cannot be output to another device or downloaded to your computer. I'm thinking I'll have to wait until they update the software to be able to use that. I was very disappointed this didn't work because it's a feature Roxio and other software of this type doesn't provide.	1
This is a new program for me, but it has pretty quickly become my favorite movie editor. I am not an expert at movie editing. In fact, I have 50 or 60 hours of video that I have taken with my phone or GoPro but have not put together for sharing with others. Part of the problem has been the rather rudimentary editing programs that have been dispensed with cameras or computers that I have purchased. Movie Edit Pro is both fuller featured than the afterthought programs and more intuitive. Even though it was a completely new program to me I was able to make a DVD full of videos of my dog complete with navigation. There are a lot more feature that I haven't begun to explore. There is an online manual that you can download that is nearly 400 pages long, which hints at just how much there is to learn before you have mastered this.  The one thing I would like to change is the installation options. This package came with only the option to install via a DVD player. I do not, however, own an external DVD player, so I have no way to get this onto my laptop, which is the computer that I use most of the time. I will probably get an external DVD drive in the near future, but it is frustrating not to have options. Movie Edit Pro is hardly the only software developer that limits you to only one installation option. Companies make it possible for the user to install the program on more than one computer, but that assumes that every computer has the same capabilities as every other. I would really like to master this program, but that is not going to happen so long as I have to do all of my editing on the computer I use less than the others.	1
This is my first time using this kind of software, I am not a tecky person. So I will rate this according to how easy is it for a beginner to use. can edit videos to make them match the music you want.  has an easy to use menu bar. I had to play with the tool bar because I wanted to know what everything did before I did it. 360 degree editing that was fun! I also like object tracking allowing me to make an image in the background stand out more.you can do stylish touches I did beginner ones cause I was playing around. Compatable with windows ten as well. There are many more features I am learning to use. I like that someone who does not know a whole lot can use this pretty easily. I say it is a lot of fun. Love it	1
Magix is a European software publisher and has been around for a long time. They publish a range of audio and video products as well as others.   Ive been using their video and music products for years. On the whole, the products perform well and are typically updated annually. Some annual versions have been better than others, particularly in terms of stability. In fact, with Movie Edit Pro, the stability issue became so severe a few years ago, I pretty much switched to Cyberlink PowerDirector.   Movie Edit Pro 2016 Plus, so far in limited testing, is stable on Windows 10, but its still early in the game.   In terms of features, there is great competition among the entries on this run of video editing which includes Adobe Premiere Elements, Cyberlink PowerDirector, Corel VideoStudio and a very interesting upstart, TrakAxPC. Each entry is competent and can satisfy the needs of the casual to fairly advanced videomaker.   This edition of Movie Edit Pro comes with a couple of very useful extras, ProDADs Mercalli v2 image stabilization, which is very effective and the New Blue Titler, which is a pretty good package. Many action cam features have been added and if you have a GoPro or similar action cam, this will more than satisfy your needs. There is also limited support for 360 degree editing, where you can import 360 footage but not export it as 360. This is a feature with zero interest to me.   You can create up to 99 multimedia tracks, sync multiple cameras (which works well and is very handy), do limited color grading of your video, work with ChromaKey and a lot more. Object tracking has been vastly improved, so if you want to obscure someones face as they walk or run, it is much easier now. The keyframing feature has been substantially upgraded and is now on a par with that in Cyberlink PowerDirector.   Dont be lulled into believing that there isn't a learning curve with Movie Edit Pro. There is and it is fairly seep once you leave the very basics behind.   I strongly urge that you download the 30 day free trial and, in particular, the 399 page manual. At the very least, do browse through the manual to learn what features are available in the program.   Movie Edit Pro, by the way, can be used to produce some very sophisticated slide shows.   Overall, the feature list is long and the program has the potential of being very useful. It is  a bit of pain to install: I had to provide my product code at least four times and go online three  times after installation for additional downloads, permissions and registration.   Movie Edit Pros Use Interface is not particularly intuitive and you my initially find it confusing and intimidating. Dont try to bull your way through it: watch the online tutorials, read the manual or both. Take your time. In about half an hour or so, youll pick up the basics.   Overall, I give this program a four out of five. Id like a more intuitive interface. As I remarked earlier, Ive had stability issues in the past and am a little nervous about the future. Time will tell.  Jerry	1

While Pinnacle Studio may not win any major movie editing awards it is pretty killer for home use. I have used final cut pro on macs and that software is pretty easy but highly complex, Pinnacle Studio is a little more challenging but is really not that much more difficult. The installation went well on my year old computer, it took about 30 minutes to get it installed and be up and running with minimal drag on my system. I tested it by using previous video clips and editing them together just to see how long it would take and what effects I could throw in in addition to testing rendering speeds. At the end of my test I was pleased with the results. While it wasn't as fast as I would have liked it to be my system is a year old and frankly was not designed for video editing but it was able to keep up. I have a new system coming and will be installing this on it for additional testing once it arrives. The interface is not bad, pinnacle has a really good layout. Simply you load your videos up, drag them to the video timeline window. You can then mix multiple audio tracks controlling each channel pretty easily. Adding transition and effects is as easy as clicking on the part you want it and clicking the effect you want, then a little fine tuning. One of my favorite features is the ability to rate effects, this way when you are looking for your favorite ones they can be easily located and the effects you don't like you don't have to keep thumbing through. Another great feature is the ability to balance your background audio with the foreground audio, very easy to do. There are a lot of great videos on youtube that show you demos and examples of how to use this, I would check them out, I really like this software, it's pretty easy to use once you get the hang of it and offers a lot of really great features and effects that rival Microsoft Movie Maker. BUT not everyone needs the features this have, if you just want basic, bare bones video trimming and titles you don't need this and movie maker will work for you. If you want full control including audio track controls and filters for the video along with other transitions I do recommend this.	1
I've used Pinnacle software for years for light editing, and this seems to be a stable release with added features (which I probably won't use).  I have a moderately powered computer and everything seems to work well.  Pros: -Easy installation -Stable -Not too taxing of computer's power	1
We have both this version and the Ultimate version of this software. The Ultimate version (which I have on my home computer) is littered with extraneous materials and options that most folks will never use (and has a considerably higher price tag). And, if I am to believe two of my friends, has a nasty tendency to crash (though that has never happened to me). Now, I have this Plus version on my office computer ... it does everything I need and at a perfect price.  I have had no issues with this crashing, I have made a couple of "nice" projects for my classes, and I have never found myself wanting the little "bells and whistles" on my Ultimate home version.  If you are torn between this Plus and the Ultimate version, I have used both. I greatly prefer the Plus version.	1
Pinnacle Studio 19 Plus is  good mid-level video editing software. Its price point and functionality are targeted towards the beginner-intermediate editor, and it works reliably, has powerful editing capabilities, and import/export functionality. I run it on a Windows 10 computer (about 1.5 years old) and haven't had an issues with it. This is a solid software choice if you're looking for editing software for personal or family videos, or for basic work/technical film editing.  The learning curve is reasonable and in 1-2 hours, you can do basic editing and video composition. The more sophisticated inputs and channels will take a little longer to learn - but still approachable. The interface of the program isn't too cluttered, and common tools have shortcuts.  YouTube has been invaluable for finding tutorials on how to do different things, and I've relied on it a lot.	1
Our ten year old is making videos for different games that he places on you tube, mainly Minecraft, but some others.  He was having difficulty editing video with the standard video editing software that I had put on his computer.  Some of the things that he does includes taking things out of the video that are distractions.  I know that he works on voice and controlling the noises in his videos.  He also adds some animations.  What I liked about the program was how intuitive and easy it was.  He just had to think about what it was that he needed to do and put it in words, and he could find how to do it.  He approves of this software completely.	1
I used to have an earlier version of this software that, if I remember correctly, was free. It was on my old computer and when that computer died I lost the software along with it. I remembered liking the software, so I was happy to be able to try it again in this newer version.  I have tried several types of video editing software and, to be honest, some of them are very difficult for this old lady to figure out. Pinnacle makes things much easier and is more user-friendly. I've watched tutorials and just played around with it and think this is going to work for me. Maybe I'll even be able to start doing video reviews now.  I received the Pinnacle Plus edition. There is also an Ultimate Edition which has more options and if you're heavy into video editing software you might want to spring for a few bucks more and get the Ultimate edition. For me, the Plus edition is more than enough and I am very happy to have this software again. I installed on a computer that is still running windows 7 and it installed and is working fine for me. Very happy with this new version of software that I had lost when my old computer died.	1
ATTENTION!!  FYI, You can NOT install ANY version of the Pinnacle Studio 19 editing programs onto an external drive! So will they do anything to correct it?? Yeah, they're going to CONSIDER changing it back (the older versions allowed you to!) to allow it again, on their FUTURE  Editions! Uh huh, I said, "Future". So it only gets 2 stars in my opinion for what it offers and its price $ but the fact that they removed an important option totally ruins it for me and anyone like me that tries to keep as much free space on their c drive as they can. This would fill mine up in a blink with the footage I edit. Who wants to have to upgrade their computer to edit videos on the C drive,  when the older editions all allowed you to use external drives! *I could not find WHY they downgraded this (and ALL the) new Studio 19's to not allow installing it on to an external drive! It is CRAZY to intentionally DOWNGRADE an important feature for so many that edit lots of HD footage.	-1
With the right program, even an amateur can create a polished production. This software offers a generous menu of features including live screen capture and auto ducking. I had no problems loading it but found it slow at times. Free training is available for thirty days. It is worthwhile, especially for amateurs and I do wish it was free for the life of the software. Although I am far from mastering all of its features, it does have plenty to inspire. It is a good program for folks with a working knowledge of editing software.	1
A lot of features for not a lot of price, it does have a bit of a learning curve but they provide a lot of lessons and guidance on how to use each feature. If you have any background with video editing, this offers an easy step into some useful task, though not entirely advanced compared to other programs. I'd heartily suggest it for people who aren't willing or interested to jump in to the more professional programs, or are interested but they're budget isn't--but who want to have more creative possibilities than what a basic program like Windows Movie Maker or lower end/price programs. This is also a really good stepping stool for those higher end products. Get to know basics and exploration on this, then if and when you find you come to the end of what it offers, move on. The expensive programs really are overkill for the great majority of people (and I say this as someone who has the Adobe suite and realize that even as an educator I'm paying more than what I reasonably need to use).  Great middle ground software that would fit most people's needs and spark a lot of creative development	1
I had used Pinnacle Studio 17 plus. I found it a little clunky, but it was usable. I was sad I got plus because I didn't realize there was a higher ultimate version and there was no way to upgrade. So this time I'm glad to be getting ultimate.  Things that are new for 19: -Project Bins--a bin that you can throw a bunch of video/sound that you want to use, or a way to put video/sound into a organized bins without having to move the videos from the folders they really are located in. The bins contain video links, not the actual videos. This is great for me. I like having my videos organized by time and events. Also I have tons of videos and pictures in one folder. This allows me to grab the best and bin them without creating duplicate video folders and taking up more space. It helps me not to have to go through a folder with hundreds of pictures/videos over and over again. I love this feature! (And they needed to add it since Adobe Elements 13 added it) -Even more effects--like I didn't waste enough time already over effecting my home videos... Thankfully there's now a favorite section so you can put your favorite effects where you can easily get to them. -Multicam support--If you have a party or wedding or wherever you might have more than one people videoing, it's pretty cool to be able to jump around the cams. If you have audio for your videos, it even tries to line them up automatically! -Support for more file types and better 4k support.  When you open it up, it looks very similar to 17 or 18. It's an evolution and refinement with more features. It's good to know they didn't change everything! It's run pretty smoothly so far, but I have a pretty powerful computer. I don't have anything higher than 1080p to play with, but I've not had issues. I do suggest you use the system requirements as a very minimum requirement. I wouldn't try running this on anything less than an i5 with 8GB of ram and would prefer to have an actual video card in there too--and that may still give you a lot of waiting when crunching higher res video. I wish Pinnacle would give you a suggested computer setup for different levels of performance. I'm running it on an XEON 1650v3 with an NVIDIA Quadro K2200 and 16GB of ram. That's basically the equivalent of a high end i7 and a GTX 750. You're going to have a completely different experience running this on your $400 laptop than a performance machine. Video editing takes a lot more processing than picture editing.  But I was able to trim, split, combine single and multiple HD videos with no issues. I could have saved in many formats and DVD. It does bluray with an additional purchase. But, disk based media is practically dead. I'm just glad it lets me save it as a mp4. It will also export to Facebook, Youtube, and Vimeo.  My understanding is that Pinnacle provides little if any support. And I think that's the main disadvantage over Adobe Premier Elements. I can google all sorts of issues with Adobe Premier Elements and find all kind of help. It may be slow support with a strong accent, but I can call Adobe. Pinnacle Studio does have tutorial videos on their site and on Youtube. It looks like more videos for 19 are coming and most of the 18 videos do apply. There is a knowledge base in the support section and the ability to email support (free for 15 days from purchase...). If it works great, you're good. If it doesn't work for you or you have problems with the program--good luck...  But for me it's been working great. It hasn't crashed once. The way it works makes sense to me. If you're still deciding, go to youtube and search for "Pinnacle Studio 19 Ultimate - Basic Editing Beginners Tutorial". That will give you an idea of how the program works. I think Premier Elements is a little bit easier for a beginner, but I think it's easier to do some more complicated things with Pinnacle Studio.	1
The speed improvements are tremendous. Using only a minimally equipped laptop, but with eight decent gigs of RAM, my previews run far better than they would have in version 18.  I love the variety of effects that come in the Ultimate Edition's bonus software, with choices that are suitable for nearly any category of subject.  Transitions and effects are easy to implement on the topmost layers overlapping element edges below. I heve yet to experiment with the new audio tools, but they seem capable.	1
I've used Pinnacle Studio in the past and I've been so pleased with it, but I have had nothing but troubles when using this latest version. It has been glitchy and freezes when I'm trying to upload media files. It acts like it's searching my entire computer for media, but the screen freezes and I get stuck.  The editing capabilities are fine (and about what I expected based on previous versions). I was especially drawn to the ability to handle multi-camera editing, but it was so slow to load and so buggy even when the media did eventually get loaded.  I've installed it on the same exact computer that I used for the previous version of Pinnacle, the only difference is that I have "upgraded" from Windows 8 to Windows 10. I loved it in the past, and I really wanted to love it again, but until I can put together a video without wanting to hurl this software out the window, I'm hesitant to give it more than two stars.  Perhaps they'll fix some of these bugs and glitches so that it will run smoothly.	-1
I use video editing software for home video achieving and for sending videos of my kids to their grandparents who live far away... not exactly 'professional' use, however I do like a video editor with a good interface, solid set of features, and stability. Unfortunately, Pinnacle Studio 19 isn't that editor.  First, as other reviewers have mentioned, you're required to install this program on your boot drive. I have multiple drives which I use for my main drive, app drive, games, etc. Forcing me to install on my boot drive is ridiculous and limiting. I contacted support and this was confirmed...  I normally use CyberLink PowerDirector for my video editing, which, for the most part, has been fine for my needs. Pinnacle Studio's interface is very familiar coming from PowerDirector, so I was able to get editing pretty quickly. I immediately noticed that various features seemed more cumbersome to access. Outside of simply dragging and dropping video clips, it seems all other features require one or two extra clicks compared to PowerDirector, which I found slowed me down considerably.  My biggest complaint would have to be the stability... on the very first project, I spent about 15 minutes putting a video together (about 12gb), saved it, then tried to render it only to have the program crash. I restarted my computer, opened Pinnacle Studio back up, reloaded my project, and again, once I tried rendering, it crashed. I was able to render it only after starting from scratch and doing the exact same thing...  Since then, it's crashed quite a few times, to my frustration, since the crashes seem to corrupt the project I'm working on. I tried using the on my wife's laptop, with the same results.  In the end, after nearly a month of trying to using Pinnacle Studio, I'm back with PowerDirector....	-1
After an absence of many years, Ive recently started posting videos to YouTube again.  Ive just been doing clunky editing using Windows Movie Maker, but I want to start using some of the fancy features I see in so many other videos these days  picture in picture, special effects, a fancy opening, etc.  So its the perfect time for me to fire up the newest version of Pinnacle Studio Ultimate and try to learn how to use it.  I had an older version of this software (16, I think)  but I was lazy and never really applied myself to learning it.  Good enough editing just isn't good enough anymore, though, so I have to step up my game.  One big con with this product is the complete lack of documentation that comes with it.  OK, I understand that printed manuals are taboo now in the digital age, but would it kill you, Pinnacle, to actually post a user guide of some sort online?  Its a big problem because I am currently unable to edit any videos taken from my webcam.  The audio plays at supersonic speed, making me sound like Mighty Mouse on helium  and I have yet to find any way to fix this (or explain why it is happening).  It happens on previous videos I open as well as new videos I film using my webcam software within Pinnacle.  Having the ability to open my webcam software within Pinnacle Studio 19 Ultimate and record my video there is a nice feature  but it does me no good for the time being.  The audio is fine, though, if I try to edit other videos or live screen captures.  I wish I could wait and post this review later on, after Ive had more time to figure out my problems and actually use this program, but Vine program rules demand that I post a review now.  So, all I can really talk about here are the features Ive read about.  One new feature I really like is audio ducking.  It seems like everybody and their brother are using musical backgrounds on YouTube these days, and I hate that because as often as not the music is too loud and makes it hard to hear what the person is saying.  Auto ducking allows you to tone down the volume of the background audio during the narration of the video.  If you're going to use music in your videos, I highly recommend taking advantage of this feature.  If you're a really fancy videographer and have a setup with multiple cameras, Pinnacle Studio 19 Ultimate features a really great tool for synching your videos  for up to six camera angles and two audio tracks.  That is probably not a feature I will be using, but I have watched some tutorial videos about it and find it really impressive.  People also seem to be excited about the addition of project bins, which afford you the advantage of grouping all of your files for each project together.  Obviously, given the problems Im having importing webcam videos, I cant give this product five stars.  Even if the problem is entirely my own fault, it should not be so difficult to find help in identifying and troubleshooting the problem.  Overall, this looks like really good video editing software  not very intuitive but certainly powerful.  Ive encountered no error messages or slow processing times working with my files, so it seems to be a very stable video editing program (unlike several other programs Ive used in the past).  If Im able to fix my audio problem with webcam captures, Ill update this review or add that information as a comment.	1
Ok, I know for about $20 more than the Plus version, this one has ALL the bells and whistles, it even has a  free 30 day Studio Backlot PS 19 training to help get you acclimated faster to utilizing all those bells and whistles and the bonus of accessing lots and LOTS of royalty free stock that is downloadable............... So why only 2 stars you ask?  My computer is set up so that all my pictures and videos are stored on external drives to keep as much free space on my C drive. When I tried to find a way to install this on the external drive, I could not! So I searched for a way to and couldn't find ANYTHING, so as it is still a relatively new release I called support  (and I hate calling support for anything, it is always so aggravating) well I learned that you can NOT install this on ANY drive other than your computer's C drive! Wait...... it gets better! You cannot install ANY version of Studio 19 on an external drive! So are they going to do anything about it...................?? Sure, they are going to "consider changing" that aspect of it back to allow this (their older versions let you do it!) on their future versions...... Yeah, "Future".... So I still gave it two stars for all it has and the price point but IMO the fact that they took away that VERY important option totally kills it for me. I would really need to upgrade my computer ($$$) a LOT to edit videos on its C drive, *and there is not ANY good reason that I could find WHY they downgraded this new Studio 19 to not allow for installing it onto an external drive! I am still in unbelief that they DOWNGRADED such an important feature for so many people editing lots and LOTS of HD footage.	-1
I'm an old time Corel user.  There was a point in time I could do just about everything with what the Corel product line offered.  It helped my cureer, but that was a long time ago.  I have to admit, when I see the name Corel attached to Pinnacle and needing a video editing program I decided on version 19 Ultimate.  Well, this isn't the easy simple to use version of Corel I once knew, it is much more of a challenge.  A challenge worth spending time on.  I've had this program for about a month and I have managed to put together a few short videos and I am happy with how they turned out.  I have much more to learn, and this program, I hope will become easier to use with time.  I wish I could be more helpful with telling you more about this program, but I'm still learning it myself.  There is a lot of support on the web.  I'm going to rate this 4 stars, just because it isn't an easy program and it takes effort on the user end to make it a great program.	1
This feature laden program is great for pros but a bit more challenging for amateurs like me. Installation was hassle free and there are, quite frankly, almost too many options. It is easy to become overwhelmed. The feature I use most is the auto ducking which suppresses background noise so narration and dialogue come through . The free training is helpful but I think they should provide it for the life of the product, not just thirty days. Unless you are a pro, it is unlikely that you will master all the ins and outs in thirty days. That being said, this is a comprehensive program especially beneficial where photography is either a profession or a passion.	1
My first impressions are very good.  $99 is a great value for what this software can do.  My two big needs are on-screen recording and multi-camera syncing and editing. Pinnacle Studio 19 Ultimate can easily do both. Just be sure to check your system requirements. Older machines may be sluggish with it.	1
I had not been a previous Pinnacle user.  But I have used Corel and Cyberlink.  That said, there is quite a learning curve for Pinnacle.  As a result I made liberal use of the free 30 day access to Pinnacle's Studio Backlot training.  And I am glad I did.  To begin to appreciate Studio 19 from a novice perspective, I found the training to be essential.  I downloaded the training files and followed along with the video tutorials and before I knew it I was producing videos.  This is power packed software.  It does pretty much every thing with video and sound and effects that I could ever imagine using.  And once I practiced, it got pretty easy to use.  The interface makes sense and the project bin concept that drives everything is very effective.  There is a SmartMovie machine built in for those inclined to let the program do some of the production and Photo Montage ability as well.  I knocked of one star because I think Pinnacle should allow access to training beyond 30 days without charging.  This is a robust and feature rich program so it would be nice to know I could go back to the website to maximize the Pinnacle experience without whipping out the credit card.	1
First, i am no video expert...photography is my 1st hobby.  But we all shoot video, and often need tools to make a final presentation.  Its a very complex field vs. single frame photography.  So Newbs, beware...there is many lower end, or even freebie programs to get started. I have used many video editors in the past...and damn, this Pin. 19 is quite intense, hard to fathom all this at such a reasonable price point.  Most of it is beyond what I would ever use, at least at the start.  Like, most of these programs which keep evolving over time, they are very feature rich, so newbs are often overwhelmed. I am most curious so far about 4k video....which so far, worked well.  What I really want to start exploring is 3d video!  But, upon initial review, I have a lot of studying to do, as 3d adds another layer of complexity to video.  But the fact at this price point, 3d editing is possible, well, I will slowly learn and explore this new medium. The user interface is good, assuming u have a somewhat of a graphics background, as many of these programs share some common interfaces.  Hard for me to ding a product with this much power, at this price point.  I appreciate some of the other reviewers comments, as I have learned from those as well.	1
Part of a trio of video editing software versions, this is the best. This new version has a couple of notable new features including a new multi camera editor, and New i7 (intel) support. Each version allows for more cameras with ultimate allowing up to 6. Other important pieces of the software include over 1500 titles, effects, and video templates  best of all, you can share that video on a few different web video services like YouTube, and facebook.  If you are not wedded to a particular eco system, then this is a very good place to go. The adobe video products are good, but I believe that this is a better and easier to use system.  The harder choice may be deciding if you want the standard, plus or ultimate. For most folks the standard will likely be fine and for those wanting more camera angles with synced audio, then the higher version will be your choice.	1
Ive had a long time love/hate with Pinnacle. I started using it when it was an independent company and gave up on it when it was acquired by Avid, who (in my opinion) practically destroyed the application and provided simply awful customer support. Like many others, I abandoned Pinnacle. It was bought by Corel and I didn't have high hopes for it.   Much to my surprise, Corel after years of flailing is making a concerted effort to rejuvenate their acquired product lines. PaintShop Pro which was on a downhill path is really a great program in its present iteration. I skipped sever iterations of Pinnacle Studio, but when offered the opportunity to evaluate Pinnacle Studio 19 Ultimate, I figured why not.   Overall I think Pinnacle Studio 19 Ultimate is vastly improved since my past outing with the product. But I will be sticking with Cyberlink Director.   The feature list is on the Amazon web page, but I suggest you also look at the Pinnacle Systems website as well. Pinnacle does not offer a trial download of Pinnacle Studio 19, but the manual is available. If you're a Cyberlink Director or Adobe Premiere Elements user considering a switch, I recommend downloading and perusing the manual before purchase.   Ultimately it comes down to a users preferences. This is probably not a program for absolute beginners, but like Cyberlink Director and Adobe Premiere Elements, it is a good place to continue after using Windows MovieMaker.   It installs easily, interfaces are a bit cluttered  which can be said of all its competitors as well  and has some features like 4K that few people will use right now. The New Blue Effects package is nice.   In toto, Pinnacle Studio 19 Ultimate is a nice serviceable video editing suite. With all the choices in the market, though, I would advise careful consideration.  Jerry	1
Pinnacle rocks! It is one of my favorite video editing software packages on the market. I can make all sorts of audio and video edits. Perfect in terms of usability and cost.	1
I love TurboTax. We use it to prepare our household taxes every year.  There is a table on the back of every box to help you pick which version you need. It has been accurate in my experience:  When I was young, I could get by with a 1040EZ, which is equivalent to TurboTax's free software. As my career progressed, I graduated to TurboTax Basic. When I married, our combined assets bumped us into Deluxe and then Premier. We don't own a business, so we may never need Home & Business.  Prior to this, I had never revisited Basic. I was curious to experience how much I was gaining from using Premier. Without going into too much detail, the difference is night and day. I think they sit too far apart in the gamut for an honest comparison, like comparing a Corolla to an Avalon. But it is clear that our family will never get by with Basic. Thankfully, this was provided to me free of charge under the Vine program, but otherwise, it would have been $30 wasted. I'll stick with Premier.  BOTTOM LINE: TurboTax is wonderful, but you should follow the advice on the back of the box. Don't skimp. Buy the version that's right for you. Don't be intimidated by the cost. You can write off the cost of the software as Tax Prep.	1
Good item fast shipping.	-1
I've tried both major tax software packages (this and H&R Block's) as well as the TurboTax Online version. While none of them is perfect, I think this is the best of the three. What sets this apart is that you have the option to do your taxes via a very simple interactive step-by-step "interview" or, if you know what you're doing, you can actually just jump from topic to topic. You even have the ability to just go to specific forms and fill them out directly. This flexibility means you can quickly fill out an area you're familiar with, but have the software lead you slowly through unfamiliar topics. I find that I generally go direct to things I've done several years in a row, but will do the step-by-step interview for areas that are new to me (e.g. when I first got married, or had kids, or got a small royalty check from a patent). If you get a form in the mail you don't recognize (1099-G, for example) you just do a search for it in the software and it tells you where to go.  My recommendation is that you save some money and start with this or Deluxe. If you actually come across anything that you really need a higher version for, or that would be nice to have, you can upgrade the software online and pay a bit extra, keeping all the work you've already done. The software makes it very easy to upgrade in-place in the middle of filling out your returns. My guess is that you won't ever have to, however.	1
This is easy to use tax software. I've used Turbotax to do my taxes for the last few years and I've always been happy with the results. It walks you through your taxes step by step with lots of helpful tips. Very easy to use!	1
First let me say that I live in Florida. Without the necessity of state filing, Turbo Tax Basic does the trick. Deluxe will probably be a better fit if you live in a state that does require filing.  The hiccups experienced last year seem to be cleared up, and this appears to be the old reliable Turbo Tax that so many have come to rely upon. The process is about as intuitive as it gets, and the software fires right upafter updates, of course.  I do recommend that you look at the Turbo Tax product comparison chart before you dive in, so there are no surprises. Basic is definitely just that, basic. The good news is, if you need to upgrade, the process is seamless.  Although Im still a little tender after last year, the truth is that  when they are not getting in their own way  Intuit makes some of the best tax and accounting software available. This years Turbo Tax seems to be representative of that fact. Hopefully, theyll keep it up!	1
Turbotax basic allows the beginning user, or the person with uncomplicated taxes to file a quick and easy return. It comes on CD, you just need to install it, run the program, and start filling out your income and personal information. If youve used the software before, it has an import feature to bring data in from your previous years return, so you have to work even less.  I usually file my return in less than half an hour.  This software guides you through all the steps, and tries to help you maximize on your return. Since my yearly tax return is uncomplicated, the basic version is suitable for my needs. For more advanced or complicated taxes, you might have to buy the more expensive version which has more features, forms.  Ive always liked Turbotax. It is a fast and easy way to help you get your tax return as fast as possible.	1
If in this life we find only death and taxes, one had better get TurboTax. As a software program which has been around for a number of years, it is the best. From the most elementary version such as this one to the most complicated do- it- all program, Turbo Tax  simply cannot be beat for this unpleasant yearly task. It walks you through each step, answers every question and provides an accurate tax preparation .If you have never used a tax prep program, we recommend TurboTax . It takes time, but it provides the satisfaction that your yearly taxes will be properly prepared IF you honestly follow the directions and fill in the blanks accordingly.	1
I've been a TurboTax user for so long, I can't remember when I started using it.  Like most, I had issues with last year's software as I file 1099-MISC, and I needed the Schedule C forms that were taken out of the version I used.  I did explore briefly H&R Block's solution (as they were offering it for free), but in the end I stuck with TurboTax.  This tax year, I'm picking this up to run a concurrent check, as we're going to have to go with an accountant or CPA to do our taxes, as we've had a LOT of life changes.  But still, I was advised to do my own return - just not file it, so I can know what to expect.  So I'll do that on TurboTax as well.  Hopefully Intuit continues to make this product going forward, as I find it easy to work with, especially since I go year to year, so much of the data is picked up from the previous year's form - I like that a lot.	1
We have been Turbo Tax users for many years now. Even when I had a small business and needed an accountant, I still used Turbo Tax to get a good idea as to what our tax liability would be.  Every single year, I was within a couple of dollars of our accountant.  Turbo Tax is a trusted brand in our house.  Highlights:  ~ Easy to Use! User Friendly!  Let Turbo Tax guide you and ask the questions! ~ Accurate ~ Easy transfer of data from previous years! ~ Includes 5 free e-files, so you can get the kids taxes done too! (Please Note:  It does not include State)    I have never understood why people pay companies to "do their taxes".  Turbo Tax is an economical and easy solution. It has the most up to date tax law and will continue updating for you!  Turbo Tax double checks your return and guarantees 100% accurate calculations!    Most people dread filing their taxes! Not here! Not with Turbo Tax. It is just so easy....Turbo Tax will put all your numbers in the right place on each form! You can check it at the end, e-file and safe a copy!  UPDATE:  When I first posted the review, I had done a quick review of our taxes and tested the software.  I wasn't ready to purchase the additional State software at the time, but assumed it would be flawless like in the past.  Wrong.  I was unable to complete the purchase for the State. It took me in an endless loop to add credit card information again and again.  I kept getting a message to "try again or go to support".  In addition,  I found two quirky tax situations that Turbo Tax is NOT able to handle. You have to manually go in and enter the information. This is in regards to a Long Term Disability Repayment for prior years.  Even with the prior years Turbo Tax files on my computer, it was unable to compute.  I contacted Intuit regarding another quirk - this is also in regards to a disability repayment. Turbo Tax shows an inflated income due to a repayment of LTD when SSDI kicks in. Due to that "inflated on paper" income, it makes your Premium Tax Credit (Marketplace Health Insurance) look as though you owe them back a portion of the money! Intuit promised me a return phone call that same day.  It has now been four days and I haven't heard from anyone.  To avoid further delay, my husband went out and purchased the Deluxe version with the State included. I had to remove this version from my computer.  The two quirks above still have not been addressed. I will enter the number manually as I have been told. As for the repayment of Premium Tax Credit....I guess we just have to wait to see how and if that is ever resolved.	-1
I have been a TurboTax user for years; in fact, I just checked and I have TurboTax files from 1999! This, the Basic edition, does not come with a state editionwhich is a let-down for me since I live in a state which requires a state tax return. The installation is very straightforward and since I am already a TurboTax user from years past, it is very easy to import last year's files and everything is filled out already. Very handy, especially if your work situation has remained the same.  I have found TurboTax to extremely thorough for 99% of the situations; it goes through just about every possible scenario and the only time I would suggest hiring a professional is if you are in a very complicated situation, with wills, trusts, retirement accounts and so forth, but I would still attempt to use TurboTax to serve as a check on the professional's work. Yes, it is that good.  Filing is easy, free, and straightforward. You're kept abreast of every step (the IRS has accepted your return, etc.) and are notified by email and text. Documentation can be accessed at any time, and it's copious. Even complicated tax information is clearly documented if you are willing to take the time to read. For the DIY-er, TurboTax is a boon, best in class.  TurboTax has taken everything into consideration, it even helps you estimate the value of donated items. A very rigorous error checking takes place before you file; it also includes the risk you run of getting audited while offering (paid) services to help you if the risk is high. Four and a half stars because it's missing the state returnwhich, while it is available for download, is quite expensive on its own.	1
My husband loves turbo tax, and when I saw this to try out, my husband said yes! However, for our family we probably need the premier one. While it's great that this is free, we just need the added benefits of premier. We are looking into purchasing that one.	1
Makes tax filing almost bearable.	1
My best friend tax season.	1
Easy to use. Well worth the price	1
First time user. Program was very easy to use. Asks questions about your situation, answer and that's about it.	1
I always buy H&R Block at the beginning of each year. As I found out H&R Block and Amazon always have a 50% discount at the beginning of each year for this software. For the past couple of years, I monitored this H&R Block SW price and I haven't found better price than this 50% discount. Here are my purchase record for the past couple of years.  o 01/07/2012 Got H&R Block Premium, Amazon special deal: $29.99 o 01/05/2013 Got H&R Block Premium, Amazon special deal: $26.99 o 01/03/2014 Got H&R Block premium, Amazon special deal: $31.99 o 01/02/2015 Got H&R Block premium, Amazon special deal: $31.99 o 01/02/2016 Got H&R Block premium, Amazon special deal: $31.95  I do my own tax return, mainly because I have complex tax situations...more than 7 schedule K-1 forms from various private placement investments (including 2 oil exploring investments with complex tax codes), more than 10 rental properties, and a sole proprietorship (for stock trading).  First of all, not all the tax-filer have the related experience or knowledge to handle my tax return (especially, the complex tax codes from oil exploring investments). Or it will cost me a fortune for an experienced CPA to do my tax return.  I was using Turbo tax initially, but I didn't find special advantage in Turbo Tax when comparing with H&R Block. So, I switched over to Tax Cut, and I have been using H&R Block for the past 8 years. It's not only cheaper, but also capable of handling my tax return's needs. It has an easy interview process to guide people to enter information. It allow me to fetch specific form to make manual modifications. I can do if-else analysis to assess different tax strategies with it. The cost of purchasing additional state tax packages is low (rental properties in various states that require me to file multiple state tax returns.).  To my experience, both Turbo Tax and H&R Block are not much difference in functions and capabilities. But I would recommend H&R Block for its value. (Don't get me wrong...I am not saying Turbo Tax is bad. But it's more expensive.)	1
This is the second year that I've purchased H&R Block Premium + State Tax prep software. I'd been wanting to try it for years, but my husband always did our taxes (some exercise in self-flagellation that I've never understood...) prior to that and despite the struggle putting pen to paper, he was reluctant to e-file until he made a mistake on our 2013 taxes. Not wanting to appear overly eager to dive in with the tech-rescue I suggested tax prep software and letting me have a go at it.  He mulled it over and said OK, so I then started reading reviews; deciding to go with H&R based upon the positives I'd read.  I had not completed my own taxes for over 25 years, so I was a tad intimidated by the prospect of doing them at all. Fortunately my experience with last year's H&R software was very positive, and left me feeling empowered, not fearful that I'd done it incorrectly.  Ultimately there were no errors and the filing was quickly accepted by the feds with an extremely fast e-file to refund payment. (My husband was THRILLED with that part of it!) That experience led me to purchase the 2015 software for tax preparations this year.  Right now my daughter is applying to colleges and we'll be filling out the FAFSA (Federal Financial Aid form) and the CSS Profile (Financial Aid form for private colleges) on January 1st. While I don't expect to have all the info I need to complete my taxes on that day, if I do I can use this software to easily complete it and accurately fill out these forms. If I don't have the info it's recommended to estimate earnings and taxes on the forms, but then after e-filing taxes, that info can quickly be uploaded to replace estimates. Yet another reason that e-filing is the way to go.  As for using this software in general, having all the proper information (W-2's etc...) was really important, as was having a list of deductions (we did itemized deductions due to a large number of medical bills). I needed the Premium version as I'm an independent contractor (freelance writer), and this version addresses self-employment (Schedule C reported income).  I like how this software 'interviews' you. It asks you questions and if you don't know the answer it offers help as to where to locate the information and tries to clarify information as needed. H&R also offers help to users via unlimited online chat with tax experts. You can work on part of your return and then save it to come back to it. It's a process that could take months or a few hours depending upon how complicated your return is and whether or not you have all the required information.  I purchased the 'Frustration Free' option and it came in a plain, white cardboard envelope inside an Amazon box with other items. I nearly threw it out thinking it was packing material!  The CD and installation instructions with an Activation code are what you get. Installation on my Windows 7 PC was super easy, and last year's tax info (W2s, 1099s and last years return) was immediately imported by this year's software.  According to the software the next update will be January 7th. Updates are fairly frequent, but the software offers to check for one each time you open it so you're never out of date. You also are asked what state return you wish to file, and this too is updated as needed.  In paying for this software you have up to 5 Federal returns for free. The State filing costs an additional $19.95 per return. You can input your credit card info for that transaction securely through the software.  While a tad daunting at first (because I didn't want to mess anything up...) this software does a great job at guiding the user to a successful conclusion. It explains things in effective detail so the user feels informed versus overwhelmed. The logical progression of needed information in the software makes it easier for users who are unfamiliar with doing their own taxes to gather the needed information and have it at their fingertips to add to the software. Filing both the federal and state returns is done easily, and error checking (accuracy review) is done multiple times prior to filing to ensure you have accurately filled out the forms and maximized your deductions.  H&R Block has produced a useful bit of software that techs and non-techs alike can effectively use to complete their taxes. It's Q&A style in gathering information is easy to follow and the results are better than expected.  It's a product that produced accurate, fast results for us last year, and it's the product I knew I wanted to buy this year too because of my prior year's experience.  If you're doing your own taxes, I highly recommend it.  ----------------------------------  UPDATE: 2/18/16  Finished my taxes (Federal and State) with this software to provide accurate FAFSA information for a college bound student. The software submitted my e-file and I had the Federal portion accepted within minutes of submission, and the State portion accepted the next day.  Since I had to pay federal taxes this year I deferred payment by direct removal from my checking account (something you can direct the software to do as late as 4/18/16) instead of paying a fee to pay by credit card.  Taxes are not fun, but this software definitely makes them easier to submit and understand.  -------------------------------	1
About the same as previous years.  OK.	1
Awkward and unclear balance sheet treatment.	-1
Great software.  I like the fact that Turbo Tax walks you through preparing your taxes.  It instantly calculates your taxes so you can see how much you owe or the amount you are getting back.  I also like the efile feature.  You do have to buy the state separately, though.	1
Love the software, hate the IRS.	1
This is only my 2nd time using H&R Block and I really do like it compared to being a longtime Turbotax user. It's a lot less complicated. I only wish they would tell you upfront about the addt'l. fee to efile the state tax...	1
I've tried both major tax software packages (this and H&R Block's) as well as the TurboTax Online version. While none of them is perfect, I think this is the best of the three. What sets this apart is that you have the option to do your taxes via a very simple interactive step-by-step "interview" or, if you know what you're doing, you can actually just jump from topic to topic. You even have the ability to just go to specific forms and fill them out directly. This flexibility means you can quickly fill out an area you're familiar with, but have the software lead you slowly through unfamiliar topics. I find that I generally go direct to things I've done several years in a row, but will do the step-by-step interview for areas that are new to me (e.g. when I first got married, or had kids, or got a small royalty check from a patent). If you get a form in the mail you don't recognize (1099-G, for example) you just do a search for it in the software and it tells you where to go.  Before buying this, make sure you actually need it. If you run a business, even with employees, you might be able to use Home and Business. If you're a sole proprietor without employees, you can actually probably save a lot of money and just use Deluxe (which includes Schedule C).	1
The price was less than purchasing it direct from Intuit.	1
Excellent tax prep software!	1
Did my taxes and other then they customer service needs work. it was slightly better then last year and the State taxes papers were Really Really slow but otherwise good	1
I haven't finished my taxes with this software yet.  I know it works though.  I switched to H&R Block last year when Turbo Tax got so many bad reviews.  I love H&R Block.  It will be so easy to do taxes again this year.  You can ask advice for free from H & R Block professionals by e chat .It has 5 Federal e file returns free.  Also H&R Block guarantees the best tax refund.  Highly recommend.	1
Have used this particular version to TurboTax for Business.  Has all the forms needed for S Corporations.  Particularly like I can transfer previously tax information w/o having to retype.	1
Happy Happy Joy Joy! It was just as it was advertised, so it gets four stars, what else is there to say! They would get five stars if they went above and beyond what was advertised and expected.  Imagine if your grocery store was like this and you had to rate every product you purchased! How annoying would that be?	1
Works well, the extra help offered by the Premier version causes me to choose it over the Deluxe version - but my return is considerably more complicated than most...	1
Perfect	1
I've been using Turbotax for 13 years now.	1
It worked.  Easy to use.	1
Did the job.	1
Use this every year since early 90's.	1
Used deluxe version last year and it imported my financial info from banks for $18. i used the free addition this year and to  add amount to line 15a form 1040(over 701/2 years ira distribution) they want $55(premium edition).Even with amount added I am in such a low tax bracket I still would not owe any taxes.	-1
Good price this time around; too much volatility in the pricing	1
Good product.	1
We always use TurboTax as our taxes are pretty basic	1
worked	1
good product and service	1
Good as always.  Will continue to use Turbotax.	1
i use turbo tax every year	1
Ditto	1
Turbo Tax came through nicely again for me this year.  No complaints.  Will probly use again next year unless TT makes some major mistake in delivery, pricing, performance, or what what.	1
Third year now of using TurboTax and am very satisfied.  I also use it for my mother's tax return.  Both of us have rental property so need the premier version.  Because my mother lives in another state, I had to buy additional state for her state return.	1
I gave this a "1" this year because the CD just plain flat out didn't work. I tried mutliple PCs, all with the same resul ... "Please insert a CD". Dummy me didn't try the CD until the 30 day return policy had expired, so there was no way to return it for a refund. I called Intuit and luckily they provided me with a downloadable copy via their site. Intuit seemed pretty aware of the problem, as they didn't even request the CD be sent to them. I should get a refund for all the hassle I went through!!  ha ha	-1
Used this product for years and saves time, money, and keeps me sane.	1
Good product. Gets the job done overtime and really helps me out with my taxes. IRS accepts this product because of its famous accuracy I think.  I recommend it wholeheartedly!	1
I've been using TurboTax for the past 10 years, and find that it's an excellent product. The software is extremely easy to use, and all that's required is for you to answer a series of simple questions for each category.  With that said, the customer support needs improvement. After e-filing my return, the IRS sent me a letter stating that they needed additional information on one of the forms that I had filled out. Being unable to get through to the IRS, I opted to speak with someone at TurboTax. While I was connected within 30 minutes, the person at the other end of the call was clueless about my situation. I was told that my call was being transferred to a tax expert, and that I'd only be on hold for a few minutes.  My few minutes of hold time ended up being well over 2 hours, at which time I gave up. Subsequently, I've still been unable to get through to anyone in the know at TurboTax, and when I call the number provided to me by the IRS, I'm met with a recording that states that they're unable to accept calls due to extremely high call volume. This is despite the tax filing season having ended.  The bottom line is that while this software is great, if you can't get through to a knowledgeable person in customer support, you're in trouble. Since your only other alternative is to call the IRS, and they're never able to accept calls, you're left in a no win situation.	1
I've used this for over a decade and haven't been audited. (fingers crossed). Includes Sched. C and depreciation schedules, although they keep nagging you to upgrade to the Home and Business product, for more money, of course.  Intuit also offers optional low cost audit insurance in case things go bad with the IRS.	1
Always first class.	1
By purchasing TurboTax I saved on hiring an accountant to do what can be done by nearly anyone. Well worth the cost!	1
I bought this program to replace TurboTax that I have used for many years.  Other than being much cheaper, I could find no fault with this also easy to use tax program.  I'll never go back to TurboTax during my lifetime -- it offers no advantage to the average user..	1
I have used H&R Block Tax Cut Deluxe for at least 15 years and have been content with it. I would give it five stars if not for ONE major issue - which may affect many people in the mid-Atlantic States. It will affect you if you live in one state and work in another. That is because H&R Block Deluxe gives you ONE state return. You can PURCHASE additional states at the ridiculous price of $39.95 per state. This is more than the Deluxe (Fed and Stare sells for). So, be aware of that so you won't get any surprises.  Also be advised that the software provides for free efiling for FEDERAL but there is a charge to efile your State Return.  When they charged $19.95 for any state over one, I was giving them 5 stars. But now that they have gotten greedy, I've lowered it to four stars.  I hope you found this information helpful.

Used turbo tax higher versions for many years with decreasing satisfaction each year.  This appears to be systemic with Intuit as the same has happened with their Quicken product.  Each new version seems to be slower, more buggy, and more error prone than the year before.  Turbo Tax has never reliably downloaded my tax info either from the institutions, or my Quicken program, but has seemed to run fairly reliably, and accurately, with manual input of data.  This year that is not the case.  I have had to override the program several times for incorrect data entry, and been caught twice in endless run arounds where the program endlessly circles.  Turbo Tax has never correctly calculated the taxable portion of an employee contributory pension since I started using it.  I also notice the Intuit corporate greed evident in slick upgrade and price increase schemes.  The "special" customer upgrade price is always twice as high as the retail cost everywhere else by March.  I find Inuit's attitude toward customers, and business model very annoying.  I wish that they would properly debug their product, charge a reasonable price, and quit the sleazy marketing.	-1
Great product.  I have used it successfully for year.  However, I use it to make the first effort then take it to my tax gal of 27 years.	1
Last year, TurboTax screwed up by eliminating needed forms from the Deluxe version without mentioning it. This year, they returned those forms but it did no good. Once I imported all the information that was needed, and double checked everything for errors, I clicked the button to send the returns electronically. Error message. I checked everything there was to check. Rebooted my computer and wifi. Error message. Spent nearly an hour on the phone with their support. Error message. Downloaded the "latest version" and deleted everything else. Error message. Error message. Error message.  I finally dug out my old printer and output the forms to snail mail them in.  So sorry, you didn't buy it from Intuit directly so we won't give you even a partial refund for this waste of a piece of software. I won't be reviewing it next year because I am DONE with TurboTax.	-1
Received as expected	1
2015 was one of the better years for H&R Block's signature product.  In the past, updates were late and some parts didn't work as advertised.  This year worked well and updates were on time.  No complaints.	1
Tax prep like I expect, works fine and accurate.	1
I have used it for the past 20+ years and continue to depend on it.	1
I have used TurboTax for years to prepare my modestly complex federal and state taxes. I tried the Block software one year and found it to be decidedly less user-friendly, so have been back with TurboTax ever since. Honestly, Premier is probably a more capable program than I need, and next year I will likely buy Deluxe and if necessary upgrade for a fee within the program. The user interface is easy to use, and all but one financial institution I use was able to electronically upload data into the program. Basic entries are straightforward, and I particularly like the "ItsDeductible" feature for charitable deductions as valuation of donated items is challenging at best.  The program is quite thorough in its scope and I think I got accurate results, certainly with no gross errors. An ongoing issue with TurboTax at least since the 2013 tax year is truncation of printed tax forms. If you print your returns for filing without scaling the page to fit the paper, the bottom line of each page is either partially or wholly cut off. This line contains important information for the processing of your return. This leads to a conundrum: if you don't scale to fit, there is missing data (an untenable solution), while if you scale to print, the text and page layout will be changed slightly. My state goes to great lengths to say NOT to scale to fit, but I see no other practical solution. A review of the TurboTax user website common questions reveals I am not the only one having this issue, and a 45-minute call to Intuit's customer service did not produce an answer (though the representative tried her best to be very helpful). This should not be an ongoing problem, but it is. If it wasn't for the otherwise bulletproof performance of the program I might penalize the software more than a single star for this printing gaffe, but especially for those who e-file, this truthfully is a good program and deserves a four star rating.  If you're going to do your own taxes, TurboTax is a good place to start; I recommend trying Basic or Deluxe first (unless you know you need Premier or Home & Business with certainty) depending on your situation; I think Premier is awfully feature-heavy right out of the box for most users including myself in most years.	1
Have used Turbo-tax for decades. Wouldn't think of doing taxes any other way.	1
i would normally give them a 4-5 star rating. first of all state filings are supposed to be $19.99. when submitting they jacked up both states to $24.99 even though the program stated $19.99 at the start of efiling. also since i filed after 4/18 which is not a problem if you don't owe anyone any money (FYI penalties and interest are based on owed money so if you don't owe money then there is no reason to file an extension), there was an update with a serious flaw in the program. anyone who filed before 4/20 probably wouldn't check there taxes. apparently one of the forms in the program was putting some sort of college scholarships or something into a return as taxable income when it shouldn't be. if you have college financial info in your return you better check the possible impact on this.	-1
Great price and quickly shipped.	1
Delivered as promised	1
I've used TurboTax for years, always reliable. This year they put features back in that you had to buy the "Premier" version to get last year (I bought the "Deluxe and used the Feds Schedule E) that year.  I often stop in the middle of preparing taxes to do something else.  This year TurboTax kept wanting to start at the beginning again, which shouldn't happen.  Their "Print" set up requires WAY too much paper, so I print each completed form page separately (two-sided). I print the signature page, we sign and date it, and I scan it, then print the front page on the back of the original signature page. The Feds get their original signature, the state returns we file get their copy with an original front page printed on a copy of the scanned signature page, and we kept one for our files.	1
Did the job with no apparent errors. The tax software was easy to use. My only complaint is with the documentation of tax law.  The documentation is skimpy and does not really answer questions you might have abut the software. The tax law questions are easily answered with simple online searches, but software questions are just left hanging.	1
This did my taxes and didn't cost too much and has audit support at no extra cost.	1
Used Taxcut - now HR Block and HR Block for many years and always saved lots of time looking up forms and figuring what was needed. Easy to use and latest rules included. HR Block software is a winner but hope we get a flat tax or fair tax scheme in the USA.	1
Does it's job. Got my taxes done really quick. No complaints about the software, however, it's overpriced as usual just because they can and know people will still buy it.	1
Worked perfectly. Thanks.	1
Horrendous. Could not figure out how to use parts of it. The tax code is ridiculously complicated and this didn't help much, although our tax situation is quite simple. Could not e-file . And zero customer service	-1
Simple to use	1
The best tax software on the market, bar none.  I use it every year, and get my maximum refund (or lowest tax bill) with the confidence that all is accurate and soundly acceptable.	1
DOES NOT FULLY WORK. after last years fiasco they "reinstated" the forms for deluxe. but the problem is some of the forms glitch, not allowing you to e-file.  after many LOOOOOOONG phone calls with "tech support" being hung up on numerous times when being "transferred to a second tier" I have come to the conclusion that they don't really seem to care about customer support, or even have an idea on how to fix the problem, as they seem to do noting but stall.  After several calls, you get to explain over and over that you did the steps they are suggesting several other times with the other tech support people that still can't figure out that the program itself is malfunctioning.  I think that the "second tier help" they talk about is just a ruse to keep you on the line for over an hour, and then their systems hangs up on you and you get to start over.  probably be easier to do it manually. (a lot less frustration and heartburn)  buy the way, tech support will not call you back when they (accidently?) hang up on you.  what is strange is that in previous years it worked fine, so what changed? (the software?)	-1
Again this year we used H&R Block software to file our taxes.  We file our own taxes, and then assist our mothers with filing their own (easy retiree returns).  We've never had a problem with the software -- we itemize and use quite a few of their forms.  We don't qualify for the online "free e-files" that are always advertised, so this is a very reasonable alternative. We downloaded the state program for our state, and it was missing one of the forms we needed.  I was able to download it from the state's website.  Our state doesn't allow e-filing (so weird, and seemingly last century) so we have to print it out and mail it in anyway. As long as they don't make any major changes, or raise the price, we'll be back next year to buy the 2016 version.	1
Been using TurboTax for as long as it's been available without any difficulty. The program downloads flawlessly and all expected financial documents and/or issues are professionally addressed.	1
In spite of the various problems the last couple of years, TurboTax remains a relatively painless way to do basic income taxes.  If your finances are organized and relatively simple, you may be able to e-file your returns after just a couple of hours worth of work.  The intuit software isn't perfect, and there always seems to be a bit of a learning curve each tax season, but it is still straightforward if one has the patience to go through all the steps. Cautiously recommended.	1
Easy to use. Covered every aspect of income, deductions and forms. The efficiency continues to bring me back.	1
Works as well as others but cheaper. Still has that question about internet sales tax that should not be in there.	1
It's TurboTax - It Works!!	1
It is good in that it will transfer prior years as well as download financial info.	1
Switched to H&R Block for 2014 Taxes; found this year's version (for 2015 taxes) to be even more user friendly and extremely thorough. Allows e-file of both Federal & CA 1040/540 taxes.  Love that. Great user support built-in plus active "board" for discussions.	1
I like it, easy to use. Reasonable price. Have used it for a number of years.	1
I've been using this software for years and I love it.  It's simple and it just works.	1
Worked Great!	1
used as soon as it came in	1
The software downloaded from this CD (purchased from Amazon) onto my (one year old) Mac Laptop could not be opened or used without a "DSA Key", whatever that is.  Intuit does not offer a clue.  Blocked and frustrated, I returned the product to Amazon.  I've used TurboTax before without downloading difficulty, but not this year.	-1
I use H&R Block tax software year after year.  This would be my 5th or 6th year using it.  Normally, I'm pretty satisfied with it and it does a fine job of catching all possible write offs, but this year, I could not find a place to deduct sales tax for large purchases (i.e. a car) in the questionnaire portion.  I knew it should be in there because I had done it before.  I had to search the forms and find it on the tax sheet.  If someone did not know to look for it, they would have missed out on a potentially large deduction.  Other than that one miss, it did have places for all my other deductions.  Will continue to use, but don't miss that one!	1
Still easy to use does all the hard work for you. I have been using it for many years.	1
TurboTax user for 20 years. While not the perfect, TurboTax works well on the calculation side, but updates required by late-breaking changes in tax laws result in some info/descriptive sections becoming less clear. My wife and I do our FIT in parallel, she on paper and I using TurboTax with info imported from Quicken. Most years, we have minor differences to reconcile. Quite often, TurboTax cues us to a deduction or credit we may have overlooked or forgotten.	1
It is a great product as it was basely easy to use but some parts were a little confusing it.  It work great on the federal and state income returns.	1
We switched over to them after Turbotax decided they didn't value their customers and could screw them last year by removing a feature that had been in for years and trying to tell us all it was to serve us better.  Hey Intuit you lost a customer of about 15 years doing that you morons!  So we got it and H&R Block imported things just fine last year.  It took a little getting used to, but no real issues.  It was no better or worse from a functional standpoint than the more expensive Turbotax, though the help files were slightly more cumbersome.  Nothing major.  Does it work?  Yes, it's fine and we had no issues doing our taxes with mortgage, minor stock dividend stuff, and some forms like W-G for gambling winnings.  Is it as good as Turbotax, well no.  It's not quite as polished and doesn't look as slick.  For example, updates aren't as seamlessly hidden as with Turbotax.  I even got a disturbing error message after the last program update.  I'm sure it's still fine, the program doesn't seem to be acting differently, but the last thing you want is a glitch in your tax software.  Probably going to wait for the next update on 2/15/16 and see if it gives any errors then.  Frankly, I'd just rather wait for updates in the first couple months on any tax software before submitting anyway.  So yeah, for cheaper cost and a company that I don't think is going to turn around and try to screw me, if only because they are a distant second in market share, it's well worth the money.  I have no qualms about suggesting it for anything but the most complicated of tax returns.  --Update 02/10/16-- I got the same error again for the state tax return.  It read No TaxDataStoreHandel found for TaxDataStore (see TaxDataMgr::getTaxDataStoreHandle()).  Not good since this is the second time.  I checked their support and they said to make sure anti-virus, firewall, etc. are off, no Windows Updates pending, and such, but I could tell it wasn't one of those.  Their help site wording is a little ambiguous, but did ultimately point me in the right direction after a couple minutes.  Go to Tools/Update the Program, click Next, then the hyperlink for What's included and which forms are final in the current state update?.  Browser will open and scrolling down will lead to the manual update area.  Couple more click and done deal.  No errors after updating that way.	1
Very good program, great,value	1
TurboTax is the best way to do my taxes. I've tried other programs and always come back to this one. It's very thorough in making sure you include all of the important information. It also has great, understandable questions and explanations. The only negative is the rather large fee for e-filing state taxes.	1
I've been using Taxcut for several years after my divorce from Turbo Tax. Does what it is designed to do. I get the download version each year which usually has a special offering period when it is first released. A very economical and efficent way to do your taxes through Schedule C and an inculded State	1
Have used TT for years.  Always purchase at a discount.  I hear complaints of TT shorting some forms trying to push you to a more expensive product, but I was not affected.	1
I've always preferred H&R Block and it's earlier named product over the major competitors product.  It is easy to use.	1
This year, you will pay a big tax penalty if you didn't have health coverage for 2015. IMPORTANT* This program factors in the penalty at the beginning, so if your like me and you are looking at your refund amount, it will look significantly lower until the end of the process when you verify that you had health coverage. For me, this was very confusing. I spent like an hour or more redoing my taxes, because the refund amount seemed way off. It isn't till the very end that you figure out that it's low, because they penalize you for Obama care until you prove you have it.  Otherwise I like the H&R program. I have used it for years. I can't give it 5 stars because you have the hidden cost of paying for additional state e-file programs and additional amounts to efile your state returns. Otherwise it's all good ''''	1
I love it.	1
It worked fine. Some areas of instructions could use improvement. But the ability to talk with and ask tax questions (maybe for an extra fee?) of a tax expert is very worth while. I think with Tax Act it's only via online chat, but I'm not really sure.	1
This went on sale in early January 2016 and I bought it for $21.95. Following last year's Turbo Tax Deluxe lies and issues, I switched to HRB for 2014 and have now used HRB for 2015. Everything went flawlessly from installation to efiling. State efile was $19.95. So, in total, I spent less and had a lot less aggravation. Thank you H & R Block!	1
My 23rd year in continuous using of TurboTax.  I have grown with the company thru their mistakes, and they have always moved forward.  That is why I keep coming back.  I know their product makes my life of filing almost easy.  Certainly compared to the years of IRS books and pouring over this regulation or that.....now it is all within my fingertips.....just a click and a read away to find out whatever I need to know.  Thanks.	1
I've used H&R Block for years without any major issues.	1
I have not tried this yet, but in the past they have worked.	1
Easy to use.  Better than the software when working for HR Block.	1
I have used this product for at least 8 years and feel that it is very thorough.  It is extremely easy to use.  It is great for deductions and for simple investments.  I hightly recomment it.	1
As usual, TurboTax is easy to follow and get my taxes done quickly.	1
Been using H&R Block tax software (Tax Cut) for more years than I can remember. Used Turbo Tax before that for several years. Finally tried Tax Cut, now H&R Block because my Dad was using it and  the lower cost than Turbo Tax. It has handled everything for me over the years from K 1 forms to investment forms including cap gains/losses etc. It has even handled for me with out a hitch a necessitated amended return. As my forms have gotten more complex over the years I have never had an issue.  Now that being said I have one recommendation: Even though at this point in time I am very familiar with how this tax program flows I do carefully read each step in the interview and answer each question carefully. This little detail will insure you get the forms and pages you need. If you do miss something you will not get the page you need. You will have to go back and hunt it down. You are better off saying yes to a question you are not sure of. You can always skip the part when you get to it. This year I may actually use the download function for some financial firms like Fidelity to save me manually keying in all the data. Much easier to verify and be done with it. Actually this program makes it a joy to do your taxes, if I can say that. The State part is just as easy because of the carry over from the Federal part. Push of a button and its e-filed. Love it.	1
What can I say?  Turbotax is.... Turbotax.  If you're a small business, TurboTax Deluxe may well meet both your personal and business needs.  It has served me well for many, many years. The program is very thorough, accuracy of the program is guaranteed, audit protection is available, and electronic filing is free.  As long as Intuit doesn't try stiffing the user, I will keep using the Deluxe version.  I've got to give credit to Intuit for listening, when last year we made so much noise about their "upgraded" tax programs.  They refunded part of our purchase price on the more expensive versions they had forced us to buy when they moved forms to more expensive versions.  I commend them for rethinking that decision.  Had they not done that, last year would have been my last TurboTax year - and probably that of thousands of others.	1
Been using TT for years and it seems to get easier every year.	1
TurboTax for 2014 got a ton of bad reviews for good reason. They tried to force an upgrade on you by leaving out some forms. After losing many long time users they brought the forms back. I love the product and will continue to use it.	1
Regarding this year's Deluxe TurboTax software makes it very easy to do your taxes if you do not have to use it for anything other than to do a simple itemized taxes.  I experience zero problems entering and completing my taxes.  You should choose carefully to insure you have the correct software.  Last year, there was a considerable problem for those who discovered that they needed a more expensive tax preparation software..  Regardless, choose carefully. Pros: -You can go step by step to make sure you have all of you deductions, credits, or payments covered and correct, or you can select the forms you wish to use. -One of the best features that information can be pulled from previous year's filing if done on TurboTax.  It is nice to simply check the transferred info this years end make any corrections.  You also don't have to retype the info that you use year after year. It is a good reminder for items that you entered last year and found that you will need documents. -If you have the info from the previous year's Turbo Tax, you can compare how you did last year with this year.  It gave me a history of how my earnings stacked up with this years earnings among other things. -If you miss something, there will be indicators to let you know where to go to make corrections or to enter missed info. -You can stop at anytime and go back to where you were or to go to another place when you reopen. -Does all the calculations for you and then has a review in which you will have an indication of what you need to check. -Easy to use and to file taxes. -There is an indicator to give you an idea if your return could have an audit.  It's not in concrete but does give valuable information. -I have used this software since it was MacIntax.  I like it and found it to be a very effective tool when going through the tax process. Cons: -The "ItsDeductabel" doesn't have a lot of items to choose from and I found that a number of the items given to a charity were not listed.  This has been a problem for a long time.  There are not instructions on how to enter the info and continue to use the entry.  Maybe I missed it, but I knew what to do from past software. -There is no audit help unless you pay an additional $49.99 which is close to what I paid for the software. -Many times though the filing process there were notifications about the audit program.  It got tedious. -Safety concerns are addressed but more personal information is required.  Some would consider this problematic.  I considered a different over-all score because some of the concerns I have still linger, like ItsDedutable.  Additionally, it does seem there are more sections are eliminated and a new charge for the item or a different more expensive level of Turbo Tax is required.  . Considering the pros and cons, I will definitely buy TurboTax again as long as they do not eliminate the forms I need. Will continue to buy this software. -	1
have been using turbo tax for the past 25 years.	1
Between moving across the country, buying a house, selling a house, five different W2s from three different states and two different adults, my tax situation is, well...complicated. TurboTax makes it straightforward (-ish). That's pretty impressive, since it obviously isn't going to rise to the level of "easy", considering what we've got going on.  I do have to say that I preferred last year's Amazon Gift Card bonus edition (with a 10% bonus!) and I also am not a huge fan of a 20$/state e-file fee. That said, the product works well, seems comprehensive to my understanding, and gets the job done. Worth the cost (especially since it might be deductible).	1
turbo tax 2015 works well, as turbo tax does year after year	1
I have used this product since 1996. I like it because it remembers my information from year to year, like depreciation, losses, IRAs, investment accounts, Schedule C, auto & other expenses, etc. This year the price was right to move to the Premier Version. I found data entry could be very annoying in the lesser versions. It was always trying to sell you a better version. That means it was also stupid on top of annoying! If I wanted a better one, I would have bought that.  This is better than it was with some inefficiencies like: to jump back into a section, like "Income" or "Deductions" you have to revisit a bunch of questions you already answered in that section. You should be able to "drill down" to where you want to continue. I like the forms section that you can choose to use.  I continue to use it because there's nothing that adequately competes with it on the market. It gets the job done. It's reasonably priced; although, I always try to buy this program on sale. I also know that it's only a limited amount of time that I have to devote to using it.  Still, unlike previous years, there are no hidden fees. I paid for the Fed & State and got them. The eFile for Federal was free! It can also be used for several returns. Money talks!	1
Excellent product! Have used Turbo Tax for many years now!  Very easy to navigate through the program!	1
Great product at a fair price.  I am a regular user.  Easy to use.	1
Don't do your taxes without it.  Easy to follow instructions and less expensive than an accountant.  If you are fairly well organized in your record keeping, then this is  a breeze.  Also, more and more employers and investment firms are providing direct downloads into TurboTax which makes it easier and reduces errors.  Getting the right version may be confusing, but the cost of going "one up" from what you need is usually only $10 so being safe in your choice is not that expensive.	1
as Expected	1
Ok, does it's job no issues	1
I've tried both major tax software packages (this and H&R Block's) as well as the TurboTax Online version. While none of them is perfect, I think this is the best of the three. What sets this apart is that you have the option to do your taxes via a very simple interactive step-by-step "interview" or, if you know what you're doing, you can actually just jump from topic to topic. You even have the ability to just go to specific forms and fill them out directly. This flexibility means you can quickly fill out an area you're familiar with, but have the software lead you slowly through unfamiliar topics. I find that I generally go direct to things I've done several years in a row, but will do the step-by-step interview for areas that are new to me (e.g. when I first got married, or had kids, or got a small royalty check from a patent). If you get a form in the mail you don't recognize (1099-G, for example) you just do a search for it in the software and it tells you where to go.  They don't tell you this, for obvious reasons, but there is really very little extra you get with Premier and Home Business. It's mostly little bonuses that you get, like online databases for valuing deductions. Deluxe has all the forms an individual could possible need; the main difference is in how much help you'll get filling them out.  My recommendation is that you save some money and start with this, or even Basic. If you actually come across anything that you really need a higher version for, or that would be nice to have, you can upgrade the software online and pay a bit extra, keeping all the work you've already done. The software makes it very easy to upgrade in-place in the middle of filling out your returns. My guess is that you won't ever have to, however.	1
Intuit has again hit a home run with the 2015 edition of their tax program.  It is very easy to fill in your information because of the question format.  I've used Turbo Tax and loved it for many years now and every year it is better than the last.  I highly recommend Turbo Tax.	1
It might be obvious, but this version does not include the state tax program.  To file state taxes you will have to purchase and download the state product from within the Federal application.  I am using this on a Apple iMac with latest OS and Turbo Tax installed and is working as expected.  I was able to import prior year data without issue.  My taxes are not complex so this version works fine for typical home write offs.  I have performed a preliminary tax run for 2015 taxes and I did not run into any issues.  My prior year data was there and I was able to enter in my 2015 information without issue.  I have not purchased the state yet but will do just before filing taxes.  I have purchased the state filing in the past without issue.  Turbo Tax and Intuit did not make customers happy last year with higher prices and reduced functionality, but it is still a good product and hopefully the company learned its lesson.	1
Used it before and I am sure I will be content when I use it now.	1
Love or hate it, I have always found Turbo Tax to be easy to use and covers everything I need for preparing my taxes.  Much cheaper than HRB.	1
Last years TurboTax was less than stellar and was missing many forms. A lot of reviewers were quick to let them know that they weren't happy about it. I'm impressed that Intuit listened and brought the missing forms back in this years software and I'm happy to say it's nice to have TurboTax back. Thank you Intuit.  This software is easy to use and a huge help at tax time. We've used it every year for our taxes and we are happy to say there is much less frustration this year due to Intuit listening to their customer base and making the much needed changes.	1
Easy way to file tax return.  With TurboTax, you can easily and quickly prepare your taxes.  If you are a novice, you can take the extra time to follow the interview process in order to get the greatest deductions or if you are familiar with tax code, you can simply complete the sections very quickly that apply to your situation.  Can't imagine doing by hand or paying the high cost of a tax professional.	1
Works well with Windows 10. No issues so far.	1

If you get a form in the mail you don't recognize (1099-G, for example) you just do a search for it in the software and it tells you where to go.  I can also tell you, however, that Premier probably isn't worth it for the vast majority of people, even if they have investments. The basic version will still allow you to fill out capital gains sheets. The only thing this really gives you is the ability to better handle rental property and gives you tools to value and maximize deductions. If you have a home business that doesn't have employees (and thus no payroll taxes) you can also get by with Deluxe, instead of Home Business. They don't tell you this, for obvious reasons, but there is really very little extra you get with Premier and Home Business. It's mostly little bonuses that you get, like online databases for valuing deductions. They can't actually remove the ability for you to file your required personal taxes and so all versions have all the forms available. The main difference is in how much help you'll get filling them out.  My recommendation is that you save some money and start with Deluxe or Basic. If you actually come across anything that you really need a higher version for, or that would be nice to have, you can upgrade the software online and pay a bit extra, keeping all the work you've already done. The software makes it very easy to upgrade in-place in the middle of filling out your returns. My guess is that you won't ever have to, however.	1
Another year of taxes accomplished, almost with my eyes closed, thanks to TurboTax!  Ours are so simple / basic, I think I could get them done for free locally, but I have yet to look into that. Until then, I will stick with what I know.  Also that old saying, if it ain't broke, don't try to fix it, or something to that effect...  I'll be back next year.	1
Makes tax filing almost bearable.	1
I have been using Turbo Tax for years.  I have found it easy to use.  I don't usually skip sections.  Just easier for me to go through each section.  No problem importing my data from the prior year.  A long while back I switched to another product because of calculations errors Turbo Tax made and while it guarantees the calculations it was such a hassle to prove to them it wasn't worth it so I switched.  I came back a few years later and there was no issue importing my data from a competing product.  I like the guided menus.  And this year's product seems to be just as easy to use and helpful.  This Premier product does offer features that use.  It may be more than others may need like stocks and bonds, for instance.  While it comes with one state download, it does not include a state e-file.  That gets to be expensive.  As is buying another state download which I need to do.  I have had issues with e-filing my resident state because Intuit did not include a copy of the other state return which is a requirement.  So I don't e-file and mail it in.  They said they would fix that, but I haven't seen anything that says they did.  All in all I like this product and it makes my life much easier.  I remember the days of taking pen to the 1040 and other forms and using a calculator... talk about stress.  I recommend this particular edition if you need the financial guidance for your investments.  Otherwise try a less expensive version.  You should find it very easy and intuitive.	1
I've been using tax software annually for a while now, since it simplifies an otherwise excessively complicated process. This Turbo Tax package features both federal and state returns, which is convenient. This premier version of Turbo Tax differs from the basic version by including an audit risk meter (which is supposed to help reduce the chance of an audit) and Itsdeductible (which is meant to accurately calculate the value of donated items) as well as information on maximizing deductions and credits. It differs from the deluxe version by having additional information about investment sales and rental property income/expenses/refinancing, as well as a retirement tax help and IRA tool.  As with most tax programs, TurboTax works step-by-step and showcases your total refund amount as you go along. So far this program looks promising, but I will update this review as the tax season is closer and I'm able to use it more.	1
I have been using the TurboTax Premier  software for many years for preparing and filing my Federal and State tax returns. The software is easy to use and is great for those who have investments, rental properties and itemized deductions. I can import stocks trading transactions from my financial institutions to my 1099.  We can also import previous year's data with the convenience of electronic filing.  A nice new feature included in this year's version is the retirement tax help feature which is tailored to helping those who are retired to maximize their returns.  I would highly recommend this software as it would help us to prepare for tax returns instead of relying on expensive tax preparation services.	1
I have been a user of TurboTax for several years. This release does not offer any ground-breaking changes in functionality. It has the same, familiar interface and guided instruction that has been honed over the years. My needs are relatively simple, no complicated multi-rental properties or other investments. The user has the option of simplifying the process by having Turbotax only present options that it feels are relevant to the preparation of the return, or the user can opt for a more thorough tour of all options (which is what I do). When there is a question about a particular deduction, the software's help is often clear and unambiguous. Installing and updating the software from one year to the next is simple, it easily imports data from the previous year to speed the process of preparation. The software will periodically update itself, which it did when I first installed the software. The updating process went without a hitch.  Last year I prepared a return for a friend using their copy of Turbotax, and when I received the final amount owed, it seemed wrong. We took all the pertinent documentation to a tax preparer, and had them do the return. In the end, they came back with the same numbers, save for one very obscure deduction which was only available for one year, and would have been easy to miss. It did little to change the overall amount though, so it further reinforced my confidence in the software. Old releases (back to 2007) continue to work on the Mac, if it is necessary to go back that far, which is impressive. I am looking forward to using it to prepare this year's (2015) return.	1
TurboTax Deluxe is easy to install and the interface is intuitive and easy to use. I can't comment on the start-to-finish tax-return experience yet, as I won't have everything needed to complete my return for a few more months. I will update this review with my full experience at that time.  FIRST UPDATE- 27 MARCH 2016: My return has been filed and I'm just giving it a bit of time to make sure no problems come back, but I have to say that I'm shocked by how easy this was. I have a fairly complicated return- nothing unprecedented, but I do have a tax situation that requires about a dozen forms, several worksheets, and a good half-day's worth of work to do myself.  With TurboTax? Half an hour, literally. I did it with a basketball game on in the background. I checked it a few times, and everything was where I expected it to be. Not only that, but my payment was about a third of what I expected it to be based on last year's return. Some of that has to do with lower numbers on my end this year, but I'll go ahead and throw a little vague credit Intuit's way anyhow.  I'll update this review once more after my payment has been fully processed and I know there's nothing left to do for this year, but assuming there aren't any issues, I am absolutely a regular TurboTax customer going forward. This experience was everything Intuit markets it as, and I couldn't be happier.	1
Excellent product that I have used for many years.  The interview makes doing your takes a breeze, and the Efile options, along with State modules couldn't be easier.  Unless you have a tremendously complicated return, this product should do the trick with you.  You can also avail yourself of excellent planning tools - and import data from previous years to make filing even simpler!	1
I am a big fan of Turbotax, and have been for many years.  I find their products very "intuitive" to use, and the question-and-response method of entering tax data is very useful to me.  What's more, I like the fact that they offer different versions of the software for different tax situations.  I have used many versions, but this year again, the Premier edition is perfect for my situation, with some stock action to report, as well as rental income.  (P.S.  Their small business and self-employed version is great, too, and helped my self-employed wife for many years accurately report income, in order to get social security credit, and properly file.)  Lots of people complain about TurboTax each year, but I think you will see, the overwhelming amount of reviews are positive.  For over 10 years now, TurboTax has helped us quickly, accurately, and easily file our taxes.  Simply go through each section (income, deductions, credits, etc.), answering each question as it pertains to you.  Voila!  Any credits you are due are credited, any deductions, too.  It will tell you if you're better off taking the standard deduction, or itemizing.  Filing is a piece of cake.  It lets you electronically transmit your data to the IRS, and saves a .pdf file of your return for you, every single form needed.  Refunds are processed quickly, within a week to 10 days has been my experience.  I highly recommend this product if you have investment income/losses to report, as well as rental property.  If not, simply go to their website, or look on amazon, and find the version that is right for you.  They offer 4 different versions to cover individual situations.	1
As advertised.	1
This software installed and updated without problems on a Win 10 64 bit machine.  This version is geared toward those that may have investments and rental income in addition to ordinary income.  The software uses a series of wizards to take you through each possible scenario that may apply to your specific tax situation.  It is very easy to use and works in a very intuitive manner.  I recommend waiting a while after Jan 1 before you do your taxes so that the latest software and form updates will be ready.  I usually wait until Feb 1 or a little later.  Highly recommended	1
We have always used Turbo Tax, we are always happy with it, which is of course, why we continue to use it year after year.  So glad to see that the 2015 version is better than 2014.  Please note though, this does NOT include the State version.  It's too early to use this for our taxes, but everything downloaded well, didn't run into any snags or problems, and Turbo Tax guides you through step by step.  Looking through the program everything looks like it will go just as smoothly as any of the previous year I have used the program.	1
I am really glad to see TurboTax offer a Deluxe 2015 Federal Tax software for Mac. I only gave it 4 stares because the state tax software is not included. I have used TurboTax for PC for 20 years and the state tax has always been included. I have been very satisfied with my results. The software downloaded in a timely manner and I was able to start the interview process immediately. Of course the tax forms from my banking institutions are not available yet, but the software uses the same familiar question format and it should not be any trouble to file my Federal taxes.	1
I don't know how many years it has been, but is has been from the beginning of Intuit.  Yes, there have been problems along the way including a couple so severe I said I'd never use the product again.  But I always come back because TurboTax always does the job and makes it a lot easier  than doing it manually.  I hate all the ads and cross selling and wish they would stop, but there is no hope of that.  They did add back the forms they put into a slightly higher priced version last year and sparked an insurrection.  Overall, it's TurboTax, good old staid and reliable TurboTax.  Jerry	1
Satisfied with product. Can't use it till next year.	1
TurboTax Deluxe 2015 does NOT include Schedule E or D.  For these forms, which are required for rental properties and capital gains/losses on stock sales, the Premier version is needed, and it costs $20-30 more.  Have a look at H&R Block for substantially less money for similar functionally as Turbotax.	-1
I've used Turbo Tax many many times.  It's the best out there. I used it last year and will use it next year.  It stores your data and makes life easier. It autopopulates your information into each field the following year.  It's taxes for dummies truly. I adore this software and will never go to anything else.	1
Excellent TAX software that I use every year.	1
Have used TurboTax for years.  Because of some special tax considerations associated with recently acquired property, I have used a tax preparation service for the past couple of years.  HOWEVER, I still buy TurboTax and use it to do my own estimate before carrying my information to the tax service.  Always like to know what to expect and this is a good check on the tax service's work.	1
I've used TurboTax from many years now and have had zero problems. Great product and easy to use interface.	1
It works great. I loaded all my transactions from Edward Jones, which saves me a lot of time. It's repetitively easy to use.  It also costs a whole lot less than paying a tax professional.  I also feel good about being able to do my taxes myself.  I've used TurboTax for maybe 15 years or so, and I have always been pleased.	1
Once again I have used TT to do my taxes and it walks me through effortlessly. You will see other reviews of people complaining about their taxes and they hate Turbo Tax and use some other brand, quite honestly, I think it depends on the user.  Depending on your needs there are different types of TT to suite your needs, just make sure you pick the right one for you, since I do not day trade stocks or own multiple properties, for my simple world of taxes the Deluxe version is what I used.	1
I think there may be a problem in the program this year 2015. I used the "Let them ask all the questions and guide me".  So I answered all the questions one by one.  When I was done and had them check for errors, they said there was an error in the Health part.  Since my deductions were not enough to take this year, I thought that was strange. I might also mention I have Medicare so I am exempt from Health Insurance questions so what could this be?  I finally went to the forms and opened them and began going over them and there it was a lot of paper work for Obama Care which has nothing to do with me at all.  They wanted me to figure if I got a special what ever they call it to get help from the government for OCare, which even if I did I would not take.  As I scrolled down the paper work I discovered that someone had marked that my husband and myself had only had health insurance for the month he was born May so we were in contempt of the law. I never marked anything to do with Obama Care in the questioning so I have no idea where this came from.  I was able to fix it, but I want others to know you may have to do the forms by yourself on the Deluxe edition for Obama Care because it was not a part of the question and answer program.	1
very good	1
I've tried both major tax software packages (this and H&R Block's) as well as the TurboTax Online version. While none of them is perfect, I think this is the best of the three. What sets this apart is that you have the option to do your taxes via a very simple interactive step-by-step "interview" or, if you know what you're doing, you can actually just jump from topic to topic. You even have the ability to just go to specific forms and fill them out directly. This flexibility means you can quickly fill out an area you're familiar with, but have the software lead you slowly through unfamiliar topics. I find that I generally go direct to things I've done several years in a row, but will do the step-by-step interview for areas that are new to me (e.g. when I first got married, or had kids, or got a small royalty check from a patent). If you get a form in the mail you don't recognize (1099-G, for example) you just do a search for it in the software and it tells you where to go.  They don't tell you this, for obvious reasons, but there is really very little extra you get with Premier and Home Business. It's mostly little bonuses that you get, like online databases for valuing deductions. They can't actually remove the ability for you to file your required personal taxes and so all versions have all the forms available. The main difference is in how much help you'll get filling them out.  My recommendation is that you save some money and start with Deluxe or Basic. If you actually come across anything that you really need a higher version for, or that would be nice to have, you can upgrade the software online and pay a bit extra, keeping all the work you've already done. The software makes it very easy to upgrade in-place in the middle of filling out your returns. My guess is that you won't ever have to, however.	1
As I was expected before, I extremely use Turbo Tax with regards to filing income tax.  It was so easy to follow step by step procedure how you can maximize your tax return.	1
I was smart this year and waited until Intuit put it on sale with Amazon.  That way the price is easier to take.	1
Not great, but better than the alternatives.	1
I always buy H&R Block at the beginning of each year. As I found out H&R Block and Amazon always have a 50% discount at the beginning of each year for this software. For the past couple of years, I monitored this H&R Block SW price and I haven't found better price than this 50% discount. Here are my purchase record for the past couple of years.  o 01/07/2012 Got H&R Block Premium, Amazon special deal: $29.99 o 01/05/2013 Got H&R Block Premium, Amazon special deal: $26.99 o 01/03/2014 Got H&R Block premium, Amazon special deal: $31.99 o 01/02/2015 Got H&R Block premium, Amazon special deal: $31.99 o 01/02/2016 Got H&R Block premium, Amazon special deal: $31.95  I do my own tax return, mainly because I have complex tax situations...more than 7 schedule K-1 forms from various private placement investments (including 2 oil exploring investments with complex tax codes), more than 10 rental properties, and a sole proprietorship (for stock trading).  First of all, not all the tax-filer have the related experience or knowledge to handle my tax return (especially, the complex tax codes from oil exploring investments). Or it will cost me a fortune for an experienced CPA to do my tax return.  I was using Turbo tax initially, but I didn't find special advantage in Turbo Tax when comparing with H&R Block. So, I switched over to Tax Cut, and I have been using H&R Block for the past 8 years. It's not only cheaper, but also capable of handling my tax return's needs. It has an easy interview process to guide people to enter information. It allow me to fetch specific form to make manual modifications. I can do if-else analysis to assess different tax strategies with it. The cost of purchasing additional state tax packages is low (rental properties in various states that require me to file multiple state tax returns.).  To my experience, both Turbo Tax and H&R Block are not much difference in functions and capabilities. But I would recommend H&R Block for its value. (Don't get me wrong...I am not saying Turbo Tax is bad. But it's more expensive.)	1
I've used H&R Tax Software for about 15 years.  Never any problems with my returns, or the software.  I could not be more satisfied with H&R's softare.	1
they did it again. you need premier version for stock sales. 30 dollars more for this requirement. don't buy this trash.	-1
Quick Ship, Good product.	1
Great price, had an issue with the 1099B entries this year as it did not allow entry of the person the 1099b was issued to and showed the wrong person as the receiver and would not allow a correction that I think was an overlooked software issue. According to the tax adviser chat on H&R block this would not present a problem with filling, we will see. They at least offer free audit protection. I think the price difference for this premium software over other brands I could name make this a very good buy.	1
Hated it, and here are 3 of my 10 reasons:  1. Cant import income in bulk.  In other words, if you have an excel file with 500 expenses, (with date, description, and time), youll have to type in each item individually, doing 1,500 entries.  Barf. 2. Cant paste what youve copied from elsewhere 3. They hide too much.  In other word, in most cases, they don't allow you to see all of the things youve already put in so that you can easily change it	-1
Used this last year, guess I never wrote a review. Does the job. Still hate that they charge $20 to submit state taxes.	1
I'm a nonpracticing CPA who switched from TurboTax to HRBlock about 5 years ago when TurboTax limited the number of returns per software purchase to one.  I've been very happy with HRBlock in its user interface and links within the program to government instruction sites.  I think the additional state purchase price is high but can live with it as I only need one additional state now to file for my son.	1
Turbo Tax is so good at making tax time easy. Just got my info together, and it walked me thru each section.	1
It really does simply taxes.  The explanations and interface are very helpful.  There are places for improvement but it gets the job done with very little issues.	1
makes taxes less of a chore. Turbo tax needs to stop the unbundling of tax forms and features for deluxe and seems to have learned its lesson with this year's product. leave it alone!	1
Easy to use, great price	1
Forms NOT included in TurboTax 2015 Deluxe for rental properties (Schedule E) or for stock sales (Schedule D).  For these you need the Premiere version for $20-30 more.  Buyer beware.  Same situation as last year.	-1
I have used turbo tax for years.  This product is good to help you walk your way through the tax process - which is never loved!  The main program installed easily, as did the state taxes add-on.	1
I wondered if TT Deluxe 2015 would do what it did pre-2014, as Intuit promised. Specifically, would it handle rentals. I am pleased to say that it does. Thanks, Intuit, for correcting a marketing blunder.	1
I've used this product for the last 12 years. Always works and is SIMPLE to use.	1
This was a Download Only.  I did not know about the rebate.  The software worked pretty good, but not as well as last year's 2014 version.	1
I've used the HR Block Premium & Business software for about eight years now.  The Business package is used for some family Trusts I manage and these Trusts hold actively managed investment accounts, each with over 80 securities transactions to report on Schedule D.  My biggest beef with the software is no support for importing data to Form 8949 in order to populate Schedule D on a Form 1041 Trust return.  So one has to either spend a month of Sundays manually keying in the data to TaxCut, or go pay a third party service where you can actually upload trading data you can download from your Financial institution to populate the Form 8949s and a Schedule D.  Then you get to manually reconcile the totals from the third-party provided Schedule D in TaxCut software so you can proceed to file it all on paper (I've filed paper Trust returns of 90+ pages with all this crap).  A very unsatisfying experience either way.  The online forums for this package are full of requests to address this problem and others, but nothing ever ever seems to be addressed or improved.  They clearly don't want to make their DIY products better.  They want to drive you to hire them to do your return.  I'm one of the fortunate ones who hasn't had insurmountable problems installing the software on my Windows 7 computer, but I wish this company would listen to their customers who, year-after-year-after year post requests to fix the same serious shortcomings with the product, yet never ever do it.  I can only conclude that they don't pay their engineers enough for them to invest their money in the markets, thus they don't know what investors need in a Tax software package.	-1
I have been using TurboTax and filing NJ Resident &  NY Non-Resident taxes for more than 10 years.  For most years, the previous year's information is transferred this year's.  Not so for TurboTax 2015.  I had to re-enter all 4 SSNs.  My spouse works in NY and hence we file a NY Non-Resident form.  For most years, we get a modest refund or at worst a modest tax due.  I was shocked when I saw that we owe 10X more than last year's.  How can that be?  I went over all of the questions to re-confirm my answers and still the same results.  Out of desperation, I went directly into form IT-203 and found that TurboTax erroneously entered the non-NY wages into the NY wage section!  How can a product that so many people depend on make such a mistake????	-1
Generally happy with HR Block - much cheaper than TurboTax if you have an S corp - but no efile for state which is costly for me, and some quality problems - support has been ok.  I've used it for years and will continue.	1
Still working on my taxes, but all seems to be going as expected and as experienced in previous years' products.	1
I have used Turbotax Deluxe for years. This year I cannot update seven files to get rid of the "Do Not File" note at the top of the forms. In fact I cannot file until these files are updated. I spend an hour on the phone with tech support. They finally gave me a new download. I installed it and have the same problem. It doesn't work well with El Capitan operating system. I hate to go to H&R Block but I am totally frustrated.	-1
Have used TT for years.  No problems; always works.  My returns are relatively simple;  this may not be the right product for someone with a complex financial situation. However, you must have good records for income, deductions and deductible expenses.  Many sources can tell you what to keep and for how long.	1
Have used TurboTax for 5 years and always extremely satisfied with the product. Also use it to do my brothers taxes. Cannot go wrong.	1
My quibble is with the Business section, as it is really limited business.  A competing product includes forms like 1065 which a family partnership would need.  This leaves the product incomplete, and I feel Intuit is being disingenuous in their representation of the product.	-1
Includes all the important forms and loads easily.  I can't believe all the negative reports.  Maybe these negative ones are by inexperienced folks or ones sabotaging H&RB.  Anyway, used H&RB for 6 years and never had a problem.	1
I used this program last year. No need to pay an accountant $350 to complete a short 1041 Trust return. It did help that I had the previous year's return, which was done by the accountant. Be aware that this is actually TWO pieces of totally separate software. They don't even look the same. You'll have two new icons on your desktop. The Business piece doesn't seem as user-friendly as Premium.	1
Perfect.	1
I just finished my preliminary tax return and happy to report that I have not encountered any problems. Overall, the interface looks very similar to last year.  I purchased the H&R Deluxe + State, but the Federal portion is identical, so I am reposting the Federal portion of the review for reference here.  I've used H&R Block's tax software (formerly called TaxCut) every year since 1995. Several times when I saw a promotional deal I purchased both H&R Block and TurboTax to compare. I found that both programs satisfied my needs but H&R Block costs consistently less. I have been buying the Deluxe version of H&R Block because it covers it the mutual funds sales and cost basis calculations are included (Schedule D) and the form for Foreign Tax Credit from mutual funds is present (Form 1116). To get this functionality in TurboTax you need to buy the Premium version of the software.  The price on this package changes often and you can catch some great discounts. I use a nice tool that shows history of Amazon prices. If you enter "Amazon price history alert" in Google it will come up at the top, my favorite has the word "camel" (repeated 3 times) in the name. You can set up the tool to send you an alert when you desired price drop is reached. During the last tax year season the price fluctuated between $20 and the list price of $34.99, and was on the gold deal special a couple of times.  ' INSTALLATION ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ' I had no problems with my install. However in 2013 I helped a friend resolve an install problem on a Windows 8 PC us installing from a CD. I am including what we did again as I know a few people told me in helped with 2014 install. Normally the automatic install runs a file called "tcauto.exe". This file in turn calls another program located under "installers" directory which actually does the work. We were able to by-pass the error by executing the exe program in the installers directory directly, this year it should be called "HR_Block_Tax_Software_2015_Deluxe__State_-_Windows_CD.exe" (it is the only file in that directory).  ' If you encounter issues with display, such as not seeing selection boxes, check your screen resolution. Both Windows and Mac minimum requirement for the screen resolution is 1024 x 768 pixels or higher. At a lower resolution H&R Block software will have problem with display such as not properly displaying selection boxes. Screen resolution can be changed on your control panel by change PC's display settings.  ' If you are using a digital download you will need a key-code to install the software after you download it. The key-code can be located several ways. Option 1: In the past when my download finished the install started automatically and offered me a choice of two links "View Keys" and "Install". Option 2: This year the install did not start automatically so I clicked on the install program myself, and on the first screen it asked for "Activation code". When I purchased the software Amazon sent me a message which included a Product Code (note that they did not call it Activation code) which is the number I needed. Option 3: You can locate it in your Amazon account: 1) Log into Amazon 2) Select Your Account at the top right of the page 3) Select Games and Software downloads which is towards the bottom of the long page you see when you log in 4) Then under H&R software entry you will see the key-code that you need to enter to unlock the software  ' If you have a virus scanner it will generate an alert the first time you run the program, change the permission to "Permit Always" otherwise the program will be blocked.  ' Does H&R allow to install the software on two PCs? I found the answer on H&R Block web site FAQ under the topic "Installing Software on Another Computer" I quote the FAQ answer below: "There are just a few steps necessary to re-install the H&R Block At Home program from the CD you received in the mail. Follow the steps below to re-install the program or install it on a second computer. Insert the H&R Block At Home CD into your computer. Click the Need to Re-install? link on the menu bar at the bottom of the screen. The Frequently Asked Questions page will open to the first FAQ titled, "Can I install the software on a second computer?" Enter your activation code and last 4 digits of the credit card you used to purchase the program initially and click Activate. You can find your activation code in your purchase confirmation e-mail. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation."  ' WHAT IS INCLUDED ~~~~~~~~~~~~~  I purchased H&R Block Deluxe entitles me to 5 free federal e-files. It allows me to print and mail as many returns as I want, there is no limit on printed returns.  ' GENERAL ~~~~~~~~~~~~~  I just finished my preliminary tax return and below are my observations. Note: the forms are not final until mid January of 2016.  ' Pet Peeve: H&R Block starts the interview process with an annoying up-sell pitch, recommending an upgrade from Deluxe to Premium even when it is not necessary. In my opinion, they should wait until the person enters this year's data and suggest the upgrade only if there is something about the return that can benefit from the Premium version. That would have been useful.  What is the difference between Premium and Deluxe? The Premium version offers advanced tools for self-employed and rental property owners: cost basis of home sales, dividends, gifts, and inheritance assets. It has advanced schedule C guidance to maximize deductions for self-employment income. And finally it has guidance for rental property income and expenses. The rest of the Premium package is the same as Deluxe.  Note that the Deluxe package has support for self-employed income as well as stock sale cost basis calculations.  ' Pet Peeve: Help is not context sensitive. For example, when you click on "learn more" about a particular topic the general help window opens but it does not show help topics for the specific topic that you were working on. Instead you need to search and know which key words to use locate the relevant topics.  ' H&R Block provides you some guidance for completing Form 1116 (foreign tax credit, for example foreign tax paid by mutual funds). However, you need to keep switching between whole-form view to enter data and then back to interview to read the instructions. Even though the form where you can enter data is visible at the same time as instructions you cannot enter data into it until you switch into whole-form view. This is cumbersome, but at least there is some guidance for this form.  ' DeductionPro (which helps you put value on your charitable donations) is integrated into H&R Block software running on your local PC. It suggests reasonable prices based on condition of the donated item and it is nice not to have to come up with what is reasonable on my own.  ' Pet Peeve: I don't use the default location for the tax returns due to how I set up my backup software. The H&R Block software does not initially remember this new location on the second start of the application, it told me I have no returns. I needed to pick the return manually from the File menu, as it did remember recently used files. The third time I started the software, it finally knew the location of the tax return file.  ' At the end of the interview process there is a check step (which you can run at any time, but the interview ends with this check). This step flags problems (e.g. missing information) and potential audit alerts (e.g. unusual deductions) with red flags, and reminders (e.g. things you marked tentative) with yellow flags.  ' Sometimes I want to return to some section of my return. The best way to jump to any section directly without navigating through other pages is to use "take me to" button which is displayed at the top of every page, on the same line as H&R Block banner.  ' Does H&R has the ability to import TurboTax data from previous years? Yes. TurboTax files have a .tax extension.

Does the job and easy to use.	1
Year in, year out, this product works well.  I am glad I switched to this brand and intend to stay with it for years to come.	1
H&R Block helped me get my taxes done with no problems.  I submitted my return electronically and received a check in about two weeks.  This software takes you step by step on all the possible deductions, etc.  I have been using H&R Block for a couple years now and will continue to do so as it is not as expensive as Turbo Tax, but you still get your bang for your buck.  No problems or issues with this software.	1
Works as described	1
Downloaded yesterday and finished my taxes last night. I have a slightly complex tax situtation-- 2 K1 s (partnership and limited liability company) that are prepared by an accountant and two states, one resident, one nonresident.  I usually just ignore the state software because Ohio has a reasonably good on line site that allows you to file directly and WV tax forms aren't too bad for nonresident taxpayers so I don't see any reason to make in program purchases.  I would recommend this to any other last minute filers.  I used a laptop with Windows 8 by the way. I decided I didn't want to take a chance of downloading to Windows 10 and then having to redownload it on another laptop.  Other people have said that it worked okay on windows 10 but I had to be cautious because-- well last minute filer.  I do know by the way we have to the 18th to file this year so this is a generous assessment of last minute..	1
I just finished  my preliminary tax return and happy to report that I have not encountered any problems.  Overall, the interface looks very similar to last year.  I've used H&R Block's tax software (formerly called TaxCut) every year since 1995. Several times when I saw a promotional deal I purchased both H&R Block and TurboTax to compare. I found that both programs satisfied my needs but H&R Block costs consistently less. I have been buying the Deluxe version of H&R Block because it covers it the mutual funds sales and cost basis calculations are included (Schedule D) and the form for Foreign Tax Credit from mutual funds is present (Form 1116). To get this functionality in TurboTax you need to buy the Premium version of the software.  The price on this package changes often and you can catch some great discounts. I use a nice tool that shows history of Amazon prices. If you enter "Amazon price history alert" in Google it will come up at the top, my favorite has the word "camel" (repeated 3 times) in the name. You can set up the tool to send you an alert when you desired price drop is reached. During the last tax year season the price fluctuated between $20 and the list price of $44.99, and was on the gold deal special a couple of times.  ' INSTALLATION ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ' I had no problems with my install. However in 2013 I helped a friend resolve an install problem on a Windows 8 PC us installing from a CD. I am including what we did again as I know a few people told me in helped with 2014 install. Normally the automatic install runs a file called "tcauto.exe". This file in turn calls another program located under "installers" directory which actually does the work. We were able to by-pass the error by executing the exe program in the installers directory directly, this year it should be called "HR_Block_Tax_Software_2015_Deluxe__State_-_Windows_CD.exe" (it is the only file in that directory).  ' If you encounter issues with display, such as not seeing selection boxes, check your screen resolution. Both Windows and Mac minimum requirement for the screen resolution is 1024 x 768 pixels or higher. At a lower resolution H&R Block software will have problem with display such as not properly displaying selection boxes. Screen resolution can be changed on your control panel by change PC's display settings.  ' If you are using a digital download you will need a key-code to install the software after you dowload it. The key-code can be located several ways. Option 1:  In the past when my download finished the install started automatically and offered me a choice of two links "View Keys" and "Install". Option 2:  This year the install did not start automatically so I clicked on the install program myself, and on the first screen it asked for "Activation code".  When I purchased the software Amazon sent me a message which included a Product Code (note that they did not call it Activation code) which is the number I needed. Option 3: You can locate it in your Amazon account: 1) Log into Amazon 2) Select Your Account at the top right of the page 3) Select Games and Software downloads which is towards the bottom of the long page you see when you log in 4) Then under H&R software entry you will see the key-code that you need to enter to unlock the software  ' If you have a virus scanner it will generate an alert the first time you run the program, change the permission to "Permin Always" otherwise the program will be blocked.  ' Does H&R allow to install the software on two PCs? I found the answer on H&R Block web site FAQ under the topic "Installing Software on Another Computer" I quote the FAQ answer below: "There are just a few steps necessary to re-install the H&R Block At Home program from the CD you received in the mail. Follow the steps below to re-install the program or install it on a second computer. Insert the H&R Block At Home CD into your computer. Click the Need to Re-install? link on the menu bar at the bottom of the screen. The Frequently Asked Questions page will open to the first FAQ titled, "Can I install the software on a second computer?" Enter your activation code and last 4 digits of the credit card you used to purchase the program initially and click Activate. You can find your activation code in your purchase confirmation e-mail. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation."  ' WHAT IS INCLUDED ~~~~~~~~~~~~~  I purchased H&R Block Deluxe plus State. This version entitles me to 5 free federal e-files. It allows me to print and mail as many returns as I want, there is no limit on printed returns.  One state software is included in the package but the package does NOT include free e-file for the state return (see one exception below). If you want to e-file your state return you will need to pay a fee of $19.95 to e-file each state return. Alternatively, you can print all the forms and mail them using US post office without any additional fees. If you need to file taxes for an additional state, each additional state is $39.95 plus $19.95 e-file fee.  Note 1: NY state residents can e-file state returns for free if their income is $60,000 or less. Note 2: It is not possible to e-file a state return for New Hampshire, it has to be mailed in.  ' GENERAL ~~~~~~~~~~~~~  I just finished my preliminary tax return and below are my observations. Note: the forms are not final until mid January of 2016.  ' Pet Peeve: H&R Block starts the interview process with an annoying up-sell pitch, recommending an upgrade from Deluxe to Premium even when it is not necessary. In my opinion, they should wait until the person enters this year's data and suggest the upgrade only if there is something about the return that can benefit from the Premium version. That would have been useful.  What is the difference between Premium and Deluxe? The Premium version offers advanced tools for self-employed and rental property owners: cost basis of home sales, dividends, gifts, and inheritance assets. It has advanced schedule C guidance to maximize deductions for self-employment income. And finally it has guidance for rental property income and expenses. The rest of the Premium package is the same as Deluxe.  Note that the Deluxe package has support for self-employed income as well as stock sale cost basis calculations.  ' Pet Peeve: Help is not context sensitive. For example, when you click on "learn more" about a particular topic the general help window opens but it does not show help topics for the specific topic that you were working on. Instead you need to search and know which key words to use locate the relevant topics.  ' H&R Block provides you some guidance for completing Form 1116 (foreign tax credit, for example foreign tax paid by mutual funds). However, you need to keep switching between whole-form view to enter data and then back to interview to read the instructions. Even though the form where you can enter data is visible at the same time as instructions you cannot enter data into it until you switch into whole-form view. This is cumbersome, but at least there is some guidance for this form.  ' DeductionPro (which helps you put value on your charitable donations) is integrated into H&R Block software running on your local PC.  It suggests reasonable prices based on condition of the donated item and it is nice not to have to come up with what is reasonable on my own.  ' Pet Peeve: I don't use the default location for the tax returns due to how I set up my backup software. The H&R Block software does not initially remember this new location on the second start of the application, it told me I have no returns. I needed to pick the return manually from the File menu, as it did remember recently used files. The third time I started the software, it finally knew the location of the tax return file.  ' For folks trying to download State Forms. The state forms are not available as of 11/20/2015. H&R web site says they will become available in January.  To see the latest status you can go to H&R website, click on Dowload software, then hover over  "Download Software" on the top banner and select "State Editions". Currently it says "Coming soon in January 2016".  When the state forms became available and  teh state software can be downloaded directly from the program.  ' At the end of the interview process there is a check step (which you can run at any time, but the interview ends with this check). This step flags problems (e.g. missing information) and potential audit alerts (e.g. unusual deductions) with red flags, and reminders (e.g. things you marked tentative) with yellow flags.

I have been using TurboTax for years.  Even though I see a fair amount of bad reviews, I have never had any problems with the product.  I never buy it until January.  This year I used it with Windows 10 with no problems.	1
Always a great deal and flawless software experience	1
I have use this product for 9 years as Tax Cut & later H&R Block.  The ability to import information from last year's return saves a great deal of time and insures accuracy.  It is designed for the average person, asking most of the necessary questions during the interview process.  Once the interview process is completed the software performs a review and flags entries which may be in error or missing and allows you to input the appropriate corrections.  E-filing takes little time and a confirmation is available from IRS normally within 24 hours.  Since I live in a state with no state income tax I cannot comment on this feature. Overall the H&R Block software performs well and does not require the user to be a computer expert.  One cannot beat the price compared to tax preparation cost.	1
Don't buy it here. It will not keep or include your activation code in your digital locker.	-1
good price	1
great product	1
Pretty good software for my purposes, and at a good price, been using H&R Block for a few years and I can't find anything to complain about.	1
I have been using this program for years and have been happy with it.  My taxes are not that complicated but I can see that it handles pretty much anything necessary to do taxes.  Will continue to buy especially with great price at Amazon if you keep watching.	1
I always helps me do my taxes and gets them done with the minimum of effort.  It is worth the money for me	1
I have used H&R Block software for years and always like the way it works. This year I took advantage of getting part of the refund as an Amazon gift card with 10% added to the value of the card. The gift amount goes into your Amazon account and is the default method for paying for things you order so you don't have to remember to use it or make any effort at all to use it. Use this for $1000 refund and you have gotten back the cost of the software plus the filing fee plus made a small profit.	1
Works as expected.	1
I have always used TurboTax and have downloaded it from Amazon for the past few years and never had a problem till now.  I was finishing up my return and was asked to update the software.  It asked to save my return before updating.  I tried to save my return which it would not do.  It also would not update.  I got numerous errors.  I closed the software and lost all my information.  I then when to TurboTax website and typed in the error code that I received in the help section.  The instructions were to uninstall the program, delete two different program files, disable antivirus software and reinstall.  I followed all these instructions with the same result, not able to update the software.  So I can't file because I can't update and I can't update because I can't save my return.  I plan on contacting TurboTax to get the solution as currently I can't file and I've wasted $45.	-1
This  software  saved me much time and money, easy to use recommend this software. This is the second year using H&R block and so far am a happy camper/filer. Saved money by downloading  thru Amazon.	1
I will someday abandon all Intuit products but the truth is I'm locked into TurboTax for 2015 per some carryover data. I tried several others but ended up paying the big bucks for TT. It works, filed OK, no problems. I guess I could live with TT if I hadn't had 10+ years of frustration with Quicken and its forced upgrades for reduced functionality. I've successfully abandoned Quicken.	-1
Have used H&R Block for 2 years.  Previously used TurboTax.  I purchased H&R because the price was lower and I had no problems with earlier version.  It does the job.	1
used this product since 1989 and love it	1
Good program	1
23% of the people could not use it. Waste of money, very confusing, no support. Alas you have to hire a person due to the complexities of our system..	-1
this program covers most tax returns and works well	1
Very good amd quite accurate.	1
always use this program works great and is easy to use	1
I've been using TurboTax for 20 or more years.  I like how it keeps track of my data and imports it into the new tax return.  It makes it quick and easy and less likely for user error. I just wish at least one state e-file was included in the price.  I always print out the state return and mail it in to avoid that fee.	1
been useing turbotax for many years and getting the biggest bang for my buck and all the tax refunds get the maximum allowable refund every time to the tune of thousands more.	1
I'm writing this review moments after filing my 2015 federal and state taxes. This is the sixteenth consecutive year I've used TurboTax. In some years, Intuit does better jobs than others, and it has certainly has some stumbles in both usability and technical issues in some of those years. Not so this year.  The user interface is basically the same as the 2014 version; you can step through an "interview", or just direct Turbo Tax to display the items you are interested in. Installation and updates were problem free (Windows 10 machine).  I still remember the days when tax returns were a three-day long and migraine-inducing affair. Tax time is stressful enough...this helps take some of the sting away.  My only beef is that Intuit repeatedly tries to upsell extra services throughout the preparation process. Happily, it also makes declining these offers easy enough.  Great tax return product; select with confidence.	1
Got the job D-U-N.  I have a simple tax return.  I like the product and used it to work on my parents taxes as well.  I don't understand why every else marks this very low??	1
Like others, have been using TurboTax for 15 to 20 years and find it acceptable. was not thrilled with being forced to Premier last year with Schedule D move, but it does also seem that the price was $20 less than I remembered too.  There was a bit of quirkiness this year; difficult to go back and review/redo some info, and could not figure out how to add dependent W-2 (teen son) as only options were for spouse or me to add another W-2 not add one for dependent. He went online and filed via TT Free service.  Affordable. Works. recommended	1
Only tax software I buy..easy to use ...no problems..have been using for nearly 10 years.	1
TurboTax is the best. I've tried others but this is so much easier to navigate.	1
I have used Turbo Tax for many years and I find it always easy to get my taxes prepared and filed. I did try some other competing products but I prefer Turbo Tax. Certainly some of that is liking what I'm used to but it's easy to get used to the product because it does it's job so well.	1
Once again. Thank you for a excellent product. I highly recommend it. Thank you.	1
I'd like to give it 0 stars but that isn't an option.  For starters, it was erroneously changing my refund from over $2000 to under $800 when I added a $3 1099-DIV. Yes, a 3$ dividend was moving the refund down by about $1,200. Yes I double and triple checked to make sure it was entered as $3 and not some larger amount.  Also, this software COMPLETELY CHOKES on partnership K-1s if you have a box 11 code C loss. It can't do them. Period. Turbotax has no problem with those partnership K-1s.  So it's useless to me but I can't return it so I'm stuck having paid about $30 for nothing. I had to go buy Turbotax anyway.	-1
Did what is needed it to do. Excellent.	1
As a CPA I have been using H&R Blocks Deluxe Tax software for at least 15 years. While theyve actually cut back some of the features I found VERY helpful, I find it more user-friendly that Turbo Tax  the only other personal tax software out there. Sand its always cheaper and Amazon always has the best price the list week of the year or  often on January 2nd.  The feature I miss most is the Compare to Prior Year report (which was deleted about four years ago when HRB changed name of their tax software from Tax Cut to HRB at Home. This was a handy way to see if you missed anything from prior year or why your estimate this year was off. I sure wish theyd bring it back.  The other factor I want to alert you to (as it applies to both HRB and Turbo Tax) is the state tax program. If you live and work in the same state or there is NO STATE Income Tax in either your home or work stare, you can skip this comment. However if you have the above situation (or have rental real estate in other than your home state), you will need TWO State tax programs. HRB gives you ONE state included in the program package. EACH additional state module  which you can only buy and download from HRB  costs $39.95 plus tax. Since the Deluxe + State shouldnt cost you more than $34.95 (probably less) you are paying more for that second (or God forbi9d third state) than for your original Fed + State return. This is very common issue for those living in NY, NJ, PA, and CT. I wish that HRB would offer a  Deluxe + StateS for maybe $10-$15 more and allow up to  say  three states. But, since  like airlines  they can make more by charging for each addition extra  they probably wont One other thing.  With the deluxe you get up to 5 free Federal e-files. But you get NO free State e-filing. That costs about another $15.00. This is really annoying. But know the cost going in.  So I would give the software five stars but am withholding one star because of the high cost of extra state modules and lack of the simple compare with last year report.  I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.  Steve Ramm CPA	1
I thought I'd give H&R Block's software a try this year and that was a disaster.  I came running back to Turbotax and everything went smooth as butter. All my transactions came in seamlessly from Fidelity and Scottrade and they all matched exactly what I have in Quicken (I like to do the cross check). I have some fairly complicated K-1s and TT handled them no problem. It imported last year's return no problem and that helped speed everything up greatly.  I do miss that bonus 10% they used to offer with the Amazon gift cards but...oh well. Maybe they'll bring it back next year.	1
Love it.	1
Once again, this years version of the software made my life exceptionally easy. I used to spend two days with spreadsheets and a calculator. I stil l have the spreadsheet to total up income and deductions. After that entering everything into this program and coming up with the final taxes doesn't take long, and I have a complicated set of taxes to resolve.  This year, don't forget to fill out the section for Health Insurance you pay for. Otherwise you'll get charged an extra $650 and miss the tax credit you may otherwise get for your insurance expense.  Highly recommended.	1
Yeah, I've been using TurboTax back to the dreaded DOS days. Other than being glacially slow, it works well and I usually have no trouble with it.  Saved some money and aggravation and got the download version.  Recommended.	1
I buy this every year in December so I can plan out my tax year. The program is very well written for people like me to use. I would have to pay a professional if not for TurboTax.	1
very good tax program	1
Been using TT for 10 years. This is the smoothest most useable version yet. Good job	1
Intuit products get worse and worse. Bugs, dumb UI, just awful but sadly the only game in town.	-1
No problems installing or using this year's version on my windows 10 PC.  No crashes etc.	1
Good buy for the price	1
I've used this product for many years.  It's not the cheapest tax preparation software around, but I've found it about the best, and far cheaper than having it done professionally.	1
Much improved over last year	1
Best in the business, forget the other guys.  I'd rather have a tax expert than a software expert designing my tax software and who knows taxes better than H&R Block?	1
Always easy to use	1
I use this every year.  While I am not 100% satisfied with every aspect of Turbo Tax Home and Business, it does save me a lot of money as opposed to bringing it to a tax man.  I have used TT for about that last nine years.  It is easy and only occasionally to I have any confusion.  This usually explains things very well.  I've tried other less expensive similar products and they were not as detailed and left me with many questions when going through the process.	1
I have been using TurboTax for many years and it is indeed the best program in it's class.	1
I have bought my Turbotax from Amazon for the last 5-6 years.  I like that a copy of it is kept in my Amazon Software Library.  I have had several computers crash on me over the years and having Turbotax in the software library makes it very easy to reinstall even after several years.	1
As usual, there are going to be a number of negative reviews of TurboTax, some complaining about price, others about features or updates or installation problems.  While no product is perfect, I personally think TT is pretty consistently a good piece of software at a reasonable price.  Intuit (like many other companies) plays games with licensing and features and versions, which annoy me as much as anyone else, but that doesn't make the product terrible.  BTW, if you have a tax situation that is more complex than you can handle, tax software isn't going to help you figure things out.  You'll either need to educate yourself (books & IRS website), or find a tax accountant.  As I do every year, I'll try to write a balanced review based on my own experience.  Note that I've been a user of tax software for many years, and have in the past used the competition's products as well.  Initial Review 6 Dec 2015  This is my first report, which I will update down the road after I've made more progress.  Initial download from Amazon and installation was completely trouble-free (Windows 7 64-bit).  No problems with warnings, glitches, updates, or anything else.  The only oddity (minor) was that after the initial updates it failed to automatically start the program, after saying it would.  When I did start it up, it quickly found the various copies of my 2014 tax files (I save versions as I go, in case I make a serious error and need to roll back).  Imports from the file I selected were clean and trouble-free.  My tax situation this year includes self-employment income, investment income, foreign income (not just mutual funds), itemized deductions, college expenses, 529 fund payouts, and Roth conversions.  The interview hasn't changed much that I noticed.  I switched back and forth between the interview and the forms view, as I often do, to understand what was going on under the covers.  It didn't take too long for me to enter all my current numbers (many of them estimates, of course) and get a sense of my full tax picture.  For state taxes, TT had already started on my state return (based on my home state), but asked me to confirm that it was the free state I wanted to use (extra states have additional cost, e.g., if you live and work in different states).  The state tax return was also trouble-free and looked correct.  Two glitches to report so far, hopefully these will be corrected.  Both are related to college costs, and both can cost you real money. (1) My son's college charges a required fee that it doesn't include in the 1098T.  It's a qualified expense for the 529 fund, and there's a place for it on the form, but TT doesn't ask for it or allow it during the interview.  You sort of have to know the mechanics and go into the right form to add this item.  Not user-friendly, and can lead to higher taxes than you owe.  Bad. (2) The "optimization" of the various education credits is terrible, and can lead to bad results if you let the program do what it chooses.  In my case TT reserved a huge part of the 529 funds withdrawn for the AOC (don't worry if you don't know what that is), which led to some of it becoming taxable.  There was no optimization -- I was able to do much better with simple trial-and-error.  Bad.  One other thing I noticed:  there doesn't appear to be a simple way to find and correct the health insurance figure (in the business income section).  It's hard to find in the interview, and I couldn't find a way to change it in the forms (ran into a circular reference between two forms each saying go change the other one).  This part of the program hasn't changed from last year.  Not a big problem, just something to be aware of.  Overall, I'm satisfied.  Still a reasonable program for the money, still does a decent job at reducing my tax computation and filing hassles.  Update 22 Feb 2016:  Overall I'm still reasonably happy with TT.  Some specific comments:  (1) The college fees issue I mentioned above is still in the software, which I think means that it will "never" be corrected.  It's important to enter this data correctly, obviously.  Further, it might affect your state tax as well: in MA, it matters in the computation of the college tuition deduction.  (2) The optimization of the American Opportunity Credit is now corrected, it works the way it should.  (3) I had a problem with the MA tuition deduction calculation works -- in my first run in December this wasn't done correctly by TT, so it over-indicated (by more than $2000) how much I would gain from this.  So now I find that I'm paying the state instead of getting a refund.  Would have been nice to know that before I had to pay my Jan estimated tax installment.  (4) The handling of Form 1116 (for foreign tax credit) is very poorly implemented.  TT prompts you during error checking to fill in some required "explain this line" forms, instead of doing so during the interview.  Also, the explanations are usually so simple that TT has the information needed to pre-fill these in, instead of asking the user to hunt down where the numbers came from.  Also, if you're not careful, Form 1116 might calculate your foreign tax credits incorrectly, by excluding certain foreign income.  I've found that one MUST review this form manually and make corrections directly in the form and in the relevant 1099 forms, in order to make sure everything is done correctly.  (I've been doing this for years now, there's been no improvement here.)	1
The only way to do your taxes each year as far as I'm concerned!  You rock TurboTax!  And Amazon.com helps deliver the goods so much easier.	1
I've been using TurboTax for many years.  It's a good package for the average filer.  It's important to note that you must have a basic knowledge of your tax situation inorder to know which version to buy.  Now that Intuit is again giving all the tax forms with all programs, an annoying deliberate omission in prior years, you can prepare an entire return with this package.  You just won't get guidance for all situation such as capital gains reporting.	1
I have to give the new Turbo Tax 5 stars.  It has always been an excellent software program for doing your taxes; this year there are all the new steps required under the updated tax laws, including the ACA requirements.  As usual, Turbo Tax will lead you through all the possible steps to prepare your tax submission - and you will need to have copious records.  The program, reflecting the IRS requirements, demands detailed information on all income and deductions.	1
TurboTax Deluxe is back!  Yeah, thanks!  Please don't mess with it again.  TTax is number one, so don't mess with it like last year.  PS: I guess last year they forgot the past, i.e. when they tried to charge for printing extra returns and the famous Coke faux pas. Now,  please don't forget the infamous 2014 mistake.	1
I've used TurboTax for over 15 years now, I can't imagine using anything else.	1
Got it early from amazon and at a good price	1
Turbotax Deluxe does not include schedule E (rental property) or D (capital gains for stock sales).  For these schedules, the Premier version is required, which costs $20-30 more.  Same situation as last year.  I am using the Mac version but I presume the same is true for the PC version.  Last year I used H&R block, which is substantially cheaper for the same functionality as Turbotax Premiere, but H&R block is not as polished.  Buyer beware.	-1
Roxio Creator NXT is a SUITE of tools for (1) creating/copying CDs/DVDs (2) editing Photos (3) editing Videos and (4) editing Music/Sound. I had high hopes that it would be the "one stop shop" for my CD/DVD creation, photo editing, video editing, and music editing needs. However, my experience with this suite is nothing short of disappointing.  The only software I find useful in this suite is its CD/DVD creation tools -- but I already have Cyberlink Power2Go, which is much more intuitive to use. Plus Cyberlink supports Blu-ray copying; Roxio doesn't. The rest of the tools in this suite is really nothing to shout about. I'll provide a brief evaluation of each of the tools:  (1) Creating/Copying CDs/DVDs Roxio began as a company that specialized in software for creating CDs and DVDs over a decade ago. I've used many versions of Roxio's optical disk burning software over the years and they've always worked reliably, so I expected the CD/DVD burning software in this suite to work flawlessly -- and It does. It even copies your files to a Blu-ray disk (you would need to have a Blu-ray burner of course). My only gripe is that Blu-ray copying is NOT supported. Roxio does offer support for Blu-ray video creation BUT you would have to BUY an additional PLUGIN to enable this feature. Come on Roxio. Really?? For the price, this software should have included full support for Blu-ray disks.  The plugin can be purchased from the Roxio Website. Just do a Web search for Roxio Creator NXT 4 Blu-ray plugin and the link to purchase it should come right up.  (2) Editing Photos I'm a heavy Photoshop and Lightroom user. But there are times I want a quick and easy way to edit my photos without having to go through the fuss of opening up a resource-intensive photo editing program like Photoshop or Lightroom. I had hoped Roxio's Photo Editor would fill this void. But it doesn't unfortunately. Roxio's Photo Editor only provides very basic tools like saturation adjustment, crop, rotate, flip, straighten, sharpness adjustment, exposure adjustment, red-eye reduction, and brightness and contrast adjustments. I have freeware programs (spyware-free I should add) like Faststone and Pixlr (Web-based) that provide these tools and MORE, like healing brush, levels and curves adjustments, and various filters. Roxio does provide "advanced tools" like wrinkle, dust, and scratch removal -- all of which do not work very well in practice. Roxio also has layer masks BUT you're limited to PREDEFINED shapes like circle, triangle, rectangle, etc., which makes it practically useless.  (3) Editing Video The video editor is pretty basic. The timeline interface is okay -- nothing remarkable.  I did not like any of the transitions and overlays it comes with. I could not find a way to strip the sound from a clip. It has a Web video capture feature that's supposed to capture ANY video from your browser (YouTube for example) and save it to your disk. But this feature does not work. I followed the instructions to the tee but it simply doesn't do what it promises. I did a Web search to see if I had missed something and found that the consensus among longtime Roxio Creator NXT users seems to be that this feature has been broken since Roxio Creator NXT version 2.  A feature that I DID get to work is screen recording, which records the activity on your computer screen and creates a video of it. The playback is very smooth but there is definitely a slight degradation in the audio quality.  (4) Editing Sound Again, I'm not impressed. I much prefer to use the open source software Audacity. Roxio does have one audio capture feature that I was hopeful about but that turned out to be disappointing as well. The audio capture allows you to capture sound/music from any source (YouTube or Pandora for example) and save it to your disk (as a Wav, MP3, or Ogg file for example). However, the captured audio has a VERY noticeably lower fidelity than the source. The quality of the captured audio is poor regardless of the format (e.g wav, 192kbps MP3, Ogg, etc). I have ReplayMusic (paid) for capturing sound and this one faithfully captures the source with no perceivable degradation in audio quality.  Additional Info that might be of interest: I'm using Windows 10, 16 GB RAM, Intel core i3,  --- If you're looking for a comprehensive all-in-one suite for managing, editing, or creating audio, video, and photos, you will be sorely disappointed with Roxio Creator NXT 4. The only thing it does well is creating/copying DVDs and CDs. And It doesn't fully support Blu-ray. Roxio Creator NXT 4 simply isn't worth the high price.	-1

As a bonus, the video illustrates what you get using Roxio's 'Record Your Screen" feature. I find it to be a very useful capability because it captures anything that's on your primary or secondary monitor, both video and sound and you can see the quality for yourself if you expand the attached video to 'full screen'. Just for fun, toward the end I am playing a previous screen recording session within the main recording.  ________________________________________________________  Roxio was very much 'love at first sight' to me, back in the early 2000's. Even then, it managed to consolidate a number of 'media' functions into one package and it was great for as long as one's expectations were for decent, basic capabilities. Then, as the company was bought and sold, subsequent versions turned increasingly bloated, slow and bug-infested and were backed by unacceptable customer support. The last 2-3 installment were bad to the point that they wouldn't even install on my Windows 7 computers and barely worked on one of my kid's Windows 8 and so-called customer service was unable to do anything about it. I did review them at Amazon and they got well-deserved 1-star ratings.  Well... here's the good news, the NXT 4 works, in the sense that it actually installed without a glitch on my Windows 7, the interface is super-clean, well integrated and efficient and everything I've tried so far works exactly as expected.  Roxio NXT is a Jack-of-all-trades by design so anyone who expects Photoshop-like sophistication when editing photos is going to be disappointed. However, whatever I tried so far worked well and did for me what I expected. I didn't try 'everything' because, as the attached video shows, there's a lot in NXT but the features that interested me the most are just great. So let me give you a couple of examples.  "Capture Audio from Sound Card", for example, would let me play some music on my computer and it's intelligent enough to determine when the song ends, then check the recording against some giant database and, if recognized, it will properly file it under the correct album, artist and song title. I works near 100% of the time for as long as you have some decent source for your music, like a music service. And, if your service has commercials, it's okay because you can set it to ignore anything that's shorter than, let's say, 35 seconds. There are many options, including 'quality' and the audio file format, even a setting to 'not record' a song if it already exists in your library. To make it short, this feature alone would make this a worthy purchase for me.  "Record Your Screen" is what I used for the attached video. It takes everything you have on your screen and whatever sound your computer 'hears' and it dumps it all into a WMV file. Please watch the video to get an idea of 'everything' that Roxio can do. I begin the recording by simply browsing through its features. The second half were, among other things, I recorded me playing a recording of my recording my screen may not be as interesting. Note that I am using the Windows Media Player rather than Roxio's own Nero to play this because, as I noted before, Roxio's NXT 4 has 'a lot' but I do prefer other apps to perform certain specific activities and Nero's media player is far from may player favorites.  Without going any more in-depth, I would say that this version of Roxio's NXT is worth its price, even considering the reasonable likelihood of dismal customer support for which Corel, the owner of Roxio is famous. I suspect that there are other apps that can capture and properly file music. In fact I did try one or two but none, as far as I know, is as efficient and elegant as Roxio's. Same for screen capture. It's totally agnostic of 'what' it is on the screen and that makes it flexible and efficient. I also like its ability to quickly autofix large numbers (as in hundreds or thousands) of photos at once. And, since the NXT actually installed on my computer, I am happy with it and I will rate it a 4 stars, one star being deducted for Corel's terrible customer support of which I was a victim in the past.  My advice would be: just forget who makes this. I can't say much about the "Data Copy" section because I don't need Roxio for it so see other reviews discussing it but the Music, Video and Photo sections should make NXT a worthy app.	1
The year of 2002, I started using Roxio and has always work fine for me	1
I've previously used Corel After Shot for photo editing. Like other Corel software I find it slow, has an awkward UI (doesn't use the standard windows dialog boxes), and somewhat difficult to use. But After Shot is an add in and not the primary product here so this review score only applies to the Roxio Creator product.  First  minor problem on a Windows 10 PC didn't run autorun, had to manually double-click SETUP on the CD. On starting the setup first thing it does is check the version to let you know if there is a newer version online (optional if you do not have internet connectivity at the time of install). Crashed part of the way through my first install, but worked correctly on the second install.  Second minor problem, software asks for a activation key which is not labeled or listed anywhere on the package, instructions, or DVD. In fact while it asks for an activation key, it wants you to type in what is called a "SERIAL NUMBER" on the back of the DVD envelope. How hard would it be to actually have the software call it a serial number of label the number on the DVD envelope the same as the software description (activation key). Kinda amateur in my opinion. It is what you'd expect to see in a $5 download not a $90 product.  My DVD works fine to convert *.mp video from cell phones or from AVCHD (from a video camera -- in my case from memory stick or USB). It isn't particularly fast, but it is faster than Corel Visual Studio which is achingly slow for just a quick video conversion and save to DVD. For this reason alone I recommend Roxio Creator and it is the principal reason I got the software.	1
I have the cd version and it won't install. I tried on two different pcs - and I get it going and then it hangs or crashes. So I am not able to provide a review on how well it works.	-1
This is scary. I have owned most every version of Corel for 20 plus years. This was a biggest mistake EVER. Create a restore point if you are stupid enough to be like me. I bought it without reading reviews, my past use was what I wen by. Creator 2 is still on one of my machines and works fine. This version was hard to install, and has screwed up my computer. Every web page needs to be reloaded at least once, sometimes twice to actually display correctly. And this is day one, after a week to get it installed.	-1
Roxio used to be a well-known brand name in the editing software business.  Sadly the name lives on but the quality of the product does not.  I had the product as a disc.  My first attempt to install on Windows 10 failed.  Second attempt worked.  No instructions or help are provided in the box and the website provided no help either.  So essentially you are on your own for the install.  Once installed I had a problem with the program freezing.  I would then have to force close the program and reopen.  Quite a hassles, while it isn't that hard ot figure out how to use the software, again I could not find any documentation as to how to use the different features.  I tried some editing projects and some burning to disc, but I kept having freezing problems.  I did send an email to Roxio tech support and never received an answer.  I should note I have no other programs who freeze like this.  Sadly I think I will uninstall the program, until I can find out what the problem with my software is.	-1
I am an amateur photographer and this software has served me well.  My jobs are small and I like the ability of doing custom work. The software helps me does this.	1
To be honest, I am still having quite a time figuring out how to do things on this software.  There is a built in tutorial but it is not the clearest or the greatest.  As far as loading the product is went very smooth and I had no issues, I am running windows 10.  I did use the photo enhancement part and it works very well.  I played with some photos and made myself look about 10 years younger.  Most of these types of products have a learning curve and this one is no exception.  I had Nero before and it worked good after one figures out all the various functions and I am sure this will be the same.  Persons that are more tech savvy will likely have no problems with using this.  Overall seems like a good product.	1
My husband uses an earlier version of this program along with the capture device from the same company, but every so often its bugs catch up with it. He has to uninstall and reinstall it. It works for a while then. Well, I thought this new version might have fixed the bugs, so I ordered it and gave it to him to try on his Windows 7. First, it was really hard to install it. It downloaded updates which took a while. That isn't uncommon, but then we got to the serial number. I say we, because it took both of us and trial and error to figure it out. We couldn't tell the difference between 0 and O. Finally we got it installed. He doesn't have any use for the Aftershot organizer. He uses the program for video capture. It didn't work well enough. The sound was garbled and it hesitated. Useless. He uninstalled it and reinstalled his old version. It worked much better. Okay, well, I have a new Windows 10 laptop, so I thought I'd give the program another chance. (I don't use capture, but I might use some other features of the program and I wanted to see if it worked better on the Windows 10 device. Unfortunately, I guess you only get one installation because it wouldn't accept the serial number. Don't bother with this. Look for an older version.	-1
First let me say I am running a fairly fast desk top tower computer - Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit SP1, dual Intel chips running at 2.40Ghz and with 32GB of RAM.  It still took nearly 45 minutes to install this program from the CD provided - half and hour for the loading and then another 15 minutes to do the download of the updates and registration.  So, when you go to install this puppy, make sure you have allotted enough time.  A couple of pet peeves on the installation process - they notify you right up front that the installation may uninstall some of your  programs - but, they do not tell you which ones - I have not found any they did install, but  I keep wondering.  It would be better if right up front they told you what would be uninstalled and let you decided.  Another pet peeve, they make you type the serial numbers in as part of the registration - a combination of letters and numbers - well, for the "zeros" they do not put slash marks thought them - so, you are left guessing "is this a "zero" or a capital "O".  Mine had both - so, it took a couple of tries to guess which was which.  This is an easy fix - surprised it was still there in such a product.  One other note - about 20 minutes  into the installation the disk drive starts making start/stop/start sounds that go on for about a minute and a half - they are normal, but just sound strange - let the machine work through them and the installation will continue.  Now, to the good part - this program will solve all your  disk writing issues - I used  to use Roxio Home years ago, but it no longer works with my current 64 bit machine.  This program adds all the goodies you will need for creating your custom video disks, editing you photos, backing up your programs, etc.  For manipulating data from your PC onto disks - the Roxio products cannot be  beat and it is well worth the price.	1
Excellent software,easy to use, and fun to play with. I made all kinds of video editing. Installs easy. Makes a great gift.	1
This is pretty easy straight forward to use. you can even download a digital version of the disk they give you. can take your cds and make them dvds digitalize lp and tapes, can capture shots from you tube and other sites. Can also quickly convert and clean up raw pictures you might have. I used this one to make a video for my kids of the baby pictures we have of them. Step by step instructions made even me a non computer person have an easy time using this product. I even let them pick their favorite song to set this all too. They had a ton of fun with me and now we have a great memory too. it has many more features I did not mention. Really is well thought out and easy to use	1
I received this software as a vine program review item, but would have bought it anyway. My wife teaches Transitional Kindergarten, and as part of the open house presentation and as a gift to the parents with the children's memory books, she videos the children at various activities throughout the year, and we make a DVD of a compilation of the videos. Roxio Creator is an easier to use than some of the more expensive competitors software. I easily move the videos off of the computer and onto a DVD for the parents ( it is amazing to see the growth of the kids from 4 years old to 5 and it is something they keep forever). In any case I like Creator and recommend it.	1
I hate doing this to the vendor, but it is clear from my experience and other reviews that there are major issues with this software. Even when you use the download option instead of the DVD, the install fails. I've tried it on three different machines, and all I get is a 5 minute wait and then an error about pre-requisites.  I'll attempt again when/if there is a new update.	-1
Couldn't install it on my windows 10 pc. Need we say more?	-1
great temporary security. ladygamblertina@yahoo.com	1
This is my favorite antivirus from Amazon.com	1
Installed. Program interface wouldn't come up. Got blank screen that said "UI not found. Well this is embrassing." Eventually figured out it needed 'Terminal Services' turned on in System Configuration Utility. Found out no thanks to Avast. It could have told me what it needed  but it didn't. And 'Terminal Services' is not something you really want to have running in the first place.  I only installed minimum configuration. AntiVirus core, Web browser protection & Email protection. It brought Firefox to its knees, slow and eventually locking up repeatedly. Uninstalled Web browser protection. Firefox still locking up.  Uninstalled entire Avast product using their tool. Which required running in Safe Mode. God only knows what it did while it had free reign there.  Then I discovered that Avast had destroyed all my restore points. It had gone mucking around in the restore point files to remove a trivial PUP. As if they wouldn't know that hacking up restore point files wouldn't destroy their usefulness. I wanted to go back to a restore point I made just before I installed Avast to make sure it was all gone. Forget that. And if I had had any other crisis, I'd been totally hosed.  Avast is a screw-up product. It LOOKS like it's slick and running well  but it ain't. Stay away from this product.	-1
This is great software. I love it. It's accurate and easy. Thank You	1
The product leads to buying the upgraded version.  I did not like the product and it was not user friendly  and wanted tp add additional products.	-1
One of the best free antivirus software.	1
Good, basic, antivirus package.  Gets the job done and you can't beat "FREE".  I use this same platform on my Android devices too.	1

Corel VideoStudio Ultimate X9 improves on the X8, and adds plenty of features to boot.  I've been using Corel tools for a long while, I also use Sony tools.  (Depends on the computer I'm using.)  I like them both, but Corel VideoStudio Ultimate X9 is the go-to when I need to edit quickly.  Tons of extra wipes, effects, and does the job quickly.  I'm using a Windows 10 64-bit i7 desktop.  It runs fine, though I think my computer is showing it's age.  Or maybe the Corel VideoStudio Ultimate X9 needs an update because it's a bit quirky so far when I'm editing a long soccer game.  But I just re-open and it's fine.  It usually takes a few updates for any video software to get all the drivers/new additions in place.  So I'm good with this as is.  Corel VideoStudio Ultimate X9 isn't perfect, but it matches any other program I'm using in it's sub-$200 class.  If you want something more robust (and sometimes I do) then there are better options for a price.  But if you're doing the family videos or a student film then Corel VideoStudio Ultimate X9 is a pretty good choice.	1
I find Corel VideoStudio fairly easy to use (as far as video conversion and editing goes).  I've previously used a wide array of video tools (Adobe Premiere Pro, Sony Vegas, Ulead VideoStudio, Pixela ImageMixer, Nero Vision Express, Pinnacle Studio, ArcSoft Showbiz, Virtual Dub and even high end expensive professional products like EDIUS).  Currently Corel's VideoStudio is the nicest I've used (of course this isn't completely fair as many of the other products no doubt have newer improved versions too).  I don't notice much difference between VideoStudio X5 and X9.  I'm sure they added some nice things but they haven't jumped out at me.  For me the biggest change has been the phenomenally increased speed on Win 10 64 bit vs 32 bit WinXP (much of this improved performance is due to the hardware though).  Batch convert is the feature I use the most.  This is an excellent way to convert files from one container and form of compression to another.  One of my complaints about all video editing software is a lack of in context explanations of the various choices.  How is a novice supposed to know the difference between H.264-Baseline, H.264-Main and H.264-High?  VideoStudio is easy to drag and drop clips together in a project and to drag and drop transitions between the clips to produce a nice final project.  A lot of tasks are intuitively easy (whereas other software leaves to reading through poor documentation to try and figure out how to do something).  Almost every company wants to sell you new version after new version year after year.  At least Corel provides some very nice (low cost) upgrade offers.  Certainly some of the time you'll want to take advantage of the upgrades to utilize new hardware abilities or a new software feature but generally I find it's reasonable to go several years between upgrades.	1
I was happy with PowerDirector until it started crashing my computer and then refusing to let me render in the resolution it was rendering in when it crashed.  Every time it crashed, I lost a resolution until I was down to nearly nothing.  Boy, was I glad Corel VideoStudio came along.  I initially installed VideoStudio on my Windows 7 system.  Then, I upgraded Windows 7 to Windows 10.  It worked on both systems without crashing either one.  Woohoo!  One of the things I noticed right off the bat is screen video capture.  I'm so happy to have that.  For years, the only way for me to screen capture was point a camera at my screen (yeah, I know about free software).  This also has a slideshow wizard, but what I wanted most was a video wizard.  As far as I can see, there's no such luck.  Oh, well.  I'm happy to see it can edit six cameras.  My old video editor could only handle four.  I haven't challenged it yet, but it is the coolest feature.  That can really make a video look all pro.  I'm still learning my way around this software, so maybe there are things that are there that I don't know about.  So far, I've made a few basic videos for YouTube I've found that and VideoStudio is similar in feel to PowerDirector, but some things aren't as intuitive, or maybe I've just been with PowerDirector so long that anything else feels alien.  The videos have turned out great, though, unlike Windows Movie Maker which makes my videos somewhat grainy.  It's more powerful than Windows Movie Maker and has more options.	1
Corel VideoStudio Ultimate X9 hasn't been very successful for me. I've been unable to load it on a ZBook 15 with a Xeon processor. The installation went fine, but the software itself crashes right out of the box. I've attempted for weeks now to get it up and running so I could do my review on the product for Corel and Vine, but have been unsuccessful in my attempts.	-1
We have a video buff in the family so we have had experience with X4, X6, X7, and now X9 of the Corel Video Studio.  X9 has some very big improvements over the other editions.  For this being the Ultimate, they do charge you extra to be able to authorize Blu-ray discs, something that leaves a bad taste in your mouth.  This is a very difficult review to write as I am gearing it toward those who have never used this program before and those who like us have used previous versions and are familiar with this software.  I will touch on high points and give an overview trying to keep it as concise as I can.  WHAT TO EXPECT FROM THIS EDITION (GENERAL OVERVIEW) Stop Motion Capability Standard Definition and HD quality videos Can do In Depth video editing from multiple video sources Can add and customize audio timelines with in depth capabilities Comes with fast flick easy editing mode (quick and easy video projects) Screen Capture for anything you do on your computer Additional programs for creating custom text and video effects Lots of transitions ,animations, templates for lots of creativity 64bit program for faster rendering time  NEW FEATURES WHICH WERE ADDED IN THIS EDITION Multi camera editor (supports up to six cameras and two additional soundtracks with multiple sync points including Audio Markers) Enhanced audio capabilities (Select multiple audio tracks to normalize audio) Can customize attack and decay (ramp in and ramp out of sound) They have enhanced audio ducting to be able to work on multiple clips at same time Includes new Blue Video effects (exclusive to the Ultimate version) Create custom templates for Fast Flick Can share templates with other people Now supports HVEC which is H.265 video format Supports MSF video format (exclusive to the Ultimate version) Improved .MP4 and .mov performance Optimized for 6th gen Intel I7 chipsets Enhanced motion tracking  COMMENTS The multi camera editor can take all sorts of video from various sources and use them in sync.  So if you took video from your cell phone and a video camera, you can sync them up with this program.  From our experience it seems to work quickly and without glitch so far.  The new audio enhancements seem to be pretty cool.  Now you can select multiple tracks and be able to normalize the audio a lot faster than before.  This makes the work flow much faster than previous versions.  Audio ducting moves at a much faster pace in work load since you can do many clips at the same time manually or automatically.  It works pretty easily without issue so far.  New Enhanced Motion tracking will track motion up to four points in the video as compared to the previous versions only able to do one.  This makes witness protection in video a lot more effective and easier to do with less room for misses and errors to better protect identities.  There are a lot of different options for outsourcing videos.  You can outsource via web (Facebook, YouTube, social media, etc), DVDs, SD cards, HTML5,  and portable devices.  One of the most exciting parts of this package is the 30 day membership to the Studio Backlot.  This is a fantastic boost for beginners to experienced users.  The video tutorials go into great depth explaining the features - old and new- of this program.  This is probably the most beneficial part of this package as it really takes the user to a new level of willingness to experiment and learn the program.  It really can push a user, regardless of previous experience to new heights not previously possible so quickly from this program.  Before this feature, it took a lot more time and research to try to figure out all of the capabilities of what Corel VideoStudio could do.  Now, it is all laid out for you and you can take as much time as you need for 30 days to learn with optional membership after the 30 day period is up to continue with the Studio Backlot at like $7ish dollars a month which is not too bad if you need more time.  There are other programs that Studio Backlot that you can view tutorials from as well in addition to the Video Studio.  DRAWBACK In previous versions, you were able to create Blu-rays.  However, in this version, you are not able to create Blu-rays until you pay $8 to unlock that feature.  Considering that this is supposed to be the Ultimate version, I found that to be very irritating.  Why should we have to pay MORE to make high definitions Blu-rays when we always could make them in previous versions I have had included.  THE BOTTOM LINE If you want to do some powerful and professional video editing, the multi-camera editing features with enhancements will make the job a LOT easier and faster.  Faster workflow and fantastic tutorials through the Studio Backlot make this an excellent program to use.  We are still very disappointed that we have to pay EXTRA for Blu-ray capability, but the program is still well done.  Because of the exclusion of Blu-ray without extra fees attached, I am giving this four stars.  They should never have kept that feature out of this version with all of the great improvements.  I will update as time goes on and we are able to use this program more and I can comment with more detail and perhaps even edit comments with new information.   I will also update with our computer specs for the computer we installed this on soon.	1
Installation is easy and this is jammed packed with features.  Too many features. I don't even know where to start.  The interface doesn't help much, it's somewhat cluttered and it's hard to find what I need and figure out what everything does. I have to search the net for help often. So expect a steep learning curve.  This works fine on my Windows 10 laptop.  I wish there was a simplified beginners mode for this. I'm an engineer, so I CAN figure it all out, but I don't WANT to, at least not all at once. When I design software, I make my applications easy for the user.  Starting the user in a simple mode and then having an advanced mode is a good way to allow the user to get acclimated with the most popular features before moving on to more advanced user.  To be fair, the more I use this, the more I like it. That being said, I don't like to have to watch a video to learn how to use software. I create user interfaces and user experiences for the products I work on. The computer is so powerful today and it is so easy to make good interfaces, that I should be able to start up a program and just intuit how to make it do what I want. Software like this should have a simple mode and an advanced mode. If you just want to use the basics, you shouldn't have to learn everything. It's like learning advanced calculus so you can add up your grocery expenses.	1

In testing VideoStudio Ultimate X9 (VSU X9), it never balked at accepting any of them. While I found VSU X9 feature-dense and not especially intuitive, I was able to compile content from multiple capture devices  and files already on my computer and assemble them (with titles and a music track) within an hour of installation. While it was hardly art, it worked. With time, practice and exploration of the 313 page user guided (downloadable .pdf) and Corel's online guides,  I anticipate improving results as I become more familiar with this  program.  This software worked excellently from installation through export of my compiled content in its project manger to multiple output formats.  Installation on a Windows 7 machine (64-bit with 16 GB of RAM and a quad-core 3.4 GHZ Intel processor) took about 25 minutes. The VSP X9 installer included a progress bar that accurately indicated the install status.  The interface is based on a 3-part concept: capture (or import), edit and share (or output). In between are more options than all but the most proficient users will be able to appreciate. Output options are abundant, for both writing to physical media, creating many different digital file formats (of varying resolution) and sharing directly to multiple popular social media sites (including YouTube, Vimeo, Flickr and Facebook).  PROS: -Works with many source file types (I didn't have any on my machine it couldn't work with) -Outputs to physical media, multiple digital file types (at multiple resolutions) and social networking sites (YouTube,  Facebook, Flickr and Vimeo) -Includes a selection of audio files to populate soundtracks with the "Auto Music" feature -Includes an computer screen capture utility: awesome (since the most widely used of these can cost hundreds of dollars)  CONS: -Interface is cluttered and not especially intuitive. -No included help files., "F1" takes you to Corel's website. OK only if you have persistent online access (and vendors should NOT assume this); user guide and quick start guide are .pdf files that you have to download separately. -Many of the effects and features (for both content and titling) could quickly tire viewers if over-applied. This is less a criticism of the software than of the potential for over-use of these tools by some users. This is especially true for the "FastFlick" quick video creator utility, which I felt did not do enough to let me know what effects were going to  be present as part of the pre-authored templates.  Finally: VSU X9 also includes tools for DVD authoring and 3D video creation; neither of these are part of my own regular user needs, so I didn't test them.  The accompanying video shows the result of quickly capturing multiple video and still file formats, adding titles, audio files and capturing a PC screen.  Overall: impressive performance and decent value for the price.	1
I am running this on a Windows 10 laptop with a Core i7 processor, and I too have had issues where the program aborts and stops responding. It seems Corel needs to issue an updated patch for this software. I did try to check for updates, but it does not find any. I am able to use the program at times, but have yet to successfully complete a project.	-1
The DVD reader on my primary computer is broken so I downloaded the files from the Corel site.   The total install is about 3.8GB and though the downloading was pretty quick, the very slow install process failed the first time, throwing up a message that I should call Corel Technical Support. No error codes, no explanation, no nothing that an experienced user would use for troubleshooting before getting involved with a probable wait for telephone support.   So I relied on instinct and tried to install a second time, which also took a very long time, but it installed without issue.   On an i7 based computer with an Nvida GPU, 16GB RAM and a 7200RPM drive, launching Corel VideoStudio Ultimate X9 invokes a static splash screen that cannot be minimized or sent to another layer. The VideoStudio splash screen takes over you machine, keeping you from doing anything else, for more than 3 minutes! Absolutely unbelievable. After taking my  enforced nap, I checked in Preferences to see if the splash screen for an option to not have it launch. Nope.   The next time, I wil have a stop watch handy when I launch VideoStudio, but I think the three minutes plus is reasonably  accurate.   Unreal.   I checked Windows 10 Task Manager and my system is relatively clean, no impediments to Corel executing quickly.   But everything about this program seems to be slow. Dragging clips from the media bin to a track is slow. There is a noticeable delay between clicking the lay  start button and the video playing. Transitions take time. Everything takes time, way too much time.   I run Adobe Premier Pro, Adobe Premier Elements, Cyberlink PowerDirector, TrakAxPC, Magix Movie Edit Pro 2016 and other video programs on this computer and none run as slow as Corel VideoStudio Ultimate X9.   As a result of this sluggish performance, I have to give up testing it for today  I just don't have that much time. I will come back to it later when I can endure the long waits. I will say that the program was stable during all this: no crashes, just incredibly slow performance. And the idea of a static splash screen that you cant dismiss is pathetically archaic.   More later  when I have the time and patience. If I can get the program faster, my rating will almost certainly increase.  Jerry	-1
Loads easy enough.  We'll see how it works as I learn it.  I'll update this.  I'm hoping to come up with trailers for my books.	1
Looking over some of the other reviews I was worried that this version would be a mistake to try.  I have to say it is running well on my Lenovo Flex 3 with Intel I5 and 8gb of ram.  I have had VideoStudio X7 and X8, and this version runs much better then the earlier two.  There is a service pack that I downloaded and installed.  I had one issue, my reasons for 4 stars and not 5.  After many hours of video editing I had it stop and give me a message, "VideoStudio has stop running."  The good news, I had saved my project and I was able to reload and return to editing.  I haven't had this happen since, but I still save my project regularly.  I have a Canon 5D Mark III, and Sony RX100 IV, and a few other video GoPro type cameras that I use and have edited and assembled final videos using Corel VideoStudio Ultimate X9.  The Ultimate gives you lots of transitions, quick start templates and much more that makes your final videos look good.  This package comes with Corel FastFlick X9, a quick easy way to put a video together fast,  Corel Screen Cap X9, this allows you to capture your computer screen, and VideoStudio Training (7 days free, $69 for a year), everything you need to start making super videos.  Bottomline, you could spend a lot more money on video editing software than this and not really get much of anything more.  This package is one of the easier packages to learn and use.  There is plenty of info online to learn more and to find suggestions.	1
This is a very powerful program.  There is not much that a home video editor cannot do with this.  Some of the wizards aimed at recreational users were not really what I was looking for.  So while "fast flick" is not greatly useful for me, others might find it interesting.  What i was most impressed with is the improved multitrack editing.  If you need to integrate footage from multiple cameras, this software works wonderfully.  Of course, as with all such software it is very processor and memory intensive.  But as long as you are using the correct times, renderings took about as long as expected.  In terms of value it's hard to find better.  For the features, this is a tremendous value in editing software.	1
Advanced users will appreciate the stage-based platform combined with a budget friendly price.  If you are working on multiple machines and don't want to buy licenses for the high dollar software for each of them, this is a great package for your "tertiary" work stations.  Know going in that no matter your experience level with video editing, there is going to be a learning curve with this one.  Everybody has particular wants and gripes with software, so in the end, my opinion will matter less to you, than knowing the pros and cons.  Pro: Very budget friendly in a software category that can range into the thousands.  Pro: Does everything an amature like me requires of video editing software.  Pro: Multi-camera and 4K video support.  Pro: Active online community, tutorial videos, and support from Correl.  (Con: You will need that to get the most out of the software.  It takes some figuring out.)  Pro: Free templates, fonts, and creative bits.  Con: It has been less friendly since my upgrade to Windows 10.  Con: Some features are non-intuitive.  Con: Playback experience is directly linked to the power of your computer.	1
I've been using Corel and PowerDirector over the years. I like them for different reasons. Corel has always been pretty user friendly, so if I want to quickly edit something, that's what I use. The interface is easy to use, the program has a number of templates, drag and drop effects, a variety of filters and transitions and professional looking titles. It's also easy to load video, edit in the timeline, and make a cohesive movie to upload to the internet. You can also create video in a few different formats. So, for beginners, this is a great program.  If you're a more advanced video editor, I'm not sure this is for you. You may need more effects and bells and whistles. But for the home user just wanting to transfer videos of the kids or vacation, or for the small time vlogger (which I've used it for many times), this program is just fine and well worth the price.	1
I have a previous iteration of this software which was good video software to use.  1.  Loading:  This is a 64 bit version really.  I tried this on an older 32 bit system, but the limits of that system made messing with video programs and pictures in general make this a troubling idea.  Loading is easy on a single DVD.  2..	1
Corel VideoStudio Pro X9 is another great product from Corel. I have been using Corel products for many years, both Photo and Video software. I find them to have the tools a regular user needs plus some advanced tools for the professional. Also Corel products are much easier to use than others.  I have been using this software to edit some movies I took at a recent gathering. Doing what I needed was straight forward and easy to accomplish. I have Cyberlink Power Director as well which has more elaborate features but is not as user friendly. Fortunately I know how to use this type of software and am able to navigate it. The main difference is that with Corel it is much easier where as Cyberlink it is not. Both are great programs but if you can not figure out how to use one then its not much good.  This software installed easily, contains many great features,  has not crashed at all, and does everything I have needed it to do. I am very pleased with it and recommend it. Corel products have always proven to be positive experiences for me over many years.	1
This is one of the best video editing programs out there. I find that it has many great features, with some quick "wizard" type capabilities, but that the real worth of the system is in the detailed editing capabilities.  I have been using VideoStudio since X3, so I was basically aware of how it works. For the beginner, there are excellent tutorial videos available, and there are quick movie applications, and a method to quickly generate picture shows. They also include a program to capture the output of your screen, which would be useful for training, or just sharing what you are seeing.  For advanced users, there is the stage. It has the typical elements, with video track, overlay track, title track, voice over track, and music track. The tools include project templates, transitions, titles, background patterns, special effects, and paths (used to make items flow a certain pattern). Most of the tools have literally dozens of options, all of them visually presented so you know what is being done to the video.  Once the video is edited, you can share it to the web, create an ISO, or make a DVD. It can create high definition DVDs. They have options for creating for mobile devices, computer, web, DVD, and 3D. A wizard takes you through the process of creating menus and chapters for DVD options - which can also be customized.  I found that the rendering engine is very fast, and makes full use of multiple processors. It is the fastest I've worked with.  The one thing you need to realize is that it will take some time to master the program - there is a lot of stuff here. Personally, I suggest creating a test project, and applying the effects and etc to see what they do. I've always found that doing is the best learning. It is how I learned the Corel system when I started, and a few hours of dedicated practice will lead you to appreciate the capabilities.  Summary: Powerful and a bit complex - but the results are worth it.	1
Corel VideoStudio Pro X9 has created a great video editing program that anyone can use. From editing your old videos to cutting edge video to be posted on YouTube, this software is just the thing.  The package was annoying however because all the different languages piled on top of one another made it very hard to read.	1
Previously I was using Windows Movie Maker to edit clips because it would get the job done very fast without unnecessary complexity.  Since Windows Movie Maker is no longer included with Windows 10, I'm looking for replacement software.  I avoid Adobe products these days since they moved to a subscription model for their pro-level products.  Corel has been around forever in graphics software (I remember using Corel Draw in the early 1990s when I did some part time work as a graphic arts designer), although video is a newer area for them.  Corel VideoStudio X9 actually feels very similar to Windows Movie Maker.  I was able to edit clips, split clips, make transitions, and apply effects within 10 minutes of playing around with the user interface.  I didn't have to read any of the user manual to make edits right away.  This has much larger library of video effects, although some of them are cartoonish looking and could have been implemented better (for example it would be nice to have a natural looking rain or lightning effect, rather than the artificial looking ones).  If you're not sure about Pro vs. Ultimate, it's easy to upgrade after you buy the Pro version.  When you exit the program a dialog pops up with an offer to upgrade to Ultimate for $14.  Then after downloading the upgrade files, enter the new serial number and you have all the extra Ultimate features.  Here is a screenshot while I was playing around with the motion tracking that follows an object in the video.	1

Its for those with newer PCs who have Windows 10, 8, 8.1 or 7 and who are seeking support for the latest 6th Generation Intel processors, or those users who are seeking pro-quality editing tools (like multi-camera support) with the capability of working with 4K video.  I like this software very much as an alternative to Camtasia Studio - a much more expensive bit of software by TechSmith.  Corel offers great tutorials, a very good PDF User Manual, Community Forum and a free trial (30 days) for those who want to try it out before they buy.  On my Windows 7 PC it ran flawlessly as it did on my Window 10 PC.  Installation was easy via download and a little bit fussy via the included DVD in the package I received. (I had to go into My Computer to find the file to get it to launch.)  Once installed there are lots of free templates, font packages and background downloads that you can add to your software as desired.  Overall, this product is about as easy to use as its competitors at first glance, but the tutorials and clean interface make it something that is relatively easy to use with practice.  (Try out the FREE trial on the Corel site to give it a go before you buy, and you'll really know if this one is for you.)  The bottom line is that many users will enjoy this softwares perks, but if you already own&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Corel-VideoStudio-Pro-X8-Old-Version/dp/B00T0I6J9E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Corel VideoStudio Pro X8 (Old Version)</a>&nbsp;or don't need the new features be sure to compare versions to make sure you need the few updates offered in X9 before you buy as there's a big difference in price..  NOTE: Video review has been completed by using the Corel VideoStudio X9 Pro's Screen Capture feature and adding transitions to the front and back of the video.  The video size for 13 + minutes of video was 223 MB which I compressed to a 84 MB file to upload to Amazon by using Free Video Compressor software..	1

While I found VSP X9 feature-dense and not especially intuitive, I was able to compile content from multiple devices and files already on my computer and assemble them (with titles and a music track) within an hour of installation.

Ultimate X9 adds two additional multi-cameras to the sync/alignment capability (6 instead of 4) and a suite of features for special effects.  The accompanying video shows the result of quickly capturing multiple video and still file formats, adding titles, audio files and capturing a PC screen.  Overall: impressive performance and decent value for the price.	1
I'm only an amateur with video cams, so I don't need all the bells and whistles.  What I do love about Corel VideoStudio is that it is oriented to somebody just like me, who wants, actually, NEEDS to improve videos he has shot and is putting them on YouTube.  I'm never going to win any awards. But, thanks to Corel VideoStudio Pro, those among you who chance upon my YouTube videos will be slightly less annoyed with my productions.  I rate it five stars due to its low price and ease of use.	1
The full program comes on one DVD.  No content or extra discs to install. After installation, the program advised it was ready to install service pack 3.  I clicked install and it indicated the installation was successful and launched the program. However, when I clicked check for updates, it again said service pack 3 was available.  I installed the service pack again, restarted and it finally said the program was up to date.  I mainly use video editing programs to trim down personal videos to make them a more watchable and enjoyable size, so I'm reviewing this from that perspective.  I don't use these for film class or to try to become the next Spielberg.  I simply want to clean up and edit my video.  For this particular example, I used eight clips from a Sony Action cam that I recently filmed on vacation and an MP3 song encoded at 256kbps as background music. I only used one track each for video and audio.  The only effects I added were a few transitions. I'm not really into effects other than basic titles.  Since I planned to use this project as the example for my review, I added the transitions to see how theyd affect encoding.  My PC has an Intel 2.8mhz dual-core i7 processor, 512GB SSD, 8GB RAM, Nvidia Quadro 1000M GPU and is running 64-bit Windows 10.  I trimmed the eight clips down to about 7 minutes and trimmed the music to match. Other than the transitions, I added no other effects.  It took about 12 minutes to encode the video to a full-HD MP4 at 30fps.  Although the fan kicked on, it didn't seem to burden down my PC and the temperature hit a max of 126 degrees F while encoding. The end result was very good with clear video and sound and no dropped frames or other issues.  Usability is straightforward although those familiar with this type of video editing software will be up and running a little quicker than those coming from programs like the newer versions of iMovie.  Videostudio X9 meets my needs which are admittedly fairly basic.  I can't speak for how it will perform for someone who needs tons of special effects and features but if you need a good capable editor for simple to moderate complexity, it can definitely handle it.  It does so with reasonable resource usage.  My only complaint, which is not unique to this version, are the in-your-face ads to upgrade.  You can click to choose not to show the ads again but it doesn't make it any less annoying.  If someone wanted Ultimate, they would have purchased Ultimate.  They don't need to be bombarded with ads featuring special upgrade pricing for Ultimate after the very first use of Pro.	1
WARNING: Right now this is priced exactly the same as https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01AC3ZAHW/ If you are like me, you might not be sure which one is the better product. It turns out that Ultimate is considerably better than Corel VideoStudio Pro X9. DON'T buy this version if the prices are the same. I don't know why they are both currently being sold for $79.99, or how long this situation will last, but I would be hacked if I paid ~$80 for this version and found that I could have purchased the same product with the ability to add more camera views and with a LOT of extra high quality editing tools included.  Moving on the the actual performance of this product. It is what I have been using to edit video since I can remember. We had VideoStudio X5 on our computer and upgraded from it. We have used many different versions over time. They haven't really changed all that much, which is to say that they are all pretty straightforward and easy to use - especially once you learn your way around the program and have invested some time in using the program.  It is very easy to add basic graphics, text overlays, and the usual stuff. Music is easily added and you can even toss a video in and let it make the video for you and it will often be good enough, or need only a little final editing. Which is pretty amazing, but most of the software out there does this too.  I find it very easy to use, and Corel has gotten much better recently when it comes to customer service. Something changed there... They also have some very good user-to-user resources if you google them and ask questions. Often fellow users would have answers before Corel.  But as I said, Corel has improved a lot lately.  There are some cons, almost but not quite knocking this down to four stars.  Occasionally, I have run into glitchy and stuttery operation. This usually happens when loading a video format that is older or natively designed so that it uses more processor power than other, more modern codecs.  /UPDATE:  After playing with version X9 some more, I am finding that it does load some of these files without having to use a conversion program first - that is a really big deal if you have any of these old cameras around, or need to work with video from these cameras.  This finding makes me rate the software a solid 5 stars! END UPDATE/ Second, I really expect that I should be able to load ANY video file that my computer can PLAY into this program and edit it, and have it convert quickly to something that is modern and easy to edit and use. But I've had to jump through hoops to use older codecs like Kodak Zi8 and Creative VADO sometimes.  I understand that part of the problem lies with the older cameras. But I really think this software should be mature enough now to make those things invisible.  We should be past the days of someone wanting to edit some video they found laying around on their old camera and having to research how to convert that video. If the computer can play it (it can) then this software (IMHO) should edit it.  Overall, I am a big fan of Corel. I have been using Paint Shop Pro since the days when it was shareware and JASC. When Corel took over the software, there were some hiccups, but they have done a lot of good things with it and that software, in my opinion, is every bit as good as Photoshop for most people and priced much more reasonably. I feel like VideoStudio is sort of the same deal with video editing software. A FAIRLY priced product that works really well for most people without having to take classes at their community college just to use it.  Overall, I highly recommend this software and in spite of its minor issues, it is a great way to edit just about any type of video. I will say, despite the "Pro" label, it is not pro software. It is really good home software, but if you are a pro you know that and are using specialized tools on specialized hardware. This is great for almost everyone else though.	1
I have a 4 year old PC, not cutting edge even then, and it runs pretty well.  My editing needs are light, and for me VideoStudio is easy to learn, easy to use, and works well.	1
I'm an illustrator who works primarily in vector format and CorelDRAW is one of my favorite programs for it. So first the cons- Support, documentation and user guides for Corel products can be iffy. If you're just starting out, and want to learn to use the program, by all means, read the user guide, help files and do the new user tour- but you'll learn a lot more about what the programs can do by looking for online tutorials and playing with the program.  So the pros- It's really intuitive. When you're starting, and facing all those options, it can be a bit intimidating, but if you've used any kind of vector software in the past, it's easy to figure out. The tools are great. I'm loving the improved knife tool and the fountain fills are a lot more adjustable and easier to use than X7 for beautiful ombre and shaded effects. So far, this has been running really well on my system. No crashes or freezes even with a lot of nodes and fill styles.  I love CorelDRAW. You can save in SVG format for plotters and cutters, you can trace bitmaps to create vector shapes and reduce the number of nodes or merge shapes easily. It does everything that more expensive programs do, and does it in a very user friendly way.	1
This is actually my first experience with CorelDRAW - but I love it.  Having no bad 'habits' from other versions, I learned how to use it directly from training videos and online sources.  If you follow the instructions you are golden.  Even as a beginner with the software (not graphics) I found these programs relatively easy to use.  As others have mentioned, it is more intuitive than Adobe.  That works for me.  I didn't want a huge learning curve since I don't do this for a living.  Overall, a wonderful suite of tools that you will enjoy creating incredible graphics.  Five Stars!	1
I think the last time I had and used Corel Draw was back in the late 90's. I actually took 3 semesters if college graphics arts courses using Photoshop so that is the program I am most familiar with so I never really got into the Corel graphics software. I think I had CorelDraw 7 way back then. It was before they started using suites. Anyway, though it was a good program then, I wasn't as familiar with it so I always went back to the Photoshop and illustrator rather than try to learn more about CorelDraw.  Recently, Adobe has made changes to Photoshop that I don't particularly like so when this came up for review I descided to give it a try. I'm still not very familiar with it. Big programs like these take a while to learn. But, I have played with it enough so far to get me excited about it. It seems to be pretty intuative and without ever reading a book I think I would eventually be able to utilize it well enough, however, I plan to order a book or CD so that I can really dig in and get the most out of it. I'm particularly excited about the webpage design creator and the raw photo editor. I used to make  websites but it's been so long that most HTML that I learned as long beeen deprecated. I came off the webuilding scene not long after CSS was born and that was a long time ago. Too long for this old brain to remember much.  I'm really hoping that once I get enough CorelDraw under my belt to be efficient with it, I can release Adobes hold on me and make the switch for good. And so far, it is looking good. Installation was easy. I will update as I learn more about this program and share what I know.	1
The software itself is robust and quite useful for the graphics designer in your firm or family. Installation is fairly simple but activation was another story. From within the program , it failed to recognize my password or if that was my user error, it failed to let me change it. Giving error messages. It did know that I had an account with my e-mail address. Finally I went directly to Corel.com and changed my password there. Mission accomplished, or so I thought. Once opening one part of the suite and entering the info, you still need to validate an e-mail link before access is granted to the other portions of the suite. Once these hurdles are overcome you should enjoy the newest version of CorelDRAW Graphics Suite X8	1
Update: As Corel stated I finally was able to load Corel X8 on top of Corel X7 that I had purchased previously. However I just loaded X7 and it required me logging into my Corel account to do so. It accepted my username, and password and initialized the program. So all is well here now. It was frustrating, but I have loved Coreldraw, and the other suite of programs in the graphics suite, and will now be able to enjoy them. For what it is worth, below is my original review and some of the frustration I experienced. It is entirely possible that Corel was having a problem with their servers on this day, making functionality difficult to say the least. I really do love the program. Below is my original review.  The thing I love about Corel Draw is the ease of use. I have several expensive Adobe products and the learning curve is radical. Corel has built in several different levels of sophistication. They have simplified ways of doing everything so anyone can get professional results. As far as another comment that they have zero support that is inaccurate. You can Google Corel support and they have a huge contact us page with three options: 1) Chat Online 2) Submit a ticket to support and get an answer within 24 hours 3) Call them with the listed 800 number Mon-Thurs 9am -10pm, and Friday 9am  7pm EST.  I used the chat feature and was instantly connected to a representative at get a load of this 7:01 am on a Tuesday EST. When you get into a chat they answer all of your questions, and they automatically send you an email notifying you that a support ticket with number has been created for you so you can use that feature as well, and they have a copy of your chat session to bring them up to date. Now that is what you call first class support. So what I learned from my chat session is that you can install this software into up to 3 machines (that you own) and only use it in one machine at a time. The software is licensed per household or per single address. According to their EULA (End User License Agreement) you are leasing the software not buying it. As they say in the EULA The below agreement gives you permission to install and Use one copy of this product on one computer or electronic device at any given time as set out in the details in the EULA. That is what it says but the chat person said you can install it in up to 3 but only one usage at any given time. Also on the X7 sale page here at Amazon the Corel factory representative responded to the Q&A the same way with install of up to 3 machines with one use at a time. Also the EULA says this is a license, not a sale. The software is licensed to you, not sold to you. You may not sell, rent, lease, resell, or loan the software. That is a bit of a disappointment to me because I purchased X7 and was hoping to be able to sell it. Not! It aint going to happen. However my brother lives with me and Corel said him using it is no problem. Same household, and not more than one person using it at the same time. Corel X8 installs right on top of X7 and you can have both of them installed at the same time. So if you are unsure about compatibility it is advisable to install X8 first before, if you decide to uninstall X7. That way you won't go through any hassles reloading X7 for any reason. I cant see why you would need both; X8 does it all and then some. This is a bit disheartening. When you open any part of the software it is precluded with a sing in box and when trying to sign in I get an unexpected server error. Then I try the second email address I have registered with Corel it says incorrect user name or password. So after many frustrating attempts to be able to use the software I unchecked the box that said I already have an account. Then clicked on continue and it says this email address is already in use. So I did a chat after logging into my account using the same email address and password that was refused as a server error when trying to use the program and they wanted me to do a screen capture of the error message. Then the screen capture function in my successful install of X7 before didn't work right. So the support person said I had to reinstall the program. So I thought first I would reboot after the X8 install and I did. Up came the same error message not letting me get into the program. So I took the chat reps advice and tried to uninstall so I could reinstall. He told me to use Control Panel to uninstall. When I went into Control Panel and selected the program the message came up to wait while the program finishes the install first.  Something was going on because my entire machine was running at a snails crawl. So I waited, and after a while the control panel screen came up and gave me options so I tried using the repair feature instead of removal and see how that goes. That is running now. It is taking forever. Its been several minutes and it is 6% complete. I will spend hours getting this sorted out. X7 loaded without a catch before. For now I have to give this experience 2 stars. Hopefully when it is all said and done I can move the ratings up. I must say that even though the support chat told me that I can install X8 right alongside X7 I am suspect that it could be the cause of the problem. Only time will tell. Both programs show up as separate apps in Win 10. I can load X7 programs fine. But then again if I uninstall X7 and X8 turns out to be the problem, then I will have to find the X7 disc which is buried in a box somewhere because I have been remodeling my house. Will come back after I get this sorted out. So far I am not impressed.	1
**** Update 04/27/2016  **** Service Pack 2 came out.  Uploaded and it fixed the crashing problem.  The CorelDRAW Swite now is running perfectly!  Five Star Update. Old review below. ___________________________________________________________________________________________ Let start by saying I am an old time user of CorelDraw.  I used it for years at my job and loved it.  The Suite X8 offers much more and still has the feel and performance I remember.  I am also a Adobe Photoshop user.  I ended up moving more into using Photoshop mainly due to more local classes and support compared to CorelDraw, though Corel was/is my favorite.  If you are looking at this Suite I'm sure it is because you know what you need for your job.  I don't see the hobby types using or buying this based on the cost.  Installation was painless and flawless.  I guess we would hope so for this price range of product.  Once installed I find everything seems to work well.  I would like to give a more detailed review, however I am unable with the amount of time given me to complete this.  You see, I received this from Amazon Vine to review and I received this package for the cost of the taxes on the product.  I will make a good attempt to update this review as I have more time to explore and use it.  All in all if you need a graphics program for work, this is an excellent suite package and offers more for the money than my Adobe package other than local training.  Other than the frequent crashing of the program, it would be great.	1
I have used Corel products for years and never find them lacking in updated material. I like the features of this new version and it didn't take me long to get the hang of the upgraded items. It matches Adobe for greatness and costs much less.  My graphic design business requires the tools Corel Draw supplies. It's a neat package and has great 'how to' information. Nothing is simple in the world of graphic design, except this new Suite X8.  Highly Recommended	1
The two main components of Corel Draw X8 that I will use are the Raw Photo Editor and the vector drawing program.  This product feels like two programs that I used a lot.  One was a vector based application called Arts & Letters that I used a lot many years ago.  The Corel Draw drawing application is very intuitive for me except I had to explore the menu to learn which tool does what. Theres a lot to learn, but the basics don't take too much effort.  There are numerous useful tutorials built into the product plus there are a lot of YouTube tutorials on many different aspects of this application, so if you have the time and patience, you can learn how to do many different things.  I use the vector drawing tool to make draw renovations or add-on projects for my home  cabinets and the likes.  My wife is new to Corel Draw, but she is very interested in learning how to do everything.  It has many options and will take a while to learn, but with some determination, I think most everyone can learn how to use it.  But there is still a lot to learn to master the advanced techniques. This product is in a professional classification in my opinion.  I especially like the fact I can finally edit photos in Raw format.  I have a Canon D5 Mark II that Ive used to take a lot of photos around the world.  I take both Raw photos in CR2 format and JPG photos simultaneously.  Memory is cheap these days. I am especially impressed with how well Corels auto adjust works.  You can do a side by side split images to compare your adjusted image to the original.  Thats quite useful to know if your tweaks made the photo better or worse.  You can grab the image and move it around to different parts of the photo to see the difference in other parts of the photo being adjusted, not just down the middle.  And if you have previous experience with Photoshop, they have the option where the menu placement and structure will somewhat mimic Photoshop so you can reduce the learning curve when acclimating to Corels version.  I like what I see so far and I intend to use Corel as much as I can going forward  especially for Raw format editing.  This product is clearly not inexpensive.  It is a fairly serious investment to make and you should be sure this is what you expect. Corel offers a free 30 day trial download and no credit card required.  So if you new to this or have never used Corel Draw Graphic Suite, I strongly suggest you take them up on the 30 day trial before spending this much money.  And make sure you download it when you have sufficient time to devote to learning how it operates.  There is a significant learning curve, especially for newcomers.  I have used comparable products and I think I even purchased some of the Corel products quite a while back.  Using it seems all too familiar somehow.  Anyway Im very glad to own this product and I will make good use of it. There are other components to Corel Draw X8, but I doubt that Ill use everything in this package.  I think my wife might make full use of it. Shes excited to use it.  I did receive this product on Amazons Vine program, but just for the record, I have to pay self employment taxes (double social security tax) on what I receive and income tax as well.  So that works out to be about 36% incremental tax for me. Amazon reports this as income to the IRS. In the beginning it appears to be free, but when I pay the IRS, it is definitely not anyway near free. I write Vine reviews the same as if I bought it directly and give out the full range of stars from 1 to 5. You can check my 800+ reviews for proof. If a product performs as advertised, then I give it 5 stars. I would never knowingly mislead anyone with my reviews.	1
I've been a CorelDRAW user from day one when I started out in the Windows world. When I switched to Mac, I started using Adobe Illustrator. CorelDRAW has always been the ONLY comparable product to Illustrator, and continues to be so with Suite X8. It's exclusively a Windows program, so if that's the environment you're working in, and you're looking to upgrade to a real graphics program, Suite X8 would be a great choice.  As with Illustrator, the learning curve is steep. This isn't one of those watered down vector art programs, this is the real deal, meant to give you powerful tools to create a variety of deliverables in unlimited formats. I won't waste space here listing the modules and what they do, since that's available in the above product description from Corel.  What I will make note of is the inclusion of AfterShot 2 as a built-in module that is exclusive with this release via Amazon.  AfterShot 2 gives you the same kind of photo editing power that you'll find in Photoshop, and most notably adds the ability to edit RAW files from nearly every known camera on the planet that will shoot in the RAW format.  If you don't know what RAW is, then you'll probably never use this feature, but for those who do, it's nice to know Corel has finally added the support for RAW images that have long been available in Illustrator.  THE PROS *If you're already a CorelDRAW user, Suite X8 is a worthy upgrade.  Most of the user interface is identical, with a few enhancements, so you'll know your way around.  There's a free 30-day tutorial available online to get you up to speed on the new features and functions. *This is a one-person license, but it's a permanent license with no other fees required.  Corel also has a subscription service if you want to "rent" CorelDRAW, similar to Adobe's Creative Cloud, if you don't want to pay the full retail price up front.  The subscription also includes free updates. *CorelDraw will export and import native Adobe Illustrator files if you're moving from that platform, or also use Illustrator files, and prefer to continue to work in CorelDraw. *As a vector creator/editor, CorelDRAW can match Illustrator feature-for-feature, even though it may do things differently than Illustrator, you can get the same things done. It really comes down to a matter of preference.  THE CONS *You have to have an internet connection to activate the software, and to allow them to check your license at least once a month.  Not usually a problem since if you're reading this, you have internet access, but I find it a bit intrusive.  Just a small detail. *While CorelDRAW is an outstanding vector art program, I find Photopaint to be an inferior cousin to Photoshop, and the website creator should be avoided altogether. Corel is trying to provide a "value-added" incentive by adding these other programs in a "suite" but I wouldn't buy CorelDRAW for its photo-editing capabilities. *This is ONLY a Windows program. I've always wanted Corel to port DRAW over to the Mac.  If they had, I would still be using it and probably never have started with Illustrator, which then eventually drew me in to all of the related Adobe products.  That said, CorelDRAW does offer a robust export/import function to use files from other programs, but it's not as seamless as with Illustrator.  Just a reminder: This is NOT a program for newbies.  Even though Corel and everyone else touts the ease of use of their programs, there's a steep learning curve to programs like CorelDRAW and Illustrator when you reach this level of professional program.  But, don't be discouraged if you are new to this level.  You CAN learn the program, just give yourself time.  I would have given five stars, but took a star off for the inept web creator.	1
This software has an almost unlimited range of creative possibilities from advertisements to posters, logos, book illustrations and amped up family photos. One of the features that makes it exceptional is that you can customize your workspace to whatever design platform you were used to before you started using Coreldraw.  I never had the older version so I wouldn't know any of the differences or any changes that they've been from the old to the new. This program is designed for both professionals and everyday design in editing end beginners and pretty much anyone that buys the software will get a lot out of it and will benefit from it. As a photography student, I use it to create stand-out projects for my graphic design and photography classes in tech school. Definitely recommend it.	1
Got this for my 14 year old who loves making cool edits to pictures of his favorite athletes, then sharing with friends and posting online.  He was able to use a copy of Photoshop while he was taking a graphics course in school, but as that class is over, I thought this would be a good replacement.  So far, he's said it was easy to install, and found it fairly intuitive to figure out how to find what he wants to do.  He likes the bitmap to vector feature (TRACE) as he's able to copy images he finds places and add them to his finished product, often greatly increasing their size without any loss of quality.  He has just started using this product so not sure about the special effects he is used to v what is available but he seems to think from cursory review that it has a rich set of effects.  I like that it's a permanent license, something uncommon in software today. I also like the videos that help you get started.  Will udpate as the product is used more.	1
My husband installed this on his laptop for the review first. I actually have not put it on mine yet, mostly because he has a lot more experience with CorelDraw than I do.  (He's the official family geek.)  First of all, the program comes with a downloadable version, so if you don't have a dvd drive on your computer, you are still going to be able to use this.  Many laptops today just don't include an optical drive.  The new feature that had him the most excited was the font manager.  It can tell you if you have duplicate fonts, whether they are fully installed, protected fonts, etc.  This wasn't on the previous version, and it is a huge aid for someone who uses a lot of fonts for websites, etc. In any other program, being able to manage the fonts and see all of the ones you have installed is nearly impossible and certainly going to take a lot more time.   He was nearly giddy about this program, as there is apparently no other program that is nearly as efficient at managing fonts.  While I found it interesting, it wasn't something that got me nearly as excited as he was.  You can also get downloadable software for photo managing using RAW files called Aftershot.  This was another feature that had him drooling with joy.  This is a feature that you apparently need to download soon after activating your software.  This is a much more affordable option for managing graphics than any other brand.  It's not a subscription to use the software, it's software you actually BUY and install on your computer and you can use it until your computer is so antiquated that the Smithsonian Institute wants it for a display.  No additional fees or what he calls "hostage fees".  For those who don't always have internet access, you do have to have an internet connection to activate the software, but you also have to connect again once a month to maintain your activation.  This is apparently to prevent piracy, and is only a minor inconvenience.  Most people are going to access the internet that often without special effort, even if they are working offline.  It's also designed for Windows 10, which is probably the most used OS courtesy of the release method chosen by Microsoft.  I think all of our computers are actually running it, although we may still have one or two old laptops that just have 7 or 8 on them.  Not all programs are necessarily ideal in 10, so seeing this is addressing that issue head on is nice.  When we got this software, my husband had actually just finished a trial of the software, so he's been playing with it for a bit when he had time.  He really is a bit too excited about the font manager portion (okay, I'm boring, I just use like three different fonts, and don't really care about all of those others.  Then again, I like spending time with an old fashioned pen and a bottle of ink on paper practicing lettering by hand.)  CorelDraw is really great software.  For me, the fact that they have training videos is an asset, as I have decided that I should learn to be better at computer graphics and photo manipulation than I am, even if I just want to clean up shots of my granddaughter and daughter.  I'll confess that I really had not been spending much time with graphics software in the past decade, and I'm seriously behind the times in terms of using it.  The interface is user friendly, and the learning curve does not look like I'm attempting to climb Mount Everest in a pair of flip flops.  (That's IF I can get him to hush up as he goes on forever and ever about how wonderful the font manager portion is.)  It might be kind of neat to figure out how to draw and paint in a computer graphics program, without the mess and clutter of paintbrushes and acrylic paint tubes (my usual medium).  I'm excited about having this software and getting it installed on my laptop.  I'm creative in the 3d world, so expanding it into the cyber world would be an interesting and exciting process. Best of all, it is a much more economical option compared to Adobe's offering.  It may seem expensive, but I think it will be worth the expense for anyone who is serious about computer graphics.	1
I can't really add much to what other reviewers have already said, but I wanted to point out a few of my own observations.  1. Don't get this if you are a beginner or are getting something for a hobby. There are free and low cost programs out there that are better suited for your needs.  2. The font manager is a nice thing to have if you have a lot of fonts. I do, but I was skeptical about how much I would use it. It shows the fonts at a larger size and makes it easier to select than in programs with such tiny font previews.  3. PowerTrace makes great vector images from art you couldn't otherwise enlarge without a lot of quality loss.  4. The Photo Zoom seems to enlarge pictures very well. I was able to enlarge and print family photos from a pretty small size. The larger and higher quality the image, of course, the better this works.  5. I don't like having to connect to the internet to activate and use software. I know it's just where the industry is going, but I don't have to like it. Meanwhile the warez crowd will get whatever they want completely unfettered.  6. I didn't even bother to try the Help section. Run a search for whatever you're trying to do on it, and someone will probably have a tutorial or instructions that won't confuse you like "Help."  7. If you have some experience with these program, or with graphics programs in general, you will be able to figure this out fairly quickly. Most basic functions are the same in most programs-- it's just a matter of where they put the tab or button.  I've had a lot of fun with this, and I think you will too. Four stars for productivity and fun.	1
My daughter is very interested in drawing and recently bought herself a&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Wacom-Bamboo-Spark/dp/B010PKT6C2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Wacom Bamboo Spark</a>&nbsp;with some money she earned. She is not super computer savvy, but wants to turn her art into computer-type comics or maybe graphics for t-shirts. The Bamboo Spark helps her use her love for drawing by hand with a pen, into a computer image, but she needed a program to help refine and color her drawings.  We have Adobe Photoshop student edition, but it is really suited more for photos. She can use it and enjoys it, but she doesn't really like it for drawings. She thought this would be a nice tool that would work for both photos and drawings. She loves it so far!  It is definitely powerful. There are so many features that we just are learning. I was almost embarrassed to try to write a review because so many of them are written by people who are skilled with these programs and zoom through all the features right out of the box. But then I figured that there must be other people like us who are beginners and looking to learn...everyone had to be a beginner once, right!? ha ha  We like that there is a tour right away to help you get started. There are also a bunch of videos available to help you with what you want to do. I know when she first started with the Photoshop, and wanted to so something like a gradient, the internet was a huge help to walk you through step by step, and then you felt more comfortable with improving on that if you wanted. I know this program isn't as popular as Adobe, so there might not be as many instructional pages around, but we chose Corel anyway. I have always found Corel items just to be more simple and intuitive. I am a huge fan of WordPerfect and update that all the time. I always get complements on my documents and people always want to know how I did something...and I tell them you gotta ditch that crappy MS word! ha ha!  I really like that we can just use this without a lot of training or experience and without subscription. It isn't cheap upfront, but it is a powerful program. You can get cheaper or free stuff, but it just doesn't have the tools needed to really be creative. This is a wonderful introduction to a higher level.	1
First a little background.  I have always been a Photoshop guy.  I am a pro photographer, and I have taught photoshop in my college photography classes for years.  However, the latest versions aren't really being sold.  Instead you pay a monthly or yearly fee.  No thanks.  I know that's the trend lately, but I don't have to like it.  As a result I am in the process of switching.  The Corel suite is, so far, just as powerful.  By that I mean that I haven't yet wanted to do something and not been able to do it with this software.  There has certainly a learning curve.  Corel uses different terms than Adobe.  What I know as layers are now called objects, to give just one example.  It took me a while to become an expert at Photoshop, and this software will be no different.  As primarily a photographer, Photo-Paint will be the portion of the suite I use most.  It has been easy to adjust so far, and there are hints both at the right side and bottom of the screen.  I already like some things better.  For instance, when cloning, which I use often, in this program you select the area to clone from by simply right clicking it.  I was used to having to press alt, but this way is easier -- no hands on the keyboard.  I have so far found this to be quite easy to figure out on my own or with the on-screen hints.  I have only used Help when I didn't know what to call something because the terminology is different.  The Website Creator is also easy to use and has some good, pre-made templates.  I don't do a lot of websites, but I did a quick one to try it out and it was pretty easy.  In this case I am comparing it to Site Spinner, and this seems to compare well.  Aftershot allows editing of RAW files, and many other functions I have been using Lightroom to do.  The suite comes with a lot of extras, such as 1000 fonts, 10,000 pieces of clipart, templates, frames, fills, and a bunch more, and all can be used royalty free if you are doing commercial work.  The suite works well on my Windows 10 computer, and handles my dual monitor setup well.  I am impressed so far, and it isn't too expensive for a complete suite of graphics tools.  I am making the switch.	1
One thing you'll notice when you get Windows 10 is that it doesn't come with a dvd / blu ray player software. You have to dish out extra for that.  That one fact alone means that you need a bundle like this if you intend to watch any DVDs or Blurays on your laptop.  Overall this is a great bundle what makes it really awesome is that if you work a bit you can make this thing play your movies from your laptop on your TV and you can control everything via a phone APP.  That's kindof neat. More people these days are just building their home entertainment systems themselves with laptops and TVs and this thing works nice with a ROKU or an Apple TV.  WHY NOT 5 STARS Anybody that has read my reviews knows that I generally give 5 star reviews, even if I don't love the product,  and only take stars off if there's something material about the product.  Basically, I'm running multiple monitors and I am unable to view movies on anything but the primary monitor. I would prefer to be able to watch movie on any flat panel being being restricted to only the main screen.  Now, I'm not entirely sure if that's the fault of this software or if it's just because the bus on USB3 is not fast enough to support video coming through to the Hub -- so it might not be the software's fault.  I am able to do anything else and I can watch movies from Apple TV on any flat panel from my PC but for some reason, I can't make this product play movies on anything other than the laptop's native screen.  If I'm doing something wrong, I'm happy to fix it and give this product 5 stars.  OVERALL Great product. Great features. It really is essential for Windows 10.	1
Cyberlink PowerDVD 16 Ultra is a media player that supports not only Blu-ray playback, but also 3D Blu-ray playback as well as being capable of playing a host of different audio and video formats.  While there are other players such as VLC which are more affordable (free!), there are Blu-ray discs that VLC can not play.  For example, I could not play Spectre using VLC, but PowerDVD played the disc without hesitation.  Setup Cyberlink learned from the complaints about version 14 and now you are asked if you would like to associate video, music or images with PowerDVD.  A choice of extension for each media type like how VLC does it would have been nice, but at least you can choose what types of files you want to associate with the program.  Upon start, the program begins scanning your computer for images, music and videos.  To stop the program from snooping through your files in each of media files, you need to under settings / preferences / media library and there you can select the folders that PowerDVD will scan.  To stop the scan, simply remove the folders from the library.  I can understand why the authors would set the program to scan common directories without first asking, but I wish that there was a better way to stop the scanning if you didn't want it to happen.  PC vs TV One of the first screens that pops up when you start the program is a screen that gives you a choice between PC mode and TV mode.  Both have the same functionality, but the two modes present the menus differently.  PC mode is the classic interface with lots of options and menus.  The TV mode has much simpler menus to reduce screen clutter to make it easier to navigate.  The interface in both cases is smooth and easy to navigate.  Library The media library is a very nice feature.  The user interface looks clean and handles smoothly.  There are also options to customize the interface.  The photo viewer handled different file types and perusing through images files is much smoother and faster than with the Windows Photo Viewer, for example.  Having all of the video files in one place is very convenient.  There is the option to use YouTube and Vimeo files within the library as well which is a nice feature.  Media Support The ultra version of PowerDVD 16 is the only one of the three versions that includes Blu-ray 3D Disc support.  Casting A nice feature is media-casting support which allows you to stream audio and video to Apple TV, Roku, and Chromecast devices on your network.  However, for this to work you must have one of these devices and it doesnt work with Blu-ray discs.  Performance I played mkv, m4v and avi files with both PowerDVD and the free VLC player.  Both handled the different files types competently.  The video enhancement features of PowerDVD were set to sharpen detail, enhance lighting and optimize color (50%) and to enhance audio (50%).  I didn't seem much of a difference when playing both players side by side on my computer (see the image that I have uploaded of the comparison).  I found the playback of Blu-ray discs to be very nice but not spectacular.  However, for discs like Spectre neither the VLC player nor Blu-ray player that came with Nero 12 could decode the disc whereas PowerDVD did it with ease.  Power DVD allows you to change the enhancement features and to play side to side versions of the same image so that you can see the effect which is a very nice feature so that you can tweak the enhancements to get them just as you want them.  Overall Is it worth investing in PowerDVD if other programs such as VLC handles videos or Windows Photo Viewer allows you to scroll through photos?  The interface of PowerDVD is much slicker than the other programs and PowerDVD can handle a lot of different files types.  What makes PowerDVD better is the support of Blu-ray discs, especially 3D discs and the video and audio enhancements that the program offers.  Plus you don't have to worry about tweaking the program to make it play certain discs.  PowerDVD handles them all.  So if you are looking for a media center to handle all of your media, then PowerDVD 16 Ultra is a very good choice.	1
I get video files in all kinds of formats, and can't stand hunting for an application to play them in.  PowerDVD allows me to play just about everything (at least in my library) seemlessly. Easy to install, reliable, great output quality. Haven't tried it with 4K files so I don't know how it handles those.	1
Two years ago, I upgraded to PowerDVD 14 Ultra. Because PowerDVD 14 Ultra did not support FLAC audio, I still often used the VLC media player to play content that has FLAC audio. And to play ISO images on disk, I use Daemon Tools to mount ISO files to virtual drives that both PowerDVD 14 and VLC could then play. The free VLC media player also starts up a lot quicker than PowerDVD if I just wanted to quickly view something. Support for FLAC audio and the ability to play ISO images were both added to PowerDVD 15, along with a PowerDVD Remote app that lets you use your iPhone or iPod Touch as a remote control. PowerDVD 16 Ultra's two main improvements to PowerDVD 15 Ultra are: (1) a new "TV Mode", which I do not find that much more useful than the usual "PC Mode", and (2) some YouTube features such as the ability to download YouTube videos to play offline and the ability to upscale YouTube videos to HD quality, and the ability to watch Vimeo videos.  I was initially excited about the new YouTube features that were introduced in this version 16.  However, the new YouTube options are VERY buggy :-( In trying to play various YouTube videos in PowerDVD 16 Ultra, the software would either tell me that the video cannot be played and it just provided a link for me to play the video using the Web browser, or the PowerDVD busy-icon would continue to spin forever until I clicked the [Stop] button to end the attempt at playing the YouTube video and I had to use the Web browser to view that video on the YouTube site.  But for the online videos that PowerDVD is able to play, I am then able to use its TrueTheater audio and video enhancement options.  I often turn off the TrueTheater function when playing Blu-ray discs.  But YouTube videos often have mediocre video or audio quality, and so I find the TrueTheater enhancements to be very useful for playing online videos.  With many YouTube videos, PowerDVD only offers a subset of resolution qualities.  For example, I often encountered YouTube videos where PowerDVD only gave me the option to play it at two or three resolutions, such as 360P or 720P quality.  But if I play the same video using my Web browser on the YouTube site, I get the full spectrum of 144P, 240P, 360P, 480P, 720P, and 1080P quality options.  I would not mind PowerDVD leaving out some of the lower resolutions, but it should at least offer to play the video at the highest resolution that YouTube offers.  But instead it sometimes would not include the 1080P and/or 720P options that YouTube offers for the video, whereas playing the same video from the Web browser gives me all of those quality options.  The new feature to "download YouTube videos to play offline" is partially useful.  The software downloads the YouTube video to its own cache directory in a proprietary format.  So if you were hoping that PowerDVD 16 Ultra can now download YouTube videos as portable AVI or MP4 video files, it does not do this.  There are various Web sites that let you perform online conversion and download of AVI or MP4 files from YouTube, Vimeo, and other video sources.  In order to play ISO images, PowerDVD 16 first needs to install a device driver that creates a virtual drive.  On two ISO images, I found a weird bug where the video would play, but the audio was entirely missing.  But if I mount these same two ISO files using Daemon Tools Lite and then play the ISO image on the virtual drive that Daemon Tools Lite created, PowerDVD 16 then plays the audio normally.  So if you are not getting any audio from an ISO image being played by PowerDVD 16, try mounting the ISO file using Daemon Tools first, and then using PowerDVD 16 to play the ISO image mounted on the Daemon Tools' virtual drive, instead of directly playing the ISO image using PowerDVD 16.  If you plan to frequently play various ISO images during a single viewing session, it is faster to use Daemon Tools to mount the ISO images.  PowerDVD 16 takes awhile to mount each ISO image before it can play the ISO file.  You see its busy-icon spinning on the screen while it creates a virtual drive to mount the ISO image.  When you click the [Stop] button, the ISO image is unmounted and the virtual drive is removed.  And then when you play a different ISO file, you have to wait again while it creates a new virtual drive.  This delay is okay if you are just playing one ISO file.  But if you want to play multiple ISO files in a quick sequence, it is quicker to start up Daemon Tools and use it to mount each ISO file before playing the files in PowerDVD by accessing the virtual drives created by Daemon Tools.  I think PowerDVD's handling of ISO images would have fewer delays if it did not remove its virtual drive after the playback of each ISO image is stopped.  Ideally, after the first ISO image is played, the PowerDVD virtual drive should be retained for further use with other ISO files and only removed when PowerDVD is exited.  PowerDVD 16 is advertised for use with Windows 7, 8/8.1, and 10.  But I have also been using it on Windows Vista (Service Pack 2) for several weeks now with no problems.  It seems more stable than the previous PowerDVD 14 Ultra that I was using.  PowerDVD 14 Ultra would sometimes crash my computer with the Windows "Blue Screen Of Death", but I have not yet experienced a BSOD crash using PowerDVD Ultra 16.  Compared with PowerDVD 14, this version 16 is also far more well-behaved and polished in all areas.  After I installed PowerDVD 14 Ultra two years ago, I discovered that its installation routine quietly changed every file type association to default to PowerDVD, including all video, music, and image file types.  Other software like WinRAR and VLC Media Player politely ask if you want to associate various file types to default to being used by their software, and they let you click or unclick the file types that you want to associate or dissociate with the program.  Now PowerDVD 16's installation process also lets you select which file types to associate with the software, instead of forcing itself onto every file type.  PowerDVD 16 also has subtle improvements in remembering where you last played a video and the folder that you accessed last.  With my previous PowerDVD 14 version, every time that I closed the program, it would always still leave between one and five different processes running in the background that serve no purpose other than to consume memory.  With this PowerDVD 16 Ultra, closing the program usually cleanly ends five of the processes used by the program: clmediaparsersb.exe, CLMPSvc.exe, PowerDVD.exe, PowerDVD16Agent.exe, and PowerDVDMovie.exe.  It does sometimes leave the clmediaparsersb.exe, CLMPSvc.exe, or PowerDVD.exe processes still running, which I then manually have to end in Task Manager.  But this happens far less than how the previous version 14 would often leave these programs still running.  Most users will not notice or care about these leftover processes still lingering after the program is closed, but I frequently run CPU-intensive and memory-intensive programs, so I like to minimize the number of unnecessary processes.  As was also the case with PowerDVD Ultra 14, I have not noticed any strict licensing restrictions as I have been able to install PowerDVD 16 Ultra on multiple computers running Windows Vista, 7, 8.1, and 10.  If you are satisfied with the PowerDVD 15 Ultra that you previously installed, unless you can get a great upgrade price, the improvements in going from version 15 to 16 are far less than the improvements in going from version 14 to 15.  And if you are satisfied with using the free VLC media player, this PowerDVD 16 Ultra is quite expensive to get the extra features that you may not need or care about, and PowerDVD consumes a lot more memory than VLC. To me, one of the main convenience features of this PowerDVD version is the ability to directly play ISO images without the need of additional software to mount the ISO image.  But you can use the free version of Daemon Tools Lite to mount ISO images and play them with VLC too. On some slow computers, I have sometimes found VLC to stutter, lag, and drop frames during playback of some video content, whereas PowerDVD appears to utilize much better internal buffering to smooth out the playback and I rarely get dropped frames on PowerDVD.  But for unknown reasons, there are also various videos in MKV and AVI formats that play more smoothly on VLC than on PowerDVD. So for me at least, I like keeping both the latest VLC version 2.2.4 and this PowerDVD 16 Ultra on my Home Theater PC, because neither of these two media players can still play everything with equal smoothness.  But PowerDVD 16 Ultra now plays just about any kind of DVD and Blu-ray format that I throw at it.  So my 5-star rating is based on upgrading my previous PowerDVD 14 Ultra to this version 16.  If I was already using PowerDVD 15 Ultra, I would probably rate this 4 stars for upgrading from version 15 Ultra to 16 Ultra because this version 16 is not as much of an improvement from version 15.  But if you have version 14 or earlier, this version 16 is worth the upgrade.	1
The Cyberlink PowerDVD program is notoriously buggy. See the photo? That's as far as I get when inserting a DVD or Blu-Ray disk. It freezes and stays like that until you remove it from memory, then does it again with a new disk. Buy Version 15 and they want you to upgrade to 16 (for $45). If you have 16, they want you to upgrade to 17 (another $46). They keep you throwing good money after bad that it really adds up. Mine has the latest patch and it didn't change a thing. It still crashes and is unstable. I couldn't get Cyberlink to help (they offer help subscription service for a hefty annual sum). Bottom line: They don't support their product. You can get the VLC Video Player off the Internet for FREE. Some of the software bundled with this player is loaded with adware. Very expensive and it doesn't do much except brighten the image and sharpen it a bit. I'd give it three and a half stars if it worked. But now I wouldn't give it a single star because it crashes and won't work.	-1
This software did the job for me.  It is acceptable and functional.	1
This is very cool software and a huge step up from the freebie video display software provided on your PC.  Haven't tried the streaming features as yet.  There's enough features in this software that could keep you tweaking and having fun for weeks.	1
Subtitles do not render correctly on a 4k display  No customer support / service	-1
As advertised. However the access to YouTube and others does not work.	1
World number 1? That's an understatement. Maybe if your world limited to your balcony its ok but in my world its a scam. It came preinstalled on my computer and when I try to use it it miserably fail. So I installed my favored number 100 DVDFab--free for lifetime, does open any disk, gives you options like watch in pre-screen, subtitles, any region,  etc.	-1
works great!!!	1
doesn't come with a CD Key you have to buy it as an add on.....	-1
Cyberlink PowerDVD 16 Ultra is what you need when you don't have an Apple laptop, desktop, or iPhone and want to stream your media to your TV as easily as you can if you have Apple products.  Streaming everything from photos to videos stored on your device, to YouTube you're streaming from the Internet is a true no-brainer in the Apple world, but the Windows world has had only clunky solutions at best, until now.  While other reviewers have complained that the software is pricey, it's less pricey than owning the aforementioned Apple devices, and does pretty much the same from most any Windows-based computer from Windows 7, 8 (not tested) and 10 (tested).  I didn't have the install issues other users have, and am not sure why they experienced the kind of trouble they did, but installation was fairly straightforward as were the install instructions.  I would give this 5-stars except that I think the multitude of features are a bit overkill for the average user, and make the software's learning curve higher than it should be.  I know software publishers want their products to be the swiss-knife in the category, but 16 Ultra has sacrificed some of the simplicity of earlier versions with a lot of bells and whistles that, for me, bog it down.  If you're looking for a way to stream any type of media from your PC to your smart TV, this is certainly a good solution.  Note: You will have to have a device like a ROKU, Apple TV, Chromecast, etc., in order to provide the link between your PC and your TV, so take the cost of those into consideration as well.	1
This won't be a very technical review because there are many here that have gone into great details about the technical specifications. My purpose for choosing this software was to be able to watch my DVDs when traveling in a much better program then what's installed on my laptop. I love the user interface because it's very user friendly. I didn't have any issues with installation. I haven't gone through every single feature but the software works perfectly for what I'm using it for.	1
There is a feature option in this version that is new to me.  After installation, you are asked if you want to enter the PC version or the Television version without any explanation of what each offers.  I chose the TV mode and right away I didn't like the menu structure.  For some very weird reason, the title bar at the bottom is very wide and actually covers up a big portion of the movie menu such as subtitles.  You just cannot select the subtitles on most movies I have watched so far.  It almost seems like PowerDVD has dropped back to VGA resolution on my 65 inch Panasonic HDTV. And I cannot seem to shrink that ultra wide black bar at the bottom that has the play, stop, pause, etc symbols.  On some movies I've seen so far, I can use that big black menu to select the subtitles, but most often not. I just cannot imagine why they created such a huge black menu bar at the bottom of the screen.  Now the black bar goes away after you start watching the move.  I have had cases where I got stuck in a menu loop and had to start the movie from the beginning.  So I thought maybe it was unique to the computer I had connected to the Panasonic HDTV.  So I installed PowerDVD 16 on my best computer that has a new $475 NVidia card inside and it is connected to an $800 40 inch UHD computer monitor. But this time I selected the PC mode and the menu bar at the bottom was acceptable. Then I switched to the TV mode and there was that broad black line again. It was a little more narrow than on my 65 inch Pansonic HDTV, but not by much.  I still had the same issues trying to activate the menu in the bottom on the Movie menu image - that is selecting the language and subtitles.  I don't know what Cyberlink was thinking to create this monstrous thick black title bar that covers up the bottom part of the movie startup menu. I have almost every release of PowerDVD there is and this is the first time I've ever seen anything like this.  I will have to uninstall version 16 and go back to version 15.  I hope they come out with a new tweak to fix the huge black bar at the bottom of the screen or at least give me the option of selecting how big it is.  Back to the PC and TV modes for a moment, they offer some imaging enhancement that is supposed to allow the viewer to view in original content, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% enhancement.  I tried to see the difference between these five settings and neither my wife nor I could detect even the slightest difference in any of these optional settings.  It wasn't until I installed this new release on my computer with a UHD monitor and even then it was subtle. Basically, it gives you the choice of several levels of sharpness.  So setting it to 0% (original) just passes the video as it was recorded. If you skip to the end of the movie when the credits start to scroll, you can finally see a little difference between 0% and 100%. The lettering is a little more crisp when at the 100% setting. At the lower settings, the lettering looks slightly soft or very slightly blurring or maybe out of focus for lack of more descriptive terms. But when watching the movie, I just couldn't notice the difference even on the $800 40 inch UHD monitor and $375 NVidia video card. My wife has 20/15 vision courtesy of Lasik surgery and she couldn't see any difference either except for the rolling credits at the end of the movie. Her eyesight is near perfect and much better than mine.  So yes, it makes the image a little crisper on a UHD television, but don't expect miracles.  The second option has to do with audio quality and has the same range of 0% to 100% enhancement. I have a very high quality Klipsch 7.1 sound system and I really enjoy it.  But here again, neither my 27 year old wife nor I could detect any difference in sound enhancement. She can hear far better than I can. There's probably some improvement, but without the ability to instantly switch between two entirely different sound systems in an AB comparison, I don't think it is possible to hear any difference no matter how good your hearing is.  Now I don't want to be seen as overly critical. Thats not my intent.  Just moderate your expectations and don't expect miraculous improvements in the video and sound quality. There are definitely some video improvements  just subtle.  Obviously any enhancements are welcome. I it isn't a simple task to make these video adjustments in real time. And you cant create something out of nothing.  I just recently upgraded to Windows 10 and from what I can determine, Microsoft didn't include any video players in the operating system.  So it appears you will have to purchase an application like PowerDVD if you plan to watch movies via your computer.  There are some fairly good free movie players and I have used two of these apps. One is called VLC and another one is called MPC-HC.  VLC is fairly popular, but I think MPC-HC is a little better, but not huge amount. If you just want a casual computer based movie player, the free players are not bad  pretty good in fact.  You won't get a lot of frills, but they certainly do the job. There were a couple of instances where I couldn't get PowerDVD to play a movie ripped to my hard drive.  PowerDVD is apparently a lot more legal than some players when it comes to hard drive copies of movies.  I have a large collection of legal DVDs and Blu-ray movies in ISO format backed up on several high capacity disks.  That reminds me of a new feature on this release of PowerDVD  it will now play a ISO movie file.  But it takes it quite a lot of time to buffer the movie in memory before you are able to play the movie.  If you use the free app called Virtual CloneDrive to play the ISO image with PowerDVD, it loads far faster than PowerDVD. So I still have to mount the movies ISO file using Virtual Clone.  And that will automatically invoke PowerDVD to play the movie file.  It is a little annoying to unmount a movie file, but it will release the movie when you select the next movie you want to watch.  You can find the free Virtual Clone Drive app at the RedFox website along with some other interesting apps. It used to be called SlySoft, but recently Slysoft mysteriously vanished overnight. Dont download any recent updates to the Slysoft apps if you purchased a license or youll have to pay for it again.  My wife is not a native English speaker, so it helps her to see what is being said. And a lot of times, the sound recordings in movies is virtually inaudible and impossible to understand what the actors are saying. So even though the subtitles are annoying, I place more value on knowing what the actors are saying.  If you don't think my review is useful, tell me the reason why in the comments so I can improve my review writing skills.	1

I love the casting feature which I successfully used with a Roku 3. This software is great for viewing and casting video, still photos and playing music files. I think it fills a niche for those who miss Windows Media Center and are looking for a solid media player with perks.  Older video looks better using the PowerDVD 16 Ultra software, and everything sounds great! I love that it's capable of handling 4K, enhancing video of all types and casting to larger screens too. The integration of YouTube and Vimeo content was a sweet touch. Would love to see future versions include links to add Netflix, Hulu and other streaming services to the mix too.  I was able to install it on Windows 7, 8.1 and Windows 10 PCs without a problem and the more I use it the more I like it.  I also like that it comes with a $60 bonus software package with PhotoDirector 7 Deluxe, a digital copy of PowerDVD 16 Ultra, and 30GB of Cyberlink Cloud storage for 1 year. NOTE:  PhotoDirector software has its own unique serial number, but instructions to download and install it are inside the box.  -------------------------------------------------  What I like about this software...  + You can install it on multiple Windows PCs. Despite looking for the answer on the Cyberlink website, I've not found that there is a limited number of installs you can make with the included PC disc. There's also a link to download and install the software with the code on your PC disc if you have a laptop without a disc drive. I've put it on (1) Windows 7 and (2) Windows 10 PCs without issue.  + You can extract audio from video and save it to a file. So if you want a sound bite, or a song from a movie, you can do it!  + The PowerDVD Remote by Cyberlink for iOS (iPhone) and iPod Touch) works well and the app is free.  + Installation was easy and completed within about 1 minute. The prompt to view tutorials was very helpful as in watching them you are introduced to the software's features and how to get started.  + 30 GB FREE storage on the Cyberlink cloud. (Not sure for how long though?)  + Compatible with Windows 7, 8, 8.1 and 10.  + Great DVD player on a PC! TrueTheater enhancement does make a positive difference. Both audio and video are better than expected.  + Auto memory for where you left off in a movie or a slideshow is a wonderful feature.  + Comprehensive video and audio format support!  + It's easy to navigate whether in PC or TV mode.  + 4K and high frame rate video playback is supported, meaning you don't need extra software for playback.  + Casting to Roku, Chromecast and Apple TV devices - my favorite feature! If you have stuff you want to share, bring your laptop with PowerDVD 16 Ultra on it and a Chromecast device to your location and you're set.  ----------------------------------------  What I wish was better...  -/+ The price is on the high side for not also supporting installation on Mac computers.  -/+ During installation you are given the option to have this program associated with opening video, photos and music by default. Be sure to uncheck the boxes if you don't want the program to take over these functions automatically.  -/+ PC mode and TV mode... why two modes that essentially do the same thing? The menus are slightly different and I'm guessing it has something to do with the integration of the remote app.  -/+ With Windows Media Player and a TV tuner in my PC I was able to use my hard drive as a DVR. I don't see how to do this with this software, but perhaps it's there and I just don't see it? There's a lot to learn about this software.  ----------------------------------------  While I use VLC to view videos and Windows Photo Viewer or Photoshop Elements to view photos, and I rarely use anything but iTunes for my music library - this software will change that on my Windows 10 laptop PCs. It's just easier to use, and has a prettier interface with it all right there. The addition of the 'casting' feature is what really makes it a winner for me as I'm sure I'll use it a lot.  If you mourned the loss of the Windows Media Player with the update from Windows 7 to 8, 8.1 and 10, this is worth checking out. There is a FREE trial on the Cyberlink site, so you can play with it before you buy it.	1
This is a really great program. The best feature is the chromecast/Roku streaming. I had much more issues with chrome browser-based casting than this casting service, plus I can use Roku by itself if I want and leave the buggy chromecast out of it altogether. The software also provides the ability to play DVDs and Blu-rays in my disc drive, which is surprisingly not an included feature with my computer. There are other features as well but those are the only ones I tried. The only complaint I have is the price; it does seem a little pricey. Overall, great software.	1
Like thousands (millions?) of other PC users, I gave in and succumbed to the Windows 10 upgrade, and discovered that Media Center isn't included. I thought this might fill the void, and it has worked so far.  This version includes TV mode, and the TV Remote works with an iPhone or mouse. I can stream video files directly to my Samsung TV (with Roku) but for some reason it won't stream Blu-ray so I still have to use my stand-alone player or watch them on my PC. That is the reason I took off a star, I was hoping to eliminate one of my remotes. It will eventually support 4k Blu-ray, but it can't stream? If I have to use an HDMI cable then what's the point...  It's packed with features, more than I will use, but it fills my need for streaming Vimeo and YouTube video. I haven't tried any of the editing functions yet so I can't comment on them.  Install and activation was easy.	1

I have used every version of MS Office for the past 15+ years. In that time MS has released some winners and some duds. Office 2010 seems to fall in the latter category. I am currently using Office 2007, but I downloaded the 60 day trial of 2010. After playing with it for a half hour just trying to do basic tasks I have come to the conclusion that I will not be purchasing it. There just simply aren't any compelling reasons to. In Word the biggest new feature is the document map. Yes it is handy on longer documents but they have to be formatted just so for it to work as you would expect. It does let you move from page to page with one click which is nice. But haven't the page-up, page-down keys allowed us to do that since 1981? In excel the new "sparkline" feature seems to be their big selling point. I played with a spreadsheet and after the "ooh, ahh" wore off after two seconds I was left with the impression that they simply took Office 2007, slapped on a coat of paint, moved things around a bit and called it a new release. Plus every time I would try to do even the most basic task, Office would have to go online to download the feature which caused the application to crash. I haven't had an office application crash since the 1990s. Whatever happened to a full install? I have read reviews that call Office 2007 the "Vista" and 2010 the "Windows 7". Frankly I think it's the other way around. I am not about to pay $150.00 for a document mapper. So I am off to uninstall this turkey and get my Office 2007 back.  Edit 6/18/2010:  I should have included my computer specs yesterday. I bought the computer in December 2006 so it is no slouch.  Dell Inspiron 6400 / E 1505 Intel Core Duo 1.6 GHZ Processor 2 GB RAM 160 GB Hard Drive DVD +/- RW Drive 17" LCD Screen Card Reader Ethernet WiFi 3MB/S DSL Broadband Internet 56K Modem (Emergency Only) HD Sound Card ATI Radeon X1400 Windows 7 Home Premium (Formerly Vista Home Premium) Office 2007 Home and Student (Formerly Office XP)  So I did not experience any performance issues other than the constantly phoning home to do even the most basic task such as opening a preference screen. Which by the way caused Word 2010 to crash. Unacceptable.	-1
Would not install: activation code not accepted.  Returned it.	-1
There is more to dislike than to like about 0ffice 2010.  I started using the free Open Office and find it an easier transition than using office 2010 and Open Office runs on other operating systems. Microsoft has moved so many features that your muscle memory developed over years of using previous versions of office is now useless. It takes me twice as long to do anything because of searching for features that I know exist and used to know how to find. How would you like it if Toyota moved the brake pedal to the back seat, well that is what Microsoft did. You can't find the pedals. I have been using it for about a year and still search for basic features that I have used for years. I am constantly clicking Help but the new Help for office consists of cheesy training videos that require Silverlight (which causes other problems) and Pollyanna blog posts. So then I go out to the web and find the answer from another grumpy user. I finally decided that if I was going to learn a new version of office it would be free so I downloaded Open Office and haven't looked back.	-1
Warning, warning, warning The trial of Outlook on this that you don't even know it is going to install, not only makes itself your email client, it keeps downloading your email even after the trial ends if you open it for any reason, for example to look at all your emails it is already holding hostage, get rid of the trial software for Outlook as soon as you can if you still have it on your computer, I'm currently trying to go through the over 900 emails that it downloaded before I realized that it was even on my computer  I was orginally very happy with this product, but then to my dismay I found out the hard way that it installs a trial version of Microsoft Outlook on your computer.  Everything works nice, until you send an email and then Outlook takes over your email, I thought it wasn't going to be a problem, then I went to send an email and got a box that popped up and told me that the trial period had ended and that I would have to purchase a $200.00 or more program to get all my business and personal emails back that Outlook automatically downloaded without me selecting that as an option  The Powerpoint is good on this version, but if you buy this office suite, make sure you do not install any of the trial programs that the disk automatically installs, otherwise you will find yourself losing data that you needed and can't afford to pay the ransom to get back	-1
Office 2010 Home and student edition ( Family Pack) with WORD, EXCEL, POWERPOINT and ONENOTE installs at a variable rate depending on your PC hardware. The visual install, looks like it has delivered you the whole suite, but thats just a fool-ya, or a Got-cha. Click on anything you did not buy in the option you chose, oops, another sales pitch. This version has so many similarities with its web page cousins that it is just beyond a joke, except that it has the big brand at the top "Not for Commercial use", an alternative that all other Office Versions, Open Office,  X5, and more do NOT display. The file page is quite literally massive in WORD with all its options for save , send open, Sharepoint, etc, and the Templates , the permisions , sharing and Versions components look nightmarish. EXCEL has the same set of web-like displays,same as Powerpoint. One Note does I admit look kind of intriguing, but why does a "Not for commercial use" edition have its front page with the Graphic of Notebooks "Work", "Personal", and "Classes"; shouldn't "work" be "taken" out since it is ipso facto for commercial use ? Although , it must be noted that One Note does have the general structure of the Web like WORD, EXCEL and POWERPOINT. Overall, the reduced function,  limited range, and the continuation of the annoying ribbon make this Office cutdown, not worth it ( Office without Outlook is like Smart Suite without Lotus Notes); Even Word Perfect Office X5 is a better deal with more to offer and less to restrict, the full version even has a free sharepoint server, where-as Office 2010 is simply Sharepoint compatible.   After initial installation, before opening any Office component, you are offered access to the Microsoft version of the "cloud" ( at least that is what it looks like), and I have more concerns about the security issues with the "Cloud" as MS offers it than any other form of the cloud I have seen( plus if the MS Cloud Outages continue, then this could be rather precedent setting). And, if you happen to run TREND MICRO anti-virus applications on your PC, then the Office 2010 setup will be a most disagreeable meal for TREND and you must divest yourself of Trend Micro , at least for the moment.  All in all another dis-tasteful new generation Office Experience.	-1

Following instructions was complicated. Ended up with European selection and none worked.  First thing you get is to update and then it leads you to pay for more advanced versions.  Just remember nothing is really "FREE".	-1

I've noticed some of the reviews here seem to tout the features of this software, but the authors do not necessarily indicate that they have actually tried to use it, which makes me a little skeptical of their 5-star ratings.  Let me say up front that I have actually used it.  Also note that I have used quite a few different types previously, my favorite being Adobe Premiere Elements.  This version from Pinnacle is not by any means user friendly.  If you are a novice, you won't find that the process has a "easily walks me through it" design to it by any means.  It is, in fact, fairly difficult to do even basic things...like add titles or captions to the timeline.  You will see a tab toward the bottom called "SmartMovie," that does make things a little bit simpler....but even with this option it's still not all that easy to navigate your way through the process.  Two main things about this software that I found fairly annoying:  1) If you want to view the online training videos from Pinnacle, you can only do so if you subscribe to their site for $7 per month....otherwise the video stops about a fourth of the way through and a pop-up pushes you to make this purchase.  Until you do, you're blocked from viewing the videos.  2) It does not burn to Blue-ray discs unless you download a plug-in that will allow this feature, which also costs $7 to download.  Really Pinnacle?  I mean....really?  Even the MyDVD software that comes with it has a burn to Blue-ray option on it, which is greyed out because you have not yet purchased the plug-in.  Horrible business model, IMO.  What I did manage to do was to burn a short 4GB AVCHD movie on a DVD DL disc, and I was able to include a title for it.  Oddly, the transition from one clip to another had special effects built in for switching from one clip to another...swiping from left to right, loading the next clip from the middle out, etc.  At first it was pretty cool to look at, but eventually it got annoying.  I was able to finally figure out from the manual how to go in and take the transitions out of the timeline.  It was strange to me that these special transition effects were set up by default.  When I tried to burn a larger, 10GB movie (as a side note, all of these are HD family vacation footage), of course I couldn't load it on a DVD DL disc due to its size, so I decided to save the file and then I would burn it from my Adobe software. Halfway through to exporting it to the folder, however, the Studio 20 software froze up and stopped exporting....so I had to close it.  BTW, I have a fairly robust PC....Core i7 CPU, 12GB RAM, etc.  Basically, unless you want software to make AVCHD movies less than 8.5GB in total size that will not burn to Blue-ray unless you download a plug-in at an additional cost, I would look elsewhere.  My suggestion is Adobe Premier Elements....that's the one I have had the most success with.  I can't recommend this one.	-1
So I was pretty excited to try this version of Pinnacle (the last version I have is 17). There are a few new features (actually more for me since I haven't updated in a while) like stop motion animation capabilities and motion tracking.  However, this one seems more buggy than I remember the last version to be when I installed it. First, I had to completely uninstall 17 (I thought I could just update but you have to start fresh) before installing this. Its a large program and took a LONG time to install. Especially since I had to retry a few times due to error messages that even now are inexplicable to me. Anyway, I finally installed it in full with all the extra stuff. I installed this on a Sony Vaio with a fast processor so there shouldnt have been so many problems.  The program itself is VERY slow and there are so many issues with syncing, playing a video either didn't play at all or was delayed and there is no preview. For the life of me I cant get that preview window to function. Maybe there was a problem with the installation so I am (gasp) going to uninstall it and then reinstall it to see if that will fix it.  At that point, if I cant get this up and running, Ill just reinstall 17. I really don't understand how they can be selling this product for $100 (at the time of this review) for something that is so buggy and so frustrating to get up and running.  I really cant recommend this at this time.	-1
"Secrets Can Kill", the first game in the award-winning Nancy Drew mystery series, is a defining game in the history of adventure gaming. However, now that a re-release has been created, I would say that obtaining a copy of the original would only be desirable for those who'd be interested in seeing how the series began.  In this game, Nancy travels to the fictional town of Paseo Del Mar, Florida for a vacation to visit her Aunt Eloise. While she's there, a student is murdered at the local high school, where Nancy's aunt works as the librarian. Nancy's aunt immediately introduces her to the principal of Paseo Del Mar High School, and they ask Nancy to go undercover as a new student to track down the killer.  The plot of the story is very mature, and very engrossing. While playing the game, I felt like I was truly solving an actual murder mystery full of danger and intrigue. I personally found this game even scarier than most of the more recent cases, because everything in the plot was so realistic. I could definitely see something similar to this story happening in real life.  The gaming quality is unpleasant at best and very poor at worst. The game ships on two discs that must be switched between while playing in order to progress through the game. The graphics are very poor, with 3D potatoes looking more like tiny loaves of bread and characters that are 2D cartoons over 3D backgrounds. However, one must take into account that this game was released in 1998. Once the date is thrown into consideration, this is slightly forgivable.  The controls aren't very user friendly, either. It's hard to move Nancy around her environment, and the hotspots are sometimes very poorly placed. At times, I had to back away from an entire area just to approach something I saw from a specific angle. Otherwise, I would miss a potential clue. The controls in the next game are barely more user friendly, but thankfully by the third game things start getting better from then on out.  The amount of puzzles in the game is pretty disappointing. While the later games are filled with puzzles and character interaction, this game only has 2 "real" puzzles (one being a slider puzzle, the other being a puzzle in which levers must be pulled in the correct order). While I don't like having an overwhelming amount of puzzles in Nancy Drew games (like Ransom of the Seven Ships is guilty of), I do still like having a moderate amount of them.  Character interaction in this game was relatively good, though. The characters were a very quirky bunch, and even though they weren't animated well, I rather liked them. Their personalities were all very distinct, and each of them had a huge secret to hide (regardless of whether or not they were the guilty party). There are four suspects who're interactive throughout the entire game: Daryl Gray, the student council president who found Jake's body and Nancy's contact who flirts with her through the course of the game, Hal Tanaka, the over-achieving exchange student from Japan who's desperate to get a college scholarship, Connie Watson, a tough girl who's very secretive of her personal life, and Hector "Hulk" Sanchez, the big jock on campus who aspires to be a professional football player someday. They were all interesting, and I suspected all four of them at times. Overall, the characterization deserves a good score, but I didn't really care for how the culprit at the end was presented (I won't say anything further because I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't played and plan on doing so).  The music was very, very well-done. I loved all of the tracks, and they all complimented their scenes perfectly. I especially loved the opening song that played while the main menu was being pulled up, as it is truly a heart-pounding and suspenseful track that is perfect for a murder mystery. I miss hearing this track in later games. The musical score is the only aspect of this game which I cannot complain about at all.  Also, one final word of warning: some plot aspects in this game are definitely more mature than one typically sees in Nancy Drew games (more so in the most recent games than the earlier ones). There are references to weapons, drugs, and blackmail. Personally, I would've given this game a "T" rating instead of an "E", but the re-release of the game earned an E-10 (which is suiting for the re-release, in my opinion). I didn't mind these more mature plot aspects very much, but some parents would probably wish to know this before allowing their children to play it.  While "Secrets Can Kill" is far from the best Nancy Drew game, it was definitely a good game that started it all. By today's standards, the gaming quality would be horrible, but it was fairly good considering the era it was released in. If you're an avid player of Nancy Drew, you could play this as a way to go "back in time", but it's not necessary now that a re-release has been issued. The original version (which this product review is for) is now out of print, but if you're able to get a hold of a copy of it for a low price, I'd say go for it (so long as you have a system with Windows XP or earlier, as this game and the second game are unable to be played on more advanced versions). If you're a newbie to the series, however, I wouldn't recommend starting with it. I would suggest beginning with the remastered edition (which is much more user-friendly and updated) and then going in order from there, so long as you're able to play Stay Tuned for Danger (I'm hoping for a re-release of this one too). The game in and of itself is fun, but it's not necessarily the best. I think only avid Nancy Drew gamers who're interested in seeing how it all began and those who've played from the beginning and want some nostalgia would get any good use out of it. Go for it if you want, but if you plan on playing this game a lot, just get the far superior re-release instead.	-1
Generally speaking, to get the best performance from any operating system a clean install of a full version is recommended. The best choice is to choose a full version of the product and enjoy the benefits of not being left with artifacts and leftover's of your previous operating system which can lead to instability in certain cases. I would only buy this on a limited budget.	-1

I purchased this software, hoping to experience the opportunity to design some slick personal calling cards.  What I got instead was a migraine!  The design backgrounds are GORGEOUS, but you have to have a PHD in graphic design to make this software work. I spent hours trying to make my chosen design fit within the print area of my standard Avery cardstock - I don't claim to be the brightest crayon in the box, but I'm pretty intelligent and resourceful and I wasn't able to do anything with it.  I'm glad I only spent [amt]. If you have the a lot of extra time and an unending supply of patience, give it a shot - If you don't choose another product, or go to Kinko's.	-1

The review that has 5 stars I really wonder that is real It doesn't stay connected the whole time I would not recommend the product	-1
All the reviews are not for the product listed. Amazon needs to straighten this mess out.	-1
So far, I am not impressed. It did arrive quickly, but it does not work for us. I followed the instructions to a "T" several times on several devices and it would not connect. I started skeptical because there is no product on Amazon that has 300 reviews and every one is 5 stars. This is literally the 2nd 1-star review (and I think the other person was wise for not purchasing).  I've grown even more skeptical and plan on returning this product unless someone from Opticover is willing to help out.	-1
I looked at purchasing this Router.  However, one has to wonder where these ratings are coming from since some of the reviews, along with the questions folks have asked about the product, do not seem to have anything to do with this product. What's-up Amazon.	-1
Our office made it mandatory for us to upgrade to Office XP....I have had nothing but problems since.  Thankfully, I only have to deal with this piece of garbage at work.  I definetely will NOT be buying ANY XP branded product for my home computer. First of all if you thought Word was slow, wait until you try Word XP. It takes nearly 5 minutes for a large document to load in Word XP while Word brought it up in a few seconds.  And when word finally does load your document, it has stupid comments all over your document (which is probally why it took so long to load).  The first time I tried printing a document with Word XP, it took nearly 90 minutes for it to even get to the printer!  When the document FINALLY printed out, I found that it printed out ALL the comments which DOUBLED the size of my document.  I figured out how to turn the comments off, but have not figured out how to turn it off permantly.  So everytime I load a document, I have to turn the comments off and hope that the drop downs that do this actually work! Also when I first loaded word, outlook or excel there was this annoying "pop up" at the top corner of your screen that had something to do with hands free typing.  I permantly killed this window too because I DON'T NEED THIS [stuff] MICROSOFT!! Also another feature I don't like is when you copy more that one item in word, it brings up another annoying clipboard window that Microsoft assumes you want.  This window displays EVERYTHING you have copied and covers up part of the window you are working in.  I never have and never will use this clipboard so there is no reason why it should keep popping up.  Apparantly Microsft "forgot" to add a way to permantely turn this off from office.  I ended up having to go into the Windows registry to do it. Finally there are bugs galore.  The buttons and drop downs sometimes stop working for no apparant reason.  Sometimes when trying to open certain documents from other office programs you get error messages, and when trying to open Help, you occasionally get messages saying "Error opening help"! Go figure. Top these errors off with the ever annoying autoformatting "feature" in Word, Excel and Office and you have a complete waste of money. Bottom line, Don't waste your money on this.  You are MUCH better off with what you have now.  I have discovered, that Microsoft tries to FORCE you to do things the way they ASSUME you like to do things.  They just keep adding more "features" that intefere more than assist you.  You will spend a lot of time undoing what they force you to do.  You will also spend a lot of time trying to turn off their useless and annoying "features" just to type ONE document.  Heck you may be better off with a typewritter since you have the freedom to do what YOU want instead of wasting time undoing what Microsoft automatically does for you.	-1
In its early years, this operating system was one of the most unsatisfactory I have ever used --- including DOS, Win 3.1, Windows 95 and Windows 98.  Aside from being incompatible with older hardware, XP Home Edition crashed frequently --- especially if you often work with several windows open at once as I do. This was particularly unhelpful. As a writer, I was forced to save documents no less than once for each new sentence, and at touchy moments, literally every few words.  Most important, the program is highly susceptible to viruses and hackers. Preventing these two problems requires expensive add-on software and hardware.  True enough, the built-in firewall OUGHT to work. But in my case, hackers got in anyway -- four times in six months. With this software, I suffered repeated break ins, the last of which cost me some primary data and several of my original poems. Even installing service pack 2 did not help.  After the last go-round, I was forced to hire an expensive data recovery guru --- another story in itself --- but was still unable to recover everything lost.  Throughout this six-month nightmare, I repeatedly reinstalled the XP program, including, more than once, service pack 2. That, however, didn't plug the security leaks. My computer was completely compromised. In the end, I had to junk the machine all together.  In my experience, Mac and Linux operating systems are both far superior.  Now I've got one Windows machine --- a laptop purchased in early 2007 at or around the release of Service Pack 3 --- to run a BioFeedback program whose authors, unfortunately, had not created a Linux version.  Admittedly, Microsoft's final XP service pack seems to have plugged XP's most serious security holes. Still, after my dreadful experience with XP Home Edition, I forever swore off Windows as my primary operating system. Microsoft operating systems remain magnets for viruses and hackers --- to say nothing of endless bugs and technical issues --- and eons of otherwise unnecessary computer security checks and maintenance.	-1
UPDATE to review, 2/12/13: yes you CAN make MS Office 2002-2000 run in Win7, if Win7 is previously installed.  I just installed both on my Dell laptops (Lat 6530 and 6510) which I just bought in January.  In PC World, they maintain you can also install those same MS versions in Win8, but I'm so antagonistic to Win8 I've not installed it, yet.  Original review follows below.  ==================  Imagine, if you will, the annual How-to-Alienate-the-Customer Meeting in Redmond, Washington, aka 'upgrade' plan, for MS software.  Ms. Snippy (proudly):  Well, we've redesigned the interface yet again, just like aisles in grocery stores, so the customer will be confused, feel stupid; so will subscribe to our paid help.  Yet we added a cute dog to slow the search process, make it harder to search than prior;  we also reduced the number and types of files search can read, and made the Indexing Service more annoying.  We also forced the interface colors to glare blue and glare white, to increase eyestrain. Thus we can truly call this product 'new'.  Mr. Fleece-the-Customer Project Manager (smiling):  Wonderful, Snippy! But is that all?  Those changes won't confuse the customer long enough;  soon they will stop subscribing to our ignorant help hot lines.  Ms. Snippy (bubbling over): Oh, we've done much more.  Starting with, reducing backwards-compatibility with our own earlier software, and popular programs like Lotus 1-2-3 and Adobe Acrobat; so now it will cost those companies more, to sync with our 'new' software.  And less of their own products, will be read by OUR software, just the same!  Mr. Fleece (eyes wide):  aha, so we can blame them for lack of compatibility, and make more money thereby.  Well done, Snippy!  Ms. Snippy (ecstatic):  Well, here's the best part: we create NEW JOBS!  For now ALL the older material must be retyped or reformatted within our own products, thousands of hours of NEW WORK spent on old material which used to be converted in an instant!  That extra work, is good for America!  Mr. Fleece (with the Arm-and-Hammer look):  yes, teaches the customer a lesson that he shouldn't go anywhere but to us!  for all his software needs.  Ms. Nudger (sheepishly):  Um, excuse me.  We've also made our own earlier products incompatible with the 'new' version.  So how do we blame the other software companies, when in fact we also are incompatible with our own products?  Mr. Fleece:  Can't you recognize 'progress'?  It's the policy here to force people to upgrade, upgrade, upgrade, never ending, never matching, never fitting the past -- just like DETROIT proudly does with American cars!  You're UNAMERICAN, Nudger; and you're FIRED!  ===========  The above fictional conversation is not wholly fictional.  Eleven years ago, my one and only pay-for-help hour spent with a Microsoft employee basically resulted in him admitting Fleece's last lines.  In the name of progress.  I kid you not.  The rest of the fictional conversation is easily deduced by the actual history of MS products.  So too, here with Word 2003, when the elimination of backwards-compatibility, really begins.  Later versions of Office are even worse.  I've tried and rejected them.  But after reading reviews of how Word 2003 allegedly fixed the bugs with respect to right-to-left text (i.e., Hebrew), I wanted to try this.  Yeah, what a mistake!  Two copies I bought, both of them nearly useless!  Why?  Um, if you can't even retrieve your own previous files in the 'upgrade' version, then why upgrade?  Hmmmm?  For every 'upgrade' of Office becomes more and more dysfunctional.  I bought Word 2003 due to the many bugs in Word 2000-2002, but guess what?  Word 2003 TOOK AWAY what was good in those older programs, and substituted even more bugs and dysfunctionality.  That 'progress' continues from Word 2003, onward.  OFFICE and hence Word 2010 is so incompatible, after downloading the trial version in only two hours I was so frustrated, I uninstalled it. With difficulty.  Here's the scam: the 'upgrades' are like the opening dialogue, above.  The 'upgrades' complicate procedures which were simple in earlier versions, especially in Word and Excel, prior to version 2003.  For example, you used to just click on Help, and you actually got a chm file OF Help.  Not now.  Now, the DEFAULT in Word takes you ONLINE.  Takes two hours to figure out how to change that default, so you can get the old help file you're used to.  So too, the ? in a dialogue box USED to function simply: you clicked on the ?, then moved your mouse to the section on the dialogue box you wanted to understand, and got a semi-coherent explanation of that section's function.  Not now.  Now, another dialogue box opens with a lot more text, and you must SCROLL SCROLL SCROLL to find the item you could have gotten in 2 seconds, under the old method.  With no more coherence, of course.  Often, even less.  Help like this:  if the dialogue box says 'make operation operational', of course you have no idea what 'operation' is in view.  So in the old days, you clicked on ? and you got a tool tip which said, 'this function makes the operation, operational'.  That of course elucidated nothing, but at least it was fast.  Now, in Word 2003, you get the same message, but it took you three or four minutes to even FIND the same line of text as in the dialogue box, within the new and de-proved help file.  That is, after you spent two hours figuring out how to turn off the default ONLINE help which of course never helped you, either.  It's not by accident that most law firms still offer backwards-compatible documents for Word97-2003.  They have to.  Legal and accounting stuff has to be kept for YEARS.  Notice the range of the offering.  2003 and prior.  Word 2003, however, is far less desirable than prior versions: its clipboard is worse, its buttons are harder to customize and actually they removed some useful button customizations like Reveal Formatting;  the PERMISSION annoyance (covered below) means you might have to go through all your old documents and establish permissions, even on your own computer (problem on XP Pro, not Home).  And frankly, I don't see any functions which are improved, versus Word 2002.  Only new annoyances.  The usual company retort to complaints like mine, is to deem the customer ignorant of computers, puh!  Balderdash.  I've been working with computers since Trash-80.  I still have my old 286's, and they still work.  Admirably.  So it's not like I'm a computer neophyte, and my business depends on word processing and spreadsheets.  To date, nothing beats Multimate II (a DOS product) for merges, and DOS (not Windows) Lotus 1-2-3 version 2.x, for calculations.  All Excel has to offer, is formatting the final product.  To wit:  oh, now in Excel 2003, you can't retrieve Lotus 1-2-3 wk1 files, but get a 'restricted policy' notice.  By the way, this very 'policy' is itself buggy.  If I use XP Home, I don't get the problem.  It only occurs with XP Pro.  See?  MS products don't work with each other.  That lone $90 hour I spent paying for MS help years ago, resulted in this gem of explanation:  each programmer only gets certain subroutines to write.  The programmers are isolated, and don't get to see how the product fits together.  So OF COURSE there will be bugs.  Design requires a wholistic approach, which at MS, is anathema.  Okay, then: their products will waste billions of dollars in customer time trying to work around the bugs.  Not to mention, eventually MS will tank due to such a stupid policy.  But I digress...  Back to the problem: you can't open your own files when you are the administrator?  And you're not told how to get permission?  Oh, wait: you can ONLY get permission if you use Microsoft's ONLINE PASSPORT SERVICE?  Access to your own computer not online, depends on you establishing credentials online? Oh but yes!  You download a silly 'rights management' program which you can't even install, unless you subscribe to NET passport ONLINE, which means to access your own files on your own computer to use them in Office, you have to BE online, establish your credentials, and only THEN can you open your own documents on your own computer.  What drunk thought of that?  And of course, if MS voluntarily ends the PASSPORT program, then you can't even do that convoluted and needless procedure to open your own documents on your own computer offline.  So MS won't even allow you the administrator to control your own computer, with Word 2003. So here's the scam workaround: you have to settle for XP Home, or contact them in Redmond; of course you wait for an hour on the phone, then for $90 per hour they will be happy to spend four more hours 'helping' you to solve THEIR OWN TYRANNICAL BUG.  Of course, the 'help' person at MS knows absolutely nothing about the software, so first you go through irrelevant questions like do you have a virus, in order to eat up time and cost you more money.  Forget the other junk in the Suite.  It works not at all.  The Outlook 2003 was so badly designed I just flat removed it.  Excel is totally retarded, for audit-trail accounting.  Everything about its structure is buggy and arcane.  I spent FOUR HOURS today, just trying to figure out why it wouldn't recognize a labelled number, as a LABEL.  Previous version of Excel had the opposite bug: if you typed in a number, it automatically treated it as a label, unless you put an equals or plus or minus sign in front of the number.  Sheesh.  But at least Excel 2002 and prior, would recognize the label marker and treat what followed AS a label.  (This matters: say you're doing billing like I was, and you wanted to LABEL a billing amount, to keep it out of your totals;  in Excel 2002 and prior, you can do that easily.  But NOT, in Excel 2003, and no FUNCTION formula will let you do it.  More could be said, but then I'll have apoplexy.)  By contrast, old DOS Lotus 1-2-3 version 2.x -- which IBM owns now, and won't sell -- along with its add-in (nee: Funk Software) 'Worksheet Utilities' is totally superior, especially for actuarial and other number-intensive, date-intensive, audit-trail-intensive calculations.  Runs in a DOS window in XP, and I'm told by my computer guys that I can get a DOS window in Win7, so might upgrade to Win7.  Whew.  Calculation in our modern computers is instantaneous.  DOS rocks.  So too, that version of Lotus.  Later versions don't work well with dates.  Forget the later Quattro Pro, too.  Excel's only good for formatting the final reports, and even then inanely won't let you store print STYLES without extreme effort: you do it by setting up your windows, print area, then name the whole thing as a CUSTOM VIEW.  Forget macros.  I could spend hours ranting about the flaws in Word or Office Professional, vintage 2010 backwards.  Word is totally incapable of a decent merge, for example.  The trouble you have to go to in order to make merging work in Word, means that unless you've got thousands of records, you might as well do it by hand.  And with thousands of records, count on half of them coming out wrong unless yhou spend thousands of hours designing a very precise database which is thirty times harder to manage, versus the old DOS days.  Unbelievable.  No wonder prices rise so much.  We're all spending downtime trying to get basic word processing functions, to work!  So too, forget Front Page;  it's easier to write your own html code in Word.  Business Contact Manager?  You're better off with pencil and paper!  Access?  Someone on crack designed it. The Photo thingy isn't all that bad, but its bugs abound.  Outlook 2003 is the worst.  They removed all the flexibility of earlier Outlook versions, and of course made the interface completely frustrating, to boot.  Outlook has always been way overcomplicated, but if you have a lot of stuff to juggle and you use it daily (which you must, or you'll forget how) -- it can be helpful.  Simpler is old Sidekick in DOS.  Sigh, you can't store it in the UMB, in Windows.  But it works just fine on an old 486...  So instead of reading only my ranting -- Google on a MS program name, add the word 'sucks' -- you'll find even whole discussion forums devoted to that second word.  Usually such vulgar language is inapt.  But not here.  Every swear word ever invented, belongs to Office products and to MS software in general.  It's deliberately unintuitive, confusing, buggy and mediocre, so you have to subscribe to paid help.  That's the only explanation which makes sense of the data. Same can be said for Adobe, Roxio, Symantec and Corel products.  So MS isn't the only scammer in town.  Go back to DOS software:  its products work well on these faster machines.  ===============  UPSHOT:  If you are lonely and want to spend all your free time debugging MS Office gaffes, then buy Word 2003 or Office Professional 2003 et seq. If on the other hand you like me are stuck with Word and want to know the latest version which worked -- though buggy, is manageable -- get Office 2002 or 2000.  Best was Word97, but getting it to work in XP is something of a problem.  Hope you kept your Win98SE machines. :)  So now, I just uninstalled Word 2003, and go back to Word 2002.  At least they don't prohibit you from accessing your own files!  Gotta install it now, byeeee.	-1
The review that has 5 stars I really wonder that is real It doesn't stay connected the whole time I would not recommend the product	-1
All the reviews are not for the product listed. Amazon needs to straighten this mess out.	-1
So far, I am not impressed. It did arrive quickly, but it does not work for us. I followed the instructions to a "T" several times on several devices and it would not connect. I started skeptical because there is no product on Amazon that has 300 reviews and every one is 5 stars. This is literally the 2nd 1-star review (and I think the other person was wise for not purchasing).  I've grown even more skeptical and plan on returning this product unless someone from Opticover is willing to help out.	-1
I looked at purchasing this Router.  However, one has to wonder where these ratings are coming from since some of the reviews, along with the questions folks have asked about the product, do not seem to have anything to do with this product. What's-up Amazon.	-1
Unlike many other reviewers, I bought this product in April, after Microsoft had plenty of time to fix the bugs -- which means they're not bothering to fix them at all -- and I have spent three months using it, not just a couple of days. Also, I have a PhD in Mgmt Science and Information Systems and was a long-time Quicken user, so I'm not exactly stupid, I don't think, when it comes to personal finance software. Here are just a few of the problems I'm seeing:  Default settings, almost without exception, are the worst possible settings.  Advanced budget reports don't work at all. Actual amounts for transfers out appear as positive, but budgeted amounts appear as negative numbers, so the difference is huge precisely when you're saving a lot of money. In some other cases, the budgeted amount in a report has no relationship to what was entered, and there's no visible way to correct it.  Cash flow charts assume all monthly budgeted amounts are subtracted on the first of the month. That makes projected balances very pessimistic - nearly useless.  After downloading transactions online, the program does a lousy job of matching payee names with previous transactions. It's bad enough to make ANY reliance on automated balancing impossible.  If you have a 2002 or earlier copy of Quicken, you may as well keep using it, even though online banking no longer works.  How could there be NO software company out there who wants to take this business away from Intuit and Microsoft, who apparently don't even WANT it?	-1
Used to be good.  They ruined a great product.  Worst, though, is they renewed on my card which I DID NOT authorize, and now I'm paying for another year when I didn't even use it the first year.  VERY HARD to cancel.  Avoid avoid avoid on every level.	-1
A trial version of this came with my Dell laptop.  It seemed to work so I bought a key.  It worked for a while with the key but now it doesn't work at all.  I will uninstall and do manual file backups.	-1
The review that has 5 stars I really wonder that is real It doesn't stay connected the whole time I would not recommend the product	-1
Poorest operating system Microsoft ever made. Longest boot time. Massive ram and disc space required. Use Windows 7 instead.	-1
Too much money for what you get, but absolutely required in the working world. I feel miked for another lump of money just to keep up.	-1
I got my computer with Vista pre-installed.  It seems to vary depending on who gets it, some are lucky and it runs fine, while others have nothing but trouble.  I fall into the second group.  For me it's slow, buggy, bloated, and annoying.  Until service pack 1 was released, I wasn't able to right-click without crashing Explorer.  No, you didn't read that incorrectly.  I couldn't right-click without crashing Explorer!  It was fixed for a while, but I've started having the issue again.  Fun.  Copying files takes much longer than in XP.  Several times longer.  My boot times are longer.  My shutdown times are longer.  I work on an Office Live website and MS can't even get Vista to play nice with their connection software out of the box.  I was forced to use an aging XP laptop just to update files on it.  Thankfully they do have pretty good customer service and I was able to solve that issue with a combination of patches and workarounds.  Still, Vista required more work for me than XP did and that's the problem with Vista.  Now there are some nice features.  The voice recognition for typing is really very good, I don't mind the UAC pop-ups asking for permission for a program to do some activity, the screen shot program is really helpful, and the DVR software is just wonderful.  However, the good just doesn't out weigh the bad.  Vista has caused me many hours of stress and anger.  If you're upgrading, just go with Windows 7.  It's the most current one anyway now and it runs the way they should have released Vista.	-1
What a pathetic O.S.!  I still have to use mine, because I have certain hardware and software that require me to use Vista on one of my 2 main PC's in the house.  I often get system crashes, hang-ups, slow-downs, error messages, etc.!  It is truly pathetic.  I really LIKE this O.S. for it's simplicity, BUT with all the problems i'm having, I can't accomplish much!  If a Microshaft executive is reading this, how about some Windows updates fixes and modifications that will make my Win Vista system work better!  We users need better support from you clowns!	-1
too many pop-ups.  CCAPP.EXE is still the bigger POC ever written.  It hangs once or twice a week.  LiveUpdate notice is a new feature that will give you pop-ups on your desktop about new products, new features, upgrades etc.  I guess too many people opt-out on email notices, so they decided to just put it on your desk top... advertising about their products.  It will also be in 2008.  I would rather take my chances with nothing, than ever use a Norton product ever again.	-1
Norton has come a long way since this version.  This one was just not friendly to the user.  Most PC users don't want to work with the Internet Security software.  To be honest, I don't think the security parameters that I set changed anything.	-1
Sent it back.  Norton says "find your own drivers if you want to make a bootable disk"..... I went to Nova Backup.  Perfect.	-1
This product works reasonably well on XP, but on Vista it's a WHOLE different story.  I have never used a product that has caused me so much grief and frustration. What's wrong?  1. Frequently shuts down all HTTP traffic for no reason.  Happens every so often, randomly.  2. Every once in a while it denies access to all programs, so clicking on any icon results in a message saying you're not authorized.  Only cure is to reboot.  3. When updating itself from the internet (often), everything else on your computer grinds to a halt - for a long time.  4. Restarting the computer with Zone Alarm turned off results in being unable to access the internet at all.  I'm not even sure I can get rid of this thing, which has been much worse than any real virus.  It was bad enough that I installed this on my own computer and have had to deal with hours of grief, but putting it on my wife's computer has almost caused a divorce.  I strongly recommend against using this product on Vista in its current form.	-1
I went to Zone Alarm because I was unhappy with another product.  That was a big mistake.  I run VER 8  it has caused loss of internet connectivity. This is very similar to the problem that occured in July when they put out an update that conflicted with a MS XP update.  I lost many hours on that fiasco.  This tim it didn't take me as long to try turning ZA off.  Sure enough after turning ZA off I was able to connect. I run ZA on two computers one still has Ver 7 , no connection proble with this one.  The one updated to VER 8 is the one that wouldn't connect.  A second issue is I am constantly bothered with warnings about suspicious program activity. ZA says that it doesn't know what to do about this but yet I am supposed to.  I bought the program to do this for me.  What a piece of junk.  At least the other vendor would talk to me and did finally offer me a free upgrade. Unfortunately I had already bought ZA by that time.  What a mistake.	-1
I was disappointed to learn that iBank is not supported by one of the largest banks in the U.S., JPMorgan Chase, and you cannot do direct downloads without paying a monthly fee to the bank.  You can only download monthly statements.  If you monitor your banking activity on a weekly or greater basis, this is a real pain.	-1
WARNING to anyone thinking about buying this product! Please understand that you will not be buying this product only RENTING it. If you do not renew every year the product stops working....COMPLETELY! I'm not just talking about updates, etc. It actually tells you that it has stopped working and it won't work unless you renew. I have just wasted more than 2 hours with Norton's online tech support. This is the case with ALL Norton products and I am quoting the tech.	-1
I want to first say that anyone who is NOT running anti-virus software should really get some - any - antivirus software on their systems immediately. It's not only about losing your own data. It's about your system being turned into a robot to send out millions of spam messages a day. If your system is open and unprotected, it in essence can be taken over by anyone on the web. This could turn you into a porn system, a spam system, or many other kinds of illegal systems without you ever knowing. You really need to keep your system locked for your safety as well as the safety of others. Never mind your legal implications if you let your unprotected system become a storehouse of child porn. ("Really officer, I had no idea ...")  McAfee and Norton are traditionally two of the big names in the PC protection world. We have used both on and off over the years. Recently we have given the edge to Norton for their anti-virus software abilities. You only need one virus to hit you to wipe out your data and to turn your machine into a porn-distributing robot. When we had the opportunity to try McAfee, we thought we might as well see how it was doing.  The first thing I have to say is you CANNOT review an antivirus software package after only a week of us!! That is not a valid test. You need to use it for months to see how it actually performs. This is a long term software package, not one that works for a week and tells you much of anything. That is like buying a retirement stock portfolio and judging it after a week's worth of time.  So we've had this for several months now. Issue 1. It really slows down your system. Far more than other systems do. Since most of us use our computers for things that we do not want to wait 8 hours to complete, a slow system is not a good thing. There is no reason for the system to crawl the way it does when McAfee is running.  Even more importantly though it does NOT provide reliable virus protection. I might even accept a slower system if I knew it was being properly protected. However, it is not! The system that was running McAfee on it got hit with a virus that Norton blocked on our other systems. That right there is the ultimate failure mark. If you are running anti-virus software on a system, and it gets  a virus anyway that damages data, just what was the purpose of the slow anti-viral software? Especially when other software at the same price did its job properly.  We haven't tried yet, but we've also heard that this software auto-bills yearly without asking your permission and that canceling the software is a royal pain in the butt. That is the death knell as far as we are concerned.  Buy Norton. Stay away from McAfee, at least this 2008 version.	-1
The installation process is not straightforward because it doesn't allow you to pick and choose which components you want to install because it comes with multiple features besides virus scan.  There is no direct UNinstall from Windows Vista.  The only way to uninstall the program is to download a custom uninstall program from the McAfee website.  Unlike Norton, the virus scan kicks off even when you are actively using your computer.  The interface was cumbersome because of the multiple products bundled together.  Although McAfee antivirus may be good, I would not recommend VirusScan Plus with SiteAdvisor for those who use their computer all the time.	-1
I haven't used AVPs for years, mainly because I don't need them (I know what to not click on) and they slow my system to a crawl.  This is ridiculous.  In those 3-5 years I have not used one of these programs, someone could have noticed this HUGE design flaw and fixed it.  My system still slows to nearly a complete stop.  And killing it in Task Manager doesn't help, either.  I was afraid that even after uninstalling it I was still going to feel the pain of the AVP, so I actually went back to do a system restore to prior the McAfee installation.  System runs smooth as silk, now, and I still don't have to worry about viruses.  Instead, invest in a good router, and don't click on any pop ups, people!	-1
I am not impressed with either McAfee or Norton, they both are very commercial and seem to miss virus's and spyware.  In fact they are close to useless.  Gives one a very false sense of security.  Try iolo, bit defender or spyware dr.  They all seem to find lots of garbage that these big name virus detectors miss.  In fact, McAfee is even worse than Norton.	-1

I've been using Norton Utilities for many many years.  Starting back in the early macintosh days, and now right up to windows vista.  What's really sad is to see their product get worse and worse each year.  But I think this one is the last straw.  First I had problems with my rebate (for owning a prior version).  Then I had problems with licensing.  Although I went through the licensing procedure and registered my product, the backup utility that is part of this got installed as a "trial" and kept nagging me until it timed out.  The product also crashes frequently, and after finally getting my license squared away, then the backup utility refused to work.  I eventually learned that it had corrupted its internal database, making it useless.  Honestly, even though it is inexpensive for prior version users to upgrade to this version (assuming they honor their rebate), I still regret doing it.  I would definitely recommend macafee for security and virus removal, and pretty much anything else for backups.  It's really sad to see what Symmantec did to this once great product.	-1
The lessons are ok, the problem is the software looks like it was designed for a 1980's PC running Windows 98.  The window size is about a third of the screen on both Macs and PCs.  There is an option to resize it to full screen, but all that does is zoom in to the point where the graphics are pixelated.  It's probably time they updated this software.	-1
Wincleaner doesn't have good support after the sale	-1
Easy to set up but after that it's just one headache after the next with drivers... it's worse than vista, yes I said it...VISTA sucks but at least it can access the internet right out of the box without IT technical configuration. It works with nothing but the programs that came with it, and wireless internet, forget it...in the Ubuntu users guide it says if ubuntu does not recognize your wireless card, get a new one.....yeah right: great guide.. I'll just use OS X or Xandros.  OS X is the best no hassel OS, next to that for my Eee PC I have switched back to what actually works...Xandros, which is the OS that comes preloaded on the Eee, it's the best and everything wroks soon as you turn on the computer.  No need to totally reconfigure Ubuntn/Xubuntu etc you have better things to do with your life then soend days on end configuring Ubuntu to play mp3's, watch you tube, have sound, be able to get on the internet, not have a retarded resolution and virtually anything else you may want to do give extra wasted time for config.  Ubuntu is a waste of time, Xandros Linux just works...nuff said.	-1
There's no point mentioning the pros with these cons, so:  - It's huge, slow, and slows down your PC startup as well. - Very poor to nonexistent audit trail, can cause a lot of damage. - Cannot create custom reports. You're stuck with tweaking the ones Microsoft provided, which may not work for you. - PayPal and eBay integration requires a monthly fee.  With these cons, it really doesn't matter what the pros are.	-1
well, I'm in the middle of a month before my virus definitions subscription expires. so, Norton has pleasantly given me notices every frickin' day to remind me that they're expiring. you can't turn this off. it interrupts whatever you're doing, regardless if you have more important things to do. Their customer service is no help. This is like forced SPAM on an espresso blitz. so, think you'll like Norton? go for it. enjoy. no, really.	-1
Bento version 2 has gotten some good reviews.  I can't explain that.  In my testing it's a toy application.  I have a large iCal database with about 6,000 events living on a G5 iMac running OS X 10.5.5. This is a relatively large event collection (though it would not stress Outlook at all) and my hardware is dated -- so I expected a few performance issues.  I did not expect dreadful performance. Minutes to open the Bento (SQLite really) database. A minute to add a single event record. Inability to add a record when viewing a query (filtered list). No drop down for calendar names ...  If you've used any database you'll be surprised to learn you can't emulate a join; you can't find common names in two lists for example.  This is a toy application that will only work with small data sets on a modern machine.  It's awful. Filemaker should be ashamed.	-1
CONSUMER BEWARE! Nowhere on the front or back cover of this product does it say 'internet connection required'! This company should be ashamed of themselves for releasing a misleading product like this. My 5 year old was ecstatic to see this box at the store, and kept talking about it on the drive all the way home. Imagine our utter dissapointment (and anger in my case) when we found out we couldn't use it as a standalone product! Lately, there seems to be a proliferation of unethical companies that release games or products for the PC that require an internet connection, without obviously stating this on the front cover of the packaging. Thanks for nothing idiots at 'Knowledge Adventure'!	-1
STRONGLY RECOMMEND TO KEEP AWAY FROM SPECTORSOFT CORP. PROGRAMS  search amazon for SPECTOR PRO and READ ALL NEGATIVES ON THIS COMPANY  Wast of money, lots of upgrades for $69.99, or it stops working.	-1
As ramito mentioned, it's important to know which version Amazon is selling. I have version 3.5 and it required a paid upgrade to 3.6 or the current 4.2.1 version. I also have this latest version only since it was included as part of a Mac software bundle. RapidWeaver is no longer a $50 program, since its price increased to $79. Upgrades from 3.5 are $30. This is without considering additional expenses for Themes, Plugins, Utilities, etc.  For $79, I would strongly recommend that potential buyers take a look at Sandvox Pro by Karelia, or Freeway Express by Softpress. Don't base your purchase decision on how this compares to iWeb, since pretty much any program is superior to iWeb. I use Freeway Pro, and if I didn't I would seriously consider Sandvox or Freeway Express before buying RapidWeaver.  On a positive note, the RapidWeaver community is indeed helpful and RapidWeaver is a popular application. It's just overpriced considering the available alternatives and the expense of Add-ons as mentioned before. Amazon's price of $42.49 is definitely more attractive than $79, but still not something I would pay for this program.	-1
I bought the 7.0 version in the hopes of sharing a 500gb RAID drive between my XP and Mac systems. After installing Paragon, the drive mounted fine and seemed to be operational. I had a FCP project with about 40gb of files on the drive.  Before getting to work I decided to organize things a little, moving a folder with 20gb of QT movies into a different folder. Mistake. I got a 'this operation could not be completed because the files could not be found' error. The folder with the 20gb of movies then disappeared. Gone.  Luckily, I have this backed up, unfortunately I'm working remotely which means I now have to have someone overnight me the 20gbs worth of files that have ceased to exist.  While this product might work fine for a drive you're using to transfer files, where you can afford to have it occasionally spontaneously delete files, I have zero faith in it for day to day use. Use at your own risk.	-1
Maybe if I took more time with it, it wouldn't be too bad ... it looks like it has great potential, but my goodness there are LOTS of buttons and boxes and options ... I just don't even know where to begin to say anything about this .. I have no experience with it. Sorry I can't be more help.	-1
Not sure what I was doing wrong but I never could get this program to load or to do anything. Guess I really needed it! Computer is running fine and I do have Avira on there so I don't know why this didn't work.	-1
I gave BitDefender an honest try, hoping that it would provide better protection than the horrible McAfee I was dealing with before. Unfortunately, it did not. BitDefender Total Security 2009 is a complete mess. It locked up my computer when it was trying to scan, to the point where web pages would freeze and then 10 minutes later they'd herky-jerk back to life for a minute, then freeze up again. After a frustrating encounter with a lack of quality customer service, I had to uninstall it and get rid of it for good because I just could not take it anymore. I've since switched to Avast and had absolutely no issues at all with scans or freezing. Bottom line, unless you want a major headache, pass on BitDefender.	-1
the product i don't hate, the spam to renew which began six months before my license was to expire. Never Again!	-1
I was a longtime Trend Micro user, but as time went on, they made changes to their product I did not like. When people on their forum site complained, their attitude was "Take it or leave it", so I followed their advice, and left it. I switched to Kaspersky, and could not be happier.	-1
I have been using computers since 1991 when I went back to college for a degree in Computer Information Systems and Certificate of Achievement in Microcomputer Applications. I have had several computers and am now using a Dell Dimension 8300 3 GHz , INTEL CPU with 2.5GB memory with XP Pro AND a Dell Vostro 1000 laptop 1.8 GHz with 1 GB memory and AMD64 CPU with XP Home.  I used McAfee starting in 1991 when it free from a bulletin board and then when it was bundled for a fee, then started using Norton Systemworks 2000 - 2005 (which all included anti-virus), Norton Professional anti-virus, Windows Live One Care, Norton Anti-Virus 3 user 2007 , 2008 and recently 2009 when I couldn't use the PC Tools Internet Security program.  I decided to try to install PC Tools Internet Security on my laptop because I keep it pretty clean, transferring files to my desktop computer.  The install disk took a very short time to install - that was nice. BUT...and this is a pretty big "but" for me...No matter what I did, my WLAN card was of no use -- Windows kept closing it because there "was a problem."  I couldn't register the program because I had no Internet -- because my wireless was not usable.  Because I could not activate the program, I could not use it for updates yet.  I could not access the Internet to find out what the problem so I could not activate the program.  A catch-22 situation.  No Internet meant no program.  I went through all of the settings and told the program to give full access to my WLAN card but it never worked.  No matter what I did I could never get to the Internet.  Made me mad.  A little aside -- when you are asked to activate the program you type in your name, your email address and the multi-alpha numeric product key.  When you click on activate, you are met with -- sorry but there is no Internet and it keeps your email address but you must re-enter your name and product key over and over as you try to register your product.  I never recognized most of the items the lists of choices showed so had no idea if I should allow or block them.  Even with the Zone Alarm Firewall I used to use I knew what most programs were for.  The software didn't seem to block my Explorer browser but did block items like Linksys EasyLink Advisor.  And I guess the program also blocked my WLAN wireless card.  As soon as I uninstalled the program -- which took two tries and two reboots, my wireless access magically came back along with the Internet.  What a relief!  But now I had no Anti-Virus protection.  The software seemed promising -- I thought there was a nice thick manual inside the box -- apparently the manufacturer thought that the heft of the box might lead buyers to think there was something in the box besides a disk.  I couldn't believe it -- a 4 1/4" X 5 1/2" X 1/2" thick notepad with a link to "special offers for retail customers."  There was a small flyer with instructions on how to install the program and a few other instructions as well but the manual was on the disc.  Since my Norton Anti-Virus had expired (I will never again wait until my current anti-virus program expires to install a new Anti-Virus program so I can use the old one until I get another new program) I ended up downloading the free version of AVG and going to Costco to buy Norton Anti-Virus/3-user software so I wouldn't be without protection on my two computers.  No waiting until low sale prices with rebates or anything a/c I was desperate.  I see by the other reviews that most were able to use the program after any difficulties.  Maybe they are all IT's or MIT graduates.  Programs shouldn't be this difficult.  I thought the program should be more intuitive and not block everything on your computer so you can't even use it.  People complain about Symantec's Norton Anti-Virus but I like all of the programs I have used except their Internet Security from 2004 -- it just slowed down my computer as well as others in my family including one who had a BS degree in Computer Science and a LOT of work experience with computers.	-1
McAfee Anti-Theft is a misleading title for this product. It is really a file encrption program and a poorly made one at that. After installation, the program prompts you to set up your vault (you can select the size) and create a password to lock it. It functions as a virtual drive on your system. There is only a 30 day free support period and unlimited email and chat, which from McAfee doesn't mean much. What is wrong with this program? It is so quickly thrown up that it doesn't include its own window. It uses a Windows Explorer window with its menu system below the Windows menu. If you save files in the vault it suggests that you delete them from your drive using a secure delete program (not included). The files can be transferred and encrypted with 256 bit AES and can be used on a USB drive. DON'T BOTHER WITH THIS PROGRAM. If you truly want an excellent alternative, spend a few more bucks and get<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Steganos-Safe-2008-Encryption-256-Bit-AES/dp/B0018S1WQO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Steganos Safe 2008 - Encryption 256 Bit AES</a>. Steganos offers multiple safes each with up to 256GB of storage, 256 Bit AES, password protection for emails with Outlook, Outlook Express and Windows mail, a password generator, data shredder included, PicPass (which allows you to use pictures to open your safe) and uses your iPod or memory stick as a portable safe and a key to unlock your safe. McAfee comes up short and gives very little information. If they truly want to be competitive, they need to study the competition more. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON McAFEE ANTI-THEFT! One more thing, it is extremely difficult to uninstall, it still leaves traces after being uninstalled.	-1
I was extremely disappointed when I tried Toast 10.  I thought there would be some improvements, but it's just completely useless! Of all the Toast versions, Toast 7 STILL gets the highest ratings on Amazon.  Here is why I still use it every time after all these years...  1.  Toast 10 just starts Exporting ALL THE SONGS (to fill up your hard drive with songs you don't want), and way too fast for good quality.  With Toast 7 you just: Insert a CD, drag it to the Toast window, and then CHOOSE THE SONGS you want to Export, and then choose High Quality.  2.  The reason I tried Toast 10 was that I needed to Export from one Super CD at 24/96, but there are NO options for quality or bitrates on Toast 10 AT ALL!!  The Toast 10 User Manual does not mention Exporting either.  With Toast 7 you can Export music from a CD at any bit or rate you chose, up to 64 kHz/64 Bits.  3.  Toast 7 makes perfect CDs every time.  I literally have NOT ended up with a "coaster" since about three computers ago, over 10 years ago.  I do use good blanks, but every blank I have tried has burned perfectly.  4.  With Toast 7 you can EASILY change the space between tracks from 0 to 8 seconds.  Zero seconds between tracks is essential for concept albums... Everything from Pink Floyd's the Wall to Disney's Alice In Wonderland Soundtrack, plus Classical Symphonies and Piano Concertos, and a few Tomita CDs, etc...  5.  Toast 7 still works perfectly with Snow Leopard 10.6.8 which is the BEST Mac OS ever... Snow Leopard is Lean and Powerful and able to run many older programs that the newer Mac Operating Systems cannot run. When I am required to install Mavericks to sync my new iPhone 5, I am going to partition a new hard drive to boot from both Snow Leopard AND Mavericks.  There's just too many things about Mavericks that are not cool, and too many things about Snow Leopard that are still essential!!  6.  Toast 7 worked perfectly on my iMac G5 running Tiger.  And it works perfectly on my 2008 Mac Pro running Snow Leopard.	-1
I was extremely disappointed when I tried Toast 10.  I thought there would be some improvements, but it's just completely useless! Of all the Toast versions, Toast 7 STILL gets the highest ratings on Amazon.  Here is why I still use it every time after all these years...  1.  Toast 10 just starts Exporting ALL THE SONGS (to fill up your hard drive with songs you don't want), and way too fast for good quality.  With Toast 7 you just: Insert a CD, drag it to the Toast window, and then CHOOSE THE SONGS you want to Export, and then choose High Quality.  2.  The reason I tried Toast 10 was that I needed to Export from one Super CD at 24/96, but there are NO options for quality or bitrates on Toast 10 AT ALL!!  The Toast 10 User Manual does not mention Exporting either.  With Toast 7 you can Export music from a CD at any bit or rate you chose, up to 64 kHz/64 Bits.  3.  Toast 7 makes perfect CDs every time.  I literally have NOT ended up with a "coaster" since about three computers ago, over 10 years ago.  I do use good blanks, but every blank I have tried has burned perfectly.  4.  With Toast 7 you can EASILY change the space between tracks from 0 to 8 seconds.  Zero seconds between tracks is essential for concept albums... Everything from Pink Floyd's the Wall to Disney's Alice In Wonderland Soundtrack, plus Classical Symphonies and Piano Concertos, and a few Tomita CDs, etc...  5.  Toast 7 still works perfectly with Snow Leopard 10.6.8 which is the BEST Mac OS ever... Snow Leopard is Lean and Powerful and able to run many older programs that the newer Mac Operating Systems cannot run. When I am required to install Mavericks to sync my new iPhone 5, I am going to partition a new hard drive to boot from both Snow Leopard AND Mavericks.  There's just too many things about Mavericks that are not cool, and too many things about Snow Leopard that are still essential!!  6.  Toast 7 worked perfectly on my iMac G5 running Tiger.  And it works perfectly on my 2008 Mac Pro running Snow Leopard.	-1
I ordered this product because it ws suggested that in order to transfer the video camera footage or use with Final Cut Pro I needed this or another program like this. I wish I had purchased another program because this one doesn't work properly and the customer service/Tech support is outrageously bad. In fact, I am going to complain with the BBB and any other places I can because the company is actually fraudulant as the product does not work as advertised.  One of the features that I specifically wanted to use was the Blu-ray recording onto a DVD. But this feature is locked and cannot be openned with the Software Code. Why it should be locked I don't know!  When I tried contacting Tech Support, this can only be done by signing into the Roxio website and writing them. Then they write back a bunch of irrelevent questions that if you don't answer within a very short period of time; they close your question and you have to contact them again. Also, in order to answer any of their stupid questions you have to log in and go to your ticket number and write your response, etc.  Of course, this starts adding up, because different people answer the response and replys and they never give you any usable advice. I'm not in the habit of calling people names but the so-called tech supporters are total idiots! I'll answer a question or tell them that my computer is not capable of taking a screen capture and they just totally ignore what you said like they can't understand English.  The last suggestion and most likely final one is that I needed to ask Amazon for the Key Code to opne up their plug-in (which I paid for). I did contact Amazon, even though the it was completely ludicrous, that they would have the key code. Of course, they said that Roxio should have the key code on file. Roxio is responsible for Roxio software, not I and not Amazon!  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT PEOPLE DO NOT PURCHASE ROXIO PRODUCTS!!!	-1
As a reviewer with out the internet and self preparer, they still do not allow you do yor state return with out first accessing the internet.  I had the samr problem last year and I am frustrated.  I think next year, I will go back to doing it by hand and save money.  Now they wanted to charge a fee to print returns.  Lets get real, they should make Turbo Tax for the mass not only those lucky few who are able to afford the internet.  While I realize the internet is here and I fully support it, not all of us have access yet.  What about us.	-1
First of all, Painter 11 was delivered three days after I ordered it.  Second, I got it brand new for $178. The delivery of the product was flawless.  I've had to downgrade Painter 11 because the Auto-Painting feature doesn't work like it should. Unlike Painter 4 Essentials, Painter 11's version of Auto-Painting never finishes and it freezes and crashes after I hit the "Stop" button.  This is a huge disappointment to me because the Auto-Painting function is one of the prime reasons I bought this software. By contrast, I never ran into any problems with Painter 4's version; it was smooth as silk.  Yes, Painter 11 has more brushes and features but the presentation and layout is dull and uninspired when compared with Painter 4 Essentials. In fact, I recently read an online review which said Painter Lite (Painter 4's successor) doesn't even have the Auto-Painting function, even though it's supposed to be a truncated version of Painter 12. I've finally decided to order a Virtuoso T5000 Kanvus pad & stylus which includes a copy of Painter 4 Essentials.  I highly recommend Painter 4 Essentials because it handles like a dream and is totally "on point"; Painter 11, sadly, is a major disappointment.  Long story short:  Anyone seriously interested in digital painting who wants a great product for a reasonable price should buy a copy of Painter 4 Essentials and avoid Painter 11 and Painter Lite like the plague.	-1
I'm not sure what it is with me and Corel products, but I couldn't even get this to run. I would run through the install process and when I ran it I would get nothing. I tried installing a few times to avail. I'm running Windows 7 and don't know if that had something to do with it, but it is the only program I've had these problems with. Corel support was useless.	-1
We are running Vista with Internet Explorer 8 on our PC.  This software disabled Internet Explorer when installed on the first installation, on the second installation and again on the third installation.  Finally, it took on the fourth installation.  I'm not tech savy but I do know enough to know that it was a waste of time and my conclusion is a lack of confidence in this AVG Internet Security product.	-1
Not very good at all. Although claiming to be on top of malware and viruses, it is antiquated. But, it is far better than Kaspersky. You are in big trouble if you have that one!	-1
To register this software you must call a number and be subjected to an extreme sales pitch to upgrade. After that you find that this is a page publisher like MS Publisher to create newsletters etc. There are some useful features but it will feel clunky to those used to the Microsoft interface or even Photoshop Elements etc.  Overall, this is a good entry level software if you can avoid the registration hassle. I'd evaluate the free trial version before going in for the purchase.	-1
Warning: This is the opinion of a novice. If you're looking for advice for professional products, please look elsewhere!  This was not a horrible program in my opinion, but it was discontinued almost immediately after release, is no longer for sale, and is no longer supported.  If you see a copy at a garage sale for a buck or something like that, I say pick it up and give it a spin.  The layout is fairly quirky (almost feels like Windows 95 software) but it does indeed have a lot of quick & dirty features which worked out great for an novice like me. We used it for landscaping sketches & home remodeling sketches. It's much faster to load than online programs, with fast & intuitive "freestyle" shape tools.  Alas, I'm giving it a 1-star because it's so reprehensible for a company to release & dump a product like this.  Anyway, if you're looking for freestyle CAD programs, and you're a novice like me, you might want to check out&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/TURBOCAD-15-DELUXE/dp/B003630F1W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">TURBOCAD 15 DELUXE</a>&nbsp;(about $10),&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/TurboCAD-Deluxe-2D-3D/dp/B003DUB9FO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">TurboCAD Deluxe 2D/3D</a>&nbsp;(under $40), or if you're ready to move into slightly more sophisticated sketches then&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Autodesk-Sketchbook-Pro-2011/dp/B0043SK9QU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Autodesk Sketchbook Pro 2011</a>&nbsp;(about $50).

While going through my slushpile of things I never got around to reviewing, I found this... and then found out that Autodesk gave up on it almost as soon as they shipped it. That makes this a remarkably easy review to write -- just don't bother. There are low-end CAD products that fill the same niche; you can find some open source products on osalt.com, and Autodesk even makes a couple of low-end products specifically for nonprofessional users. The Maker community should be a good place to find specialized software for CAM software and equipment (especially CNCs and 3D printers), and there are a few architectural CAD programs meant for the intended Freestyle market too.	-1

This product is made to help recover lost or stolen electronic items but there are many issues with it. I was letdown bigtime.  - It only works for Androids, PCs and Macs. What the ?????? no iPhones, Kindles or Chromebooks. Strike 1. To top things off, if someone steals your device, the thief can uninstall it. That's strike 2 right there. - Sneak Peak is something I can't assess. Y? I only have iDevices.  I had no choice but to give it 1 star. I don't use android (except on my Kindle but it doesn't work on that) so that pretty much stops me in my tracks.	-1
The user interface of this product isn't bad, fairly intuitive and user friendly, but I was surprised to discover that features that I thought should be standard (at least standard for something for this price and with 'premium' in the name) had to have another pricey subscription to be activated. Doesn't make sense. There are cheaper products out there with more functionality.	-1
Product works as expected however I will not buy again. Symantecs is now injecting itself in politics and does not support constitutional amendments.	-1
Call me biased. I love Kaspersky's products --&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Kaspersky-Lab-Kaspersky-Internet-Security-2013-3-User-Family-Pack-for-Windows-Catalog-Category-Tools-Utilities-Virus-Protection/dp/B00CPT39KC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Kaspersky Lab Kaspersky Internet Security 2013 - 3 User Family Pack for Windows (Catalog Category: Tools & Utilities / Virus Protection)</a>. Yet, every year I try one new product from the competition to see why I love Kaspersky so much.  As is the industry norm, with Avira you get an Internet Security package for 3 licenses (3 computers). You may not want to install in on three computers though once you try it.  AVIRA slows down your computer to a crawl when you first install it off the CD (there is an alternative option to download it from the website if you are connected to the Internet).  Then, it insists on you getting the Ask.com bar which is annoying and unnecessary. Since this is not a free version, why do you need to install what amounts to ads with the software?  As far as picking up on viruses goes, I'm not sure it works. I'm not sure it doesn't work. Over the last month is hasn't found any errors. Not even malware or anything else that was suspicious. Maybe I'm lucky, but if I run Malware Malbytes, Kaspersky, or PandaSecurity, I always find something to remove.  YMMV, but I don't think this is a great product. I recommend you choose Kaspersky instead.	-1
The AVIRA 2013 Internet Security strives to provide comphrensive security. However, though the software does the job, the resource-heavy nature makes it troublesome to have on the PC.  PROS - Good price for 3 users - Comphrensive security - Easy to install  CONS - Slows down your system (Even a gaming computer!) - A menance. It will not want you to close the program  In the computer security market, AVIRA should learn to make their programs more efficient and less intrusive. Skip.	-1
There are two things I want most from security software on my PC: (1) it should work, keeping my computer safe and protected from a range of security threats, including viruses and other forms of attack; (2) it should be mostly unobtrusive, so that I don't even really notice it's there, and just do what I need to do with confidence.  This one does the first thing pretty well, as far as I can tell. It doesn't do the second. It noticeably slows down my system, and it seems to demand my attention far more than I'd like. What's worse is it's not easy to turn off or silence when I need it to.  It was fairly easy to install, and I liked that when I put in the disc and started to install it, it gave me the option to download the latest version, instead of downloading the old version from the disc and needing to update later.  After using it for a few weeks I decided to go ahead and uninstall it. I find it to be more hassle than it's worth.	-1
The older version had more setting options and you could turn off Auto Updates. You could also stop or turn off several of the privacy features. On this one, you have to agree to let them send ALL of your user information to them.  I don't Care for that AT ALL when I'm paying for a program. AND it constantly runs.. Even If I set it NOT to start, it still starts and runs... I ended up deleting it  so it was nothing but a waste of MONEY to me. Honestly I don't like the agreement you have to make to use it.	-1

I bought this after reading all the RAVE reviews (that should have been my first caution flag) after years of using Norton products. I've installed it on our 2 home computers. My wife was the first to noticed that it slowed her computer WAAAAAY down. The computer I use takes much longer to start up now.  Compared to other security software I've used over the years: -It won't shut my computer down after a complete system sweep. -It won't "remember" unusual or new to it files. -It gives me few options regarding "perceived" security threats. - It REALLY slows down startup and shutdown.  Conclusion: Going back to N--n after this subscription expires.	-1
I have been a life long Norton user ever since I learned PC-Dos (not ms-dos) from Peter Nortons book (I still have it). Over the past few years I have been getting more and more frustrated with Norton. While using an older version can normally save you a lot of money, in this case, IT DOES NOT, and adds a lot of frustration with norton coming in and trying to load a new version (and charge you), even when you have over 300 days to go on the one you are using. Also the process of loading the required updates to bring the 2013 or 2014 version to present day, can be daunting, and my last bout with this process was the last straw, as it got stuck on 11 of 14, and would not go any further no matter how many times I un-installed, and re-installed the software. I have tried AVG, and found it to be a bit twitchy, and am now using Webroot which seems to be working out very well.  Windows platforms are hard enough to deal with, without having to ALSO deal with antivirus software that is constantly taking your attention away from ACTUALLY working on the computer. At this point (after using Norton for over 40 years), my recommendation, is to steer clear of it, as there are now many, many other choices out there, and after selling Norton to Symantec in 1990, the company went straight down hill, as far as I am concerned.	-1
I tried to install this on my new Windows laptop running Win 8.1.1 64-bit with an Intel i7 processor, plenty of HD space, plenty of RAM.  The installation program ran for about an hour and then an alert came up saying that the program had stopped working. I okayed out of that and then two windows came up with numerical codes. A final window came up saying that the installation had not finished and nothing on my computer was changed.  However, on my desktop was a Pinnacle Studio icon and when I clicked on it, the program started to run.  Given the option where to check for media files, I just allowed the public folders because I knew that there wasn't much on there.  It recognized the only movie I had there, so I clicked on it to open it.  The screen went black, then it went white, and then the program shut down and my desktop reappeared.  I checked File Explorer and saw that there was 2+GB of data in a Pinnacle folder under Program Files (x86).  Apparently a failed installation didn't result in the removal of the files it previously installed.  Also, it was curious that on a 64-bit computer the default installation was in Program Files (x86) instead of Program Files.  So for whatever reason, this program will not work successfully on my computer, and I'm not going to waste anymore hours trying to get it work. I can't review any of the features included with it.  I would prefer to give it a zero star review since I can't get it to work in my situation, but that option isn't available to me so I felt that a two-star rating was the fairest. I used Revo Uninstaller to remove all of its bits and pieces.	-1
For software where you can pick up free versions, like 7-zip, I'm surprised Corel has this retailing for $60. Even winrar comes with a trial that never expires, but it will nag you every time you run it. On top of this, you can purchase it online for half the cost of this.  Otherwise, it installed easily enough and it is now my default unzip software. I was happy with it until this morning....  When I logged onto my computer, it said an update was available. No problem, I said to go ahead and download/install the update. After the install, it took me through the installation wizard. I was a little nervous because this is when extra software likes to piggy back onto your computer.  Sure enough, after the install some colorful, round icon appeared on my desktop. I was upset because 1) this is paid software for crying out loud. Fine, try to sneak stuff in when it is free, I get that you need to pay the bills. But this wasn't free, this was $60!! And then even worse is 2) it never prompted me to install this software. Usually when I update Java I catch that it is trying to install a toolbar and I tell it not to. With this, it didn't even give me the option, it just installed it hoping I wouldn't notice.  I immediately uninstalled the new software, but when I got to work I noticed my Chrome (which syncs settings with my home computer) now had a new home page. Needless to say, I'm not happy.  Honestly, I didn't realize until now that WinZip is owned by Corel. Upon the realization I muttered, "That explains things." I've had nothing but bad luck with Corel ever since they bought Word Perfect. I would have skipped this completely if I had noticed who sells it now. The fact they obscure their name from the product is rather telling.	-1

Disappointed with this version of Turbo Tax, and had to end up going to a tax professional to have my return done. Why would I need to spend $40 for the deluxe version of Turbo Tax in order to get my tax return done? I think Turbo Tax needs to be upfront about what features you'll get with the basic versus the deluxe. I always use the 1040EZ to file my taxes.  I'd rather spend the extra couple of dollars to get the features included with the deluxe version than waste money. Luckily, I got this software to try out.	-1

Excel: Does not allow you to copy and paste sometimes. I later found out it's related to having many Excels open. Clicking the lower edge of a cell will navigate to the end of the sheet. Does not allow you to paste into visible cells only, despite having this setting selected. Shortening long numbers by default Does not save, unable to edit a cell. Freezes. Constantly freezes, unable to copy, close, or open anything. The only way out is to close all the windows and restart, or end task. Mangles special characters and eff me over on more than a few occasions. Why would the default encoding be Western instead of UTF-8?? Returning false positive in Conditional Formating when highlighting duplicate values. Opening a new window will minimize it (the new window) Can't analyze long numbers. Conditional Formatting will think that all long numbers are duplicates. Auto converts dashes used as bullet points into formulas. Useless Filter function when used on large set of data. Scroll bars disappearing for no reason.  Outlook: Minimizes a newly opened window. Folder pane disappears for no reason, unable to go back to Mail from Calendar. Cannot search for emails using part of the senders domain, would have to provide the entire domain. It updated and then it says "this app can't run on your pc" Run indexing in the middle of the day, preventing search results to fully return. Crashes constantly.  Windows: Folders search boxes don't search after typing in and hitting Enter Why the fk would all the windows be minized when I'm moving another window around? Taskbar doesn't work Click Start in windows 10 will give a "Critical Error" message, requiring the user to sign out.

I have been a big supporter of Corel products -- VideoStudio and PaintShop Pro -- since their earliest versions. They generally do what the more expensive software does but more easily and with more user-friendly filters and frills. Despite their aiming recent versions more at the auto-generate projects for amateurs to create fancy projects quickly, the Corel software still offers the features and function the pros want to product videos and graphics.  BUT, the recent versions, including this one currently infesting my computers, have an added thrill: THEY COME WITH POPUP ADVERTISEMENTS!  Goodie. Now whatever I'm doing I get obnoxious, endless, impossible to remove Corel ads popping up over everything. Often they have no X in the corner to close them. There is no way to stop them. I'm a computer person from way back and I cannot stop these things. I've done everything I have found in setting to stop them in the software settings, including not permitting them from the original install, and they are still there.  Evil. Horrible. And Corel just lost a lifetime customer.	-1
