i used it on a black t-shirt and it came out burgundy color looking,  only works on super light color materials	1
I have purchased almost every color that speedball offers, countless photo emulsion kits and a 9 screens - Speedball silk screening products have never disappointed me! There are not many products that I stay brand specific except Speedball. This is my brand of choice for all my silk screening projects.	1
i always wanted to paint my own shirts, and after reading some ideas on internet, i decided to do it, bought the paint the mesh and this. this squeegee has the a wooden handler, its hard and durable, the came with a little crack on it, but doesn't affect it, its really comfortable, just keep in mind in not a pro doing this, so for me it works fine, i have done few shirts for my friend and the always say they look great, i sold some too :D	1
Excellent product.  My art teacher uses these with excellent results. They are easy to work with and the colors run true.	1
AMAZING!!!! I have been struggling with skin tones because they were not coming out with a smooth appearance. I tried these out last night AND used the blending stump provided, which was a first for me, I couldn't be happier with the flawless results!!!	1
These little pins make applique so much easier.  They hold your piece in place while stitching and don't get in the way.  Also they don't leave a large hole in your pieces as with regular pins.  A winner all the way.	1
I bought these for a an appliqu&eacute; and English piecing class. They are just the right size for this type of work. I only  wish that the heads were in color so they would be easier to see.	1
What a great idea. Short pins so that the needle and thread doesn't get hung up. Good for many other tasks in addition to applique. Trust Clover to come up with what we need.	1
Great product!	1
Very handy.  Does not stick you as longer pins do and tapered head allows thread to pass around it without snagging.  Nice little box to keep them in too.	1
I like the length of these pins, but I wish they weren't so thick. They can leave holes in thinner fabrics.	1
Not just for applique. Use them for any tiny item I'm working on. Have 3 boxes of these...they are fantastic!	1
Handy little tools for doing my applique.	1
Just as described, delivered on time. thank you	1
Exactly what I needed.	1
The pin tips were not sharp and did not glide into the fabric.  I sold them at a Trash to Treasures sale.	-1
Perfect for applique and EPP, and I love the little container. It fits well in my sewing kit and stays securely closed.	1
Thank you very much	1
I bought these because I like to do cross stitch and sometimes the needles that come with the kits are either broken or bent so now I have dependable needles I can use and won't have to worry about it at all!  Also I like stitch my children's names in their shirts as well as for their socks because other wise we get confused in this house whose socks are whose because we have three females!  Sometimes we have people who help out and help us wash some c,oohing and it helps everyone out in the long run to have at least initials in the socks so I don't have or anyone one of my girls do not have disappearing clothing!  I definitely recommend these to everyone and you don't have to have gold needles to know you have good needles as I don't see the difference between the two except in color!  I will definitely be buying in bulk like this again if I have to and for gifts!  We love to do crafts in our family and everyone likes their own supplies!  Also if I think of anything else I will add it!	1
The needles are great, very good material, strong and very easy to manage the grip it gives you is fantastic	1
I love these applique pins!  I am very happy with all my sewing and quilting supplies from Clover.  I am currently sewing an applique quilt and these pins help keep the fabric in place.	1
I was unsure how much I 'needed' these, but I am so glad I bought them.  They are just perfect for hand piecing; their short size keeping them from getting in the way with small pieces.	1
great for doing small applique work	1
Perfect for all your sewing needs.	1
Great very happy	1
good product	1
Great little self-threading needles and I use them for everything!	1
Haven't used as of this time but I'm sure they are going to suit my needs perfectly.	1
I was really surprised at how much better these little pins worked for appliqu. I can use many more pins to better hold pieces in place and even though there are more pins, I get many less pokes than I did with longer pins.  If you like to appliqu quilt, I would strongly recommend these pins.	1
great pins needed for applique in quilting	1
I have been quilting for years, and I have found that these pins meet all my needs.  Eveni the package is perfect with a sturdy little chest that clicks shut to avoid scatter.  I have stopped on one more than once, and it doesn't shatter like the standard rigid case.  The pins themselves are just long enough to do a competent job in pinning work without protruding too far.  This prevents most snarls.  I keep multiple projects going, and have never returned to one to find rust or broken pin heads.  The points stay sharp. When my supply dwindles, I always  uh a back supply, because these pins are perfect.	1
I like these because they have a white head and makes it easier to see on the piece I am working on.	1
GREAT NEEDLES--GREAT FOR A VARIETY OF EMBROIDERY PROJECTS AND CROSS STITCHING.	1
Great item	1
Very nice and accessible. Easy to purchase on the Kindle Fire.	1
What can you say about needles. Wow they were great.	1
Great they are needles.	1
Nice needles!	1
ok	1
My wife loves it	1
Nice chain.  Very textured.  My hair catches in it at times.  Other than that.  It wasn't a bad deal.  I probably wouldn't purchase the same type of extender again though.	1
Extender easily attached to necklace. Very sturdy . Would have liked a bit more delicate design , but I guess this should hold up well. I think it will look awkward attached to a snake chain.	1
I had a lovely necklace that was just a bit too short and this was just long enough to solve the problem!	1
Although the desire to buy the deluxe set of 120 runs deep in your veins, avoid the temptation. The set of 120 contains many near doubles and plenty of cast-offs. The set of 60 will take you pretty much wherever you want to go. If it doesn't, plenty of online art retailers are offering the "open stock" option to help you personalize and complete your set.  Faber-Castell professes that this Polychromos line is both smudgeproof and waterproof. I'm not sure if the waterproof claim is factual, but I have experienced some minor smudgeability. However, this slight tendency towards smudging is nothing much to be concerned about. Polychromos leads are very strong and deserving of their 'unbreakable' title. (I recommend sharpening them with an x-acto knife to customize your point and to save lead that would otherwise be wasted in using a twist, crank, or electric sharpener.) Since the leads are hard, I wouldn't advise using them on "plate" or extra-smooth drawing surfaces. They are best suited for surfaces with medium tooth. If delivering hard pressure with colored pencils is your thing, toss away your Derwents, Pablos, and Prismacolors because Polychromos pencils are oil-based and will not taint your finished work with "wax-bloom".  Some have commented that these pencils are a bit pricey. For artist-grade colored pencils, they are definitely worth the extra money because the leads are hard and dense and will last longer than many other brands. They also have a diameter of 3.8mm, exceeding most other competitor's brands by .5mm to .8mm.  Polychromos has some of the widest color range I've ever witnessed in top-quality colored pencils (especially in greens). In this set of 60, you'll meet the dud, Van Dyck Brown, and possibly 2 others (at most) depending upon your personal preference. Some pencils in this set are VERY close in hue. While you'll probably make good use of them, you can eventually weed a few out to make room in your set for a more varied color collection. All in all, I guarantee that you will be quite happy with the set.	1
not good quality at all, they don't even spread around all that much when you add water, and the mark stays no matter how light it is. youd be better off just spending the money on a prismacolor watercolor pencil set. don't waste your money.	-1
These are good color pencils. They feel a little chalky on dry paper, got down smooth on wet paper, and can be used over areas which have been previously painted with traditional water colors.  Given the price they are also a really good value... I picked up 12 for $11 and change.  They make a great option when going out sketching where you can work clean and dry (most museums for instance will let you sketch, but only with dry media), and then go in with water later if you want to or are able to.  They're also great for adding details into water color paintings, where the pencil might be easier to control than a brush (for lettering or linear details, etc.and small spots of dark values or saturated color).  I've been trying them out as supplemental to ink sketching, and found them to be really convenient as you don't really have to wait for the ink to dry completely before you being laying in some additional color/value to your sketch, then once you're confident the ink isn't going to smear you can start in with the water.  They can also be used effectively with less water than you typically need to use with pan or tube water color, which allows them to be used to a better result on papers that otherwise don't take well to water (i.e. my sketchbook, which is fine with pencils, ink pens and even markers, but which warps terrible with washes.)	1
Love these pencils	1
Nice watercolor pencils - good set for any artist.	1
Very good soft pencils that color with ease. When blended the color becomes more vibrant.	1
I had never used these colored pencils before, they are incredible. I liked them a lot.	1
Bought this to use as "refills" for my 120 pencil set because the price was better than buying them open stock which is what I would have done eventually anyway. I love, love, love the FC Polychromos pencils. I have these, the Prismacolor Premier and the Caran D'Ache Luminance pencils and the Polychromos are definitely my favorite of the "big 3" and get used 10 times more than any of the others. They've got richly pigmented cores in beautiful colors that glide onto the paper like silk. I hesitate to use the word "gummy" to describe the Prismacolor & Caran D'Ache pencils because I do like both of them as well and don't won't anyone to think they are bad pencils but compared to the Polychromos that's just the word that comes to mind for me.  3/30/18 update: I've attached a portrait I did using only the Faber-Castell Polychromos pencils.	1
<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Faber-Castel-110060-Polychromos-Colored-Pencil-Set-In-Metal-Tin-60-Pieces/dp/B000C6RHBW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Faber-Castel 110060 Polychromos Colored Pencil Set In Metal Tin, 60 Pieces</a>&nbsp;I was finally able to buy a larger set of these awesome pencils and I love it! I had been using the smaller set and the pencils were getting very small. I have new ones of those colors and some colors I didn't have now. It goes without saying that the polychromos are super great quality. I received them all in one piece, packaged well.	1
A most have for any professional colored pencil artist. My only disappointment is I didn't purchase the 120 colors tin. These in combination with Pablo and Luminance are an essential pencil set for serious colored pencil artist. The colors, blending and ability to create colorful detailed drawings is worth the investment, which isn't bad compared to other professional pencils on the market now. I have been creating colored pencil portraits and drawings for several years now, and will be purchasing the larger 120 tin soon.	1
perform just as expected, easily rewettable and blends nicely. the tin lid doesnt stay on securely so i have to be careful during transport. there was an issue with one pencil not manufactured correctly. Contacted Derwent and the pencil was replaced easily. Great company and product. fast shipping from the seller, packaged decently.	1
These are by far - IMO - the easiest to work with colored pencils so far as smooth lay down, blending and burnishing using only the pencils themselves and no other tool such as a colorless blending pencil.  I pretty much knew this when I started out on a campaign to test some of the "new" brands hitting the market and compare them to my old favorites. I have attached a comparison picture so you can see for yourself how the Polychromos perform next to two other top brands and three off brands.  Interestingly enough, although they do - again IMO - look somewhat better, over all the differences in the brands of pencils are not so much in the results as in how difficult it is to get them.  I used a similar quick eye sketch for each type and did my best to match the color quality from brand to brand.  For the Polychromos the effort to get quality and intensity was very minimal, with varying degrees of difficulty getting the other pencils to perform in a similar fashion.  I also wish to highlight the fact that although my previous Polychromos were purchased well over 10 years ago, the quality of this new set is unchanged.  Not always something that you see in this day and age where every company is trying to implement cost savings which ultimately result in a lower quality product.  Kudos to Faber-Castel for holding their production standards high!	1
I bought these for Christmas gifts for my grandsons. I am very happy with the quality of this ink pencil. It acts like a watercolor pencil, except that after the ink dries, it is no longer water reactive. This really helps when you don't want to have your colors getting muddy. You can use a brush and water or a water brush. I have been using my set of 72 for two years now. My projects have taken on a more art quality.	1
Crisp, clean colors, good quality	1
Love these.  Very pleased with my purchase.	1
Great colors.  Very happy with these pencils.	1
Pencils lay down smoothly with exception of the few that have some specks in them that make them scratchy.  Color range is well balanced but wish there were more natural greens for coloring foliage.  Also skin tones are a bit unnatural and limited.  Pencils keep points longer and leads don't break much during sharpening.  Colors are lightfast.  Tin is nice and durable for carrying around pencils but I prefer storing them in the Derwent carryall bag.  The price is higher than most brands of pencils.  The 120 set rose in price from $144 to $170 in the past month on Amazon whereas the 60 set has remained around $73/$74.  Overall I think they are nice pencils but was disappointed with the multiple scratchy pencils I got given the huge price tag.  I have colored in twilight garden, Daydreams, seasons, minuet de boneur, tenderful enchantments and other coloring books.  They lay down color well on all of these books (minus the scratchy pencils).  They also work fine in combination with prismacolor and Lyra Rembrandt. I would recommend these if you can get them for a decent price.	1
These pencils are pretty good. Just haven't got used to them yet.	1
I have purchased this tin twice now, one for me months ago, and one just last month for a Christmas gift for a fellow colorist friend of mine. I LOVE my polychromos. These pencil's have very quickly become one I use more often than others! The colors are vibrant, easy to blend, HUGE color range too by the way, I mean you just can't go wrong with these. They're great quality pencils, and happen to make all of my adult coloring images unique, and gorgeous. I am always getting questions about what I use, where I got them etc, and of course I relay the information to Faber-Castel on Amazon. The craft stores here nearby do NOT sale Faber-Castel in store which is quite odd, but it's true. So thankful I was able to get these directly on here! Will be a returning customer, of course!	1
Great pencils. They met my very high expectations. Their quality is amazing.	1
Great color quality. Lots of variety in the set. Appreciate the tin for storage. One pencil arrived broken though.	1
Good watercolor pencils, not my favorite to use on textured paper. Some of them do take a lot of working to get them to disperse as wanted, which isn't the best if you aren't using a heavier paper. Over all, happy with my purchase and I use them in conjunction with my awesome Kuretake watercolors.	1
Fun art pencils, thanks.	1
great product	1
LOVE these watercolor pencils. They allow me to create watercolor paintings with the control of a pencil :-)	1
Excellent pencils!!	1
I had not realized that these were not beveled sided pencils. Additionally, they are much wider than other pencils. I have small hands and much less control with these pencils. I deeply regret purchasing them since I am not able to control them as well as other pencils, and I bought the large set. I wish I had at least made my mistake with a set of 24. Faber-Castel is a good brand for sure. However, that doesn't help me when I have less control over them.	-1
they are ok	1
Product was exactly as described.	1
You can't go wrong with Derwent! I'm very happy with this product	1
I finally treated myself to the Derwent Water Color Pencils in the 72 pack. I already love the quality of  Derwent and the color quality and the excellent selection of colors in this tin is superb. Big fan of Derwent. Great to use either dry or wet. Colors are fabulous.	1
Best pencils I have ever tried hands down! Vibrant, smooth, goes down like butter! I like them so much, I regretted instantly not getting a bigger set and went and got more open stock pencils that I wanted!!	1
Great watercolor pencils with an excellent color range that is unique to Derwent, which I really like.  I had no problem sharpening them with my Kum or Alvin/Dux hand sharpener. The wood did not split or break. The colors are beautiful and there is little color shift from wet to dry. The pigment dissolves easily and works best on smooth or hot pressed paper. It does not require you to scrub the paper to activate the watercolor paint. You may see a little pigment dust when laying down color, its best to blow it off the paper into a dish or the trash than swipe with your hand and smear it. Most pencils do this and it isn't a bad thing, it just is part of the personality of your art tool. If used on cold pressed paper with more tooth/texture be careful not to press into the paper with the pencil or the lines will not completely dissolve, which is great if that is the look you going for but not if you want a smooth color flow. According to Derwent most of these pencils have great lightfast ratings, but this is not noted on the pencils or the tin. There is no literature provided with the set, you have to look it up on their web sight or read the one posted here in Amazon. This is probably a personal preference, but I love that the name of the color is clearly printed on the pencils and they are in numeric order, also printed on the pencils, from 1 through 72. For me it makes it easy to do a color chart and then keep them in order for quick color selection. The pencil color paint d on the tip is pretty accurate. Overall this is a great value choice in the category of artist quality watercolor pencils. The color range, quality, and price, make them a comfortable buy and fun to use because you don't have to feel wasteful if you want to doodle with them. While they are not budget or cheap pencils, the price currently being charged is in my opinion a fair price for an artist grade tool.	1
Great Product!	1
The best!  life changing.  Would never use another.  Leaps and bounds above Prismacolor.	1
Is there some reason why they can't do a set A and a set B??? They have 120 in their whole line and I want the whole line, but to afford it, I could pay for a set of 60 then later pay for the second set of 60 to get the whole line. If I buy any smaller set, I'd still have to buy the whole 120 down the line just to get them all. Sounds dumb to me, and you'd think they would get more money this way as I don't want to buy them at all if I can't afford the whole set at one time and don't want smaller sets as they still would not give me the complete line.	1
Great deal	1
Great pencils, firm lead but very smooth coloring. I also like the way they are arranged in the tin.	1
These are fantastic.  Really rich colors - live up to everything in the description.  Watercolor pencils have "changed my life" in doing watercolors.  Such a great way to start with a more "exact" image and then let the water flow it out from there.  Definitely recommend.	1
nice application and works well on smaller projects.	1
I already have the smaller set and I had bought a watercolor set. I had also bought watercolor set of a different brand and was very happy with the feel of the quality however I use these much more often because I am so much happier with the color saturation.	1
These are the best colored pencils! Don't waste your money on any thing else! Worth every penny.	1
the best!	1
I am not an artist by any means.  I am into paper crafting and for a while now have been "playing" with coloring.  I have tried a few different brands of colored pencils and decided that I needed to step up my game & try Faber-Castel Polychromos.......OMG they are the best.  I am so glad I got them.  Of course the very next day I wished I had purchased the largest size (120 pencils)  I'll see how the 60 does...........Excellent purchase.	1
Wonderful watercolor pencils...perfect	1
Love them. Maybe someday I can buy the larger set.	1
Love these pencils!	1
Our first born...er, first bought, colored pencil set is always dear to the heart. So it is with these. I, now, have an extensive collection of art/coloring supplies. These are always my go-to set. I love the results...blends well, layers well, beautiful colors. I will admit that my 3 star Prisma Premiere pencils are more vibrant. But the quality of Faber Castel is excellent. I rarely give a five star rating but this is one of those occasions. I purchased this set on my own so this is my honest opinion.	1
Purchased a set of watercolor pens after attending a zen tangle color drawing class. I'm experimenting incorporating this into my ink drawings and can definitely see using them for watercolors on the road. Twenty-four gives me enough variety because I like to mix my colors for more depth. The pencils give good control when laying color down on paper. They wash nicely with a wet brush which is the style I prefer (versus wetting the pencils or the paper first). I still use regular watercolors but this is a nice addition to my art supplies especially because I've been drawing with ink. I use smooth paper like Bristol board with ink and a more toothy surface for watercolors. But these worked well on a smooth surface too. If you never tried watercolor pencils, these might surprise you. I use them with Pentel aquash brushes, love the combo.	1
Just used these last night...LOVE THEM!!!  Will buy second set for my daughter!	1
They work just the way I needed them to. Look dull until you add water then the color comes alive, just beautiful! Love the many ways to use.	1
Smooth, vibrant colors, several shade gradations, esp. the blues and greens; very nice wooden box with "stays" for each side full of pencils	1
Great pencils! I used them for this faceup on my monster high doll	1
Excellent color return, easily soluble, good quality pencils which I have come to expect with this brand. Some are easily broken which is likely due more to how they were handled than quality. Unfortunately can't put in microwave to resolve because of the gold stripe, but have used a drop of superglue to successfully hold the lead in place when needed. I can deal with it because of the good price and no guarantee that another set won't do the same.	1
SO EXCITED to get these pencils here for a decent price that didn't break the bank! THANKS for selling a great product. Does just as I expected!	1
I love the pencils from Faber-Castel I will buy them over & over again thank you. Karen Greenlee	1
Love these watercolor pencils.  I have the larger 36 set.  I bought these as a gift for my 6 year old niece.  She loves them and they are different than just regular colored pencils.  Good quality on all the pencils	1
New to watercolor.. Love this set	1
These water color pencils are easy to use and the colors are great for watercolor painting.  They blend easily and make it easy to fill in shadows and intricate areas.  Love them!	1
Wonderful!! I loved them from the moment I tried them. I've used several brands Premier Prismas being my top one but no longer since I've tried the Faber-Castell's. Yes they are expensive but I don't regret my purchase!	1
These are good pencils. My first with the oil based colored pencils so there is a small learning curve to get them to blend. The only down side is the price. I hate that I have only half of the colors produced but at the time I could not afford any more.	1
These pencils are great little tools!  You can really do small areas then apply a wet brush for great watercolor.	1
Works well	1
These are very good quality watercolor pencils for the price. They're smooth and consistent. They blend well on good quality drawing, watercolor or mixed media paper. I use them primarily for field sketching. The quality is not as high as the Faber-Castel Albrecht Durer watercolor pencils, which have a creamier consistency, smoother feel and greater vibrancy in comparison. That said, the considerably lower price point make these pencils a very good value. I also appreciate they they are free from animal byproducts, as are the Faber-Castel pencils, which is not the case with many other brands. I will continue to use these for field sketching and save my Faber-Castel pencils for studio work.	1
Nice colors. The 24 pack has all the colors I need in a nice portable case. The lead is soft and requires little pressure. These pencils are very versatile and work well in 5 different ways.	1
Very happy with the purchase	1
Beautiful pencils, easy to color with, very easy to sharpen without breaking	1
These meet all expectations.  The color goes down smooth and brilliant.	1
Excellent quality pencils. Nice color range.	1
Yes, very nice pencils, folks, good points, don't crumble.	1
like	1
My gift to myself  now I can't wait to complete my set  it's on my birthday list! You can't go wrong with Faber Castel Polychromos!	1
These pencils are wonderful and we'll worth the money because they don't disappear nearly as quickly as the Prismacolor pencils.  I LOVE them!	1
What can I say - they are beautiful ans lovely to use.  Wish I had splurged and bought a larger set	1
Love the oil pencils....they are so easy to use and very blendable.  You can create your own colors--the look is very nice.  I have cheaper pencils for cheaper books and use these when I really want to make the pictures jump off the page.	1
Although these were not originally what I was after and ended up with them by accident I am pleasantly surprised with them. I like them and can recommend them to colourists that like using watercolours. They are easy to use and apply well.	1
Nice pencils to use for watercolor. They do give a little different effect on the final product  however.  But is it nice.	1
While I did like the set of Polychromos, I wish the variety of the colours most commonly used was bigger...  On the whole, not a bad set...	1
Reed some reviews and heard about these pencils, so I tried them! Wow, I love them! The color goes on smooth and rich! I'd buy them again in an instant! Love them!	1
I love these pencils, the are a dream to color with	1
Love these pencils. I have the prismacolor premiers....but I seem to prefer these. Nice to work with..nice tin that is easy to see and use all colors ..	1
These are fantastic watercolor pencils. Oh my goodness. I am so pleased with this purchase. I was concerned about buying them as I am not much of a watercolorist. But, the lay down color so nicely. They blend just beautifully. I am learning to enjoy watercolor where I never really have before. I watched a few tutorials on these and just jumped right in. They are not super easy to learn to use, but, I am learning and I love these pencils. These Derwents may be one of the best buys I've ever made from Amazon.  And the best thing?  I got them on sale!  I loved Prime day!  Thank you Amazon.	1
very good! excelent products	1
Have not used them yet. But I know they are a good watercolor pencils.	1
Very smooth and the colors are brilliant.	1
Love love LOVE!!!! I wish I had saved for the 120 set.	1
F-C Polychromos is definitely my go-to pencil. I started out a couple of years ago with the F-C Art Grip line, but it doesn't match the buttery application and rich pigments of the polychromos line of pencils. The colors blend well with or without blending pencils or solvents. The pencils work on a variety of paper weights. I actually like them more than the Caran d'Ache Luminous pencils (with the exception of the white pigment). They are a judicious investment in your talents and enjoyment of art, regardless of your proficiency.	1
These are on par with other artist pencils I've used- not quite as good as Pablos or Lyra but close- they don't have as wide a color palate as prismacolor but they sharpen a lot better and don't shatter as you're putting a point on them as sometimes happen with prismacolor because of the wax to pigment ratio.	1
Nice I like the softness	1
Love Derwent watercolor media. Perfect for sketching and coloring. Lighter in intensity than Inktense pencils. Having both sets is a plus for artists and colorists who want a wide range of color possibilities.	1
Love the pencils but I thought they were inktense so I was dissapointed and had to go and buy the inktense. So beware the packaging is deceiving on both products.	1
I have both the Inktense and the regular watercolor pencils, they are amazing quality, beautiful and brilliant ( especially the Inktense) they blend well together and with regular watercolor, the 12 count is easy to cary when painting/drawing outside. They are nice in the 36 count, as they have a good variety of colors with a still affordable price. If you like to draw, the will enhance your experience and versatility, as they are exactly like colored pencils when initially used ( although softer) and when adding clear water over transform in a beautiful watercolor painting. Order with confidence, you will never regret your purchase, they are a classy brand that stand the test of time ( my first set came from an amazing artist friend that had them for 30 years, they are the same with my new ones, outstanding quality)	1
Everyone raved so about these.  I saved up and got the set of 60, the largest set I could afford.  Big mistake. Yes, the lay down, blending, sturdy leads and all the other hype is true.  I find no fault with the product, the quality is everything I had heard.  This was completely offset for me by the color selection.  I have rarely encountered such a large collection of dark pencils in my life.  About a third to half of the pencils are so dark it is difficult to differentiate between the shades or in some cases even the color (unless you're reading it off the barrel of the pencil).  Sarcasm...may be easier to tell the difference outside in the noon sun.  More sarcasm...these will be useful if I ever decide to attempt colored pencil reproductions of those depressingly dark old dutch masters paintings.  Otherwise, I am going to be investing in a lot of extras in the lighter colors to blend them up to useful.  So I feel that I wasted money buying the larger set.  Also, be warned, the pencil barrels are deceptive, in many cases they are considerably lighter in color than the pencil lays down (they make a pretty display in the case).  My advice....skip this set.  Buy a smaller set, then add selected individual pencils.  It will probably be cheaper overall that way.	-1
I love these oil-based professional colored pencils. They glide on easily, have vibrant colors, and are easy to blend. The leads are long lasting. The applied color has good light-fastness. The set of sixty pencils gives you a good selection of colors, and with its superior blending capability, the color palette you can create is endless. Another bonus I find with the Faber Castel pencil line is that the colors are consistent across products. This means that the color names and pigments for the Polychromos oil pencils are the same as those for their Albrecht Durer watercolor pencils. The set, packaged in a metal tin, arrived in perfect shape.  For those who are considering purchasing the wax-based Prismacolor Premier colored pencils, which cost less than the Polychromos, I'll provide a little comparison here, since I own both. There have been many complaints about product control with the Mexico-manufactured Prismacolors. Lead breakage is a problem, especially if you drop a pencil. This is because the lead is not glued to the wood. The barrels may be chipped or warped. The lead cores are sometimes off-center too. But in the German-manufactured Polychromos, quality control is excellent, the lead is attached firmly to the wood, and I have experienced no lead breakage or other anomalies. The Prismacolor pencils have softer leads than the Polychromos and wear down far faster. That being said, I enjoy using both brands of pencil. They both have bright colors, and they even blend together well.  If I have to give any negative comment, it's that the Polychromos pencils (and the Prismacolors as well) have round barrels, so they roll around on a table easily. A hexagonal shape would have been better not only to control the roll but also to hold them more firmly. But that's such a minor complaint that it doesn't detract from my five-star rating.	1
Great watercolor pencils!	1
I bought the Derwent Inktense water soluble pencils first. After awhile of using those, I figured I should try its regular watercolor pencils as well for comparison purposes. Those are very nice pencils. As a plus, their colors look exactly like what they will look like when wet. The Inktense, by contrast, change color when wet because you are turning on the ink feature.  However, there is no comparison between the color vibrancy between the Inktense and the regular watercolor pencils. The Inktense are just incredible. The finished product looks as good as any watercolor made using any other method. The regular pencils look good but I am probably only going to use them along with the Inktense, not instead of the Inktense. I think the results will just not be strong enough using the regular pencils. I got both the regular and regular metal watercolor. They operate the same and are both very different from the Inktense.  I have used a variety of papers in testing these. So far my very best results are on the arches watercolor block cold press paper. I extensively used arches paper in the rough variety first and could not get the results that I get with paint. Thus, I switched to cold press. I am also trying hot press. So far I have not turned out anything very good with hot press. But it could be that my style is not conducive to hot press. My style WAS very conducive to rough until I switched to pencils from paint. I agree with other reviewers here that advise that the paper you use makes a vital difference to your success with the Derwent pencils.	1
First, holy moly these are so much cheaper than they are at the big craft stores. Like, a fourth the price, seriously. I bought these to use for doll repaints, and I love them. They have such smooth color laydown and beautiful pigmentation. Plus they hald a point beautifully. I have used them to color a little, in combination with my Prismacolors, and they're so nice. The two work really well together, despite being different types of pencil. I like the multimedia affect of using these as watercolors, and am thinking about using them with my Copics next.	1
I love these pencils.  I just told someone that they are like coloring with butter...lol.  I would definitely buy these again.  I will be watching the price of the larger sets and will purchase if the price comes down a bit.  I would definitely say that these are worth the current price to purchase though!	1
Great product. I love my Prismacolor for other reasons, but I would definitely choose these first. The colors are so vibrant. I've attached a current work in progress and I see a difference in how vibrant they are. They blend so easily it's effortless. I also attached a pic of all of them laid out in their new home.	1
While it took me a little while to get used to the hardness of these pencils compared to Prismas, I like that I can layer these over and over again without wax bloom. They also erase pretty well. Although it takes me longer to put color down compared to softer pencils (patience!), I can do so more carefully and with more detail. Perhaps the most significant thing I noticed initially was that I hardly have to sharpen them unless doing detail work. Even then, I just barely sharpen the tip. They really last. With Prismas, I was sharpening constantly (even nearly 15 years ago when the quality was supposedly better) because they're designed to be soft. My first colored pencil illustration using these is turning out well. I highly recommend these quality pencils. A less experienced artist might not appreciate these as much as I do; however, I'm very familiar with this medium.	1
Better than Prismacolor pencils!!  No waxy buildup.  Smooth, creamy lay down of color and easy to build layers.  They are worth the investment.  They can be used with Prismacolor pencils as well.	1
Granddaughter loves these pencils! Great gift!	1
Really nice pencils they work like I thought they would.  Great color.	1
What a wonderful set of watercolor pencils!  I have been looking at many different brands because I specifically need these for redoing Barbie doll faces which requires a nice, high quality watercolor pencil that will stay sharp and allows the color to go on smoothly.  I knew that they were going to work as soon as I opened the package.  They are packed in a nice sturdy tin that will keep them together and you can store them in an art carrier, in a drawer or store them on a shelf without having to worry about any of the pencils getting lost or broken.  For the dolls, I use the pencils with the tips moistened with water.  The color flows nicely and is bright.  It can be seen almost immediately which eliminates the need to go over the same area of the doll's face multiple times.  Especially the bright white.  I've had trouble in the past with getting a nice, clean fill in with the white but with these pencils, it's extremely easy.  Now I will finally be able to finish the dolls that I started!  If you redo Barbie or any other doll, look no further because this set of watercolor pencils is exactly what you are looking for to give him/her that new face that you have in your imagination.  Next I will try using them for drawing on paper but I really do not forsee any issues with these pencils.  I absolutely LOVE them!	1
I've bought this 60 set POLYCHROMOS tin through some other online store @ decent price plus 6 additional colors in open stock (Burnt carmine, Alizarin crimson, dark flesh, light flesh, cinnamon and copper) .Actually i tempted to buy 120 color set but many castoffs or near identical colors you can't differentiate in 120 set .so this 66 colors are more than enough for me. Many prismacolor enthusiasts are complaining about hardness of this pencils, I wonder this is pretty soft with oil based leads need different pressure application than prismacolor. The color output is very detailed deep and more natural than prismacolor,however prisma's are more vivid and unnatural but you can achieve realism in prisma's depends on artists. Coming back to quality 1. This pencils are unparalleled never ever face a single breakage even using cheap quality sharpener. 2. To achieve very fine details this is your go to color pencils, (prismacolor is horrible while sharpening). 3.plenty of natural skin tone colors like all 3 flesh colors(light,medium,dark)also cinnamon,pompein red, burnt carmine,burnt ochre,sangiune,walnut brown etc. are excellent for portraits pretty much  match with prismacolor skin tones. 4. Come back to red's this Faber castell polychromos have the widest range of reds among all the artist grade color pencils even better than prisma.for example this dark red put prismacolor's crimson red in to shame also red violet, magenta, scarlet, madder all are gorgeous indeed true colors, However prismacolor's Tuscan red is unique brownish red is better than polychromos burnt carmine. 5. Come back to greens this polychomos had many natural greens like chrome green opaque, olive green yellowish, pine green, light green all re superb for natural floral drawings. 6. This 60 set doesn't have much browns and greys only walnut, Vandykes, burnt ochre, raw sienna and 4 more greys compare to prisma it's very less but in 120 set you can get full range of browns. 7. Polychromos black is the deepest black color pencil even better than Derwent drawing's black, but white is not as opaque as Derwent drawing or prisma,polychromos white is translucent more suitable for classic look on toned papers. 8.it's more value for money than prisma actually because of this pencils sturdiness in lead it will not wear out so easily, so it's 3 times more lifetime than prismacolor.but price wise its expensive than prismacolor(132 prisma set sold for 97$some time back compare to 96$ polychromos 60 set)  Overall it's very very high quality color pencils with marvelous deep color application suitable for artist to amateur(i personally advise don't waste this pencils for adult coloring etc because for adult coloring plenty of cheap color pencils will give you same result) this pencils are meant for professionals or semi pro. This is the treasure from Faber castell.	1
I bought these for a beginner colorist and he loved them. They are also artist-quality as well. Just remember that these are watercolor pencils and, as such, should not be over-sharpened because they are softer and break easily. Recommended.	1
Good pencils	1
How can you not love these beautiful, buttery, vibrant colors.  I had to have more than 60 so I ordered the rest individually.  They are amazing to blend (after watching a few tutorials!) and such a smooth beautiful laydown.  I only use them for when I'm coloring something special not for everyday doodle coloring.  I own the full set of Prismas, which I love except for the breakage issue and this is not a problem with polychromos.  I did purchase the spray fixative once I got these and it works great wiith the poly's.  This is my 5th full set of colored pencils (yes I have a problem!) and by far my favorite.  I have some Lyra rembrandt polys coming soon so I can compare but I got those mostly for practicing so I don't use up these gorgeous pencils until I am more experienced!  No regrets and glad I treated myself to these!!	1
I've never handled such beautiful pencils. I have a set of Prisma color 72 and wax bloom really can keep a person down. Especially when the blender will sort of peel up some of your coloring after a time. Faber Castell Polychromos feels premium, and the colors are excellent. I'd say they are a bit different than Prismacolor. The packaging is fantastic. It makes it easy to find groups of colors and to remove the layers the pencils lay inside the tin. The colors are organized beautifully. The way the pencils tin is set up beautifully. I  notice you can really work with layering and you have a great amount of control. You use less of the pencil too, so you will be replacing less. These pencils sharpen to a point but the output of color is the same. The quality can be felt on these pencils. The lead is aligned properly. They can be mixed with other oil pencils or prismacolor. Breakage is much less than prisma. These are the better pencils for a beginner than prismacolor as in the long run they will save you money as you'll be replacing pencils less often. I'll use all my art supplies but the Polychromos is the best I've used. I'm sure Luminance is great too, but this right here will be my daily driver.  What will really interest you in these pencils is the ability for more blending, the reduction of wax bloom they're easier to sharpen and don't wear down as fast, and if you're still a prisma fan you can mix the two mediums.	1
These are the best of colored pencils, a little more money but well worth it and they don't break and lay down beautifully - have tried others and none compare to these - highly recommend.	1
Although pricey these pencils are well worth the investment.  Perfect for detail as well as wide coverage and the lead does not break easily like some pencils.  I would like a larger set though but the colors blend well to create different tones.	1
Oh, these are simply the best. Wonderful color lay down. The core isn't super hard. But it's not soft core either. These are definitely artist quality. I use these over and under my derwent Inktense "paintings" the colors layer beautifully without getting muddy. Both pencil sets work best with a proper water brush!	1
Everyone I asked recommended these brands to me and I can see why they gliiiiide onto any surface your using to color. I also love how blendable they are don't waste your time trying to go cheaper like I was gonna do. Because when you have the right tool its amazing how more enjoyable and easier getting the art project done. Definitely gonna be repurchasing.	1
excellent	1
The pencils are like butter! Such rich and beautiful colors. They don't smudge. They are true to color. A joy!	1
These are my first set of Polychromos pencils.  Have always used Prismacolor which I love.  These are very good quality and are easy to work with...dare I say a bit easier than my Prismacolors!  There is a difference between the two pencils and I guess that is what I am feeling.  Prismacolors are wax based pencils and the Polychromos are oil based pencils.  Although both lay down color easy and beautifully, I find these new Polychromos easier to blend, especially if I want to add color over an area that has been blended with the colorless blender.  I really love these pencils and I don't think you could go wrong with giving them a try.	1
Used these last night for my bible art journaling and the colors were amazing. Love these pencils.	1
This is my third set of watercolor pencils: a 100-year old set of Mongols, which are superb; a cheap set of Reeves, which are adequate; and these. My Mongols are not replaceable (and are missing the black), so I use them sparingly and the Reeve's colors don't always fit what I need. I mostly use watercolor pencils for preliminary drawings under watercolor paintings, so I don't really need a giant set, but the colors on the Derwents are so nice I wish I'd gotten at least a 24 (and the 12 set doesn't include a really red red; just crimson lake).	1
The Derwent line is my preferred line of watercolor pencils, the colors are vivid and easy to blend.	1
What's not to love. Just wish they were more affordable.	1
I got these for Christmas this year and I am loving them! Everyone raves about their polys and I have to admit they are fantastic. Nice pigment, easily lays down color, but the tips don't wear down as fast. Wonderful blending and no problems with broken cores. I haven't used these extensively yet but so far I am impressed and I love these pencils. That said, I do still love my prismas for the vibrancy. Polys are great but they just aren't quite as vibrant as prismas and I haven't had issues with the cores of my prismas so in my opinion these can go head to head and I can't say I favor one over the other. If using them for detail, I generally will go with the polys though!  Very happy with my new pencils and they add to my collection. I've used them on my Johanna Basford Secret Garden coloring book and loved the color and blendability!  Update: Now that I have added a few more pencil options to my art box, I have had a chance to compare these to additional options. These remain the star of the show. They have great pigment, lay down smooth color, blend and layer beautifully. In addition they keep their point for a respectable length of time allowing some time between sharpening. I can't find a true con to these. The only minor issue is the vibrancy not quite matching up to the prismas, but it's very close! I like to play around with all my pencils in different applications but I always return to these. Still very happy playing with my Polys!!	1
These are the best pencils!!!!	1
These pencils are great.  They blend nicely too.  Good for adult coloring books.	1
My favorite pencils.  They layer beautifully and the colors can go from subtle to intense.	1
Perfect as Described....	1
I am using these with my embroidery work and so far trying to learn the art of them.  Love the colors!	1
see my other post. I love DERWENT and i use several brands this is a unique one. I also use PRisma and cant think of hte other brand now	1
Love them	1
Well, these arrived and after waiting for them, I am totally pleased with them.  I was concerned that they would be more difficult to use than my old Berol Prismacolors.  Arthritis makes it difficult to use a lot of pressure when doing adult coloring.  I had read so many great reviews and I was not disappointed.  These are great pencils and I am so glad I ordered them.  Now, I have an assortment of pencils and am totally pleased with the Faber-Castels.	1
Love these pencils.  I wasn't going to buy them because the price is a bit prohibitive.  I use Prismacolor primarily which are also costly but FC are pricier.  But I wanted them so badly that I bought myself an early Christmas present and I'm really glad that I did.	1
The best.	1
I love these pencils! I have Prismacolor and I like them but these are so much better! They blend better and the color's are richer.	1
Best colored pencils ever!  Vibrant colors, blends perfectly without needing any gamsol or odorless mineral spirits.  I ended up buying the rest of the colors available.  leads  a little harder than Prismacolor Premier colored pencils but once I got used to the harder feeling, I will never go back to  because of their quality hand tanked and I've wasted so much for broken leads and split casings.  The hardness of these leads make the Polychromos last much longer than Prismacolors and they hold a point well.  I sharpen them with a KUM long point, two  stage sharpener , which is perfect.  The leads are harder but not scratchy and as said above, lay down deeply saturated color easily.  Right now I am using them in the Enchanted Forest adult coloring book by Johanna Basford.	1
Love Love Love	1
Daughter and Son got these for a project, said they liked them real well	1
Wonderful pencils to use in dabbling with several mediums.	1
Love! So convenient & easy to use with the Derwent waterbrushes. Fun!	1
I've used lyra rembrandt and prismacolor both good pencils, but these in my opinion are far superior.	1
These are excellent, I have 3 other oil based CP that are good these are now my new favs	1
Polychromos are the best. This set is beautiful.	1
I'm just learning how to use art tools, namely colored pencils.  Immediately I've noticed the difference between the Polychromos and the Prismacolor Premier.  The FC Polys keep its point for a sustained period--depending on the color.  The Premiers break, break, break!  Even for me who is not an artist, not experienced with art, pencils, paints, etc., I was annoyed to have paid for a set of pencils that just kept breaking.  Compared to the Lyras:  The FC feels better in your hand, and (IMO) the color spread is the same.  The Lyras are skinny pencils...difficult to get used to in some case.  However, I love the Lyra colors, although the color variety in all the pencils are up to the user.  Compared to the Luminance:  The Luminance feels way better in my hand.  It's smooth and thicker than the FC Polys.  However, I noticed that the color spread was about the same.  Of course, we all want the expensive, pretty, Swiss pencils, but honestly, you aren't missing anything by not purchasing them.  I will be purchasing the set eventually.  ;-)  It was difficult at first to figure out the difference in total colors between the 60- and 120-count of Polys, but I was able to find a chart on the FC website.  It would be great if that same chart was on the product page.  I wanted to be able to get the 60-count, and then buy select colors open stock.	1
I love these! I can only give a review based on what I use these for, repaints on dolls. They are so wonderful and easy to use. I would suggest getting a nice pencil sharpener for a really fine point. The colors blend nicely and can be very pigmented with layering. There is a lot of choice in colors as well. This is not the smallest or the largest set you can get, but it is a nice medium palette of colors.	1
As a beginner in watercolor - these pencils are great - just need to use them as much as I do my paints.	1
gorgeous pencils. blend well. i am not sure they are vibrant enough.	1
No broken pencils upon arrival; however, the magnetic bar that holds them in place did come loose and there were several pencils loose when I opened the box. Otherwise, great pencils and neat wooden box in which to store them. I look forward to using them more.	1
I bought these as a gift for a student artist & she was well familiar with the brand & loves them!	1
Absolutely love these pencils, best ones I've ever used!  I would recommend for any serious artist/crafter/hobbyist!	1
I love these pencils and the colors blend very well with water.  My only issue is that the blue paint of the pencil colors my hand when I work with them so I am giving only 4 stars.	1
I heard raving reviews for this set of colored pencils, so I bought the biggest set I could afford.  I do love that they are oil based as it does provide a very different result from wax based colored pencils, but you really do have to lay down a lot of color to be able to spread the color around on paper with Gamsol (I used a synthetic paint brush rather than blending stumps).  The lighter colors are made to be "transparent" and the darker colors are made to be "opaque" and this definitely was the case.  I just found that it was much easier to blend and move the color around with the creamier wax based pencils from Prismacolor.  I've heard people complain about Prismacolor with the wax based barrels breaking so easily but I haven't found that to be a problem with the set I bought five years ago.  I did hear that the company has declined in quality in recent years but I can't attest to that.  One nice thing I did find was the each brand offers different colors so for some colors I preferred the Prismacolor and for others I preferred the Faber Castell.  I think I'll be going through a steep learning curve learning how to color and blend with these pencils as they are much more difficult to use then wax based pencils but they do offer a gorgeous brilliant color like oil paintings that you just can't get from a wax based pencil. So I definitely think I'll be needing to take an online class to learn more about how to use these as I was really struggling with getting the color to move around. In the end, I'm happy I made the investment, and like all art supplies, I plan to take advantage of the "pros" and work around the "cons" and figure out best how to take advantage of the special properties of these pencils and just enjoy having fun learning how to use them.  I do know from the reviews I've read that this brand seems to offer the very best water color pencils on the market (which are much easier to use) so in hindsight I wished I had invested in the water color set instead, but one day I hope to buy one of those as well.  I have tried the Prismacolor, Derwent and Inktense water color pencils and found that the Inktense were the best, Derwent second best and Prismacolor/can't recommend those at all by comparison.  If you've never used these before, I recommend buying the smallest set first to see if you like it and then if you do, invest in the biggest set you can afford or desire to own.  Wish I had done this before buying this set.	1
Nice set of colored pencils. They work well with the Faber-Castell watercolor pencils. The nice thing about these pencils is they are oil based, so no waxy build-up. The cores are bonded to the casings, which is a real plus compared to the prismacolor pencils, which have deteriorated in quality in the lat decade.	1
These pencils were great, however the range of colors were not. I draw face portraits and was hoping to find skin tones in this. There wasn't even one color close! So I have to individually purchase skin tones, ugh! My prismacolor set of 48 had some at least! the quality of these pencils were very well. The white was not very opaque compared to prismacolor. Overall, I find that I have to use prismacolor still with my faber-castell pencils to achieve a perfect drawing. I can't decide which I like more.	1
Cool	1
I never used watercolor pencils before. These are great, they are just like using a pencil until you wet them & they act like watercolors! The colors are brilliant on Strathmore paper. A good variety of colors to start with.	1
I am using the pencils for color on fabric for embroidery quilting. Works great!	1
The best watercolour pencils on the market. Colour is so vibrant. Smooth transpositions between colors when blending . My new favourite pencils to use. Do your self a favour and buy the best your artwork really shows the difference when using quality materials. These were so good this was my second purchase as my daughter stole the last set.	1
very pleased, one pencil was missing from the set. but other that that they are perfect pencils for art work.	1
Wow these are amazing pencils. They lay down beautifully.  If you're debating getting these over the prismacolors, might I recommend getting both.  The prismacolors are more creamy, but these pencils give excellent coverage,and a great color.  I use them together with the prismas	1
Love them! They are more expensive than Prismacolors, but they don't break like Prismacolors, and they sharpen beautifully. Not one lead was broken when they arrived (a set of 60), whereas in the smaller set of 24 Prismas that I bought, several arrived broken. I'm glad that I chose to buy a smallest of these instead of a larger set of Prismas. Look on YouTube, there is a video by an artist comparing the two brands and it helped me to decide to go with these.	1
Use these all the time but am waiting on the oil pencils to arrive, thanks.	1
I was worried if this set could replace my ancient set Berol Prismacolor oil pencils. The set works great. I love the vivid colors and the way the color lays on the page. I recommend this set, but I still miss mt Berols.	1
Soft smooth laydown with good even coverage of pigment.  I finally learned what the term "buttery" meant.  Though soft, these  are slightly harder than Prismacolor Premiers giving a little more control.  The difference is so slight though that the biggest differences are less breakage and easier sharpening.  The FC Polchromos pencils are oil based vs waxed base such as Prismacolors.  I find I am preferring oil based pencils because I have a more difficult time working very slowly and consistently lightly so Prismas are a bit too fragile for me and I reach a waxy buildup finish much quicker than I do with the Faber Castell.  It is easier for me to layer and blend with the oil based Castells.  These have become my "babies"	1
Can't say enough about these pencils. They are fantastic!	1
Very nice watercolor pencils, incredible color strength. Makes you want the biggest set they make!	1
Lovely to work with!	1
Smooth, vibrant colors, and easy to use. Love Derwent Watercolor Pencils.	1
i cant wait to use these	1
Beautiful pencils, amazing colors, i was so happy that i just wanted to not use it for a while and stare at the box. There aren't any polychromos in Lebanon (the middle east) but i had the chance of buying them online and found a way to ship them to me  really satisfied with the polychromos	1
I have used Prisma pencils forever and it nice to use some thing different. I do like the smoothness these pencils put down.	1
Love these watercolor pencils.  I have much more control using them, and I love the fact that the colors can be layered and that you can wet the tip with your brush to get more intense color.  Derwent has always been a name you can trust in artist supplies, and these watercolor pencils are no exception.  There are many YouTube videos that will show you how to use them.  I especially like the Frugal Crafter's videos.  She is an artist after my own heart.  No, I am not getting paid to say this!  Just want to pass along the info should you not be sure you would like using watercolor pencils.	1
Quality pencils.	1
Nice variety and good quality. Much better price than any of the art stores I have been to. Nice to have it shipped to the door without going out into crazy traffic to find at overpriced art stores.	1
Very surprised how quickly this came to Israel! Perfect condition and arrived at the earliest date specified. I purchased from buy4lessUK. The pencils themselves are great, beautiful colors and everything you need as far as colors go. I would only suggest you buy a separate set of specific skin tones because the polychromos colors aren't great for portraits. They are very different from my Prismas in terms of laydown,  you need to layer more to get the same intensity. But they are more sturdy better quality by a long shot and they actually sharpen beautifully. Well worth getting used to a different feeling in my opinion.	1
Awesome set	1
Perfect for my projects..I do suggezt the water brushes.	1
Work well.	1
The paper you use makes a huge difference.  I initially used this on regular cardstock and the colors were very muted and blending was horrible and nearly non-existent.  I then tried it on higher quality cardstock (Spectrum Noir) paper and the colors were more vibrant - but no where near what I saw on Derwent's videos.  I started to wonder if some of the videos were faked or that maybe another product was used for the demonstrations.  Then I tried it on Strathmore watercolor paper and all I can say is - wow!  The colors were 2-3 times brighter and just popped.  The blending was great.  Since these are color-fast and fade-resistant, my masterpieces will last.  One YouTube reviewer said he exposed his painting to sun for 6 months and noticed no fading, while other cheaper brands had fading.  I use these to make cards with.  I stamp images and then color them and needed something with vibrant colors that blended well.  I didn't want to use my kid's college education on Copic markers that eventually dried out.  With the watercolor, it gives me the color saturation and blending that is similar to Copic markers.  The only reason why I didn't start using these on watercolor paper was because my watercolor papers tended to be an off-white color.  Once you put the finished painting on white cardstock to make the cards, it didn't quite match.  I have found out that getting a truly white paper will be nearly impossible, however, since the chemicals used to bleach the paper actual degrades the paper and reduces/eliminates their archival properties.  I am hooked.  Once my skills improve, I might even venture into painting my own watercolor masterpieces.  Below are some examples of the results you can get with stamps and Inktense.  The flowers were done on Spectrum Noir paper and the little girls were done on watercolor paper.  I would not recommend getting anything bigger than the 24 pencil set unless you are a real artist and can really differentiate between the very slight color tones in the big set.  Since these are watercolors, you can use more or less ink with more or less water to get 2-3 shade out of one pencil.  You can also blend colors to get more colors.	1
Got these for my girlfriend.	1
Beautiful colors, fast shipping	1
Love these.	1
Fast shipping great price!	1
Love Derwent products.	1
Great value, excellent quality.	1
I love working with the watercolor pencils. I also work with watercolors, but if I want to work small or not feeling like making a mess I use these.	1
Amazing color. Vibrant. Easy to use!	1
Good quality pencils. Grab a wet brush and swipe the tip of the pencil for finer detail.	1
Love the look of these on images I stamp	1
Not the best out there but I highly recommend if you're just starting with watercolors. It's good for practice.	1
I wanted to leave behind crayola and Prismacolor and soooo happy I went with Derwent! Only regret.... I didn't buy the bigger set! I will never go back to Prismacolor again. These are smooth, easy to control, blend, and absolutely stunning product.	1
Nice pencils, great colors. Like to sometimes blend outlines. Perfect for that. Color names might be unfamiliar but they match mostly all of the regular watercolors.	1
What can I say , I love them	1
Derwent's colors are highly pigmented and go on smoothly. When you add water, they become even richer and they're a joy to work with. My only complaint is that I use them for painting dolls and sometimes they don't hold a point well( a sharp point is imperative to making nice eyelashes) This can be a bit frustrating. Still, very good pencils(though I think I prefer Prismacolor honestly)	1
These pencils are just wonderful. Being new to the WC world, I was looking ease of use, diverse color selection, excellent quality and a reasonable price. These fit all my expectations.  I am rather stunned at just what I'm able to produce with these!  Really fun, and if you can get this large set, go for it.	1
These are the first watercolor pencils I've ever used, so I don't have anything to compare them to.  But they performed very well, and I couldn't be happier with them. Adding water made the colors even richer. My only gripe is with the tin they came in. It  doesn't stay closed and I've had pencils spill out of the case into my bag. 2 pieces of tape keeps it shut, but I wish it stayed closed on it's own.	1
Derwent has very good watercolor pencils. I've tried a variety since I use them for repainting dolls. These give good pigment but are sometimes difficult on the dolls. I was a little shocked by that since it's the brand most repaint artists favor. I go back and forth between these and my Faber and Castle for good color. I've just received some of their inktense and some Prismacolors though and I'll be trying them out today. I'll be sure to review those as soon as I know how they are in comparison to these.	1
Nice pencils pretty colors, sharpens great.  Worth the money.	1
Derwent has a good name for watercolor pencils of all kinds.  These are light, traditional colors of watercolor. They blend really easily.  If you want a really bold look, get the Inktense watercolor pencils also by Derwent.	1
Great blendability, goes on smooth, just enough pigment for easy coloring.  Would recommend them as a good buy,  I use them with a dove blender pen and get great results.	1
I am new to watercolor and I am very happy with these pencils and the quality. I purchased an off brand, tried them once and took them right back. It is true, you get what you pay for. These are great quality and the price is so reasonable.	1
The product arrived in good condition. I think Derwent could have done a better job with the plastic holders which it's too thin and feels cheap and must be handles carefully or you may put your pencils at risk.	1
I have nearly all of the pencils Derwent has to offer.  I have their complete sets of Watercolors, Inktense, Graphitint, Graphitone, Tinted Charcoal and Pastels.  All of their products have been quality made at an affordable price.  I rarely have had a problem with breakage and the colors are smooth and consistent.  I would recommend these watercolor pencils to any artist.	1
I am a budding artist in drawing and painting, although I've had my fair share of fun with digital artworks. I found these very easy to use and deep colors when painted. You can wet the tip with a paintbrush and come out with much deeper, but thicker, lines. Another technique I began to use for lighter paintings parts is to draw a bunch of lines where I wanted the watercolor to go and stroke over them until it blends into a blush or off white plus color. I am a connoisseur and collector so I feel I have to be gentle with these, even though they are very sturdy. But that's just how I feel about really decent products.  All of this: with the ease of use, tricks and tips I read here, deep colors, sturdy pencils, ease of sharpening, I feel this is why I gave them a 5 star rating. I have even used prisma colors though not their colored pencils, and I find these better than either prisma colors or cretacolor.  It was way worth the money and I am happy to use these even though I'm freshmeat.	1
I use watercolor pencils a lot for my backgrounds in my art journal entries and I love the Derwent pencils...all of them.  These come in fun colors and the color stands out nicely on my pages.	1
they are not the best color that i have but do it the job the colors are brigthley, are bold. the metal case don't close well	1
learning to do W C pencil and regular  colored pencil. these seem to be an upgrade over many other manufactures	1
I finally could afford the full set.  Have used them on two pieces of art so far and am extremely happy with them	1
These are a nice set of watercolor pencils.  I thought the color would be a bit more intense, but that's ok.	1
Lots of great reviews for Derwent. Well deserved for most reasons.........BUT.......if you are a fan of rich, vibrant, translucent color, these aren't the ones........Like mellow, opaque, or more sombre shades?...... use these. Otherwise die hard Derwent fans, use their Aquarelle Sticks, which for some reason are slightly more rich and seem more saturating.....I've had some very sunny results with them....or definitely, Inktense, if you are fast and loose. Inktense are beautiful, bold, rich color.........They also dry faster than greased lightening....Amazing results if you are free and loose. Slower and you'll be left out in the rain, like me......See the independent comparison demos on Youtube.....Devotedly, I still bought a 36pc set..... Sad. Derwent is one of the oldest and most respected companies in the business.....And loyal Brit's paint some lovely, gentle work with these pencils......Among the devotees, my earliest teacher.....I'm not saying the quality isn't good.......These colors just don't have Zing and definitely do not sing on the paper for me. I use Caran d'Ache Supraclor for everything now.	-1
There are any number of books available with titles like "Watercolor Made Simple" purporting to teach the aspiring painter how to master this art in a few simple lessons or a few short weeks. These claims often collide with reality as the aspiring student comes to realize that only through much practice can techniques like wet on wet, drop in, or double loading one's brush become something attractive and useful. The two problems with watercolor are, of course, the water and the brush. For the beginner, the water seems to have a mind of its own. It goes where it pleases, which is often not where the aspiring artist wishes. The brush does not help matters, sensitive as it is to the amount water, the ratio or water to pigment, and countless other factors.  Watercolor pencils overcome many of these problems, and Derwent makes some of the best watercolor pencils around. Naturally, brushes and water are still involved in the process, but the are put off until later in the proceedings. Now, the user can have precise control over where and how much color is applied. Indeed, the user has the option of applying no water at all, using these as colored pencils for portions of the work. Or the user can use them directly with the brush, treating the pencil as a watercolor "pot." All of this flexibility makes this a marvelous medium to work with.  For those coming over from colored pencil, these pencils do not have a rich, buttery feel one gets from Prismacolor. Instead, they are a bit on the chalky side and throw off considerably more dust than their non-watercolor cousins. Still, used dry, the color intensity is comparable to Derwent's Studio line, meaning they are perfectly functional as colored pencils.  They shine with the application of water--producing intense, translucent color. They can be used to produce a pure watercolor effect or as part of layering process along with regular colored pencils to produce something more like an oil painting. Used this way, the watercolor pencils play the role of providing base layers, which are then hydrated up to the point where finishing layers and burnishing are applied using conventional colored pencils. Gary Greene, a prominent colored pencil author, is a fan of this technique.  These pencils are also a great companion with conventional watercolors as well. One technique I use is to rely on the watercolors for washes over large areas where control is not an issue and the premium is on smooth layering or gradation. I then turn to the watercolor pencils for more detailed areas where precise control is at a premium. The result are watercolor works vastly better than anything I could produce with paints alone.  By way of (unfair) comparison, I've also used Faber-Castell's scholar line of watercolor pencils. The Derwents produced much more saturated color and fewer visible particles of pigment in a wash. The comparison is unfair because this is Derwent's artist line. On the other hand, it is vastly cheaper than Faber's artist line for the same product.	1
I am sorry that I only bought a box of 12! The quality is excellent and the colours fabulous, I use them to draw the theme of my painting which I then paint with oils. I highly recommend this product!	1
this item has got great colors.....gives you a easy way to express yourself on paper.....gives you more freedom and range to show what you are trying to achieve	1
I found that using the pencils instead of inks with water color works alot easier and the colors are nice.	1
Derwent products are always reliable for their performance. Vivid colors and easy to use. Great for adding special details in illustrations and other art projects.	1
If you are going to start with watercolor pencils this is a good option. Colors are very good and the price is affordable. I will definitely recommend this pencils to beginners or pros.	1
works good once you sharpen it a little bit	1
not used it a lot yet but I got it real sharp it works good	1
Faithfully stay away from these tools.  The bevel is cut at a 45 deg angle.  The inner groove is very shallow.  On the plus side the metal is soft enough that it can be reshaped.  This also means your going to spend a lot of time sharpening this.  Save your $10 for something you can use.	-1
Well made and I like it !	1
Took quite awhile to receive,..(over 4 weeks)....but had come from somewhere in the UK,...and most anything sent from there seems to take weeks/a month,....so I didn't hit the panic button.  about the time I got around to inquiring about it,....it had come like the same day or the one after.  I haven't yet had the right project to apply it to,...but it's a beautiful tool.	1
We bought the "Xyron 900 9 Inch Creative Station" after falling in love with our much smaller&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Xyron-XRN250-CFT-Create-a-Sticker-Sticker-Maker-with-Permanent-Adhesive-Cartridge/dp/B000E147WW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Xyron XRN250-CFT Create-a-Sticker Sticker Maker with Permanent-Adhesive Cartridge</a>.  We are "craft" people and always have projects going for our business or kid's school work that require stickers. This clever device turns almost any flat object that can fit into the machine into stickers. The 9" wide working area really expanded the range of items we could use in the machine.  In addition to making almost anything into stickers, you can also use it laminate or make magnets.  This is a really cool tool that works much better than expected! Well worth the price!  Highly Recommended!  CFH	1
I look at the price now and can't believe I spent that much on it.  However, it was money well spent.  I use this product to preserve my children's artwork and schoolwork, any letters they write me and newspaper clippings.  I have not tried the sticker cartridge or the magnet cartridge, just the laminating cartridge.  It does the job beautifully, and I'm glad I have the option of using it to make so many other things with just a quick change of the cartridge.  The Xyron 900 is easy to use.  Just place the paper and turn the handle.  There is a cutter on the other side to cut the laminated product to size.  It is a removable cutter, so I can take it out and use it for other purposes, as well, or even to cut the sides of the laminate piece off.  This is a terrific way to preserve memories.  I'm glad I bought it.	1
If I could, I would change my rating to 3 stars instead of 5. I've owned this item for over three years now.  Pros: The variety of things you can do with this machine are amazing.  Make magnets, make stickers, and laminate with no heat! Simple design means no batteries, no need to plug in, just grab it and go.  This has been great for craft projects with kids, scrapbooking, and protecting keepsakes. As long as you are working with flat, smooth items, it works consistently well.  Cons; Cartridges are expensive, so use a coupon when possible. Fabric appliques didn't work, in that fabric items didn't stick well, and the thickness of the fabric caused material to wrinkle.  The magnet cartridge laminates the front of the item, and puts sticky thin magnetic material on the back of the item as it goes through the roller.  When making magnets, I found the magnetic material too thin- and sometimes because it is so thin, it isn't powerful enough to hold things up.  It also is so thin it makes it very difficult to get the magnet off a surface if you have made a sticker out of something thin (like a photo.) Don't try to make a magnet out of anything too thick though, or it will wrinkle the laminate on the front and be ruined.  I have been able to remove the front laminate, but it took parts of the project with it because it is very sticky.  It claims you can trim magnets right up to the edge, but I have found this is not a good idea with slightly thicker items (like about the thickness of a credit card without the numbers on it.)  The slight "height" of the item creates a small gap between where the laminate and magnetic material come together around the outside of the object.  2-sided laminate cartridge; good as long as you are laminating flat, smooth objects.  Watch out if you get a bad cartridge, or try to laminate something a little thick or uneven.  It will form wrinkles as it laminates, and that will ruin your project permanently.  It's impossible to get the laminate apart unless there are air pockets.  We used it to laminate autumn leaves we collected as souvenirs from a trip to Vermont. The stems of the leaves proved to be "too thick" and caused the laminate to wrinkle.  We tried laminating fresh flower petals to preserve their color, and won't ever try it again! Next time we will use dried, pressed flower petals.  The fresh flower petals are too "thick" and get scraped off or moved around by the cartridge frame that nearly comes in contact with the item being laminated.  Flower petals we did manage to laminate had small air pockets around them and began to rot within a week, turning brown and moldy inside the laminate. We even tried laminating the fresh flower petals between two pieces of clear protective sheets, only to have the air pockets again, which allow petals to move around, and again, rot.  Haven't tried the temporary adhesive cartridge.	1
I use this all the time! I wish I had a half size of this too because I do sometimes feel like I'm wasting the sticker paper. I find myself saving things up so I can use as much of the space as possible. It is made of plastic, but it's not flimsy and no pieces have broken off. I also like the cutter in the back  - just make sure you get your sticker all the way out first! I've cut my sticker a little short a couple times :-p I also have the laminate refill and that works really nicely too! I have laminated all kinds of things and I think it's just as good as a heat laminator. I would buy this again.	1
Don't know why I did not buy one of these years ago.  It is wonderful.  Easy to load and operate.	1
This is going to make alot of scrapbooking things easier.	1
I bought this for my Erin Condren life & teacher planners. I had a bunch of stuff to stick to my teacher planner but buying those clips became costly. I absolutely love this machine. You pop a cartridge in, make sure it's ready to come out so it doesn't get stuck, and feed your paper through it. Crank the handle until it comes out. It has a handy little cutter that cuts the sticker off the roll and it's removable to cut paper! I'm pretty sure a 10 year old could do this.  I wish I knew about it sooner because I could've used it in my classroom! It easily replaces glue sticks which can be annoying. I cannot wait to play with this during the summer for lesson planning and scrapbooking in my smash book.  And I haven't even used the lamination cartridge! Many possibilities for quick laminating!	1
Love	1
Absolutely wonderful, use on a regular basis and works perfect.	1
I absolutely love this!!!! I have been having so much fun with it!!! I also love that it is so versatile. You can use different cartridges with it. So, so, so glad I purchased this. it is easy and quick to make stickers and has saved me a lot of time. I have used tweezers to place small items inside the sticker paper. You can't go wrong with this. I highly recommend this machine.	1
never could figure out how to use this machine.  sent it back	-1
This simple almost toy like piece of equipment has added a lot to what I can do with my art work. Great for homemade cards and the like.	1
I love all Xyron products, use them all the time.	1
Works well and easy to use for all my Scrapbooking projects.	1
The seller was good but the product was lacking function I believed (from it's advertisement,) it had., It does not laminate the stickers.	1
I'm not really good with arts and crafts, but a friend suggested this machine since I wanted to try. It works great!  I purchased the adhesive, laminate and magnetic rolls and my favorite is the adhesive one. It basically turns any item (picture, wrapping paper) into a sticker. Not really a fan of the magnetic roll but only because it seems to wrinkly easily and it can ruin whatever you try to turn int a magnet if it ends up wrinkling, but this is probably due to user error LOL	1
I recently got this for the children's class projects, guess I should have waited a while since I paid $58.14 and shortly after it was reduced to $46.68, I guess the plus is this one can laminate (cartridge to be purchased separately), it can also create magnet projects (cartridge to be purchase separately). Nevertheless the children love it and that's purpose fulfilled.	1
I  own 2 other smaller Xyron adhesive tools and really like them a lot. I use the smaller ones for single or very small paper pieces I need adhesive applied to for my card making or scrap pages but sometimes you need a larger adhesive tool for those really big and delicate paper die cuts created by the digital die cutters like Cricut. This machine is great for that. It comes with the re-prepositional cartridge which works great for scrapping and card making but you can also order permanent adhesive cartridges AND even a magnetic cartridge material. Really a versatile way to get glue on your paper pieces!!	1
We have had so much fun with this handy little machine!  I just made some cute signs to put out in my garden asking our neighbors for kitchen scraps for our compost pile.  We now laminate magazine clippings we want to save and anything else we can think of.  I will definitely purchase a new one if this one ever wears out.	1
I got my Creative Station and starting using it right away.  It does quite a few things using the different refills.  With the permanent adhesive I made note cards using colorful napkins.  With the laminate/magnet I made refrigerator magnets with help from my Cricut.  I can see this becoming an important part of my crafting experience.	1
this is great for most any project because of the width however if your working with small pieces a smaller version would be more economical. This one has different cartridges available for purchase including one that does magnetic backing which I look forward to using. the cartridges run $30-$40 so they aren't very cheap but you can change them out without having to use the whole roll. would work very well for making magnetic pictures and stickers. there is also a double laminate cartridge available.	1
I've been looking at this product for a little while now, I like the concept of making your own stickers or magnets, I thought it was a bit pricey but didn't want to settle on a smaller version. I received a gift certificate and decided my portion of the ballance would be considerately smaller, so I went for it. It's awesome! Me and my granddaughter have a lot of fun w/it. So easy to use, no electricity needed, and no hot parts to hurt little ones. It came super quick, however, a resident at same address did not accept it and it was sent back!? "(  After, i just paid that money,,,i called Amazon and explained and they could not of been nicer! They sent it back no charge and it got here the NEXT day!!! Fast shipping and it was shipped twice!! Thats why I love to shop Amazon. This station is a nice little tool if you like to craft w/your kids or grandkids, or just organize clutter, preserve photo's or certifacates,,,so much you can do w/this you can't really go wrong! OH, its durable, also, we dropped it like twice already and it stood up to the pounding a 2yr old can deliver.	1
This worked great the first time I used it. Somehow the cartridge got messed up and I tried to put it back. There are no instructions, I mean nothing, that tells you how or where to place the end of the roll. I thought you just dropped the cartridge in, but that was wrong. I spent over an hour trying every which way to make it work again. I finally got it, but I have not used it since. A diagram of how the end of the paper is supposed to go would have been most helpful.	-1
In September this year I learned I had lung Cancer I use this for puting patterns to wood for my scroll saw work I make mostly jig saw puzzles from calendar's or my own photos the perm, ones work best & have not peeled from wood yes I would reccomend these	1
A terrific adhesive system. The Xyron systems easily apply adhesive to the entre back of anything; making it a sticker without messy glues. There is no damage to paper caused by wet adhesives. I own the 5- and 9-inch systems and love them both.	1
i bought this as a back up to the one that came with the machine, they work great i love both the machine and the adhesive.	1
I don't know what I'd do without the 5 inch "Sticker Machine."  I finally wore out my first one and purchased another quick.  I've been making stickers for my grandkids for 10 years. I always use the repositionable cartridge for the kids.  I also use the machine for cards and scrapbooking.  The only bad thing about the Create-a-Sticker is the residue that is left on the stickers.  I cut up plastic shopping bags and press them over the stickers, then remove the bag piece slowly and it pulls off most of the residue. Sometimes a little bit of residue needs to be rubbed off but it's not really a big deal. This method is the best I've found.  Amazon has the best price for the Create-a-Sticker and the refill cartridges.	1
I order the refill from amazon and i love them. I make note cards for my family and friends. It the best glue for putting on pictures. Carol R	1
awesome	1
Can't live without it when working on my crafts.	1
Works as expected. I would recommend this to others and purchase it again.	1
Brand new in new box...love it for cardmaking...	1
Great product	1
Worked great for my application	1
I love this machine and refills I make cards and it is perfect for that	1
Love my sticker machine and glad I could find the refills on Amazon.	1
No concerns or isssues	1
This is about the 10th plus time I have reordered this!!  Love making my own stickers!!!	1
very well made love the colors it came with full size rolls of craft tape very worth money spend will last forever and Hint Hint Duck tape rolls fit on it also  made a great addition  to my craft room	1
The cartridge gets stuck and it is almost impossible to fix it. I got two cartridges and both got stuck... no video whatsoever as to how to fix on xyron website or youtube	-1
These are great as are the other Dyson products, very useful.  Only thing, not recyclable.	1
I used this to identify library shelves. it pealed off after a few months, but think that was the shelf materials fault as nothing else sticks on either. The dispenser is very handy.	1
They are what the description says. Work fine	1
Awesome!	1
Easy to use and great for crafts.	1
I love this because it allows me to position an object better.	1
was what I needed.  worked perfect	1
Love this produce make great labels for crafts and other thing you need to stick with out making a mess with sprays.	1
so useful	1
Gift	1
Great products.  Very pleased.	1
Great replacement for Xyron.	1
very useful	1
Execellent service and price.	1
just what I wanted and fits my machine.  I have a hard time finding them elsewhere. Thank you very much.	1
This is good to have on hand for any scrapbooker. I thought I had ordered the permanent refill, but will use this as well.	1
Love, Love, Love me some xyron adhesive for all my paper-crafting needs!!!  So, glad to have found it and been using it all these years!!!	1
My first impression when I opened the box was how beautiful and how heavy the dispenser itself was. Built for durability, this dispenser is constructed of hardwood and could easily last a lifetime (but maybe not the cutter - it's plastic). It weighs in at almost 4.5 lbs empty and has an easily removable "dowel" that is about the size of a rolling pin. On the bottom are 4 anti-skid pads that really grip well to a desk or table-top. The plastic cutting bar looks very much like a saw blade and is held on by 4 small screws.  The colored tape that is included comes in a rainbow of colors: red, pink, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet, natural, and black. They are called Kraft Tape, however they have the quality of masking tape, but just a little thinner. They stick nicely to the plastic cutting bar, and appear to work well on many different surfaces. I know this is designed for a child, but the tape is somewhat difficult to rip off because the cutting bar is not sharp. I think this might cause some frustration, but it could easily be solved by using scissors.  Even though this is designed for children, both my husband and I saw different "adult" uses for it. The bar needs to be sharper, but I think one could come up with some replacement alternatives to make cutting easier. Hubby said he wants one for the workshop to put his duct tape, etc. on and I saw it as great item for kitchen/household use... freezer tape, shipping tape, etc. Then there's the craft room... So don't just consider it for the classroom as it could easily make a nice addition in the home, workshop or office!  Note: This holder can hold up to 12 rolls of 1" wide tape.	1
This is a heavy wooden tape dispenser that came stocked with 10 rolls of colored masking tape. Judging from other reviews, previous problems with the item have been addressed. A heavy, 3-inch wooden roller holds the tape and it slides down into grooves on the side of the base, so there's no way for it to come loose or slip out. The toothed cutting edge is of thick acrylic - it's not sharp, but it is sufficient for the type of tape provided. My kids and I have found endless uses for the tape since receiving it. The unit I received would be durable and safe enough for a classroom or any other situation involving heavy usage from small hands.	1
This is a great selection of eyes!  The only thing that could make it better is if they were peel-n-stick.	1
No preschool is complete without as many eyes as possible :) You never know when you will need more eyes :)	1
Bought these for my daughters arts and craft party. They were a hit! Reasonably priced.	1
great	1
Nice little craft eyes. A great diversity in color, size and eyelash detail. My kids love them. We ordered these after running low on our original black and white googly eyes. They were super excited for the colors of these.	1
It is wonderful exactly what I wanted.	1
great	1
Used these on "robot" favors given out at a party.  They were a hit!!	1
Perfect set of eyes with lots of different styles and sizes. Perfect for our craft kit, always need to have a googley eye or two on hand!	1
Nice variety and good amount.	1
Good variety!  Daughter loves using these in her artwork.	1
very useful in all projects	1
great for art projects	1
I suspect we don't realize just how plentiful a 500 count of wiggle eyes is. It's a LOT of staring. This pack would be perfect for a classroom project or if you have 27 children.	1
I enjoy making little toys for children using poms, and pipe cleaners and these little eyes give the critters their own character!	1
heavy duty and well made.	1
Powerful	1
Really does the job on thick stacks of paper.	1
LOVE this.  - Sturdy  - punches don't fall out when it move or flip the puncher  - handle folds flat to fit back in the box easily to pack away  - works on many pages at once	1
This one is a winner! Heavier and works much better than previous purchases.	1
Met my expectations.  I hope to have it a long time.  Very sturdy.  I was not disappointed.  I have not used it to max capacity.  I wanted clean holes.	1
My son wants to be the next Kinetic King after seeing him on America's Got Talent.  Colored craft sticks were going to be the greatest thing ever.  After many bags of jumbo craft sticks purchased at our local super store with much building success, this box seemed too good to be true...And it is.  They are significantly thinner than the other craft sticks we have so they don't create the tension needed for the kinetic art.  And the color comes off the red sticks onto his hands.  The quest for colored craft sticks continues.	-1
These sticks were just what I needed. I use them for making miniture hand fans at church socials.  With the different colors I can coordinate them with the front of my fans.	1
These sticks were great for my afterschool science program. The kids loved all the colors while building structures with cups, these sticks, and wooden blocks.  About 10 sticks were broken, but didn't bother me considering this is a huge box of popsicle sticks. The quality is great and the kids really enjoyed using them. We didn't glue anything on them so I will be using them again.	1
Mine came in a box, even better than a bag. My kiddos love gluing them in all different shapes. Add some glitter and they are in heaven. They decorated our outdoor spruce tree with them for Christmas, they look nice and are holding up to the weather.	1
Fun, but don't get them wet or let your teething baby chew on them.  The colors bleed, and they're very dark colors!	1
They are as described.	1
I make toys for my hamsters and these sticks, in various sizes are perfect for the work. My hammies will be so happy with new things to play with and chew.	1
These paints are fantastic and a great deal.  We use them in our classroom and they clean up well and we love the vivid colors.	1
Well, it's white tempera paint. What can I say? I am painting sides of bricks white, then adding random designs in colors. This lines a walk of cedar chips through my property. Some painted by grandkids. Fun and colorful.	1
Great quality paints!	1
Good quality	1
The bottle was broken, good thing I had an empty one to save most of the tempera...	-1
Good value.  Bright colors.  My grandsons love them!!	1
Intense colors. Nice paint, Not too runny and no icky noticeable smell. I really like this brand of tempera paint.	1
nice coverage and is very smooth. it also is washable. it hasn't cracked like tempura has a tendency to do which is nice. Update: we have had these about 7 months and they are just like the first day we bought them, holding up well. We still have a ton left and we paint pictures probably every week to every other week. Still very happy.	1
A great lot of paint that my son loves to use regularly.  We have an art room and use these all the time.  The paint did get on the curtains and didn't come off but it comes off everything else (my fault for having left the room with two 3.5 year old boys and some open paint). It doesn't seem to dry out in the bottles as the tops stay on well.  The plastic bottles have dropped from about seven feet and survived intact which is a relief (they live on the top shelf where they are out of reach for the wild children). The colors are true and of enough variety that you can paint anything. They mix well if you want any other colors.  i would buy them again.	1
Worked really well for the kindergarten and 1st graders.  The paint is easy to use with quick cleanup.  I love the way it looks on black paper.  Kids are so artistic.	1
This was easy to use its thick and doesn't run everywhere and it dries in about ten minutes I will order again	1
This was purchased for the Art Masterpiece program newly formed in my son's school. Product worked just as advertised. Thank you so much!	1
I bought this as a present for my 3 year old for Christmas. The paint is great quality, very bright, the right texture, and there is TONS of it for the price. We have used it to paint construction paper, a woven basket, salt dough christmas ornaments, and Christmas present boxes. It dries relatively fast and remains vibrant. Great product!	1
My little boy loves to paint and the little packs of Crayola paint was getting too expensive, so I looked into a cheaper alternative and found Prang 16 ounce bottles. The paint is thick, dries completely and cleans up easily. Great buy!	1
This paint will more then likely last a class of kids for at least a month or two. it will last my granddaughter at least a year. Great quantity, quality and value.	1
I purchased this palette to use with my Genesis heat set oil paints...it works great!  I LOVE that it has a cover and it's small size...I keep it on my work bench to use when I paint my work...my paint stays fresh and does not get dust in it!  It would be great for use in my pochade box as well...as it it is so compact and tiny!  A really great item!!	1
This is cute but I don't use it much. The wells are very very small and the top is loose: needs a rubber gasket around it so it's airtight and won't slip off. I may use it for beads or something other than paint.	1
Just too cute,as a lover of small,this is not only adorable but functional..am using to make color gradations.	1
Nice for very small paint mixing. I like the top as there's more room for mixing.	1
I am disappointed that the cover arrived broken.	-1
Love this little porcelain palette. Both the bottom with the wells and the top can be used, and the small size makes a nice addition to my travel watercolor kit, which is a large cigar box with little travel goodies.  The top cover gives a nice 'big' mixing space. By big, I mean big for travel size kit.	1
A fine product!	1
This is SMALL. Too small to be useful	-1
Wonderful little mixing well.  Esp great for small watercolor cards.  Using this saves so much waste of those expensive Winsor & Newton professional tube watercolor paints.  This is a very heavy little set; not for travel, but perfect for your art desk!  I also use it for mixing watercolors and gouache for calligraphy.  Great value...	1
Very nice quality -  it is very small.  And well suited for travel - or even use at home	1
This tiny palette is exactly what I was hoping for. It's pretty small yet has plenty of room to mix paint (and the lid can be used for additional mixing space) and it can be wiped clean if there's no place to wash it out before packing it up. The lid just sits on it, so any very wet paint needs to be cleaned up if storing it in a case of some kind, but undiluted pigments will be fine.	1
Tiny and adorable. Maybe slightly smaller than an altoids tin. I'm not sure if the lid helps that much because you really can't put more than you can use at any given time in it.	1
I love the quality and the size (mini! just what I need for my small desk) The cover is indeed loose but won't slip unless you touch it. (one less star for how loose it is but it's porcelain not plastic so..maybe it's harder/more expensive to make the perfect lids? don't know) The wells are not too deep or shallow which is what I need for watercolor. Overall, I am satisfied with the quality :)	1
Really fantastic little palette, easy to clean with a Q-tip and some alcohol.	1
Solid. Check size.	1
This cute little thing is tiny.  I imagine I will use it with fountain pen inks that I paint with. Lid can also be used for mixing. See pic with the toothpick on top for scale, I didn't have a coin. Next to it is another more regularly sized Darice 10 well oblong porcelain palette (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004GXBYSO/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).	1
This is a great little porcelain palette, and the cover doubles as a mixing area. (I use only porcelain palettes because they don't stain and the colors look more vivid in them so I know what color I'm mixing better than with plastic). I have the other porcelain palette that is twice as big as this one, and the bigger one is still my favorite as there are more wells and the wells are deeper. This has less wells and they are more shallow, but it makes this better for smaller projects involving ink or gouache and for travel.	1
Not very big but adorable! Works perfect!	1
These are simply the best palettes for my painting purposes.	1
Very cool.  Love the small pans for paint.so there is little left at the end of the project.  .  The lid is excellent for mixing and the extra pans are also a great tool for mixing small amounts and can easily be kept if needed.	1
Using for glazing,mixing, comparisons...is a handy pallet that does not take up much room on my table.	1
Nice little set, especially if you like to mix paint on porcelain.  I bought it for gouache to use in repairing areas of watercolor or batik paintings.	1
Very useful palette, super easy to clean and with a little retarder my acrylic paints last in this for at least 24 hours, more if I store it in the fridge.	1
I cannot stress enough how lovely it is to mix on porcelain vs. plastic (yuck!). The size of this is compact enough, the lid's underside is a wonderful mixing tray and the long well can be a mixing well. It's not too big and not too small and the fact that the lid isn't just clear plastic was a huge selling point. The lid does not lay flush to the pallet along the corners perfectly, but it's a non-issue really. I am waiting for a reason to buy the smaller one because it's so cute. I will note that when I first received the package, it arrived broken, but Amazon was amazing and quickly sent a replacement as soon as I started the claim online.	1
It is glazed in every area. Nice. I use the lid like a butchers tray and the palette for smaller amounts of paint. They actually hold more than you would think, despite their small size. Works really nice for illustrations. For $30, I usually would not buy it. However, you're basically getting 2 palettes, and $15 per porcelain palette is great. It's easy to clean and very cute.	1
I have the mini 12-well version of this palette and like it so much I got this larger version to use at home. I'd give it 5 stars except the lid is noticeably warped; I can still use it to mix but for the price I paid, I was hoping it'd be as nice as the smaller one. Still, it's very useful and a lot of paint can be mixed in the wells. The size is good, too; it's not huge and not tiny.	1
Perfect and cute. Great for watercolor and gouache. I love that the lid is porcelain too!	1
sorry my husband died and I have not done much any where. I received the ruler	1
Fast, accurate, and fun way to do larger size half square triangles . Learned about this from Bonnie Hunters books on scrap quilting. Way better than some other ways of doing it.	1
This is a wonderful template.  It makes my quilting blocks so much more fund to make.  I hope you like it too	1
This ruler is easy to use.  However to get a perfect Half Square Triangle (HST), you still need patchwork and quilting skills like, accurate measurement, accurate cutting and sewing of scant 1/4 inch seam. If you intend to make HSTs that finish at 1.5 inches and below then you should get Easy Angle Ruler (smaller size ruler).  This ruler is Easy Angle II, meant for bigger HSTs, at least 2 inches big.	1
Just what I needed!	1
Easy to use	1
Easy to use	1
As described	1
Great for quilting	1
I have used the easy Angle ruler several times . I find it to be very helpful on those  special quilting projects.	1
Very nice.  Will get a lot of usage.	1
I never seem to have the right ruler on hand !!!  So here's another to add to my every growing pile.  I needed a larger one for some side triangles on a quilt.  This works out great and will replace a lot of smaller ones that I have !!!	1
Very good	1
Nice bag, holds more than you think!	1
Love seeing my stuff! Really nice to carry projects...mine are quilting and sewing.	1
arrived just in time for my quilting retreat - love it	1
Wonderful project bag for a quilter. The handle makes it very easy to carry. Nice size for the block size I normally make.  Joann's had them cheaper but shipping added to the overall cost to make them about the same cost. I have Prime so they shipped without additional cost.	1
At the moment i am doing a lot of quilting projects and  most blocks are between 6 to 12 inches squared so these bags give you plenty of room to store your work and supplies,.  The clear view helps with storing multiple projects in an area like a shelf.  I can look real quick and pick the project that I want to work on that day.  Sometimes you simply have everything you need on a particular day so you just work the project as far as you can.  I was able to pack my last quilt which was a twin with all of the fabric and some spare, pattern, thread and notions on my last 2 week trip.  I worked on my project while away and stored it neatly in my suitcase. Last thought, the handle is great and the materials are sturdy so they can take a bit of wear and tear.  I have brought similar products and broke the zippers very quickly.  This is a good one so i have already ordered more.	1
I love this bag for carrying crochet projects in progress.  The plastic has enough body to stand up, and there's plenty of room, even though it looks like a flat bag.  I can also unzip it in the car, put it on the floor, and crochet right out of the bag.  Very nice.	1
Strong and well made needles.  I like the size of the smaller two needles, but that is just my preference.  I sew leather, so I need the needle to be able to flex a little and not snap when sewing heavier material.  These work well.  I have broken some when really pulling hard, but that is a severe service and I do not fault the needle.	1
They serve their purpose exactly the way they should, haven't had any issues with breaking or bending. No complaints here!	1
As described, sharp ,  curved and useful.	1
These are a very nice set of needles, well made and good quality	1
:)	1
Fabulous for hand sewing in difficult areas.	1
these are great little needles. I have upholstery needles and they are so easy to use that I thought I would try the smaller version. very pleased.	1
Works great	1
I'm new to machine embroidery and took classes at the sewing center I bought the machine at. This is the brand they recommend using. I like the tear away because you don't have the extra bulk or material after you finish the embroidery because it tears away.	1
The first template sent was bent and crumpled, so I sent an email stating that fact when asked to rate the merchant.  A replacement was sent, but it was in worse shape than the first.  I did not send in another complaint, as I figured there was almost as much smooth space on the 2 I had received than would be had on an undamaged sheet, unless I wanted a space larger than 4x4".  I would never order this again.	-1
I love using template plastic to make pattern templates when I will be cutting more than one piece of a pattern. It's great that you can see through the plastic to get alignment just right.	1
this plastic is the perfect consistency for making templates for applique or quilting. easy to cut yet durable enough to trace onto the fabric. very reasonable price. fast shipping, brand new condition.	1
handy	1
Works great.	1
This is the thinner template and it works quite well does bend easily so you need to watch where you store it. I use this quite often	1
Perfect for sewing templates yt? Es	1
Just right for templates..	1
This plastic is a little flimsier than I expected. I bought it because it was recommended by a book about bag making as a way of creating more support in the base of cloth purses. I haven't tried it out yet, but I might look for a heavier weight plastic next time.	1
The template plastic is a nice weight for basic templates.  This price is good unless you have a coupon from sewing store.  Delivery was quick.	1
Although I purchased this item. I don't think it is necessary.  I do believe the templates with the grids on them are the most helpful	1
I did buy both this weight template plastic as well a thick plastic.  It is my preference to stick with the heavier plastic as this is not as easy to work with.	1
could get hotter but works if I work it right	1
This mini iron is perfect for small craft projects.... anything you need an iron for crafting and this is your best option, I think.	1
Useless waste of money. Does not work!!!	-1
Although it did warm up to lukewarm at best, it doesn't generate enough heat to get the wrinkles out of 100% cotton no mater how long it's left plugged in. I tossed it after one use.	-1
The flat ironing surface is small, fits in the palm of my hand. It does get HOT! About the temperature of a curling iron, to venture a guess. So yes, it serves its purpose for flattening paper craft projects, chipboard, watercolor paper, cardstock, etc.. It doesn't stick to the paper, or burn the paper. As always, follow directions and use with care!	1
way smaller than I though and does not get hot enough to do vinyl-the whole reason I bought it.	-1
I teach crafts and sewing so I needed small, easy to transport irons for my students to use. These are very small and are perfect for my needs. The price is low enough I could afford a couple of these. I will probably get a couple of more later.	1
This is the perfect sized iron to use while quilting.  I have a small heat proof mat that I use beside my sewing machine to press seams as I go.  It's much tinier than you would think, so it fits into my boxes of quilting supplies perfectly.	1
Exactly as Described. AAAA++++	1
This product is a nice size for my crafting.	1
Love my little iron... Now I don't have to run downstairs to the laundry room to iron my fabric while in the middle of a project... They even sent it in my favorite color! Completely satisfied.	1
it works well	1
This is so cute and works really good too.	1
looks like a toy  wen I got  so I plugged it in and it never go hot enough to do what I needed in my quilt pieces  so  bought a large one instead  for me waste of money	-1
when I frist got this  I honest thought it was a kid toy , my wife laugh at me and told me no honey its  a real iron ,and after I use it I fell in love with it ,easy to move any where you need it . I will give it 100 stars because its worth it and more	1
Ok pluk dose not fit very well	1
It is what it is....a crafting iron. I like that the cord is long but it does get in the way sometimes but my solution is when i need to use it i unplug the cord from side of iron (easy and fast)  and use it wireless then re-attach cord so it stays hot for when i need it again during a job. i bought a small table top iron board that folds and also has a metal tray for iron that pops out...i leave it on that to heat up..takes a little while but it gets hot...I use it just for  applique or embroidery, creasing shirts to mark my center, iron on stabilizer, flatten creases in fabric i plan to use for an applique etc.	1
very good	1
This was not an Amazon Purchase, it was purchased from some forgotten place. Instructions for use: Plug it in, unplug it, allow to cool, throw it in the trash. If you gave it as a gift and the person told you they loved it, they were being kind.	-1
Great little iron just be sure the plug is in correctly. Thanks	1
Love the small iron, but thought it was three in a package.	1
The only problem I have with this little iron is that the power cord will not stay plugged in, other than that I like it.	1
bought this for my grandchild to use with those melty beads craft  stuff but still needs supervision gets pretty hot but just right fit for smaller hands to menover	1
I bought to use to melt crayons to make neat greeting cards. They came out beautiful and the iron was easy to use and heated fast.	1
Actually have not used it yet but it is what I was looking for.  Small enough to leave out when I am sewing	1
I bought this elsewhere and was so displeased. I spent only $11.00 but even for that I expect a product that actually gets hot. I wanted to buy the mini craft iron but didn't really want to spend $40.00. I travel with sewing projects often and hoped this would work at least marginal. It didn't get hot enough to bond stabilizer to fabric. My granddaughter tried melting crayons to fabric with it and it sort of worked so I left it in her hands feeling it was safe enough because it barely felt hot to the touch. Unless I got a dud and folks who gave rave reviews didn't I wouldn't waste my money. I bought an inexpensive travel iron to tuck in and take along. I wouldn't give this a second try for the price.	-1
Iron does not heat up hot enough to really iron anything! thought it would be a better product and had plan to take it in bag to sewing class	-1
I have no complaints with my little craft iron. Most of the reviewers on here seem like they expected this iron to perform like a household iron that you'd use for daily ironing. This is a CRAFTING IRON ! It's meant to smooth out those minor wrinkles in fabric, hold hems and folds, or stick on your Iron-on patches. It does just that for me at least. I'm able to easily iron out wrinkled creases in my folded pieces of fabric and iron down my folds/hems. I do agree with those who say the placement of the plug is a big awkward. The iron tends to tip over when standing bcuz of the plug throwing it off balance. Overall I'd say this is a great mini iron to have and I bet you can take this with you on travels for light ironing to iron out wrinkles from the suitcase packing. Other than that if you're doing major ironing just stick with your household iron. But if you're just ironing out light wrinkles for quilt squares or what not this iron works fine.	1
I bought this mini iron to use on ribbons for greeting card crafting.  These are the problems I have with it:  -The cord is only 56" long and the enclosed directions forbid the use of an extension cord.  -The directions also state that this product should be used with an ironing board.  One of the reasons I bought this mini iron was to avoid having to set up the ironing board.  I ignored this particular instruction, and used a cloth napkin on a wooden table as my 'ironing board'--a low wooden table, since the iron's cord is so short.  -Even though I let the mini iron heat up for several minutes, it didn't perform efficiently.  My ribbon still had wrinkles after I finished ironing it.  There is no light that goes on when the iron is hot enough, and nothing in the enclosed directions states how long it takes for the iron to heat up to its working temperature.  I would have thought that five minutes should have been more than enough time for this mini iron to reach maximum temperature.  My advice to potential buyers:  don't waste your money on this mini crafting iron.	-1
If you need a template for anything, this works.  Its stable, can be used many times and you can see thru it which is helpful.  I use it for sewing and my husband borrows it for drawing out circles in his workshop.	1
This is a great way to save anything that you made by cutting out paper appliques.  I was able to make 3 quilts of a free pattern I downloaded online.  This saved the pieces nice and sharp to make the third quilt come out as evenly pieced as the first.  Love this product.	1
Perfect	1
Love these template sheets	1
The Collins COL 198 6 Count Non Slip Vinyl Template Sheets were exactly what I hoped to receive.  This is a great product for some of my quilting projects, and I do appreciate having it on hand.	1
Arrived perfectly and on time.  Just what I wanted!  Thank you	1
Very happy with the item and seller	1
These sheets are good for making templates, wished it was a little thicker though. When marking your fabric using these template sheets, watch your edge. It does tend to bend on you. I use a ruler to lay on top of my template to mark my fabric then I cut my fabric. Just saying. My rotary cutter was used to cut my templates and it did fine.	1
Still the fine product it has always been since the company started. Completely satisfied with the performance and durability.	1
Exactly as described and expected.  Quality, thick plastic so your pattern pieces will last.  Half of the sheets are gridded, the other half are blank.  I wasn't sure how I'd feel about the printed grid, but it only took a second to understand how useful and convenient it could be.  It's definitely worth the price, and I will purchase them again.  Highly recommend for anyone that quilts and wants to make sturdy patterns instead of using paper cut outs.  Great product!	1
It's great	1
This is perfect for making patterns instead of using paper.	1
Fast delivery. I used the templates as bumper grids for the misti.	1
I bought this book of quilted pillow patterns from the 1970s.  It actually has thick cardstock template pages in it, but I didn't want to cut the book up.  I remember using something like this product in the past for quilt templates, so I bought this.  It is transparent enough to see the template outlines from my book through the sheets, so I can trace (using a ruler for assistance rather than doing anything freehand) from the book.  I love the grid.  My templates (at least the ones I am using now) don't have the 1/4 inch seam allowance built in, but once I traced the shapes, I could just cut one square's width outside the outlines I made.  Super simple.  This is easy to cut with decent craft scissors, and the other nice thing about it being transparent is that if I am using a fabric with a larger print, I can center the template over a part of the fabric that will look the best (no animals or flowers being cut in half, for example).  I haven't been using the cut pieces for a super long time (plus I am just making pillows, so I don't have to cut that many pieces of fabric) but so far, they are holding up (better than the cardstock from the pattern book would, at any rate).  I would definitely buy these again.	1
Just what I needed! Absolutely love this template!	1
great for making templates for the honeycomb hexagon quilt that I am getting ready to make.	1
Just as described, delivered on time. thank you	1
Great. As advertised. Prompt	1
has many uses	1
I bought these to use with my MISTI Stamping Tool and they work great for creating templates for cardmaking.  Just be sure to draw your design on the side that you will not clean so as not to wipe off the grid.	1
These are great for making templates	1
Good buy	1
These work great for my MISTI (Most Incredible Stamping Tool Invented). I cut them down to all the sizes of cards that I will be making.	1
Best idea on the web! I design a lot of my own quilt designs and these template sheets work wonderfully.	1
I use this as a guide for a stamping item I have.  It works great	1
Just what I wanted.	1
This is nice for my misti and buying it here is fast and wonderful thank you	1
Quality plastic.  Great for making stencils.	1
Nice and thick plastic that is easy to cut and transparent enough to see through. They last a long time.  Another tool for the quilter that uses templates!	1
Nice	1
I use these templates to make shapes for polymer clay. I trace the shapes I like, cut them out, place the shapes on a sheet of clay, then using an Xacto knife, I trace around the shape and voila! I have an interesting and unique shape of clay that I'm able to reproduce whenever I want. I store the shapes in an Altoids tin. Much nicer (and sturdier!) than a piece of paper (which I'd been using when I was starting out in polymer clay). (I tried Shrinky Dinks first, but wow; what a lotta trial and error! Moreover, the clay eats the Shrinky Dink plastic.) The gridded ones come in handy for angular shapes, and the clear ones for free-form shapes. Really glad I found these.	1
These work great	1
I haven't used any of the sheets yet ( so 4 stars)  but I ordered it based upon previous favorable reviews and my desire to save time plus have option to design some creative shapes of my own.	1
I was needing quilting template for a specific quilt I was making and this fit the bill.  I am working on a hand pieced quilt and needed to make my templates a specific size.  I like the sturdiness of the material these templates are made from and am still able to cut them with scissors.  For the price, I wish there where more per package.  Very adaptable, handy for the custom made, pieced quilt.	1
They are perfect for what I wanted	1
Perfect to hang on the wall in my sewing room.  Not expensive like some choices, yet it works well.	1
I bought this item to put in my craft room as a decoration tool. It looks cute and whimsical. Delivery was fast and price was fine. It's only plastic and definitely for show.	1
A++	1
Great little punch's Fast service	1
I do a lot of projects for school.  I was able to find the maple leaf and oak leaf, but this was difficult to find.  It was not available in my local craft stores.  There were several to choose from , on Amazon, but this one was more like what I wanted.  I wanted one that I could use for a hickory.  I am very pleased with the punch (easy to use) and the cut out is very close to the hickory.	1
This is a great product and I use it all the time. Any craft project I need to seal (indoor or out) I use this!	1
Exactly like store bought	1
I used this as an undercoat and an overcoat on my painted rocks--worked great! Goes on white, but dries clear.	1
I used this to refinish some concrete statuary my mother had that had been painted previously and had weathered badly.  I got a good solid black finish for the items she wanted to restore.	1
this was not at all what I expected.  It is a stiff dial that you have to turn manually...but be careful not to turn it too far past the number (sometimes it doesn't even stop on a number).  Not useful at all.  There are times I am knitting and look down to see it has moved to in between 2 numbers.  Horrible product :(	-1
I have used this type of stitch marker for years. It is thin and easy to use. It arrived quickly and well packaged without damage. All stitch markers are relatively expensive for what you get but they are a necessary item for knitters. So I will always keep this type on hand. I do like that they come in different sizes as few do and being thin they pass easily from needle to needle.	1
Works easily for counting and the numbers are large enough to read. This is my second one--I need two for various projects and liked it so I bought another..	1
great, use it all the time	1
These were the least expensive ones that I could find.  I love them for knitting in the round because they're a counter and a round marker too!	1
Perfect as always!	1
These work fine, but will not fit on knitting needles larger than US 11.	1
Love my heart!	1
Perfect if you need crochet hook and knitting needles! Kills two birds with one stone.  Great customer service!	1
Did not work, too cheap to do anything with it or even send it back.	-1
I got it for a friend and she loved it	1
Now I have to learn how to use it :)	1
It was what I expected to be but wish it had more for that price. Love it though.	1
Great item for any traveling crafter. Put on a chain... can wear on a plane!	1
Like the fact that I could put this on my crochet hook if necessary for counting.	1
Do not like these, and ended up putting them in the trash. There is no opening in order to put it through the yarn to mark the spot. Maybe I was using them wrong. Won't buy these again.	-1
Serves their purpose!	1
Great!	1
fantastic	1
This bleeds through many types of paper and I need ink that doesn't bleed. I am not going to buy Color box "Chalk" ever again. :(	-1
It is nice that it is a round marker and a row counter all in one.  Now if only I could actually remember to click it with each round.	1
my 10 year old daughter has taken up knitting, and I have been hesitant about letting her carry around a pair of scissors, so this little gadget is a great alternative because it's almost impossible to cut anything else, other than thread, with it.  We put a string on this and she wear it around her neck, proudly.	1
Ok	1
The blades do not cut the threads.	-1
Don't get this	-1
It is a wonderful idea in theory and I imagine perfect for sewing machines but for yarn, no so much.  I had to keep hacking at the yarn which frayed the edge.  Binding off was harder, since I had a hard time putting the end in the darning needle. But for thread it is great.  Also great for removing those plastic things that hold on price tags	-1
The idea is good, but the production is too fragile.  The stem snapped off from the counter before I finished the first project.  I'm back to the old fashioned design.	-1
Cheaply mades .	-1
I was thrilled when I first got this - I could use it on any size circular needles. Working in the round, I could treat it just like a stitch marker, and knit right past it.  Unfortunately, it has a design flaw: the stem with the needle loop is attached to an inner cylinder which ought to rotate freely, but it doesn't. It does turn, but very reluctantly. The result is that after I had used it for a few small projects, I had twisted it so often to get the numbers turned upward so I could advance them, the stem began to break away from the counter. It's now just barely hanging on, and I expect the next time I use it, it will snap off.  Another problem is that it absolutely requires two hands to advance it: one to hold the cylinder, and one to twist the end rings. Very awkward.  I'm going to order the Clover green Mini Kacha-Kacha next, so I can hang the counter around my neck and advance it with one hand.	-1
The idea is good however after a few months the plastic ring splits. A metal or rig might be slightly more expensive to manufacture but it would last longer.	-1
Not really "universal"... the loop is jus oversized so it fits on any needle, but because of this, it just continuously falls off of the needle if the needle is smaller than the hole, unless you have something holding it to the needle, which is very annoying!  The counter is really cheap plastic too so the numbers aren't even clearly printed either.	-1
I recieved BLACK row markers and it is way too much trouble to return them. I am not happy as I already had black and although I could always use more, I was thrilled to have the GREEN as shown in the picture. That was why I purchchased them	-1
Just awful.  I was sewing a student how to run a drawstring through a casing and the pin opened up, got stuck in the seam and the seam allowance, and i had to take the stitches out to get it out.  So flimsy they are completely useless in my opinion.	-1
Weak pins. I didn't intend to purchase Singer, after having read the reviews, but somehow I did. :(	-1
I can't believe I'm taking the time to write about something so small, but this is really cheap and misleading. You order 50, to be in misleading sizes. You don't expect an exact count.  But only one (1) of the large, 12 of the medium, and then 38 of the small.  I'm sending it back and understand that Amazon will send a replacement. I'll see what comes. As I now look at the other reviews it looks like I can expect that to be similar.  I expect better from the Singer brand. Obviously their supplier is saving on cost, but this is really poor.  If there isn't a reasonable assortment I'll return the replacement and get a different brand.	-1
These pins are as sturdy as the Dollar Store pins.  They should be priced at 99 cents a package.  That's the way you know what you are getting.	-1
It doesn't work as it says it does. I wish I hadn't bought the large bottle. I got to fix a ripped vinyl recliner...it would not stick.  I had to sew it first then glue and it took forever to dry, not at all like it says it will do.  VERY disappointed. I would return it but I waited past my 30 days to try it out. :(	-1
They are not sable or natural hair anymore. The two I bought were golden Taklon. They will do the job but if it says natural hair then deliver natural hair. Evidently Weber is cheapening them up and changing to synthetic hairs instead. I could have bought the same type brush for less, but thought I was getting the authentic natural hair Bob Ross Liners.	-1
I had the choice of buying these (500 "Swarovski" bicone beads) versus 1500 regular glass bicone beads (FOR HALF THE PRICE)... I really wish I had bought them instead. I'm no jewelry expert as I am just starting out and as such I made my purchase based on the previous reviews. I am not seeing anything outstanding about these beads, they seem pretty normal to me and I am not blown away. Maybe my expectations were too high. All in all I would not recommend this purchase... product is grossly over-priced for what was received.  On a positive note however, the packaging is good and the shipment was received on time...	-1
Not as good as aurora from space beans!!	-1
This clay is not good. Not firm at all and when it starts warming up in your hand and you try to make detail. Good luck, go with a firm clay and save yourself the headache.	-1
The top is loose and slips off easily so it's useless for trying to transport paint to art class. Since so many reviewers comment on how snug the top to their palette is, I think my palette might be defective. Tried to contact VirVentures but they were terrible. A bored customer service rep told me I would be able to submit a query but had no idea when they would respond. I wasn't even able to describe the problem. Straight back to Amazon and received a return authorization.  Will try to get it from another seller.	-1
Bought this machine for my youngest daughter as her "first" sewing machine.  Worked well the first 7 or 8 times she used it.  Since then the tension is erratic, it doesn't feed evenly, it breaks bobbin threads right and left.  After fussing with it for hours on end, and having NOTHING work right on it, I threw it out and let her use my Pfaff until she saved enough to buy herself a new Singer.	-1
Bought this for my girls to learn with.  Sent back. NOT a good beginner machine.	-1
This sewing machine on the bobbin side looked like a bad cardiac arrest. It was not stitching right from the beginning. Could oil it either never had direction come with it. It would cost more to fix it than to buy a Singer and a better model.	-1
It came with thread in it.  I thought I was buying a new sewing machine.	-1
Way too complicated for a beginner! I am returning it.	-1
I HATE this machine!  I've had 3 different sewing machines in my time that I loved and that were user-friendly, but this one is the worst piece of poo I've ever owned.  As other reviewers have commented, it has 2 speeds:  run for your life or couch potato - no in between.  The overall feel to the machine is cheap; the pedal is cheap; and my biggest pet peeve is that the threat constantly comes out of the needle.  I finally called Brother support to see if perhaps my needle tension setting and/or normal stitch thread settings were off.  They said no, but that I should "change the needle" (this machine has been used a total of maybe 7 times.  HUH?).  They also gave me the name and number for a certified Brother repair store.  I phoned them and was told that I need to hold the upper threat while sewing.  Fine, just let me grow a third hand!  Then I was told they'd be happy to fix it for me for only $169.  I told them that I only paid about $80 for it at Walmart, so that was going to be a happening thing.  I'm now trying to find a Pfaff.........	-1
This machine is not worth the money!  I refuse to teach students wanting to learn to sew on it as it and the next model price higher have too many limitations.	-1
I had high hopes for this machine, as it seemed to have every feature I wanted.  However, I could not thread it, no matter how many times I tried.  I have almost 60 years experience using sewing machines, and have never had a problem before.  I even watched instructions videos on youtube, to no avail.  The thread take-up lever seemed to be missing or invisible, and I just could not catch it.  I am returning the machine.	-1
Not even a starter machine.  Kept for a few weeks and then gave it to someone else.  This does not have a drop-in bobbin and I bought this to help my granddaughter to learn to sew.  Awful!	-1
I bought one  after reading the good reviews  well  it was a lemon and returned it for an exchange that one was a lemon as well .so returned it  we get what we pay for how true .  this was quite a few months ago and just recently someone gave me and older brothers sewing machine  it even is made out of metal ,much nicer machine and does so much more  .and it works !!	-1
I love it because it has been my only option price-wise for a long time, and it is better than hand sewing my large projects. For my smaller stuffed animals I just hand sew or they do get "eaten" by the machine. That is why I put 2 instead of 1 star. Because it is better than nothing.  However, I do NOT reccomend this for beginners. I recieved this as a gift when I was a beginner and would have given right up if I wasn't so stubborn. The threading really does have to be precise. There is little to no window for error. If it's not threaded juuuuuuust the right way it will bunch up your fabric, knot/break/oil up your thread,and even suck your fabric down into its writhing belly of cheap oily plastic parts. Always trim your threads really short at the beginnings and endings of seams or they get sucked in to the mess and have your seam ripper ready to redo seams when it skips a stitch. Also, never use cotton thread. A mere speck of lint and you'll have a crafting fiasco.  I do clean it between projects (every 1-7 days)and oil often, but it will still stall for 5 seconds before charging off at breakneck speed when using the foot pedal at even the slightest pressure. (apparantly it was designed to do this?) If you don't mind stopping completely to adjust or take out pins, then it is the perfect match for you. Otherwise, it's an oppurtunity to practice your zen tecniques.  The feed dog is not adjustable, so good luck with thicker, stretchy, or very delicate fabrics and multiple layers.  When I got it, the stitch selector dial was not calibrated right, so the picture on the dial does not match the stitch the machine makes when you turn it to that setting. I always practice on a scrap to make sure it's the stitch I want. Also the needle it came with broke really fast on two layers of fleece. I replaced them with normal strength needles of a different brand and it was fine.  This machine has been both the love of my life and the bane of my existence for 6 or 7 years. Better than nothing, but the bobbin is CRAZY weird, the feed dog only works with select fabrics, the foot pedal does not have adjustable speed and stalls, and mataining it and troubleshooting its various malfunctions is time consuming.	-1
I should have bought the refurbished one for $40.00. This one doesn't deserve my payment. It is slow, dragging, entangles, and overall... poor in performance.	-1
I have to amend my previous 5-star review on this machine.  I jumped the gun thinking that it was going to last me...wrong.  I've had the machine for nearly two years, but do not use it all that regularly.  I completed many projects on it when I first started using it, but in time found that my problems with it started to occur more frequently.  To the defense of the machine, I've put quite a few miles on it with basic repairs and several projects (My guess would be I've done about 75+ things on here from basic pants-hemming to quilts) .  Through most of the projects, I had few problems with the machine itself.  These were the days when it was a five-star machine and I was learning the ropes of sewing.  Now that I'm picking up sewing again, I'm finding this thing to be a complete nightmare.  As I've seen other people mention, the thread tension is a HUGE problem.  I get puckering of the thread on the underside when I used certain threads.  I can sit there and fiddle with the thread tension or the bobbin tension all day and nothing helps.  It seems to happen more frequently with Guterman thread, but not the cheapy Coats and Clark stuff.  Rather disappointing.  I also have a lot of issues with jamming up, and creating huge, tangled messes on the things I'm sewing.  Honestly, these days, my seam ripper is seeing as much action as this machine.  I've been researching the cost to have basic machine servicing and it looks like it might cost close to, if not slightly more than it would be to buy this machine new!  Ugh.  Word of advice...if you're wanting a machine to do a few basic repairs on or small, basic projects from time to time, then this machine should work just fine for you.  If you're looking to sew as more of a hobby or producing things fairly regularly, then you're going to have to put more money into a machine.  I'm already looking for a replacement for this machine, unfortunately.  I'm just tired of fiddling around with it to try to get it to work properly and am hesitant to put money into servicing it if it's not going to fix the problems anyway (based on what I've researched it sounds like it won't).	-1
Used this product for many years now, giving it a 5-star review, however, the last 4 rolls I have used have been very dissapointing in performance. The tape that should go back onto the used reel doubles over and comes out the front of the unit therefore blocking performance of the new, sticky footage. Once you attempt to solve this problem by re-tightening the spindles the refill is hopelessly ruined. 3 out of my last 5 refills have failed in this matter. Too bad because I LOVE the concept of this product.	-1
While I usually love prisma colored pencils for their rich lay down of bright and beautiful colors, the lead in this pencil was off center. The lead broke so many times while sharpening that it was 3/4 of the way through with in a week! I'm beginning to become discouraged with prisma color since they started producing out of Mexico and have started to use polychromos by Faber castell instead. Hopefully they regain some of their quality control and fix this issue.	-1
The color of the real item is dull and dingy. Not at all what the picture looks like. I expected soft pastel colors. Yuck.	-1
Very disappointed. This is one of my most needed pencils and the first time I sharpened it, it cracked down the middle. Was not worth $10. I am so upset I just wasted my money and now my artwork will be behind.	-1
The yarn colors are not as shown in the item photo which shows rainbow as having 5 different colors (including blue), and what I actually received had no blue at all ... and way too much green.  UPDATE:  I looked this yarn up on the yarnspirations web site and found the example photo to not contain any blue.  from now on, before I order yarn, I'm double checking the color example's provided on amazon.  I know it hardly seems fair to rate the actual product by a photo description mistake, but the rating is a reflection of my disappointment in what I received compared to what I thought I was ordering.  if I had been able to see the correct product color photo, I wouldn't have ordered it.  for anyone ordering the "rainbow" yarn from amazon, just know there is no blue in it ... the photo is wrong.  it's just lilac, pink, yellow, and bright green (absolutely no blue!).  I double checked the color photo of the "pretty pastels" with the yarnspirations site and it is the same, so I went ahead and ordered the pretty pastels.  in a "rainbow" i expect a little green. lol  but I'm pretty sure i'll also get the blue, this time, too.	-1
was not aware this was for a single pencil, i returned it	-1
I did not receive the advertised item, FC art grip Aquarelle.  I received a red box of 12 metallic FC pencils.  Many others have received the wrong item also so I don't know why this keeps happening.  I already have the metallic.  Beware!	-1
I gave this one star because this was a bait and switch. The pictures and description clearly show and state "Art Grip 24 Watercolor pencils" but instead I received 8 metallic pencils.	-1
Package said 24 pencils. Only 13 came in package which is very misleading. They are also NOT art grip.	-1
I use Jacquard sheets and I thought I'd try this product but it was not as favorable for me.  I will stick with Jacquard.	-1
If you are trying to order the Quilt In a Day Scallops, Vines and Waves Template (quilting ruler) this is not what you will receive.  Ordering this item only got me what was pictured, which is incorrect and does not match the item or description.  Now I am in the process of having to return something which was not at all the intent of my order.  I alerted Amazon that there was an error on the web page but it has yet to be corrected.  So, buyer beware.	-1
Although I knew the limitations of this product, I couldn't enlarge it enough to see the numbers.  I was going to use this when making dresden plates to round off the top of the piece.  But I won't be able to do so.  The pitch of the curve isn't enough for small pieces.	-1
I am visiting friends and helping the daughter make a patchwork quilt. This is their home machine.  The thread consistently escapes the needle, and there is trouble with the bobbin thread tension. I would not buy this machine.  Plus side: it is quiet and offers a lot of decorative stitches, which we did not try because we can barely get the machine to operate at a basic level.	-1
Okay for a new machine threaded a little outdated.	-1
I bought this as a gift, and when it was opened everything looked great. I should have bought the protection plan because the first time it was used we discovered it had a problem. Of course the return policy had expired by 11 days so I was out of luck. At least Brother does provide a warranty, but now I have to either drive about 2 hours away or pack it up and hope it can be fixed.	-1
Do not waste your money on this product. It can not do the basic job properly. I had to give it away.	-1
I checked everything to use correctly many times but the bottom of the stitch is always a mess! I Googled and I find out that a lot of people has same problem! Check this---"This tension is making me sew angry!" They are talking about this problem. It makes me so disappointed. This is a defected product. I returned it immediately.	-1
I was using this machinefor a few months and it was working okay, then I decided to sew two pieces of fabric together and something on the inside snapped and it was completely broken and useless from that point on. I tried to contact Brother multiple times but they wouldn't do anything and ended up canceling my warranty somehow. I do not recommend this product, go with a Singer instead.	-1
I truly HATE this machine!! This machine is only useful in a very limited manner.  It is suitable for simple mending, barely, and not much else.  If you are looking to learn to sew, this is not a machine as a sewing instructor that I would recommend as it has too many limitations.  The straight stitch options are fixed stitch length as are the zig-zag options.  Realistically, the smaller available settings are useless for the most part, which only leaves about 2 decent stitch choices of straight and zig-zag.  This is a machine that if a student has chosen it, I refuse to teach them on as it is very frustrating to work with.  For a little more money (over $150 on sale and up), there  is so much more to be offered.	-1
Not at all impressed. I have been sewing for 25 ywars. This machine is a peice of crap! Update: Stitches are loose,crappy! Motor isn't as good as my old one.	-1
The machine sews well but its not good for hemming denim jeans	-1
I was excited to get this machine for the price and the high marks from the average customer review. I am no stranger to a sewing machine, but this was the first time I had one of my own. I used it casually and had great success with altering clothing and even creating my own garments. Then, one day about a year later, it refused to pick up the zig zag stitch and tell pension as off. I have never jerked it around or broken a needle, I had never had any notable incident until it just decided to not work properly anymore. I hear it costs a great deal to maintain these machines and it hardly seems worth it. Of course this happens right around the time the warranty expires. I will be purchasing a metal bodied janome next and perhaps become a self taught sewing machine mechanic! Very disappointed.	-1
Not new to sewing, was hopeful this would get me by until I could afford a better machine again.  Seems to need repairs every 2-3 projects.  JAMS easily.  Any bobbin besides the rather pricey brother brand will jam it up.  Sewing 3 layers of fabric instead of 2 jams it, It is also picky about which needles are used.  Flannel jams it up no matter how often it is cleaned.  While I did not expect a wonder machine at a wonder price, I did expect it to last longer than the 3 skirts I was able to make before it turned into a pile of junk.  The warranty is useless as well.	-1
I'm a full-time upholstery seamstress and I normally use an industrial sewing machine but for thinner fabrics and decorative stitching I needed a machine like this one.  Since we rarely do thin fabrics or decorative stitching we decided to get this entry sewing machine to get us by.  I was excited to use it, but the excitement quickly wore off when I realized this machine always has something going wrong with it.  If it's not the bobbin jamming then it's randomly making a loose thread every 2".  It also cannot handle layered fabrics or even medium weight fabrics because it will jam the machine while just trying to start the run.  I spend more time fixing the machine then I actually do sewing a project and on top of that it has a very slow stitching speed.  I gave this machine 4-5 projects before I decided that I just couldn't take it anymore.  If you are a novice seamstress who does not do a lot sewing then it will probably do the job for you, BUT if you want a professional looking project and you don't want to waste your time fixing it all the time then I would not get this machine. I will be getting a higher end sewing machine that I can rely on to get the job done right the first time.  PROS: Price  CONS: Bobbin Jams Frequently Slow stitching speed Cannot handle Layered Fabrics or Thick Fabrics Randomly does loose stitches every 2"	-1
I would highly suggest if you want to buy a decent machine and really get into sewing you should go to a dealership and expect to pay between minimal - $400. You'll get the support you need and the warranty. If you are looking for a quick fix for light mends, this may be the machine for you, but I would not expect it to do large projects with multiple layers. It's not designed for that. The guts are made of plastic not metal, so the weight of the machine will not sustain heavy weight fabrics.	-1
Had the same problems as other reviewers.  Unable to get thread tension right to make a clean stitch.  Constantly having to stop and adjust.. Straight seems are also a problem fabric guide and stitch consistency poor.  Should have paid more attention to reviews but the price was main reason for ordering.  Realized to late to return.  My girlfriends frustration with this machine made her request for a better one justifiable.  We got the brother SE 400 combination embroidery sewing machine.  My girlfriend loves it.	-1
Well, I had the machine for quite a while before I had a chance to set it up and sew. If that had not been the case, this machine would have been returned, but I missed the window.  First off, there were cosmetic blemishes on the machine, even though it looked like it was packaged from the factory still - glitches and tears in the side decals (what you see in the photo as teal green are just stick-on decals).  That aside, I was ready to take a hammer to it!! The manual is a little hard to follow, because they have the same manual for two different models, with no break between English and Spanish. Why this was organized this way, I do not know. It only made it harder to find what you needed.  I'm no expert seamstress, but managed to sew a ton of craft projects on my old Dressmaker my mother-in-law had given me many years ago without a problem. The machine was lost in a move to another city, and I found myself looking for a new one. I'd already tried Singer, and was sick to death of them. That was all my mother used, but the quality has really gone downhill - everything was plastic parts. I have one sitting here now that came back from the repair shop for putting in a new metal gear (to replace the plastic one that snapped on the third sewing project), and they didn't bother to TIME it! It's a long drive, so it just wasn't worth it.  So, I decided to check into Brother machines. It had a lot of good reviews at the time I purchased it. I wanted to get into quilting, and honestly didn't know what I should have been looking for. As I have started to use this machine, I've learned!  This is NOT the one you want to free motion quilt!  First off, I don't have large hands, but the throat area is very small. Very. I hit my knuckles on it so many times, I was wondering if I could use it at all! It is hard to get your hand in there to lift the feet if you have a quilt sandwich in there too.  A pro for it - threading it was very easy, probably the easiest of any machine I've ever used. I also like the needle threader, once I got used to it. Note that it WILL shred some of the rayon threads, but you need to just pull extra out and cut away the fray.  I was disappointed to see how much plastic is in this machine too! Wow. I had just ordered a 100-pack of metal bobbins in the Class 15 size this machine takes. I then found out that you need to use PLASTIC bobbins with this machine, because the bobbin case is all plastic. If you use metal, it could wear the bobbin part out quicker. *sigh*  Who would think that it wouldn't be better to use the metal bobbins?!  Winding bobbins - not great. I have to wind them very slowly, and watch for it skipping a section. In other words, it might do 20 passes fine, then skip going to the bottom, making the bobbin uneven!  I've tried everything from different threads to various pedal speeds, and it does the same thing all the time. You just have to eagle-eye it. Bleah.  You CANNOT lower the feed dogs on this machine. I don't think it says that in the description (it didn't at the time of my purchase, but maybe it was added later). That's a real pain. It uses the little plastic cover. When I quilt, the feed dogs beat against the plastic plate, making a thumping sound that gets annoying really fast. Metal feed dogs hitting the little plastic plate. thumpthumpthumpthumpthumpthumpthumpthumpthumpthumpthumpthumpthumpthumpthumpthumpthumpthumpthumpthump AAUGH!!  The manual also is not super clear about how to get the other stitches. You need to have the larger wheel set on certain things to get to the other decorative stitches. Maybe others are used to that, but I wasn't and had to pick through the Spanish and two-model instructions to find what I needed. The manual is not very helpful, really.  What had me ready to toss it out the window was the bobbin nests on the bottom of my fabrics! I had very large "birds nests", and no matter what I did, what type or weight of thread I used, I had them. You can't adjust the bobbin tension, only the top. The manual tells you to loosen or tighten the top tension wheel if you have bobbin problems. That doesn't work!  If it wasn't for the WONDERFUL hint on the bobbin threading from SBP here on Amazon, I would have given up trying to use it entirely. THANK YOU SBP! You saved my sanity!  The manual is again not clear about that little spring. You can't see it (well, I can't anyway), and I had to go by faith. I took a thread and pulled it back and forth under the tongue until it caught. Think flossing a popcorn kernel out of your molar - fishing around until you feel something catch - that would be it. When threaded right, the bobbin thread will look like it is laying across the top of the bobbin after you have pulled it up with the top thread. I'll post photos later of what it should look like when you are ready to sew. This saved the machine from being tossed into the trash! (Yes, it was that annoying - nothing was working!)  I bought this machine because of my currently-limited budget. However, if there is any way you can afford more, do yourself a favor and get a better model!! This would be good for a first-timer. It does the basics well (as long as you can get the bobbin threaded perfectly!) and offers a large variety of stitches for the price.  Since I wanted it for quilting, this was my mistake for not having a better understanding of what features to look for. If I had more experience, perhaps I would not have had so many problems. Yet some of the issues are strictly related to this model of machine. I don't even think it is Brother - I think it is just this model. And if I had not passed the return window before I opened it, it would have indeed been returned.	-1
BEWARE.  The "whites" of these eyes are BLUE. This is not stated in the advertising.	-1
50 eyes, not 60.  Package arrived late.	-1
I spent a little more money than I wanted to on this product; because I wanted wiggle eyes the kids could easily remove from a large sheet, rather than those tedious single eye stickers you need sharp fingernails to remove. Guess what? Each sheet of those eyes you see- each eye pops out, so you still need to painstakingly remove the sticker backing from each eye to use. It took me a good 1/2 hour to remove them for the kids to use. I would have been better off buying cheap ones from the dollar store.	-1
Not bad	-1
I design, make, and sell jewelry for a living.  Some of the jewelry I make is crocheted, requiring a button to be used as part of the clasp.  I purchased this item thinking I'd have a nice supply of miscellaneous buttons to use for clasps.  Boy, was I wrong.  Most of the buttons I received were filthy.  Many were scratched up and had chips missing from them, showing signs of obvious wear.  I even received several that had BRAND NAMES on them.  If I had used a button with a brand name on it for any of my jewelry pieces, I'd have been putting myself in a position to be sued for copyright infringement, along with other trademark-related crimes.  After sorting through the buttons, my hands were so covered in dust, dirt, and filth from the buttons themselves, I had to scrub them with soap and hot water.  I promptly placed all the buttons back into the bucket and hit up a customer service representative to set up a return.  I was disgusted that Amazon would send out such a disgusting product (as my order WAS through Amazon directly).  Thankfully, the customer service rep handled the situation very well.  I wouldn't recommend wasting your money if you want to actually use these in crafting apparel or jewelry.  Or if you plan on receiving new buttons.  Or clean buttons.  Or anything of even marginal quality.	-1
horrid i shouldve listen to the review feathers came damaged and un usable	-1
This is an affordable clay, but it has a strong smell and can be hard to work with. It's especially messy and you need a lot of water to keep it from sticking to your hands. It makes a good filler clay, however, if you're making large sculptures, and does air dry nicely, but I don't recommend it for finished pieces - only for filling large areas. You also can't bake it or put it over an armature, like other air-dry clays.	-1
Both boxes came heavily damaged and opened. The clay was already dry and I can't use it. I probably just received a bad batch, but it's extremely inconvenient. Next time I'll just go to a craft store.  I'm just surprised I received the package on a Sunday.	-1
This cannot handle any 4" scissor, only an embroidery scissors (like the stork kind) that have a small flat screw.  I need to keep a small scissors that can handle fabric as well as thread.  Pretty, though.	-1
It's pretty, but not very functional.  The manufacturers should help us out by letting us know which scissors fit best. It's too small for most embroidery scissors.  I'm using it, but the scissors only slide in part way, not fully secure.	-1
New order, hoping it cuts we'll! Price was good & hoping the quality is as well. Have no other issues.	-1
Thin and flimsy. Would not purchase again.	-1
She supplied different paper, stating that this is not good paper.  I guess I wasted my money and will let the children use it up.	-1
Really crappy hole punch.	-1
I ordered three of these for a school project. Two of the three were misaligned and catch as you use them. I am waiting for two replacements for the two that don't work. If you order this, please check it out as soon as you receive it to make sure it works.	-1
Poorly made, but then, I guess you get what you pay for.  Dulled after a dozen punches, sometimes wouldn't even punch.  Don't waste even that little bit of money.	-1
Very disappointed  this will not cut a round circle  only cuts part way  however the long reach is exactly what I need	-1
trying to punch through transparent sheets and will not punch a clean cut.  even on paper it does not appear to be sharp enough.  Otherwise comfortable and the 2" reach allows access to areas most other punches will not reach	-1
These punched are cheaply made and the to doesn't stay shut so the punched fall all over the floor	-1
UGH!	-1
UGH!	-1
I have the blue.  It did not come out!  I brushed it, "shouted" it, and even Grandma and her spot remover couldn't get it out.	-1
Not the best, comes off too easy.	-1

broke right away	-1
I am 21 and couldn't get it. NOT FOR CHILDREN	-1
Do NOT buy for a first-time cross stitch! The pattern is printed on fabric, not cross-stitch material, thus the user has to try to create the x's based on printed lines instead of holes. This gives uneven crosses, even for an experienced user and leads to great frustration for a new user. (My 11 yr old neice gave up halfway through the first line. My 12 yr old who has been Cross stitching for 3 years didn't get much farther.)  The design is cute and on colored fabric, so you are only stitching the dolphin. However, because it's so small, the design wouldn't really be recognizable without the printed fabric. Definitely not for a beginner and not worth the effort for a more experienced crafter.	-1
I have wooden knitting needles, that are very nice and smooth to work with.  I was thinking this would be the same, but it is not.  I regret buying it, but not worth the cost of shipping. I could not suggest buying this item.	-1
The corners started peeling up after the first wash. On other ones, I've taken more time and left the iron directly on the patch for a few mins longer then the directions said. They held a little better but not much.  I've started sowing the corners one so they'll stay put but that kind of defeats the purpose of "iron-on".	-1
I really wanted to like this product, but the fact of the matter is these patches don't really stay on your jeans I put them on to cover up some wear and tear on some favorite pairs of jeans and they only lasted one wear before the edges started to curl up I even tried to re-iron the patches but they just didn't hold up. I won't purchase these again.	-1
very poor quality.  I guess you get what you pay for	-1
Cheap thread and the thread is on cardboard - not a roll so it makes it hard to use with sewing machine. The thread is super thin and breaks without much effort.	-1
This punch will not punch card stock. It is so stiff, I could hardly punch a piece of paper, and it moves when you have to lean into it. So stiff that it seems like something is wrong with the tension. A big mistake to order. Waste of money.	-1
I bought this set to add to the variety of colors I have available to me for crafting toys out of felt hand sewn together.  The set doesn't cover the basic colors that you'd need for most projects, but it does have some irregular colors that may come in handy someday.  The thread seems of adequate quality for hand sewing, but the particular selection of colors and amount of thread didn't make it worth it for me.	-1
If i could give it a minus star review I would, do not waste your money on this. Although it's a good idea the quality of the thread is cheap and some bobbins were not threaded properly the thread was bunched up. I will be using the thread for hand sewing clothes for my nieces dolls, so as not to feel guilty for the waste of money.	-1
It is disappointing for the same reasons that other reviewers point out: 1) I could not use this with heavier card stock, so it's less useful. 2) the punched design does not always come out correctly -- parts of the cutouts are missing. I also noticed: There is no bottom to catch the cutouts, so it makes a mess. I resorted to only using it with a piece of paper underneath to catch the scraps, but they get everywhere and it's messy. When it works, the design is nice, so I still give it two stars. But I cannot count on getting the same uniform design on all four corners.	-1
Yes, it is insanely hard to punch anything thicker than copy paper. For me, I place my punch on a relatively low table and stand up to press it. I wish it had a hinge/lever press  to make it easier, I definitely wouldn't mind paying more for them as I really like the lace corner punches.  This isn't worth it if you're looking to punch thicker papers. I attempted to punch stickers and 67lb paper. The dye isn't even sharp! You have to use brute force to punch it. It'd be hecka easier if it dye press edges were sharp.	-1
love the initial punches but having lots of trouble pressing down and getting a clear clean cut on some of them, but will not purchase again	-1
Is very hard, and the cut is not clean, I expected more, because I like this brand	-1
Very hard to use if u have any strength problems I,wld not order again.	-1
This is insanely difficult to punch. I have to put it on my tile floor and put all of my weight into it. What the heck were you thinking, Fiskars?	-1
nice design but extremely hard to press even just on regular printer paper. the blade is not sharp so it's leaving bits behind.	-1
Terrible.  I read the reviews and should have headed the warnings.  This thing is so hard to push down, it's ridiculous.  I don't have any physical limitations, and my arm hurt after just a couple of tries.  I am very disappointed and will not be purchasing any other punches from this brand.	-1
Not a good punch for me.  It's too hard to press and most time I can't get all four corners to punch right.	-1
One of the three corner punches doesn't even work. It punches out half of the corners.	-1
This punch takes super human strength, both hands required to put it down and then no hand left to hold the paper straight. The system is flawed. it only has small bead projections to hold the two sides of the corner so it is easy for the paper to shift, especially since  you need to be standing and use two hands to punch it down. Holding it upside down so  you can see the corner may work for some,  but I found it hard. Was trying to use it on some thin card stock and it was a workout. Bought another corner timer at the same time as this and works like a dream.	-1
I have tried using this Fiskars lace 3-in-1 punch several times and have been disappointed each time.  There is no quality to this thing and the corners do not punch correctly - EVER.  I have tried on perfectly cornered scrap paper thinking that it's "just me" but no matter how I have tried, this stupid thing does not center any of the 3 punches on a corner and quite often the fancy corner is so off that a hole from the corner piece is through an edge.  Horrible.  Don't spend your money on this one.	-1
This is crap. I have tried to give it a really fair trial but at least 50% of the time it wrecks my project so I don't use it. I have other corner punches and they don't do what this one does - which is give an uneven cut or rip the paper. I tried it with 5 different types/thicknesses of paper and it seems to be more down to the bad design. Plus, it's hard to use. Unfortunately, I kept it too long to send it back so I'm stuck with it.	-1
Two stars because the punch is difficult to punchand unless you have it lined up perfectly it doesn't punch as neatly. It should have better guides for the paper to ensure it doesn't slip and is in the right place. When it does punch correctly, the corners are pretty.  I will practice with lots of scraps before I use it on project items.  BTW it will punch light to medium weight cardstock. It is just not easy to use.	-1
Very dull. They didn't cut even thin paper. I really wanted to like these but I just couldn't. I had to return them.	-1
Very hard to punch with. I have had this problem with two fiskars punches. May be that I just don't have the strength needed, but I have ruined two projects trying to make it work with cardstock.	-1
It's ok. You really have to line corners up very carefully or your punches get messed up. About 50% of our corners didn't come out right. After about 10 punches, you hand will be so sore. Way too hard to punch cardstock	-1
Bad	-1
Who would think such a little punch to cut corners would be so difficult and aggravating to use?  If you use paper thicker than copy paper, I hope you have been doing your arm strengthen ing exercises.  You have to push really hard to get it to work, and the paper doesn't always seat properly so the cut is off.  From now on I'll stick to just buying their scissors.	-1
I liked it the first 5 or 6 times I used it, but it only took that long for the blade to go dull and start shredding my circles. I then took the extremely careful, make sure the blade is lined up the same way ... etc. etc. etc. (see "Bulldog's" post ;-D) for another couple projects; and, finally, the blade was more dull than a butter knife.  I'm not going to replace these blades every week at given their cost (depending on the seller anywhere from around $8 - $15).  Sorry Fiskar. You need to go back to drawing board on this one.	-1
Hard to use.	-1
I realize half the reviews for the Fiskars Ultra ShapeXpress were good and half were not.  For the price I thought I would try it.  I watched several videos on line on the correct way to use it.  I am pretty proficient with crafting tools.  I must say I was very disappointed.  It was difficult to keep the cutter close to the inside edge of the Fiskars templates.  It did not handle corners or curves well.  Cutting out the star shapes was almost impossible.  I would not recommend this product.	-1
I tried very hard to like this cutter but what a piece of junk! I tried every trick I could read about online and nothing worked. I was only trying to cut a 4" circle and this cutter with brand new blades just kept tearing up all my paper (plain paper, cardstock, everything). I sent it back immediately. I am still looking for a replacement.	-1
Did not work as presented on website.  Would not recommend.	-1
Ok, this plastic template by itself would be fine. If you intend to use it with the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Fiskars-Ultra-ShapeXpress/dp/B000FPYPTC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Fiskars Ultra ShapeXpress</a>&nbsp;then I hope you are a patient person. I tried just to cut a 4" circle using every kind of paper I had and this system was a joke! The cutter with new blades couldn't cut through anything without tearing it up. I'm still looking for a replacement.	-1
I first saw the eyelet setting tool used on one of the crafting programs on TV and I witnessed the moderator making holes after using the spring action a couple of times. I thought this is just what I've been looking for and I could put away my hammer. However, after using the spring action on the eyelet setting tool 5-6 times and still no holes, I gave up and returned the product.	-1
Only for people empowered with physical strengthy.  Physically impaired people are also very often those who do not have money to waste.  Weak people can not use these and it was a complete waste of money to purchase these.  The people who make manually operated die cutting machines are honest and openly say that those who are physically impaired shoul not buy their manual  equipment  It is a shame that Fiskars do not warn us.  They make it look so easy.  What a disgrace on them.	-1
I was very disappointed in these eyelet setters.  First of all they are rather cumbersome to use.  Secondly, when trying to add small eyelets to cardstock, the eyelets didn't hold.  They came right off the paper.  After several frustrating attempts I had no success and decided to return them.	-1
They do not work as well as I thought they would.	-1
I bought these to punch holes in fabric. Nothing on Amazon said these were not appropriate tools for this use. After six or so holes, I have two tools that are hopelessly twisted out of shape, so the hammer doesn't hit the cutter at all. Useless for fabric.	-1
No matter how hard you iron, these don't stay on.	-1

I have 3 others in my sewing room which are various brands so I know how they should work. This one has a very small weak magnetic inside which will rattle around when you move it. It may hold 10-15 pins if you are lucky. Others will fall off because it is week. Save your money and buy a different brand. Magnetic pin holders are awesome but this one of what I would expect if I got it at the dollar tree.	-1
Pins are all over the place. You have to be very careful when reaching for a pin as you will get stuck. Awful product. I guess you get what you pay for.	-1
Not great. My pins wouldn't stay in the middle of the magnet. They slid to the sides almost falling off. I removed the magnets and made my own pin keeper with a glass plate.	-1
The magnet is very weak, so I can't feel confident that my pins will remain safely on this tray. I should have paid a bit more for a better quality product.	-1
Pins stick but boy is it Page 4 place.  Take 1/2 seam down the side and across the bottom of the bag.  CORNERS:  While bag is inside out, take one corner and match side and bottom seams.  You will have what looks like a triangle.  Stitch 1/4  from seam stitching line.  Do the same for the other corner, but you will not have the side seam to match to.  Lay the bag flat with the corners matching (triangles).  When it is even at the sides, you will have a center seam effect.  Pin in place and take your seam across the corner  1/4"  under the stitching line.  (see diagram)  Turn right side out and you are finished.  YOU MAY  WANT TO SERGE OR ZIGZAG YOUR SIDE AND BOTTOM SEAMS.   .	-1
cheaply made out of thin plastic, but the magnet does work and it serves its purpose.  Don't buy it sorry but dont	-1
The pin cushion does not hold pins or pick them up, it only hold the ones that came with it.	-1
I bought this at Michael's Craft Store, with a 40% off coupon, bringing it down to about $6.00.. and although it may look convenient, if you have ANY sewing skills whatsoever, I would HIGHLY recommend just sewing something by hand instead of spending the money on this handheld sewing machine.  It's not worth the money or the hassle in trying to get it to work.  It's really loud too, and takes 4 AA batteries, which makes it pretty klunky to hold.	-1
I am giving this no stars. I have been trying to get this piece of junk to sew and it does not work. A waste of money & my time. It does not deserve even one star!	-1
I reviewed this years ago, but for some reason, my review was switched to sewing machine needles, so I deleted it.  The content of my original review: "If I could give this zero stars, I would.  Returned this--it NEVER worked.  You are better off buying a basic sewing machine."  This is a piece of garbage.  I would not spend any money on this.  Seriously--if you are looking for something to hem your clothes--invest in a REAL sewing machine--even if it's the basic cheap $50 model (but NOT a toy machine--I tried that, too, and returned it).	-1
Too thin and tangles easily.	-1
I no would recommend it to a friend!	-1
Very fragile but serviceable.	-1
Product I received had solidified.  Never opened it when I received a month ago, when opened it to use nothing would come out of the bottle. Took an icepick and tried to pry out what was at the top of the bottle and it was solid all the way through.  Non returnable......boo hoo	-1
When I was a child, I had an old wooden spool with four nails pounded into the top. I can no longer find it. When I saw this one on Amazon, I thought I would give it another try. When people say that they don't make things the way they used to --- they are referring to this "French Knitter".  The instructions are insufficient --- so after watching three videos on YouTube I finally got it started. As I worked my way around the top of the device, I noticed that the "nails" were bending in toward the middle. The knobs on top of the "spikes" are very prominent and I found them very difficult to work with. I gave up and tossed the whole mess in the trash. I think I'll stick to crochet.	-1
Too big to use with normal needles, not at all what I expected, I returned item, still waiting on credit	-1
It's not much easier than threading a needle but it is pretty.	-1
The roll looked like it didn't have as much elastic on if and sure enough, as we used it there was only about 70 yards on the roll.  The elastic is fine but only if you want half as much as you ordered.	-1
very weak construction. does not hold the cross stitch fabric at all	-1
I found this product the correct size and a nice material.  However, the juncture between the needle and the nylon cord is so rough that stitches won't pass over it easily.  That means that on every row I have to stop and move stitches past that point one by one.  I won't use them again and have already switched back to doublepointed needles for my project.	-1
I did not care for this hoop as it did not keep the fabric taught enough. Also at the end of my project (thankfully) the metal piece came out of the plastic.	-1
Not a big fan of these. I'm using it for Cross Stitching and it doesn't work very well. Would work well on other fabrics.	-1
I should have paid attention to the many persons who said that it ships without the little knob to tighten.  Mine came without the knob and I had to get my husband to buy one.  Disappointing as you expect to receive what you paid for...	-1
Too flimsy and doesn't stay taut.	-1
This embroidery hoop is very flimsy.  I won't recommend it.  I was expecting a more substantial hoop, but this isn't it.	-1
When it comes to a sewing loop, buy wood.  Wood hangs on to the material whereas plastic allows the material to slip through.	-1
THIS SEWING KIT IS SOMEWHAT CHEAP AND I DON'T LIKE CHEAP, INEXPENSIVE YES, CHEAP NO!  INVEST ON SOMETHING THAT WILL SERVE YOU.  DO NOT RECOMEND IT!	-1
Got this for my aspiring fashion designer daughter-shes 8 1/2. Its a lot smaller than I thought and the picture showed purple parts on it, which to me I could care less...but to her it made her sad it arrived in blue because purple is her favorite. Cant figure out how to make this reverse to lock stitches in, it goes through needles like crazy and shes only used it twice and on thin fabric-as in walmart quality thin quarter fabric to learn. I wouldn't buy again sorry to say because yesterday it STOPPED working! She bawled her eyes out and I feel like Ive spent more time and money on this than I should have by now. Ive purchased multiple needles when I feel needles should last more than 3-5minutes.  No explanation- thats annoying. Shes used it twice and its been a headache more than a learning experience and thats disappointing. Id hoped it would last through a few months of uses- not two uses.	-1
not High gloss	-1
This resin is not as good as some of the others that I have used before. I was a bit disappointed that when it was dried the resin was cloudy. And after giving it another shot was a little sticky as though the hardener didn't do its part.	-1
Even with mixing with volume or weight this resin is very finicky. I even got to the point of getting 12ml syringes and measuring out the exact volume of each before mixing and still no luck. Only one time has the resin dried completely (not sticky or anything) even after a month. The other times it worked "okay" is when it dried it was solid- to a point. I was able to make nail prints in the resin. It was soft still and still had that chemical nose burny smell. I won't go with this kind again.	-1
It's everything as it says, except the box shows that it's completely clear and it says it's a crystal clear resin in which you think, "oh, so like crystal/glass"  It's actually still malleable and a bit rubbery after fully curing depending on the thickness of your piece (mine's was 1/2 inch at the thickest). I thought it would be rock solid like the other resins I've used. It's great other than the fact that it dries yellowish (almost a sepia).  This is obvious as one of the bottles is yellow. If you want a truly clear resin, find one in which both parts A and B are non colored and clear.  I would recommend this if you're doing a thin tabletop coat, I would not recommend for crafts.	-1
This is not my first rodeo with resin but this stuff is total crap. NEVER dries! Find something better to waste your money on.	-1
I tried using this multiple times and it would never completely dry. Very disappointed. It ruined everything it touched :(	-1
All of them are too big even after I put them in the microwave	-1
I had an old brush passed down from my grandmother and I loved it so I wanted to buy another one and it's very different. Not the same brush at all. It's still a good brush though	-1
ok	-1
ok	-1
what a joke, this one brush was snapped in half when I got it in the gigantic box it came in.	-1
This brush arrived with a bent ferrule and bristles all askew. I'll return it. I was looking for this brush as part of a materials list for an upcoming workshop. I've painted for many years and know brushes, and while Winsor & Newton is a reputable company, this was overpriced even at the Amazon discount.	-1
The brushes tip is not very pointy when wet, and it is very stiff and doesn't hold much water.	-1
It's ok but not what I thought it would be	-1
These big eye needles had too small of eye holes for me.	-1
Shoddy cheap plastic with a piece of foamd glued into it. Probably worth no more than 2 dollars....not the 12 I paid!	-1
I shouldn't have bought this. I have too many brushes, and even those that fit are crowded and difficult to place and access. Would have been fine if I had all small brushes. Instead I took a similar size box --with nothing inside--and punched holes in the ends so air would dry damp brushes.	-1
The straps suck. Once you have all your supplies loaded in, it doesn't take long for the straps to tear out. I received two of these, one I bought and one I received as a gift. Within the first month of the semester one of the bags was toast. I still have the second bag but the shoulder strap busted on that one too. This semester Im getting another Martin Softside Portfolio. My original is about 15 years old, very durable and stuffed with art. In short, don't buy this. Get something quality. And if you're a student, be sure to look for one thats large enough to hold your drawing board.	-1
I ordered the template set.  What I got was a quilting triangle.  But it was sold through BT Group.  Buyer beware.  If you click the button on Amazon to return it for it being the wrong item... forget it.  It tells you to call customer support.  If I wanted to speak to a human I would have gone to the local store.  I buy on Amazon so that I never have to deal with calling customer support.  I wish there were an option on Amazon to never so me anything from 3rd party vendors.  This is the second time I have bought through a 3rd party on Amazon and had a bad experience.	-1
I bought this exact Dritz tomato pin cushion at a local retailer. It made all of my good pins sticky and blunt. So annoying.	-1
Please do yourself a favor and buy a normal Dritz Tomato pin cushion at JoAnn or a reputable sewing supply store. I received a piece of styrofoam with a thin red fabric around it, 2" in diameter. It came straight from China with a listed value of US$ 0.05 and that's what I would have preferred to pay. Utterly ridiculous.	-1
This was VERY small and does not sit level -- always falling over. Some type of foam filler but very stiff and cheaply made.	-1
Listing should be removed.	-1
No way this is s Dritz pincushion. Barely 1.5" diameter, and the "strawberry" looks more like a decorative hot pepper.	-1
Smaller then it looks	-1
This looks like grandma's tomato, but it is not. It is too small to be useful for anyone doing any amount of sewing. The pins are very hard to push into the tomato. I sew so much I've used up my original tomato and sadly have to go somewhere else for a larger, original version of this pincushion.	-1
I just got back into sewing and thought this would be a great purchase. Its about 3 months after the fact and I just bought another pin holder because this one was so hard to manage. The product is exactly as advertised and fine for the price but it is really useless in my opinion. You would have to use one hand to hold the tomato and the other to put in each individual pin. Its so light that it would slide around all over the place if you tried putting a pin in without holding it. I just bought the Dritz Magnetic Pin Caddy and its so much more amazing. Think about skipping the tomato and getting this one instead. It will save you some frustration.	-1
I don't recommend	-1
Would give no stars if able but can't not was very unhappy with this small tomato I thought it was a joke	-1
My rating is Ho hum. It's a pin cushion. The strawberry contains pumice for supposedly sharpening needles,  but it never worked for me so I pitched it and just kept the tomato pin cushion. For the price it would be a lot cheaper and fun to just make your own.	-1
The tomato is only 1 1/2 x 2 1/2 inches.  Next time I will need to review the reviews.	-1
it's like a ball, even my little kids complained that it's not real pin cushion.  it definitely cant be use as pin cushion, but i'm too lazy to return such tiny things, so gave to my kids to play pretend cooking.	-1
The item I received is less than 1.5 x 1.5 x 2 inches. This item is not nearly big enough for regular use. It can be used for temporary use but it's basically misleading you with the picture.  Not worth the money.	-1
This was just too small and flimsy. I should have read the reviews however I expected the pin cushion I had used in the past (30 years ago?). Not sure about the filling but it resisted pins. It is not a pleasure to use and will be thrown out. (lost receipt)	-1
This is a bit larger than a golf ball, and has a sponge inside. It's more like a cat toy than a real pin cushion. I remember (and expected) a big, solid and substantial pin cushion like in the Old Days. If they can send a rover to Mars, why can't they make a pin cushion like they used to make them? With everything, these days, being made cheaper and flimsier, wouldn't you think that a simple, old standby, like a darn pin cushion could still be like my Mom's? The heart can only hope, but The Man will crush our fondest dreams.	-1
Well I was expecting the standard size pin cushion with strawberry.  What a surprise to open a package with one half the normal size.  I did not realize I was ordering a very very small pin-cushion.  If you want the usual size pin cushion this is not for you.	-1
This is extremely thin and I couldn't use it for the intended purchase as a result. I don't recommend unless you want to layer over layer over days. If you want a slight sheen this is for you though. Just nto what I was looking for.	-1
I ordered this to "touch up" paint on a craft project and while it was ok, it was very thin and took at least two coats to cover each area.  I wouldn't order this again.	-1
It takes so much for something to actually grow and it took 2 cans to do nothing. And it feels and flakes everywhere.	-1
i loved this pen when it was new, but the tip frayed and became useless for crisp lines after just 2 weeks of sitting capped. totally useless as a caligraphy pen	-1
Jumping on the band wagon here. I bought one of these at a discount from a local craft store and had the worst knit machine experience as described by many of the reviewers here. I didn't use the yarn it came with as that stuff is eyelash fun yarn. I don't knit or crochet with that stuff so I expected that to give me all sorts of problems. I used a sock yarn these machines are supposed to like. Well, if it liked the yarn, it didn't like what it was supposed to be doing. It dropped more stitches than it knit, it was hard to hold while turning the handle, and there is no way to secure it to a table in any position to get a free hand to help it work. It went back to the store. Thank goodness it was not a finale sale item I couldn't return. I used the money to get another brand that works much better but is still very low priced.	-1
I gave this to my granddaughter for Christmas and we could not get it to work properly.	-1
I will see if I can get a new one. It looks like I can use it though	-1
flimsy, sure have more detailed instructions	-1
don't buy it	-1
POS made in China. Do not even attempt. I will not take up space explaining. There are plenty of other reviews you can read. Same problems most others had.	-1
I want my money back. This piece could not be operated by an adult not much less a child of 6. I say it again I WANT MY MONEY BACK. I would have returned it but it required it be returned in its original package which can not be done since you have to dismantle the package in order to get the machine out of it and you can not determine how the thing works until it is out of the package. But I say it again  I WANT MY MONEY BACK. i  will gladly send the machine back. I had to go out and buy another xmas present since this thing was not worthy as a gift.	-1
Product broke on turn 3.  It's small, everything plastic.  Very displeased.  Total waste of money and time.  I have since read other people reviews and found they have same problem with it breaking.  Great potential.  There is no way a child could use this without breaking it.  Sorry but very disappointed.  Wish I could have given it a negative 10 rating.	-1
We find that it breaks to easily and is not useful for anything but a light bracelet.	-1
It was not what I needed.  I suppose it is OK.	-1
disappointing. I ended up returning this product after less than week. It was not compatible with my three year old, Windows PC. I have found free programs online that work jsut as well and use flash drives to transfer programs from my computer to my PE700	-1
Does not work	-1
Ok let's start how the product is the quality is made well & looks good. But the manual leaves much to be desired, there is no trouble shooting for errors or problems that you would have to go to brothers website. Secondly the product needs to be updated because it runs on a Windows 7 or XP & if you have Windows 10 you need to update your driver & install. Thirdly the buttons on top of the file folder leaves much to your imagination because it doesn't give you much so good luck with that! Lastly after all of that figuring out don't be surprised if you get the design on the disc & go to your sewing machine and insert it just to say........."this embroidery card does not work with this machine?!#%*$@!!! Ok I'm done time to return it!!	-1
returned	-1
Software works great on my pc. Loved it till I got to my Brother LB6800PRW and states the card is not for this machine :-(	-1
Did not work for me.  I returned it.	-1
Stopped working after 2 months.	-1
Would not work for me  I have Windows 7  tried for 5 hours  Called Brothers  no HELP  went to website  to download  says not to use the CD they sent  but use the download  Tried 4 more times.  SENT BACK	-1
This is very dated. I had to go to the brother website and download the correct updates for windows 8. I was finally able to load my designs to the card. However, if your design is larger than 4x4 for brother 400 machine, it will not load. Make sure your design is saved for the appropriate size for your machine. The software is useless. I only purchased this to save my designs from my embrilliance software I use. It won't let you just send a design to this unit. You must open the brother program. Save your designs there then send to the card. Yes, this package is cheaper than just buying the card by itself. If you're only doing 4x4 designs, it's just ok. Brother. Needs to upgrade all these issues. I was tired of constantly hooking my PC to my machine. This has proved to be a bigger headache. I'm disappointed. If your machine says this card will not work on this machine, make sure your designs are the right size.	-1
Don't waste your money. Much better embroidery programs out there.	-1
You do not need a memory card just use your computer and cord. Don't waste your money	-1
Please notice how old all the 5 star ratings are on this item.  Totally NOT worth the money for my Brother PE770 Embroidery Machine.  When this hit the market nearly 10 years ago, it was fine.  Today?  If you have an embroidery machine that takes a USB thumb/flash drive, don't buy this because you don't need it.  There are tons of freebie embroidery software on the internet that you can save to your laptop and transfer to a USB thumb drive.  All this does is allow you to minimally edit existing designs and then transfer them to the machine.  It does NOT resize large images down to your hoop size, or digitize images like .jpg or .gif so you can embroider those images.  It does NOT allow you to create text to embroider.  The software looks like it was written for Windows 98.  And with the memory size of thumb drives today, you really don't need that great big card either.  Save your money.	-1
This I can't get to work for some reason...tried it on windows 7 & 8 and it won't work on either..wish I had sent it back when I could.....It won't work for me at all on either windows .....They mislead me on this....	-1
Wasn't aware this product was outdated!	-1
I got the brother lb6800 amazing embroidery and sewing machine from amazon I I deacided to purchas  this ped basic In Amazon site I read that it will work on all brother machine. Soon I got the ped basic I put the card in my machine, and the machine didn't accept the memory card I'm stack with new product that cost me 100 USD AND IT'S NOT WORKING IN MY MACHINE!!! BIG DISAPPOINTED FROM AMASON WEB SITE!!! AND AMAZON WILL NOT ACCEPT THAT PRODUCT CACK...	-1
I really see no point to this. You can't digitize with it	-1
this is plain out the biggest rip off Brothers has produced, It was like a Matel toy software produce, don't waste your money on this poor quality item	-1
I was advised to use a different program for my brother machine, but thought what would work better than a program made by brother.  Frustrated with my decision.	-1
I shopped around, did get it cheaper here. still payed to much for it. doesn't work with my machine. not easy to use.	-1
I ordered this for my Brother PE-770. My computer has Windows Vista which presents a challenge for the PED Basic. I followed the directions on the separate paper that was sent. I couldn't download PES files to the PED. Then I uninstalled everything and went to the Brother site and followed their solutions for installing on Windows Vista. I worked for 4 hours trying to get this installed and to download PES files but never could. I am somewhat tech challenged although I have used a computer extensively for 14 years. I finally gave up and returned it. Amazon was easy to do a return and refunded my money immediately. For me this was a disappointment. I am sure there are many other people who enjoy the PED but I can't recommend it.	-1
All seems so simple, except it simply won't work.  At first the issue was that it wouldn't save the designs on the card from my computer and it kept crashing.  I had to reload the software several times from the Brother site.  (And that tooks hours and hours because it continued to crash and reloading software means deleting it, restarting, downloading, uploading, restarting....)  Finally it works from the computer end for the most part- crashes sometimes but not always.  And now?  No matter what I do, the sewing machine won't recognize the card.  I've gone back to the brother site and followed all their directions.  I've emailed Brother several times.  Their solution?  Follow directions on the website and don't bother us.  Nothing we can do.  What a total waste of money and worse- a total waste of a LOT of time.  What I'm going through is not an isolated issue-  I've seen tons of reviews and questions on the web asking what can be done to fix this issue.	-1
I gave this product a low rating more for its value than its performance. The product does what it is supposed to do, it allows you to transfer designs to your machine and in that respect you just can't do without it (Brother got you by you know what...). The software that comes with it is at best 'primitive' and offers no editing capabilities what so ever. The user interface would be considered state of the art around 1990! It only organizes your designs, and then very poorly.  Transferring designs to the card is also primitive. You can not add designs to the card cumulatively for it erases the card every time prior to writing to it! Al in all, at its current price, a serious ripoff. Unfortunately it is all you got if you want to load new designs into your machine. I feel that at $100++ it is way overpriced, the package's true value should be somewhere between $25 and $50.	-1
Waste of money	-1
Tiny little packet with hardly any instructions or product. Also I had to add other items to make it really work. Not impressed.	-1
doesnt stay adjusted	-1
Not too happy. Product came missing nuts from screws, knobs don't turn well, it generally feels very cheap and flimsy	-1
I purchased this dress form a few months ago.  I have noticed that the more I change the sizing, the looser the form is becoming. The second half of the form has separated from the top.  When I adjust it for height, as soon as I put a garment on it, it drops down to its original position. Now I use it primarily for display purposes. I also purchased a Dritz dress form at the same time and have had much better luck with the Dritz.  I would not purchase this form again. Perhaps with very light use it would do better.	-1
To really make this work you need to pad it up to the shape of you or the persons body you're making clothes for. It's a bit hard since the make of the body is very light which is a good and a bad thing. It falls over VERY easily! This was obnoxious at times.  The dials are a little fussy and you can't have one dial at one measurement in the chest and have the hip measured to certain options on the dial. It forces it back to where it wants to be instead of where you need it to be. This is fixable, only if you pad up the body form for your personal shape.  I also couldn't get the adjustment in the chest correct because the busts size was already enlarged enough to where if I made the body form for my rib cages size, the bust was way too large...  Granted, I'm a 39A, so that may not be an issue for many people since they don't even make bras for my size hardly. That was my biggest issue besides the fact that it was very light weight.	-1
It was hard to work with and dried out really fast. Pretty much have to chuck the whole thing. Didn't seem very pigmented, either. I don't know how to keep this product fresh between uses. Not worth trying to find out. I will just get another makeup.	-1
Beautiful color but it is so soft that I can hardly use it.	-1
My fingers hurt from trying to get the dials adjusted to my size. I can't get them to stay based on my measurements, why have separate dials when you can't get them to stay...they keep popping back, i'm 34 29 36 but I can't get them to work with each other, if its on 39 hips waist will stay at 29 but bust won't go to 34....ugh	-1
I always buy Singer products, because they are always good.  I don't know who Singer had to make this dress form but it is bad.  Not steady at all hard to adjust the size.  But I needed somethings to put my clothes on  so I kept it.  The price should have been $35 - $50.  All I could get off as a discount was less than $21.  If you are looking at this to buy DON'T. you will be very disappointed.  I am out with SINGER	-1
Who did Singer design this dress form for?  It surely wasn't for the human body.  The shoulder to full bust measurement is 9 inches.  This dress form is for a woman with a full figure and 9 inches from shoulder to full bust would be pushing the envelope for even a small petite woman.  The average distance for most women of average size would start between 11 and 12.  The full bust is 41 inches with the form closed, so there is way too much fullness in the slope between the shoulder and bust to even begin to adjust the dress form.  In the past Singers has published some of the best fitting books, so there is just no excuse for them to make such as gross error in this part of their design.  Since the purchaser is able to see there is hardly any trunk to the dress form they should have at least tried put the full bust in the average place a woman's bust would be. Or taken out the fullness of the bust so a woman could adjust this area.  This dress form is worthless when it come to blouses and dresses.  Disregarding the other problems people have complained about I could have lived with them since I have an old dress stand that I could have used.  However, getting someting so basic so badly wrong has earned this dress form the highest rating I could possibly give it.	-1
I'm actually not a beginner. I've been sewing for 36 years and have never owned a dress form. But after deciding to put my skills to use for my own benefit, I decided to splurge. I was so excited! I even delayed a project until I got it. Unfortunately, 2 seconds after unpacking it and beginning to assemble it, I started to suspect it wasn't anywhere near worth the $100 I shelled out for it. Its flimsy at best and I can't see it standing up to much of what life has to throw at it. While a seamstress may treat it like a glass egg, her husband and kids will not! That doesn't even count the animals! Plus the form is not actually connected to the pole, it just sits on top, making it impossible to move even an inch without taking the whole form off. Not to mention, the pole is not offset so its useless for pants. Having sewn for almost 4 decades, I can safely say, I haven't been missing out on a dang thing! This thing was back in its box within the hour and on its way back!	-1
I live in Arizona and it melted over everything in the box and I cant use it :( I have bought this in the winter and had no problems.	-1
Good product when I opened it.  Dried out right after. Not sure how to prevent that. Had to throw it out.	-1
The label says sky blue but the actual paint is very dark, with purple tone.  Pros: cheap. Washes off with water. The 18-ml container gives multiple face applications. Doesnt need to be set with powder. Washes off easily with water.  Cons: washes off easily with water or sweat. Takes more than one application to get an even tone application with a sponge.  Stained nailpolish.  Not good for body application all day at a convention. OK for a school play, or showing team colours, fun face painting or under other powder and water based makeup for a short duration use. (Eg photoshoot on exposed skin only.)  I took a chance on this because it was really cheap and intended to be used for indoor photoshoot in an air conditioned space. For longer times in hot environments, I suggest grease paints or alcohol paints, and for speed of application and even coverage I suggest airbrush body paints.	-1
The campaign for safe cosmetics published a study in 2009 on lead, nickel, cobalt and chromium in childrens' facepaint kits. You can easily google it and find it. They report Snazaroo's had the highest lead content of the 10 facepaint kits they tested, 0.56 parts per million (page 8 of their report). This is 5.6 times higher than the maximum amount of lead allowed in candy, 0.10 parts per million, and almost 40 times the maximum allowed in water, 0.015 ppm (pl. 13).	-1
Definitely the worst pain I have ever but it is our well it should be only used for practice not for professional use	-1
Hard to apply	-1
it has a very blue hue to it :/	-1
Dried out. Wouldn't apply very well.	-1
Doesn't seal and it gets everywhere.	-1
Could not use bc it was hard as a rock.	-1
You get what you pay for.	-1
I bought Snazaroo Face Paint (2 in light grey, 1 in white and 1 in black) and no matter what I did, the makeup would cake and crumble before I could get even coverage. I used very little water as recommended (I also tried more and less in other attempts hoping to fix the issue) and nothing helped. I tried applying with high quality smooth makeup sponges, my fingers and a foundation brush as well, hoping one of those might help but nothing did. I was left with makeup that kept wanting to get crumbly and flake off, and even after setting it, trying to apply shading lightly with a powder was a nightmare. I see so many good reviews for this, which is why I tried it over all others, but honestly, it really let me down and I am frustrated that I chose to use Snazaroo. All I wanted was a body paint with good coverage, non shiny finish, and no caking/crumbling/flaking/cracking. I give it two stars, as by the 5th try I had an ok looking application, but not even an hour later it was getting crumbly still. It did come off pretty easy and didn't irritate my skin, so another plus there. I didn't apply it with a heavy hand, and used the recommended smooth upward strokes. Overall though I am disappointed. From faraway it still looked fine, but any close ups and all you could see was a crumbly textured mess on my face.	-1

Sorry to say, this stuff was hard to work with and got bad results.  Using the MAC product was much easier and got better results.	-1
I have small hands and I could barely get my fingers into these. They have to go back, what a nuisance.. I thought the Gingher Large Handle model looked silly, but if your hands are larger than an average 12-year-old, get the kind with the bigger holes.	-1
These are not what I had in mind for a hake brush. The hair is just too long on the medium size and I ended up trimming it because I had no control at all. Just a wet noodle!	-1
Won't even use these. Too many bristles fall out. Not durable at all.	-1
One word sums this product up... GARBAGE! Do not waste you money on this. Every one of the curves had manufacturing defects (READ THAT AGAIN) with the edges making them absolutely useless. In one instance a chunk of plastic fell off the edge of a curve as I was unwrapping it from the protective cellophane bag. These were not damaged during delivery. This is an obvious manufacturing problem. It is a real shame resources are wasted to ship and return this product. I told Amazon they should immediately remove this product. It is a disgrace to the Amazon name.	-1
Good luck opening this thing. Set my husband off into a fit of profanity.	-1
WAY,way, too pale.. I know this says muted not even sub titles would help w/this... might be good on a dark paper but personally I don't like it on regular white paper....	-1
Ran Out of Ink	-1
They dry out rather quickly... I only had 4 posters to do and one of each of three colors was already drying out and two of the blacks I couldn't use.	-1

I really love this shade, but there's something about it that pisses me off. There are at least two pigments that go into this color, one's kind of a teal and the other is kind of a lavender. when used in it's full concentration this color is great. If you try to blend it out or  dilute it to much with colorless blender, or as I do for larger areas, alcohol in a spray bottle, the teal-ish pigment will stain where you laid it down, and the lavender-ish pigment will spread out. this really pissed me off on this one piece I was commissioned for and it took a great deal of darkening the entire thing to camouflage it out the best I could. I just want to prevent you from making the same mistake.	-1
The Alvin Professional translucent self-healing cutting mat comes with a cautionary label affixed to the shrink wrap that reads: "This product contains chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer, birth defects, and or other reproductive harm.  Wash your hands after use." This information was not in the Amazon listing or I would not have purchased the product and had to go to the trouble of returning it. California requires companies to notify customers when products contain cancer-causing chemicals.  Perhaps the product can be shipped without the label to customers in states that don't require that the public be informed.  Perhaps that's why the information isn't mentioned in the Amazon listing.  Who knows. Who cares. Oh, I do. That's why I'm writing this review. A Google search on self-healing cutting mats and cancer leaves little to recommend in their stead except good old recyclable cardboard.	-1
Although the quality of this item appeared high, the chemical odor was unbearable, and we were forced to return it.	-1
If I could give it 0 starts I would.  This paint sucks. It doesnt dry.  Glad I payed money for this pice of crap.  Not sure what is wrong wiitj it but.  This company dropped the bomb on this.  Dont buy you will be sorry.	-1
The cover sheet I received was not cut straight or plumb. I had to attach it at an angle so it would go corner to corner on a table of the exact size as this cover. That also left overhang that would have needed to have been trimmed off. Unfortunately, I missed slightly and tried to reposition. The tape tore the wood off the top of my Alvin drawing table. Now the drawing table is ruined. I do not recommend this product because it is not 24" x 36". It is more or less depending on which angle on it one is looking at. Barely goes diagonally corner to corner in one direction. I ruined an entire Alvin table trying to use it. I was simply trying to replace a warped one of the allegedly exact size.	-1
Color was very thick as if it was drying out.	-1
Meh it dry fast and colors are a little off from the sample on the tubes	-1
Some of the tubes were completely dried up. Others seems like they weren't completely full. I will not buy this again.	-1
I was under the impression that these were 5mls samples of heavy body Liquitex Acrylic paints, much to my chagrin, they arent!	-1
I tried to use these for a while to stretch my money; the heavy body is expensive.  However, the Basics Acrylic Paint is too thin to be opaque and the colors are not vivid.	-1
The tubes don't seem like they are filled all the way. I just barely got them from the art store and I noticed they are not filled all the way. Not sure if its because the tubes can fit more but were filled up to 22ml. So I might be getting what I bought. If that was the case then why have such large tubes? Could have use smaller ones.	-1
The quality of these paints are pretty much lower than student grade. While I loved some of the colors some paints were already chunky and I was unable to use them.	-1
I bought this paint Sep 30 and didn't use it until March, so some 5 months later. By that time, some of the tubes were completely dried up, others were thickened or the texture of curdled cream, and didn't blend out. I bought it direct from Amazon, not from a 3rd party seller.  It really turned me off so I ordered some of Dick Blick's Studio paints which I thought would be the equivalent of the Basics line. They were not really pigmented enough for my taste so now I am slowly building up a supply of Dick Blick professional acrylics. They have a 2 oz tube size that is generous enough to last through a number of paintings, so I get that for less frequently used colors, and the bigger 4.65 oz tubes for the "staples". To be fair, I do have a couple of the bigger tubes of Liquitex Basics that are older than this set and they seem to be holding up well over time. As far as colors go, I like LB's light blue violet, which is a completely different, darker shade than DB Studio's version, and not available in DB Pro.	-1
good paints but i just assumed the primaries would actually be the primaries they all had weird tones to them and were not true primaries which meant any color i might want to mix would not turn out right not to mention i didn't get a purple, just a weird blue green maybe I'm too picky about the colors but as a painter who actually needs the primary colors to be legit primary colors i do not recommend this the black is very nice though	-1
The paint is thick and drys to fast. Very difficult to work with,without mediums to slow down drying time. Maybe i got a bad set. As I have recently purchased other bigger tubes and they are excellent.	-1
I have been buying these paints for years and they have started to explode out the back of the tube. I contacted the company and they refuse to fix the isse. initially they will work and then..bam out the back the paint comes and makes a huge mess.	-1
They are what is to be expected in student or basic grade paints... thin pigmentation.	-1
My paintings tend to have heavy, vibrant colors and rich layers. These paints do not do the trick for me.  They are way too thin and watery. I have to apply multiple layers to get the desired effect. Even though the colors are beautiful, they just don't have enough coverage. In fact, I think they have less coverage than the Reeve's acrylic that comes in small tubes... I tried the Liquitex Heavy Body paints before, and those work great (they are also very pricey), and I figured that the same company would make consistent quality paints. I made a huge mistake in purchasing these, because now I have 48 tubes of frustration. Luckily the company is stingy with their product and don't fill the tubes up all the way. (That's another thing that annoys me...come on Liquitex, either fill it up or make the tubes smaller! Who are you fooling?)  Now I use these mostly with acrylic mediums - dripping mediums and heavy gels and such. They work fine with these mediums. They really aren't any good on their own for the professional artist. However, this wide range of colors may be good for a child to experiment with. Too bad I don't have a child.  Will not buy again.	-1
I received 22 ml tubes which is equivalent to .744 US fluid ounces. Not even close to the 2 fl oz claimed. Their description claims 2 Fl. oz. tubes and if you look at the picture it says their are 6 x 59 ml, 2 U.S. Fl. Oz. I am requesting my money back.	-1
Rubbish. Needle broke on second project. The needle would also constantly fall out. Wood handle feels weak.	-1
Product description says it includes two needles. Mine had no needles. Read the reviews. I'm not the only person who has had this problem.	-1
As other reviewers have noted, these are a real mixed bag. Unlike the photo, most of the sponges were squarish pieces cut from a larger sponge. Some are softer than others. We got 1 or 2 nice sponges from this bag.	-1
The pencils are of poor quality.  The instruction book is just OK.	-1
Haven't even used them yet because of the cancer causing chemical.  No thank you.  That should be in the description so buyer can beware.	-1
charcoal pencils don't work well, as well as the kneaded eraser and other pencils.	-1
I enjoyed using the pencils until they needed sharpening. The lead breaks every time I sharpen them, leaving the pencil useless. Will not recommend purchase.	-1
It was a mostly charcoal set. I don't really use charcoal so this wasn't what I wanted. But that's my own error.	-1
It was ok. not easy for my 6 year old. color print on the plastic wasn't very  good either	-1
Fine for beginners.  Cord is stiff and needle is a little too short for my liking (before the bend).	-1
The cord that connects the two needles is cheesey. I can't even begin to knit something with these things. The area where the needles and cord connects is tilted the wrong way as well; so it will be impossible to make a circle even if the cord relaxes.	-1
Boye used to be the gold standard.  Now they seem cheaply made.  The first set of this size I bought broke halfway through a project - the plastic cord came off the aluminum needle.  So I bought another set.  The second set has aluminum burrs sticking up and away from where the needle meets the plastic cord.  It is catching on my expensive wool yarn!  Will this project ever get finished?!	-1
I should have known better after seeing the price but thought what the heck?  These needles are so cheaply made they are almost impossible to knit with.  The plastic the cable is made from is super nonbendable.  Do yourself a favor and spend more for a better pair.	-1
I am not pleased with this circular needle because I expected the cord between the needle points to be 16" long and it is only 9". Had I known this before I purchased it, I would not have spent money on it.	-1
The biggest problem I have with this paint is it's chalky look after it dries on canvas. It doesn't have the quality of acrylic. At least it's a good pink. Thought it would be a tad darker though:(	-1
i recieved this item in a smaller package then expected, as it seems there is an error in the labeling it is for only one canvas not 6, other then that the company was good at giving me a quick refund so i am happy, one last thing to add is the canvas is not as tight as i like them but good quality	-1
fell apart immediately as I started using it in soft clay! I epoxied the metal back into the wood and it hasn't fell apart again yet but the metal is so cheap so it warps and bends easily.	-1
Billed as a regular fettling knife, I would say this is much too soft. If it were advertised as a soft fettling knife it would be more accurate. I wouldn't buy this again, even if it were listed as soft because it bends out of shape so easily.	-1
Soft indeed. Can't keep it's shape. I should have just gone with Kemper. This knife is nearly impossible to use.	-1
Doesn't cut on soft clay. Haven't tried on leather hard.	-1
These are NOT Perler Brand beads (which are manufactured by EK Success Brands). They are a cheap knock off which causes uneven melting, rounded edges, poor durability etc. as pictured. More at http://houseofgeekiness.blogspot.com/2015/07/buyer-beware-perler-bead-scams.html	-1
No patterns for the peg boards.	-1
Pegs seem to short for any comfortable knitting. Worked piece could fall off of easily, especially if working with Bulky or Super Bulky weight yarns. Not sure if these are original KK looms or knock-off set. Returned for purchase of other brand that had longer pegs.	-1
yes, it glows in the dark as stated. but, wow.  smallest spool of thread - i am very disappointed - overpriced	-1
Cool design but NOT a easy one. Should be leveled up the pattern is not on the screen	-1
I love the colors of this cross stitch but actually I hate the pattern it is really difficult to sew with this kind of material !	-1
I liked the kit was very disappointed that there was not enough thread in a number of colors. I have been doing this type of needlework for years and have never run out of thread like this.	-1
I was actually looking for acrylic knitting needles when I accidentally purchased these instead. It didn't seem worth returning them so I decided to add them to the collection. I was suprised to see that some of the color was worn away in spots when I took the needles out of the pack, never had that happen before. I've been knitting with the blue size 8 needles for about a week now a few hours at a time and come away, ever single time, with blue hands. Not a happy kniter with blue hands let me tell you. To add to the disappointment the needles are also heavier then my cheep Walmart brand needles that are actually longer in length. Having hand issues the lighter the better for me because even the smallest bit of weight will wear on my hands after a bit. I can honestly say I would not order these again.	-1
I've been knitting for a month and am trying to enjoy the experience but... The needles I've used thus far are already shedding color at the tips. I've used two of the sizes and both have faded at the tips. I'm going to keep them only because, it would be more of an issue to send them back.	-1
Not selling very well.  Not as nice as better needles.	-1
Slap a German company name on a product and you have expectations of precision German product.  Make product somewhere else, poor quality control.  Two of the five needles do not fit in my Sewing machine because the shanks are too big.  This is true for the Schmetz blue jean needles, too.	-1
I was excited to finally have a color wheel that was large enough to read. This color wheel is printed on PAPER stock-NOT CARD stock. It is THIN and FLIMSY. I used to have a color wheel that was MUCH THICKER but I lost it several years ago. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND this to anyone!	-1
Was told I had to have this to understand how to mix clay colors. The information on this wheel is so basic that it didn't help at all. The same info is online, this is just a different format, and a hands-on method.	-1
You still need to cut your fabric to the right size. So what's the advantage? the folding. glue in your garment.. Seriously?	-1
I bought this bias maker by mistake; thought it would fit my Simplcity bias maker. That should be made clear to shoppers.	-1
Worst piece of junk ever. The slide around what ever ur trying to punch and ruin it. They also come glazed in some WERID oil thing. I am so upset I got this piece of junk. Do buy	-1
Disappointing....some of the letters are a bit skewed so they are not level with the upper edge of the stamp.  I should have waited and ordered a set from somewhere else that could be easily returned if they did not work out.	-1
I used these in Cold Processing soap and they didn't work so well... you are better off buying oxides if you are doing cold processing.  My results were:  Fading Bleeding Sweated out 100% during saponification as if my soap had exorcised a demon. .	-1
Absolutely horrible.  Completely useless unless you use the entire bottle for one loaf.  I won't stray from Brambleberry.com liquid oxides again.	-1
It works great but I wish it had a label on them so I could tell what color I was using.	-1
I know that Faber Castell is a good brand, but apparently I got a bum pack or I'm missing something. I don't draw Manga, I just wanted the pens for sketching, and I was excited when they arrived, except they don't work or I have a different idea of descriptive terms like "highly pigmented". Every single pen is almost completely dried out & silly me of course already threw away all of the packaging and had removed the pens because the cover creeped me out. These pens only work if I dip them in water and draw with them for about 5 seconds, before drying up again. My cheapie ball point pens work better than this. So, now I'm stuck with worthless pens. Next time I decide to spend money on higher priced pens I'll try ordering Sakura.	-1
I received only a 12 ct. pack by mistake, yet was charged for the 36?	-1
Aloha. I read the good reviews and got these---they arrived unbroken to Hawaii so were packed fine. But the chalky 'blow off the paper' consistency left me rather pissed off. For the price they should STICK to the paper better! The chalky, light powdery feel makes doing anything you want to stick difficult. So if you want a pastel color schemed drawing that has color that you can layer or draw over without it blowing away in the wind---invest in the better ones. You get what you pay for. Mahalo.	-1
I was really disappointed in what I received with this product.  It stated that this was sketch paper, but what you actually get is tracing paper.  Not at all what I wanted for my 2 yo daughter to draw on.  Sketch paper is one thing, but I don't define it as tracing paper....not sure what we will do with this roll now..... Not too happy, and don't want to pay to ship it back to Amazon.....	-1
As thin as tracing paper and a very small roll. Go elsewhere	-1
I fell in love with the Gingher brand as I researched them online. I wanted one of every pair. I still am in love with the design and the heavy metal construction. I've bought 2 pairs, these and some 5" sewing shears, and the one complaint I have has really ruined my excitement for the brand all together.  There is no way to loosen up the tension. Both pairs (and I've done some reading online and found it is true with many other models) are WAY too tight, the blades grind together, they are stiff to open and close making using them more of a frustration than a pleasure.  I attempted to take a screw driver and loosen up the tension on my pair of 5"s. It worked, they were much easier to use, but a week later I noticed that the nut on the other side had fallen off. Now I have to constantly tighten them with my fingernail every minute or so during use so that they don't fall apart.  I would love to know which models are not so tight, or at least which ones are adjustable, because I love the look and feel of these scissors, but until I get to use a pair that feels comfortable (and expensive, which they are) I am not buying any more. :(	-1
It a good price and it's a large cloth, but it really is only good for larger plain pieces. If you have silver that has intricate details and designs in the jewelry, this cloth is not going to do a good cleaning job. Sunshine Polishing Cloth is the absolute best I have ever used. That cloth cleans all in the beadwork, milgrain, and crevices of your jewelry. After cleaning, some of my silver looked better than it did when I purchased it. Sunshine is better than any liquid cleaner or cloth I have ever used. It even cleans when it's "dirty".	-1
Kind of disappointed,  since I have the previous model, (which by the way its very good), the adjusting wheels are very hard to turn, and the leg part I couldn't understand,  tried to use it on a pair of pants that I was adjusting the length, wow, it was a disaster	-1
Mine came broken.  Amazon was wonderful with the return process.  If it hadn't been broken, I probably would have kept it, but I doubt I ever would have been satisfied.  The shoulders would have made it difficult to put garments on and off.  Since I am very thin front to back, it could never have really replicated my shape.  I replaced it with a Roxy form from Amazon and am thrilled with that one.  It was more expensive, and I also had to purchase a fitting system (pads) for it, but entirely worth the investment.	-1
Although I like the tool overall, the one I received must have been a return - it had glue all up in the neck of it as though it were previously broken. I guess the review would be better if the seller would have provided me with an undamaged product.	-1
After several months of use I have come to absolutely hate this swift. The clamp is complete crap and has on occasion just come undone and closed the swift while I was winding yarn. It creaks and squeaks too and does not rotate smoothly. I'll definitely be buying a new swift as soon as I can afford it.	-1
Its like writing with chalk. Its scratchy and gross. I'm still a big fan of Crayola.	-1
Save money, buy the REEVES set instead. These are exactly like the Reeves pencils. I bought the Reeves 36 and the Fantasia 36 at the same time. The pencils are identical.  I was disappointed that these don't have the color names printed on the barrel, and the tin is cheap and flimsy. I'm returning these and will keep the Reeves.  The pencils are not as hard as Crayola and have better pigments, but they aren't artist quality by a long stretch. I wanted a set of pencils that I can take out (my precious Faber Castell Polychromos don't leave the house), and these suit the bill.	-1
Requested and received these as a Christmas gift after reading all the glowing reviews of their quality and performance.  I integrated the Fantasia pencils into my other watercolor pencil supplies and decided to make an updated color swatch chart of them all using Fabriano 140 lb hot press watercolor paper as a base. The Fantasia pencils did not lay down pigment evenly/easily (in order to build up color gradually), definitely did not blend well with water and a good brush, leaving indelible pencil marks on some colors, and are a general fail in performance IMHO. I'm no name-brand snob but in this case, the cheaper Fantasia pencils were not worth their (holiday-inflated) price. I'd rank them below student grade in all aspects.	-1
I bought these because they state their colors are super saturated and vivid, but I've found them to be difficult. My use is coloring in a coloring book that doesn't accept ink well. My preference has always been markers for the rich colors. So, maybe I'm expecting too much from a pencil.  You must apply a LOT of pressure to get a nice saturated color on the page. Even then, you will have to apply many layers before achieving a nice color. Also, I've found that blending is extremely difficult with these pencils. Maybe I'm not doing it right? But it seems to me that, for blending colors, pencils SHOULD be easier to manipulate than markers. Not the case here.  I've decided to try another brand.	-1
Arrived on time, not as described inside tin. Pencils had broken leads, when sharpened had to be sharpened again and again... These were donated to Vets art program and they said they are crumbly leads - but they like the colors...	-1
Wasn't inpressed	-1
I don't know what all the five star review people got but the ones I got are junk, yes you get a lot of them for the price but so not worth it, they are all warped and bent and hollow! If you want to ones don't buy thses please move on!	-1
I am a professional painter by trade and passion. Therefore, I know what quality I expect when purchasing Bob Ross materials. I've been using the same fan brush with Bob's face on it since I was 9 years old. I am now 35, so the brush has been through the ringer, and back, and aside from a few bent bristles it still works fairly well. After pricing out new brushes and paints, I found this set to be lower in cost than buying separate,  so I placed an order. Both the 2 inch brush and the fan brush fell apart in the paint thinner (the bottle that came with the set) after only 2 uses. Yes, it literally looked like a porcupine took a swim in my can, not to mention, the hundreds of hairs in the paint itself. This is not the quality I have come to expect from this particular brand and I am saddened that I must begin a search for something closer in quality to what I've been using. Bob would be ashamed. I know I wouldn't want my name on this junk.	-1
didn't glow without black light	-1
Garbage! Doesnt glow at all!!! And its very runny so i don't see HOW the hell  it can be dimensional!!!! Waste of dam money	-1
Didn't work as expected. Glow was faint.	-1
SOME of the paints were dry and we couldn't use them.	-1
My art work glowed in the dark one night only.  A complete waste of time and money. Not to mention my artwork is ruined as planned.	-1
NOT VERY VISIBLE AT NIGHT	-1
Poor quality if you want glow in the dark/luminescent but it works okay for black light.  I painted several items with the various colors and then used a separate luminous paint by FolkArt (Glow Brillo Phosphorescent) on another item.  The FolkArt is nearly 10 times brighter.  Additionally the colored or tinted paints from this product do not glow in any actual colors when used without black light.  When used with black light the colors are somewhat faint.	-1
Don't like them at all. I never used paints so it may be just me. They glob and take too long to dry. I'll stick to the markers.	-1
Product is very runny.  Will be looking for something a little thicker.	-1
Was not expecting product to be so watery and runny	-1
Product works great, but it is known for clogging the spray nozzle. Even when I put it in another spray bottle, it clogs it. Wastes the product that way...	-1
I don't like this product. It doesn't even hold tissue paper down. All papers end up wrinkled and are never completely attached	-1
It doesn't extend for any length of time that matched the required effort to mix it.	-1
Product did not work as expected. Tried three times. Waste of money	-1
Didn't like this product at all, Used it to paint a 8' X 16' mural.  It did not mix well with soft body acrylic paint.  It left the paint streaky and hard to paint with.	-1
Seal was broken this it all leaked out. Looks like it had been used and closed up.	-1
I don't know whether I like the product or not because the container was damaged. The shipping box was NOT damaged. Just the contents! The bottom of the product container is split open; contents leaked into shipping box.	-1
Arrived damaged and everywhere!!	-1
does not dry completely clear if you use it on painted item for photo transfers.	-1
I'm not impressed with this modeling paste. Before it even dried completely it had cracked in places. I can make it work for my current project, though I don't trust it to use on more risky work. I won't get it again.	-1
Disappointed. Expected REAL CREWEL YAM THAT IS WOOL! not worth the price.	-1
Too small rip off	-1
Though the picture of the product is pretty, the fabric upon which it is printed is a stiff canvas type of material and hard to work with.  I find this frustrating and I don't recommend this for beginners, too frustrating.	-1
These are clunky and stick.  The size is excellent but they do not execute, especially for precision paper cutting	-1
VERY HARD TO OPEN BLADES TO CUT WITH,	-1
I literally paid the price for not paying attention when I placed this order! The item is advertised as costing $6.88 with FREE SHIPPING. But when I viewed my invoice, shipping charges had "magically" appeared--making the total price of this item $12.75! That is quite a rip-off! I'm just writing this review to warn future purchasers about this nasty little trick. I don't know if it's Amazon or the seller. At any rate, I'll certainly have to pay close attention before I click "Submit Order" the next time. I'm very disappointed that I have to watch out for this kind of misleading and dishonest pricing practice on the Amazon site. ***UPDATE: I feel I should point out that the vendor did refund my shipping charge after I complained. The vendor indicated that on their site, it shows they charge for shipping to a PO box. I don't understand the rationale for that, and I seriously doubt that most people take the time to check a vendor's web site just to verify shipping charges. If the product page says "free shipping," then it should be free shipping!	-1
These scissors are heavy, metal, and unbelievably dull. The workmanship that went into producing these scissors can best be described as mediocre. But it's the dullness of the blades that bothers me most. I've bought numerous pairs of scissors and shears through the years and these are the worst I've seen in a long time. If there was an attempt to sharpen these at the factory, it must have been fairly halfhearted one. I am disappointed. Maybe I'll like them better after I sharpen them.	-1
I bought these to do art on my wife's fingernails for her. They don't do a good job at all for that. Contrary to the name, they're not very opaque, and you have to cover the same area more than once to get good color coverage.	-1
does not flow smoothly	-1
These pens are very light if you want them for mixed media.  I don't think they show up very well.  I bought it for the white.	-1
I'm using this to make center pieces for my sister's wedding. inexpensive, and i'm pretty sure I will only need one can for 26 center pieces!  UPDATE:  So at first everything worked out great and you definitely get a lot of bang for your buck. However; I'm submerging the glitter into vases filled with water. After the first couple hours the -water that started off clear started getting tinged with pink and now it's a deep purple. The dye does not stay in the glitter.	-1
The blue chalk marks great; however, it does not erase.  I tried brushing it off; blowing it off with compressed air; and wiping it off with a damp cloth.  Fortunately I had used it on a small area and then tried to remove it.  I thought Fons and Porter would have a good product for marking light colors on quilts.  I don't recommend this product.	-1
The chalk powder was pretty messy. It left a scattered and sometimes smeared  line, not as smooth as I would have hoped. But it worked and I still used it.	-1
The wheel doesn't roll over the fabric well.  You have to press down hard to grip the fabric and can damage it.  I like the concept but its not a good marker for anything unless you marking something like wood.	-1
I needed this for ironing curved seams.  It is not handy and does not press the seams well.  Perhaps for other uses, it's okay.  For the close in seam pressing, it was next to useless.	-1
A piece of chalk works better. Rarely works on most fabe	-1
They are just barely okay.  The do not grip the fabric very well when using to free motion quilt.  They need larger dots that would probably increase the grip and keep the material from sliding around under your hands while free motion quilting.	-1
The bad review is because the stitching came apart in both thumbs after 30 minutes of use. When I flipped them inside out it was because the fabric was cut into the stitch line. Conversely the ring fingers had too much extra fabric. I realized the inconvenience of the gloves when I had to take them off every time I needed to do anything else besides move fabric under the needle. If I needed to adjust the bobbin tension, deal with a thread break, change colors, etc. I had to take them off which personally was annoying. I switched to the grip and stitch disks and was much happier.	-1
So terribly small. Returning them. The wrist is actually 2  inches onto my hand itself!	-1
Would never buy it again	-1
was messy. couldn't get the chalk to work properly. threw it away.	-1
Won't transfer to the material no matter how much I dab it on the stencil.	-1
This clay was good but it tended to dry out quickly.	-1
Thought this would be a great answer to marking quilt tops. Once you achieve the monumental task of 'pouncing' the chalk down into the applicator, one simply need swipe over the stencil, right? Yes, that part works, but then, by the time I had the quilt under the needle of the machine, the chalk had all but wiped off. No pattern to be seen. Quite disappointed. The company from whom this was ordered delivered in a very timely manner. No complaints about them whatsoever.	-1
Item did not perform as described.  Spent too much time stamping patterns.  Blue chalk flew everywhere was messy and chalk didn't show up on fabric.	-1
This clay is terrible and hard to work with. I really did not like it and it has a weird consistency as well.	-1
I saw a video of how to use this product on Nancy's Notions website. She made it look so easy--just tamp the applicator in the tray that comes with it, rub it over the stencil and there is your sewing line all ready to be quilted. Unfortunately it didn't work that way for me. You have to tamp the pad a lot to get the powder to work its way though the pad and it did not come through evenly even though I tried to shake the powder around to make sure it covered the whole pad. Then after I swiped it over the stencil the line was not very distinct--it had a halo around the lines. The part that really bothered me though was that the line rubbed off before I had it quilted. Just with the movement necessary to move the piece around while stitching caused enough movement to rub the chalk marks off. I don't know if there is a way to make the powder stick to the fabric better. I would not buy this product again.	-1
This is easy to use, but it is pretty slimey and the air dry is not great.	-1
Bought this for the grandchildren because I work in ceramics and they don't have the patience for the whole firing cycle. I didn't like this and neither did they. It's stiff and crumbly, not easy or pleasant to work with. Not easy to shape nor elastic enough to finish nicely. And the reason for the low rating is that the clay stinks of a terrible, unpleasant chemical smell that actually stings the eye. The ad and packaging should state that this is not appropriate for little kids and can be unpleasant for adults as well. I would never buy it again.	-1
I never used air-dry clay. I always use polymer clay. This clay had an odor I wasn't able to deal with	-1
This clay stinks, I don't like working with it.  Too firm and slippery. Hare to shape for my small ornament projects.  If you can deal with the  smell it may be okay for larger projects. I won't buy this again. I have some , not sue what to do with it.	-1
The holes don't line up properly. Its too short for an a5 page so i have to measure the sheet where to punch three holes, flip thr sheet, and remeasure to punch the bottom half.	-1
I had this for awhile and never could figure it out. It just dosen't work great. I need to purchase a different one because I hate this one so much. If you need an adjustable paper punch look somewhere else. This one is super cheap quality.	-1
I bought it, tried it for a couple of days and don't liked it ... Fortunately I was able to sell it.  Go for the other one made in Japan that can be easily adjusted to be used in different binders' sizes.	-1
not for A5...	-1
Doesn't work with the Filofax had to return. It looks like they knew it wouldnt work but kept advertising that it would.  Hopefully everyone who buys this will review it.	-1
I though this would work for my Filo Fax but it did not. This is the diary size which in my excitement I did not read. But if it wasn't for that I would totally rate this a 5 star. But alas I will probably never get to use this because I don't use anything this size.	-1
This punch is very small and it is not fully adjustable. The only thing you can do is adjust the spacing between each set of 3 holes.  You can't move each punch individually as will other fully adjustable hole punches.  Absolutely disappointed.  Oh and it will only punch in about a quarter of an inch.  Be prepared to have all your sheets rip out.	-1
This punch only punches 1 or 2 pieces of paper at a time & if the paper is larger than the punch, it doesn't work.	-1
Wrong fit	-1
Quality is great however it will not punch the 6 holes for my day timer pages. I plan on returning this item.	-1
Once you squeeze it enough for any of the paint to come out, it spurts out and you find yourself frantically cleaning up extra paint that probably won't get used. Multiple layers are required for it to work, too.	-1
Not sufficient gold glitter.	-1
Color is horrible.  More beige than gold.	-1
Not tough enough	-1
Meh...these don't have the pigmentation they should but are great for kids.	-1
I was terribly disappointed in the size of the paint "pans" - half a paint pan - I've received FREE eye shadow samples larger than these half pans! These half pans are just slightly larger than the tablets that come in the Easter Egg dye kits. sheesh. at least the colors appear to be bright and vivid and beyond "primary"...	-1
These colors are very pastel. This set is an excellent set for beginners and traveling, but I found the water needs to set on the colors for quite a while to sink in or they are not quite as bright as I had hoped.	-1
Squares too small.  Couldn't get paint on brush no matter how hard I tried.  Returned item.	-1
its nice for kids	-1
I'd been using Karat Aquarell Watercolor crayons, but the colors were limited so I figured I'd give these a try.  I used them for 2 projects then gave up.  When I drop water on each square, the water has dried up in about 10 seconds.  I am not a professional artist, but I will definitely spend a bit more on some quality products. I will definitely not be using these again.  They seem chalky and of very poor quality.  Bummer.	-1
Guess I should of listened to other reviews... Very poor quality watercolor paints. Sorry but he ones you can buy at 99 cent stores are way better!!! I got to take on a camping trip. Would return but my "window" to return item has closed says Amazon...	-1
It's okay but there is not a positive way to get the really good detail I desire.	-1
***Will update after replacement***  Received this pen, plugged it in and it tripped my GFCI outlet. And then another outlet, and finally a breaker. I have returned it and I will update my review when I have gotten a chance to use it.	-1
REYTURNED WATING FOR CREDIT READING REVIWES THE SCEWEWS DON'T WORK SAND COULBD BE DANGEROUS	-1
Tips are weak at the contact point and break very easily!	-1
Very disappointed - out of all the tips, 7 did not fit my woodburner, which is a walnut hollow wood burner. Another reviewer said they fit theirs, so I ordered them, but they are not uniformly made. Included in the ones that did not fit was the exacto knife adapter.	-1
Fell apart trying to change tip	-1
I got these tips to use with my new Walnut Hollow Creative Woodburner Pen, as they had several tips to use , but recently I used them to just play around with them and they seemed like they were poorly made, they should hold up better than that for $29.00 you would think,, but after the first time i used it today and it just doesn't seem to hold up very well. I wish I had tried it out before the return expiration, it would be returned very quickly... DON"T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!	-1
Sadly the case didn't make it through many uses.  The fasteners are so thinly made they are useless.  I have found the oils take a really long time to dry.  I won't be back.  :(	-1
I usually love royal langnickel  products and hav bought many of them in the past, including sets for painting and drawing. Usually I find the sets to be high quality and contain nice materials, paints, brushes, markers, etc. However, I was incredibly disappointed with this item...It is NOTworth the price that  paid for it, and that says something because I bought it while it was on lightning deal. Details:  Pros: The box that everything comes in seems to be pf a decent quality, it is wood. It's nicely colored, and latches well. The paints seem to be of  good quality. I haven't had any issues with them.  Cons: The brushes it came with seem to be low quality. They don't snap back when you test them, and are rather disappointing to use. They leave fibers everywhere. The paint tray that the item comes with is an incredibly flimsy, cheap, breakable tray. This is the most disappointing item of all as it was one of the main reasons I bought the set. The tray looked useful from the pictures.... It's not at all. It's horrible.  For the price, I would definitely NOT recommend this product. The quality is just sub par compared to other similar products of this type.	-1
low quality, reaaly low. charcoals don't even smudge	-1
The box just fell apart when I opened it. The brush. Holder was poorly designed. Very poor product. On the upside Amazon' return service was excellent. Also this company does make a quality product that is similar just not this one.	-1
The item arrived looking good enough but as soon as I opened it, the back of the box fell off. The more I touched it the more pieces came off.	-1
This was an affordable set of watercolors and brushes for a beginner. The first thing that happened is that the inside tray ( a paper thin plastic ) came loose... Where the paints are supposed to be held tight in place, they now flip out along with the entire tray. It's not a "neat" little kit since everything is a big mess when you've closed it up and it's a lot of trouble to get it all back where things belong. The brushes are hard to access because they have layered them with a bit of an offset. ( one part of the set is under the other part )... This is a simple kit of paints and brushes. Don't expect to be wowed or super happy - expect to get some paint and some brushed and a box. The plastic liner is what makes it cheap.	-1
the case was broken when it arrived. I was less than thrilled with it. I guess I just got a bad one...	-1
Ok	-1
I bought this for a costume i was making. i was going to use static electricity to bond it to some hard clear plastic sheets i had punched out into various shapes. the bonding worked great at first, but as i arranged the costume, the colored film  peeled off the hard plastic and fell to the floor. it became an epic fail.  i think this product would work well as stuffing for gift bags or maybe on flat surfaces, but it is too thin to use as a standalone product  - thinner than standard paper.  glue - even glue that dries clear shows through.  the package arrived promptly and undamaged, but i will probably not buy this again because i did not find it useful for the project i created.	-1
I'm dissapointed.  The product didn't meet my expectations. The paper is poor quality.  The instructions aren't clear.  The paper with the colored numbers has yellow lines and yellow numbers that are difficult to follow.  Even though you follow the "guide", the final product isn't similar as the picture showed.	-1
Uuuggghh so not what I thought it was.  Said it would hold my 14x15 folders from another company which it does not.  The bottom is tapered hello who does that. And the top storage is pointless. A big time wast of my money.  I bought three how stupid an I ???	-1
I did not know how to knit upon purchasing this book...and after many frustrating hours and needing to Youtube some "how-to's", I still don't know how to knit. This book isn't really for beginners, although it says it's a "Knitting Teacher" kit. I think maybe for people who already know the basics of knitting, this would be a handy book. The book does have some cute design ideas and it comes with all the tools needed in the book besides yarn.	-1
Before I start, please don't bother commenting that I should have read the description more closely. Maybe I should have. But I'm a distracted mom of a three-year-old and twin almost-two-year-olds and I didn't, so imagine our disappointment when I sat down with my daughter to look this over and start a project, got everything out, and realized it does not include any yarn.  "This kit contains the essentials you need to get you started knitting"  It seems to me that yarn would be one of those essentials.  I'm only marking it down to 3 stars because it doesn't *claim* to contain yarn, but, even my husband thought it was silly to make a beginner's knitting kit and not include yarn.  So, fellow distracted people-- take note: NO YARN.  Update: August - I have since purchased the Klutz learn to knit kit and am much happier with it. It not only included yarn (very pretty yarn, too), but the instructions are simpler for a beginner and let you jump right in. If you get easily frustrated learning something new, or this is for a younger person (under 20), I'd definitely get the Klutz book instead.&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Knitting-Learn-to-Knit-Six-Great-Projects-Klutz/dp/0545561671/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Knitting: Learn to Knit Six Great Projects (Klutz)</a>  Further Update (September) - I have completed the first Klutz project and am looking for something harder, so I went to this book. I still find the instructions confusing, the language very jargon-y, and the skill levels overestimated. It goes from a simple garter stitch pillow to the lacy baby blanket (beginner, to easy). Maybe the blanket is easier than it looks. I'll continue to report back. It may be easier if you have someone helping you learn, but if you're totally on your own learning from scratch, I still do not recommend this book.  Further Update (December) - Started baby blanket on September 11. Still have not finished. As promised, it's not entirely as hard as it looks, but knitting that many stitches and that many rows for a beginner takes a looooooooong time. I'm about halfway through, and completed two baby hats and almost finished a scarf in the meantime. I reiterate that if you are trying to learn completely solo self-taught, this book is not the best to start on. For $13 and change, though, it's not a bad deal just for the needles and other accessories it comes with. Major oversight not including a crochet hook.	-1
These drawers are extremely tiny. You can fit one roll of ribbon as long as it's the right sized ribbon.	-1
Way to expensive for a tiny case. I must have missed the size when I read about it. Made well but mini.	-1
they were good but I though it was bigger. I got it to hold card stock paper in and I thought by the picture it was large. I did not look at the measurments because if I had I would not have gotten it. When it arrived I was very disappointed. I tried to see if it would work but it is so small it would not hold much of anything.	-1
Too small, I sent it back	-1
The eraser in this product is almost big enough to see, but far short of big enough to use by itself!  It measure 1" X 3/4".  The charcoal pencils are 2B, 4B, and 6B.  I find that the shading is difficult to tell apart.  Each level shades the same as each of the other levels unless I vary the pressure considerably.  The white charcoal pencil feels more like chalk than charcoal.  I'm sadly disappointed in this product.  This is only my second time buying General pencils and perhaps the last.  The first time was yesterday at Jo-Ann's but those General Layout pencils seem very good.	-1
When I used the first brush, the bristles were falling out and messed up my project.	-1
Too many bristles are left on canvas!	-1
Half were broken Half had sticky worn off Junk	-1
It's more a packing issue. The colors are awesome, I can tell cos they colored all over the carton :)  Bought them together with the water colors because price was attractive for a party pack, now I can't do a return because I just noticed the international shipping fees cost much than the actual products.  Amazon needs to do something about the packing, can you imagine my surprise when I see the crayons all over the box?	-1
I thought the color wheel would have more to it. I thought it was limited for what I needed it for.	-1
It doesn't adjust very well and it's basically just a holder to a fixed position. I'm going to build a better one myself though.	-1
I've used liquitex gesso before and liked it.  The clear gesso was disgusting.  I bought it to prep a wood piece and it was gritty- I could brush it off with my fingers. Throwing the bottle away.	-1
It does what it is supposed to do, I just do not like the feel. I ordered this one when the one I wanted would take too long. It did take 3 coats for marker not to bleed through my bible page. Very rough/toothy feel.	-1
Really bad smell!	-1
This product was a rubber solid when I opened it to use.  Very disappointed.  I was not able to use it at all and am not able to return it.  I loss my money on this product.	-1
Where did my acrylic  pour cells go? I expected more from Liquitex. I will update if I find I'm just on the dark side of a learning curve.	-1
Because the title says prep protector I thought this was the clear gesso, it's not. Don't be fooled, it's regular white gesso.	-1
Black glitter in goop. You can see the flecks in some paint but not others (can't see it in white, but fine in purple, etc).  That would make it mediocre, but what makes it bad is trying to get the glitter out of my brushes! After two hours in multiple cleaning methods they STILL have glitter in them!  The only way I've been able to get some of the glitter out is by flicking the brush hairs, but that ends up ruining the brushes!  The pictures are after trying to get them clean.	-1
Strange product.  It has a weird consistency -- kinda like if you chopped up jello. Years ago, Liquitex acrylic retarder was a smooth flowing clear product kinda like a tube of paint. This product requires attention to mixing so that it the chunks dissolve, and it gets equally mixed (easier with a palate knife and squishing this into the paint.  It *very slightly* adds to acrylic dry times. Let me explain: If straight acrylic paint is workable for 5 minutes and dries in 15minutes, then (adding a ratio of 1/4 this product to the amount of paint) makes paint workable for 6-7minutes (tops) and dries in >2 hours. What you want from a retarder is to increase your workable time, and this product isn't very effective in that regard. I will try a different product next.	-1
Good luck opening this thing. Set my husband off into a fit of profanity.	-1
WAY,way, too pale.. I know this says muted not even sub titles would help w/this... might be good on a dark paper but personally I don't like it on regular white paper....	-1
Ran Out of Ink	-1
They dry out rather quickly... I only had 4 posters to do and one of each of three colors was already drying out and two of the blacks I couldn't use.	-1

I really love this shade, but there's something about it that pisses me off. There are at least two pigments that go into this color, one's kind of a teal and the other is kind of a lavender. when used in it's full concentration this color is great. If you try to blend it out or  dilute it to much with colorless blender, or as I do for larger areas, alcohol in a spray bottle, the teal-ish pigment will stain where you laid it down, and the lavender-ish pigment will spread out. this really pissed me off on this one piece I was commissioned for and it took a great deal of darkening the entire thing to camouflage it out the best I could. I just want to prevent you from making the same mistake.	-1
The Basic is way too thin for me. The price is great, but not the quality.	-1
The silver color was not great. It was really pale and didn't show up.	-1
caused air bubbles in the paint...tried different paints and amounts same results.. if someone has answer or solution let it be known.	-1
The color is very off.  Cobalt should be a deep blue.  This ink is a very light cyan (like your blue printer ink only more pale).  It is also very thin.  I can maybe use this like watercolor.	-1
This ink is a lot thinner and lighter than I expected.  I thought it would be a nice dark burnt sienna that I could spray for cool effects on my watercolor.  It's a VERY light. It almost looks like watered down tea.	-1
Soapy paint. Not useful for project when using spatula is needed. Mostly for small pieces with fine brushes.	-1
I love Liquitex Basics acrylics and use them all the time - in the TUBES.  I ordered this jar because I wanted to mix a fairly large amount of a custom color and thought it would make things easier - but what I received was solidified paint.  If I hadn't wanted to save the container I could have cut it away and I would have been left with a jar-shaped mass of Cadmium Red Deep Hue.  As it is, I was able to pull the rubbery paint out of the jar with a screw driver and the paint remained all one solid piece.  I'll upload photos if/when I can.  So, Liquitex, you need to go back to the drawing board regarding how you're sealing these jars.	-1
I tried this in two different Epson printers with the same results - the paper jammed almost every time. Those few times when it did not jam and actually printed, the ink came out so wet that it ran a bit - this was with Epson's premium inks - only the lowest quality print setting (text) came out with out ink puddles.  I had bought two packages and have returned them both to Amazon. Very disappointed.	-1
I have been buying these paints for years and they have started to explode out the back of the tube. I contacted the company and they refuse to fix the issue. initially they will work and then..bam out the back the paint comes and makes a huge mess. Good pant but bad container.	-1
Couldn't print on it.	-1
Product description clearly shows the bottle as having a Spider picture on it...this is the waterproof Indian Ink that I thought I had purchased, however the ink that arrived had a picture of a dragon on the label and was NOT waterproof.  Will be returning for refund.	-1
First time user, so might has been a user error. However, I didn't get great results. I followed the directions, and the paint part went well. But the after it dried the fabric was very, very stiff and unfortunately not able to be washed easily. Probably won't be attempted the painting fabric thing again. Let me add that I am an extremely crafty person. Where I do use acrylic paints ALL the time, I've never painted fabric before. I didn't care for MY results to reuse.	-1
This color I received is nothing like the color you see here... it is much more green.. no blue.. not turquoise at all :(	-1
I used it with acrylic paint and for me it dosnt make enough of a difference for me to buy it again.	-1
Used this product on  100 hundred percent cotton. Left the fabric stiff and scratchy.  I was really disappointed. My intention was to use this for painting on baby quilts.  Tried on other cotton blends same result. Won't use it again.	-1
Sorry I bought this. The tracer only accrues a picture the size of 4x6. Using the max watt bulb the image is hazy and too light even in bed room with blinds and that's with the tracer 1.5 or 2 ft away from the wall. It's very hard to trace the iimage, it's just to faint.  The cost is not worth it.	-1
I should have known based on the price that this would be disappointing paint. Acrylic should cover the surface as an opaque color. This does not. I probably won't use this except to mix paint and change shade. Would not buy again.	-1
Not worth the effort.	-1
