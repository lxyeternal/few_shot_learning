I've been using Dreamweaver (and it's predecessor Macromedia's UltraDev) for many years.  For someone who is an experienced web designer, this course is a high-level review of the CS5 version of Dreamweaver, but it doesn't go into a great enough level of detail to find it very useful.  On the other hand, this is a great tool for someone who is a relative novice at web design.  It starts off with a basic overview of HTML and continues through the concepts necessary to build a modern web site.  Someone who goes through this course should exit with enough knowledge to create something that does what you want it do do...within reason.  Don't expect to go off and build an entire e-commerce system with only this class under your belt.  It's important to note that there's a long gap from site design to actual implementation.  This course teaches you how to implement a design.  The user interface and overall user experience is a different subject that isn't covered here...it's possible to do a great implementation of an absolutely abysmal design.  I speak from experience.  :)  As I said above, if you're a novice, a relative newcomer or just an experienced web designer who wants a refresher course, this is a good way to do it.	1
The demo is done with the PC version, with references to the Mac version when needed. The video is closed-captioned. You can set bookmarks. There are self-tests for each chapter as well.  Starts off with "what is HTML" and some other basic stuff. Includes topics such as: Planning your Website; Defining a site in DW; Creating a new web page; Adding Text; Formatting with CSS; Images and rich media; Links; Page layout w/ CSS; Tables; Forms; Reusable Content; Testing; etc. Each section has sub-sections with their own video, and some have sub-sub-sections to flesh out the material, such as the one regarding project management, or CSS, which includes discussion of CSS for print. It is not, however, a tutorial on "the best way to lay out a site using CSS" or anything like that. For that, you'll need a book or two on that subject.  She has a site that has some helpful resources, e.g. checklists for project management and site development, and helpful URLs. All in all, it's a decent introduction to creating web sites.  She sounds weird, though, like a robot (or Stephen Hawking's voicebox) with her halting, clipped delivery. She tends to be slightly chatty and repeat material, but it's not that bad; could be helpful for retention for people new to the subject.  UI - at the top of the interface, there's a "Previous Video" button and "Next Video" button. The "Next Video" button is disabled for the last video of each chapter, so to get to the next one you'll have to use other navigation. This is because the last item is the test. Kinda dumb UI choice, initially confusing. They could have changed it to read "Take Test" instead of putting up a virtual dead end. There is a sidebar which is normally hidden (you are cued that you can display it when the mouse strays into the video area), which has information on the current video and lists/links to the other videos in the chapter. The title bar (under the top-left tabs) is a dropdown to navigate the content.  There's a "Watch and Work" mode which shrinks the video display to let you work with your copy of DreamWeaver (not included). You can move the video window around BUT you CANNOT resize it - and it may be kind of tiny to watch in that mode. So if you have a dual monitor setup, you'll want to drag the Standard Mode video player to the other screen; Standard Mode cannot be resized to be smaller, either.  All in all, a good value if you want to learn DreamWeaver.	1
If you've been wanting to learn how to create your own website, but have either lacked the confidence or knowledge, this affordable combination book and video course will enable you to learn at your own leisure.  There are more than twelve hours of video training included in this package, most of it split up in the small, absorbable sections.  This courseware is "Certified Associate," approved courseware.  Dreamweaver is the premier product for website creation.  It offers several new advantages/features for the user.  It has improved dynamic applications, new CSS features that offer more control over your design, you can turn individual CSS properties on and off (you can see how they affect your designs), and you can fuse box model elements to troubleshoot directly within Dreamweaver.  If you are confident this DVD/book bundle is for you, you can simply bypass this review or read some shorter versions (this is a very long review).  If not, keep on reading.  With this software you'll learn a lot of basics, however, if you are already a web designer or have a lot of experience, you may find a lot of the material to be redundant.  On the other hand, if you are anxious to learn web design, this is the perfect place to start.  Taking a course can cost you a lot of $, but this course is quite affordable ... if you decide it is not for you, then you can hand it along to someone else.  You'll be getting more than twelve hours of video training from "Adobe Certified Instructors", a reference book, lesson files, and you can copy certain files to your iPhone, iPod, or iPad.  For the hearing impaired the script to the dialogue runs along the bottom as the narrator speaks. You can stop the video at any time to get a closer look at what is being done and/or absorb the material.  At the end of each section is a "test" to enable you to know just how you are progressing on each section.  If you are in a bookstore you can easily pick up a copy and glance at the book, but you cannot see what is on the DVD.  I'll try to describe what is on the DVD to the buyer can get a good understanding of what is on there and can decide if Adobe Dreamweaver CS5 is what they need. I've simply listed the few words under the contents and have tried to briefly explain what you'll be learning on the videos.  CONTENTS:  1) HTML Refresher - This is an excellent section for someone who already knows HTML, but could use a refresher in the form of a "crash course."

You'll also be treated to four bonus videos.  This was a long review, but hopefully anyone looking for core training in web communication will now know exactly what they will receive when they purchase this program.	1
I've been creating websites with Dreamweaver for years now, and all that experience has taught me one thing - I'm a hack web designer.  Recently I have been trying to learn industry CSS standards and had heard that Dreamweaver has made great advances in CSS management in CS4 and CS5. I'm embarrassed to say what version I am using.  When I got a chance to get a reviewer copy of this training set I jumped for two reasons, first I was mulling over spending the money to upgrade to DW CS5 and I second I have always that I was missing out on a lot of DW's capabilities.  It's now obvious that I should upgrade for the CSS management upgrades alone.  As for the value of the training - I couldn't be happier.  This is not an advanced tips and tricks resource, nor is it an exhaustive boot camp in web page authoring, but it is a fairly thorough training taking you from site planning and design to creation and publishing.  I watched the videos from beginning to end and they start pretty basic with an HTML refresher then move to the meatier DW specific training.  I can see myself returning to several sections later to brush up.  Personally, the CSS, Media, and Forms training videos were enough to justify the price tag.  The training lessons were short and easily digestible.  I liked that it broke training into 3-10 minutes so I had some time to do a little more in-depth googling on subjects like text wrapping on absolute positioned CSS objects (which it won't.) or checking my version of DW.    What this is   - An Adobe Certification Training Aid - so it starts from a very low level introduction and  goes through the entire DW web creation process   - A wonderfully designed interface   - A great overview of using DW  What it isn't   - A substitute for spending the time working with DW (but it will jump start a novice)   - An expert tips and tricks reference  All in all, I highly recommend this to anyone trying to learn DW or even web design in general. The CSS placement section has been the most enlightening coverage of the topic I have been able to find.  The author's delivery on the videos is great and the interface is the best, most intuitive I have seen. The only bad thing I can say is that the closed captioning is defaulted on, so at times it covered the bottom of the properties table at the bottom of the screen. So sometimes I had to close it to see things the author was pointing out.  But all in all, this is an absolutely wonderful product.	1
I decided (after trying a number of other products) to switch to the gold standard of web site management, Dreamweaver. I bought a few books, did some Lynda courses and still found myself wanting more. This was the perfect product for that "more".  I think some reviewers are confused about both Dreamweaver and this product - these aren't for "design". If you don't already know what you want to do, picking up Dreamweaver is not going to help! The product being reviewed here is how to use Dreamweaver - not how to design for the web. Both expect you already have the design part.  I used a pure HTML editor, which for beginners is the best way to go. You'll learn HTML and CSS along with exactly how your code changes your page. DW is more for time savings and automation. That said, it's also massively complex with a steep learning curve. And that's where Learn Adobe Dreamweaver comes in. It very clearly takes you through learning DW so that you can get on with designing web pages.  Excellent addition to my library and excellent companion to Dreamweaver itself. The only other thing you might need is one of the large reference books on DW to refer back to if you have questions.	1
The video is well-paced and delivered in an understandable manner.  It allows you to work with the software while watching and following the directions of instructor Candyce Mairs.  To me, the book is more of a reference guide, something I would access with a specific need or question, because overall I learn better by seeing and doing than by reading.  The video starts with the basics and builds logically.  This is everything you want in a teaching video/book!	1
I spent several hours on the lesson and I love it. It is very detailed and very clear. The instructions with the graph and the audio and the video playback is very nice. You can cut or repeat any lesson you need and come back and review at your convenience. The lesson starts with very fundamental knowledge of what an URL is and allow the students to know what is the source code, the layout and how to use the tools and maneuver in the Dreamweaver app. It is an excellent tool to have. Most of us uses some of the tools but not all of the tools.  Some I don't even know the function was there. It is nice to have a teacher like this I can go to easily without calling expensive tech support. Highly recommend this teaching series.	1
I have had Dreamweaver MX2004 since it came out back then. Spent years with it. Feel like I know it real well, but I am still familiar with tables as opposed to CSS. So I thought this would be a great introduction, and it is. The problem is that while I am looking at the video, and that simplifies things a lot, I am not getting the intuitive explanation as to why things work the way they do. I understand just knowing how to work them is sufficient. I'm tempted to delve into the rich full attributes of Dreamweaver CS5 as explained by this video, albeit difficult to understand the more advanced features, but I won't because this is about the video.  The opening salvo is chock full of... for example, this is the URL; this is where you type in the address bar etc. Only when you start to get into areas such as CSS do you get an introduction that for me is beneficial, and that is only because I am somewhat of a newbie to it. So there you have it, do you get an advanced lesson that flies through things and most find it hard to understand, or do you get this one and appreciate the fact that she walks you through everything step by step, even at the risk of boring the more in the know people, but finally arriving at the section you need to learn, and then appreciate that she is not moving at lightning speed.  I'm holding off buying Dreamweaver CS5, although I got the upgrade to Photoshop CS5 and love it, because my MX2004 is not an eligible upgrade version. If I could qualify for the upgrade I would grab it, but the learning curve of CSS, and the steep price for the full version when I have MX2004 already is giving me some hesitation. If I was to upgrade, or should I say take the leap to the full version, this tutorial is the one I would use, and I also recommend the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Adobe-Dreamweaver-CS5-on-Demand/dp/0789744449/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Adobe Dreamweaver CS5 on Demand</a>&nbsp;which makes a very good reference guide. At some point I will get the new version of CS5 Dreamweaver, and at that point I will do the entire video series, and have a much more in depth analysis of it. But from what I can see after viewing a bunch of the video tutorials, it is the easiest way to indoctrinate you to the newest version. So I recommend it.	1
I have also taken a local community college on-line course on DreamWeaver CS5 training. This video in comparison is quite a bit better in terms of the rich contents and course layout. The video has 17 sections covering the key elements of CS5 which allow the user to learn how to create a local web site from scratch and uploading it to the server. Each section is also broken down to several 3-6 minutes sub-sections which is just right in terms of the duration. At the end of each section there is also a test available to make sure you get a good understanding of the materials.  There are also some other additional useful features such as real-time caption and bookmarks which allows us to jump to our favorite section easily.  All in all, this is a great product for the price.	1
Even though I use Dreamweaver a great deal and own several books on the subject, I found this set very helpful. Candyce Mairs takes you through everything, from opening the program and setting up your desktop to creating a site. The focus is on the software, not on CSS or HTML or web design, so you'll end up with a through understanding of just how the software is designed to work.  The videos are brief, with clear screenshots and step by step narration which is subtitled. When occasionally the narrator makes a small error ("Fireworks" for "Firefox," say), the subtitles correct it. The pace is slow but focused and always on task -- no rambling or making and fixing errors on screen.  Since each video looks at just one issue, it's very easy to find your way back if you feel confused. I like the "Watch and work" option, too, which lets you keep the video running in the corner of your screen so that you can work along with the video.  New features of CS5 are pointed out in detail, not only in the video training but in the accompanying booklet, which also has tables of keyboard shortcuts, a glossary, and lots of example code.  If you're upgrading and want to master the new features immediately or if you usually hand code and want to get to know all the timesaving features of Dreamweaver, this is exactly what you need. If you're a moderately skilled web designer and would like to increase your skills, improving your ability to use Spry, for example, this is an excellent choice. It's probably not enough for the absolute beginner -- you'll still need to learn HTML and CSS and web design theory, but this is the best I've seen for using Dreamweaver in particular.	1
As someone who has just upgraded from Lightroom version 2 to the new version 3, I got this to bring me up to speed on the new features. I thought I would just watch the video clips on the new items as I needed them. Boy was I wrong... this is so good that I ended up watching every one of them from start to finish.  This package consists of a DVD and a small book. The book has a chapter on being a better photographer and another introducing the new features of Lightroom 3. The DVD contains the videos and a dedicated video player.  You can either use Internet Explorer or the player to view the content. My recommendation is to use the player.  It's full featured... a nice menu system, resizing for the screen, and the normal control buttons (stop, pause, play, etc.). The nicest feature of the player is the "Work Along" mode. In this mode, the video plays in a small window while you're working in Lightroom. This lets you try the commands along with the video.  Video and audio quality is excellent. The 2 instructors do a great job. They don't get over technical and keep a good pace. Not only do they present the material, they also give examples of how they use a Lightroom feature or command in their own workflow. This product would be perfect for someone new to Lightroom or a seasoned user looking to learn the new version.	1
Adobe approved "Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 3, Learn by Video" is the absolutely best method of learning Lightroom 3 that I've found. It's one on one training presented by Tim Grey and Mikkel Aaland. The program truly has just about everything to get you up and running full hilt. You'll progress from the very beginning of setting Lightroom up to importing photos, developing them, exporting them and everything in between. It does not contain everything that anyone would want in an educational program - that would be a practical impossibility. However, this program contains 10 hours of video training: you hear how a procedure occurs and you see how it's done, along with advice and opinion. There's even a testing procedure included and reference booklet. You can also copy selected video tutorials. I've had and have been using Adobe Lightroom for a couple years and recently upgraded to Lightroom 3. I've books written about Lightroom 3 by well known authors but I found reading about it was just a little too tedious and finally decided to find out how to make it work for me. This program works, it did for me and frankly I believe it's the best program available.	1
This is a greate collection of videos on the disk.  Most of the videos are between 2 and 6 minutes, The index allows you to quickly jump to a video that you want to review. The video goes from an introduction, to what is new in Lightroom 3. The videos cover working with the workflow, creating slideshows, and more.  I would recommend going to the authors website to get even more information on Lightroom  At this low of a cost it is a no brainer.  I highly recommed this to anyone who is just starting with Lightroom or those who ahve worked with it for a while	1
I am not an avid Lightroom user, although I have used it many times.  I have always wanted to dive into the tools and techniques of the software more and this video series has definitely put me on the right track.  The series does an excellent job of not only giving you a general tour and reference to what is available in Lightroom, but also diving into more important aspects that you do not pick up on out of the gate.  Watching the entire video in one sitting is probably not feasible since it's ten hours of content.  In fact, finding the time to watch the entire ten hours at all might be difficult.  Don't be fooled though as any time you invest in going through this video will improve your usage of Lightroom.  It really depends on what you want out of Lightroom.  If you are just wanting some simple organization and editing you won't need this video or certainly won't need all of it.  If you would like to dive into the publishing aspects and really optimizing your workflow, then this would be a good investment for you.	1
I am a long time user of Photoshop Lightroom, from the first version. I used to use Photoshop to manage and edit digital images, but switched to LR totally from then. LR is relatively user-friendly, you need very little instruction to get started. I never had any training, book or instructions of anykind, but always felt efficient with the software.  Well, I think it is great that I now have access to this training video. It was kind of long (10 hrs.), so finding the time to watch them was a challenge. Especially for me, as I already know how to use the software. But of course, you will pick up things that you don't know before or how to do it better. And it is true. I learned more than I expected. So no matter how experienced you are or how user-friendly the software is, you will definitely gain something from it.  If you are a new user of LR, it could be a little intimidating. If you are a casual user who only need to manage your photo and run slideshow, you don't need this video. But if you want more like publishing, converting and optimizing images, I recommend this training video.	1
The "Learn by Video" program for Flash CS5 would make a nice alternative to an introductory book - especially for visual learners.  I'd worked through the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Adobe-Flash-Professional-CS5-Classroom-in-a-Book/dp/0321701801/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Adobe Flash Professional CS5 Classroom in a Book</a>&nbsp;- and found that to be more comprehensive in its coverage, but there is a different emphasis here and I found I learned quite a bit that I didn't know or that wasn't clear before.  The little booklet that comes with the guide is an extremely useful introduction to design principles that are essential to effective working in Flash.  There are several chapters on different introductory-level topics in Flash CS5.  Each is broken up into different sections, and usually these can be completed in under ten minutes each.  That makes this easy to work through in short sections.  You can set bookmarks to remember where you left off - although it would be nicer if the program saved your progress directly and remembered for you where you left off.  The exposition is clear, but perhaps a bit dry.  There's no hint of humor here, and I always find it helps to make verbal lessons a bit more interesting and memorable.  Each section tells you what you are going to learn, gives you an explanation and a tutorial you can follow along using one of the project files included on the dvd, and then explains what you have learned.  The focus here is on learning how things work and what things mean at a fairly basic level.  You don't get very advanced, and by the end of things you'd really just have a rough idea of how things work in Flash, but it is very clear.  They assume a listener who is just getting started with Flash, and, while the lessons are sequential and they build upon each other, they remind you what you've learned and how to do things several times.  Sometimes that's a bit frustrating - in a beginner's level textbook it's easy just to skim through the repetition when it is familiar - with video it's harder to skim through what is inessential without missing the important bits.  That's one reason to prefer something like the "Classroom in a Book" series, rather than the Video Classroom approach.  One thing I got here more clearly than in the "Classroom in a Book" for Flash CS5 is an emphasis on best practices - how to manage projects so as to be completely clear, and how that helps to achieve control over the project.  There is more explanation here - more whys behind the hows.  I thought the chapter on Action Script was excellent for giving a clear concept of how it works as an "object based" language - even though you'd only be able to do some very rudimentary things after working through the entire chapter, you'd have a pretty decent understanding of how the language works and a good basis for further learning.  There are video files on the disk that allow you to follow along on what they show you in the tutorials.  One thing they don't make clear is that to work with them you have to copy the assets folder to your hard drive and open and work with the projects there.  (I find it most convenient to backup the entire dvd to my hard drive and play it from there - since that means it's available and ready whenever I want to work through a section, and it also helps to protect the original disk from scratching).  Overall, it's a good introduction to Flash and the emphasis on "Best Practices" serves as a useful complement to the "how to" guides you can find in other introductory Flash books.  I do have a few minor gripes:  the navigation through the chapter files is not as intuitive as I'd like: there are sections and subsections, and you can go to the next section in a chapter by clicking the "Next Video" button.  But: when you get to the end of a subsection, the "Next Video" button is not enabled and you have to go back to the main index and then open up the chapter index again to get to the next section in the chapter.  Several words in the projects are misspelt (e.g. "Hawaiin" instead of "Hawaiian"), and I also noticed that at least one of the project files they encourage you to use was missing (the "inverseKinematics_start.fla" file from chapter 9).  Still, the guide as a whole is very helpful and clear - and the emphasis on design principles in the included booklet makes this a very helpful overview and introduction to a rich and complicated program.	1
The presenter here sounds much more natural than the semi-robotic delivery found in the DreamWeaver tutorial product.  The lessons are broken up into easily digested 3-5 minute chunks, covering aspects of Flash from project planning and defining customer needs to an introduction to ActionScript fundamentails. Although it does not deal with programming in detail, it does cover basic concepts of object-oriented programming, variables, conditional statements, and functions. The rest covers working with artwork and text; library and symbols; layers, timeline, animation, and tweens; working with files, sound and video. You'll learn the fundamentals; you won't learn how to create those fancy user interfaces on those fancy sites; that's for a more advanced class.  As with other products in this series, there are some usability issues. At the top of the interface, there's a "Previous Video" button and "Next Video" button. The "Next Video" button is disabled for the last video of each chapter, so to get to the next one you'll have to use other navigation. This is because the last item is the test. Kinda dumb UI choice, initially confusing. They could have changed it to read "Take Test" instead of putting up a virtual dead end. There is a sidebar which is normally hidden (you are cued that you can display it when the mouse strays into the video area), which has information on the current video and lists/links to the other videos in the chapter. The title bar (under the top-left tabs) is a dropdown to navigate the content.  There's a "Watch and Work" mode which shrinks the video display to let you work with your copy of DreamWeaver (not included). You can move the video window around BUT you CANNOT resize it - and it may be kind of tiny to watch in that mode. So if you have a dual monitor setup, you'll want to drag the Standard Mode video player to the other screen; Standard Mode cannot be resized to be smaller, either.  All in all it's a good way to get started in Flash programming, if you don't have the patience for going through a book. Know what to expect; you'll learn the basics, but you'll need to carry on the learning process yourself, by seeking out more advanced information or learning materials.	1
This certified associate courseware comes as a package containing a DVD-ROM plus supplemental written material. The software covered is Flash CS5. It is structured in an easy to follow manner.  It is very detailed and goes over most situations that can/will occur when using Flash CS5.  It covers the very basics and this might be off-putting to people with experience using MS Windows. The presentation voices are modulated and interesting. They are personable and the viewer gets an, "in classroom," feel which improved the effectiveness of the lessons for me.  Some people learn better by working along with the instructor. This video course provides the necessary files to do this and complete the tutorial as it is watched.  The narrator leaves plenty of time for this.  For those who learn best by listening and watching the pace of presentation designed for working along with the presentation it will seem to move slowly. The supplemental material is a good reference for after you have completed the video lesson.  The video creates a foundation of basic skills needed and the reference reinforces the lesson.  The materials are a good reference to use while one is using the program.  All in all I found this lesson to be a useful introduction to using Flash CS5. This course helped me to learn skills that I can use in web development. For people like myself who learn better, especially at the begining in with a presentation format this provides a faster route to getting foundation skills to build upon with reference texts.	1
This was the first Learn by Video series course that I've used, and I'm very impressed with the production.  For the most part I'm impressed with the content too, although the introductory level was frustrating at times.  The course provides a good introduction to the  CS5 user interface, the Flash tools, file types, and managing the timeline.  There's also a very basic chapter that introduces ActionScript (AS3), which is the coding language used to create complex logic in a Flash application. The AS3 material is extremely basic--too basic in my opinion.  Again, I like the production of this video package. The videos can be played in Windows, Mac, or Linux. There are also MP4 versions of the video files, in case you want to view them on a portable device (iPod Touch, iPhone, iPad, etc.). This is helpful if you want to view the videos and work hands-on on your computer, although the small screen would be difficult.  The DVD also includes a collection of asset files that correspond with the lessons.  If you are a visual learner or don't prefer thick technical books, then this video course would be a good low-cost alternative. Don't expect to be a Flash expert when you complete this course, but at least you'll understand the basic concepts.	1
Excel: Does not allow you to copy and paste sometimes. I later found out it's related to having many Excels open. Clicking the lower edge of a cell will navigate to the end of the sheet. Does not allow you to paste into visible cells only, despite having this setting selected. Shortening long numbers by default Does not save, unable to edit a cell. Freezes. Constantly freezes, unable to copy, close, or open anything. The only way out is to close all the windows and restart, or end task. Mangles special characters and eff me over on more than a few occasions. Why would the default encoding be Western instead of UTF-8?? Returning false positive in Conditional Formating when highlighting duplicate values. Opening a new window will minimize it (the new window)  Outlook: Minimizes a newly opened window. Folder pane disappears for no reason, unable to go back to Mail from Calendar. Cannot search for emails using part of the senders domain, would have to provide the entire domain. It updated and then it says "this app can't run on your pc" Run indexing in the middle of the day, preventing search results to fully return. Crashes constantly.	-1
Microsoft Office is still the standard all the rest are compared to.  Office 365 is a great value when you consider the licensing options for standalone packages.  You might be tempted to use a free online office solution, but you'll be disappointed.  The cost and licensing options for this software are a bargain compared to the cost of owning the package on the same machines, and keeping them upgraded.	1
Been using Office for over twenty years.  Still not worth the money.  Buggy, and easily corrupted. Outlook is all messed up. This is fourth year on 365.  Thought I could just click "renew" somewhere, pay, and be done with it.  Took for ever to finally find the right Office site, tried to renew, but couldn't as I didn't buy originally from there.  So I came here, bought it, and spent a good bit of time trying to figure out where to enter the key.  Ended up being where I couldn't buy but could enter the key.  My goal this year is to sever from MS completely after getting my first PC in '86.  I don't think there is anything they sell that can't be had for free elsewhere.  You'd think after being in business almost thirty-five years they get it right.	-1
Always liked Office Products.  Expensive for a retiree but worth it for everything I do.	1
I have been using MS Office professional for decades. This latest version simply provides the top version in the most convenient, automatically updated, and economical format. The annual subscription renews the app on all 5 machines for a year, for under $100 ($20 per year per PC or device). I have had a number of scary moments with the Outlook component, but each was quickly fixed by the readily-available Microsoft telephone service for this product (I let them take over my machine and they quickly fix it in less than 10 minutes). Frankly, this telephone service deserves more than five stars--competing at a near-perfect level, despite competing support elsewhere in the software market being scandalously poor.	1
This is really a great buy.  It breaks down to a full MS Office software suite for 5 computers plus 1TB of online storage.  The storage alone is worth the price.  Well worth $100 per year, or less than $10 per month.	1
The software is well known and excellent.  It provides at least ten times the capabilities I need.  The annual licenses are reasonable in cost since they amount to $20 per user.  The licenses are easy to manage.  I used this one-year package to extend an existing license.  It took perhaps two minutes to access the website and enter the license key.  I like that the added license extended the current license from the end of the previous license - no time is lost.  This is not true with Norton Security, for example.  With Norton Security renewals are a timing hassle.	1
The bottom line:  I like this deal much better than trying to buy an Office 365 license outright from Microsoft because it's cheaper, you get more, and you have a lot more options.  The full review: More to the point though, Office has become a different animal than it was.  In the long run, Office 365 is a better deal than buying a downloadable, installable product--because you *get* a downloadable, installable product with this deal.  So what exactly are you getting here?  This package is the ability to use the latest version of Office in the browser--meaning, if you're on a machine that doesn't have Office installed, you can log into your Microsoft account (required) and use browser-based versions of all the Office apps.  This also means that the online storage place called "OneDrive" (formerly known as "SkyDrive") can be used to store up to one TeraByte (1,000GB) of stuff, anything you like, private or public or just shared out as you wish.  It's ALSO the ability to download and install Office 2013 OR Office 2016, on up to 5 machines, for up to 4 people!  That's the cool part.  In the past, you might have to buy more than one copy of Office, or be the sole user, or only put it on a desktop and a laptop.  Now I can put this on my desktop, laptop, and Surface Pro, then install it on my wife's PC and my daughter can also have a copy installed to use.  I've been running Office 2016 for the most part and have been pretty happy with the way it works.  2016 is not hugely different from 2013 or 2010, just in little ways.  This package lets you use Office for a year.  You can buy two or three and stack them to prolong your subscription (if you're afraid the price of Office will go up) or you can extend your subscription to more people (in case you have a bunch of kids and want to add mom and dad and grandma into the number of users).  I added a year using this code.  It was only easy to do because I looked online first for HOW to do it.  Which brings us to the only real drawback to Office 365:  anything to do with the browser.  The browser-based apps try to be as much like the desktop as possible, but they're still not quite the same.  OneNote is probably the closest match I've seen, while Outlook is the ugliest and least useful.  The fact that the browser-based versions run in Azure ("the Cloud", a.k.a., "on the Internet") means that they typically run a bit slower, depending on your Internet connection.  OneDrive is more annoying to manage using the browser, so I find myself using a computer to do most of the work like uploading files/folders, creating new folders, etc.  I use the browser-based OneDrive interface to download individual stuff or share stuff out to people.  The entire browser interface is trying to do the "Kanban" look that you also see in Windows 8's "Metro-now-called-Modern" apps and parts of Windows 10's look and feel.  My rule of thumb is that the browser-based Office is for small tasks on the go, but for anything substantial I go with the PC.  You also have to use the Office website to mange things like who you share Office with, or how you download.  They make it annoyingly over-complicated to download the 64-bit version of Office if you don't want to use the 32-bit.  You have to choose "Install-->Language and Install Options-->Additional Install Options--> then pick the specific 64-bit version you want.  There's no good reason to bury the better-performing version that far down except that they hope it prevents tech support complications.  The Home Subscription is: Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, Outlook, and a 1TB bump-up to OneDrive, up to 4 people across 5 machines. The Personal Subscription is the same, but only for one individual user, on up to 5 machines. The Business version has a lot of other options *and* things to consider when choosing.  Overall, I find this a much better deal than shelling out a few hundred dollars up front and knowing the next version will require me to buy it again, and I don't get the benefit of the added OneDrive storage space.  With this price, it's cheaper and I will always have the option of downloading the latest version of Office or sticking with the one I have.  The browser-based versions I consider an afterthought, or "bonus feature" - I wouldn't rely solely on those for everyday work.  And I would like to see managing the subscriptions and installs get a bit easier.	1
I have this running on my Macbook Air and two HP laptops. Set up took less than 3 minutes. It is a one year subscription which is totally fine with me considering it averages out to $20 per year.	1
not that easy to understand or install, documentation should be better.	1
Works well! Use for Outlook and Word, Excel!	1
What can you say great product.	1
Has been very helpful.	1
Complete rubbish! I got this with an Acer aspire laptop and installed it. There is no shortcut and double clicking the file does nothing. All previous versions of Office have worked, but this is rubbish and the is no manual or proper instructions. Microsoft had gone way downhill. If you can come up with any alternative, get that instead.	-1
As soon as the iPad Office 365 apps got released and I saw them in action, I knew I wanted to upgrade my Office to Office 365. I was able to save quite a bit of money over buying the subscription through the App Store or directly through Microsoft by buying this subscription key card.  The apps run beautifully on my two windows pcs and my ipads. By keeping all of my documents in sync across devices by saving them on Microsoft OneDrive (20GB included for free), I have seen a great increase in my productivity. I was in the process of migrating all of my productivity work to Google Drive, but am very disappointed in the way that Google Drive runs on iOS. I was hesitant to embrace the subscription model especially when Google gives it away for free, but now I am a full believer thinking it is well worth it to keep my software up-to-date and running well across all computers without having to worry about upgrading every few years...or locking myself into Microsoft long-term if somebody else comes up with something better. The subscription model will force Microsoft to stay ahead of the curve constantly trying to win its own customers to renew and not being able to rest on its laurels.  And the quality of the software and syncing interface makes me willing to pay for this.  Finally, at this time through the Bing search engine you are able to get 100 GB of free One Drive space which has made it so I can keep all of my documents in the cloud, accessible and synced across all devices. The value that this adds to the program is incredible.  I'm very happy with my purchase and very happy that I was able to save money here.	1
I Bought This So I Could Get Full Use Of The Office iPad Apps. However I Also Did 2 Mac Installs, & 2 Windows Installs !! Was Completely Painless, & The KEY Code WAS Valid !!!	1
The only real question is - does this card work? It's the lowest priced way to buy Office 365 so that's a reasonable question.  It's a 100% legit Microsoft issued card. Punch in the code and they take it just like any other card. A few minutes later you have office on 5 computers and 5 tablets. You and your buddies have 100 gig of One Drive to play with, and you can make random Skype calls all over the world for 60 minutes a month.  What happens in a year? Well hopefully you can buy another card, dump in into your account and save some more money. That of course assumes that the giant asteroid misses us and we're all still here ....	1
When I try to install I receive error code 30088-04. Can't even find the error code. Tried several times. Have Windows 8 in a brand new HP computer. Gave up. Life is too short. Should have bought a Mac. No wonder the CEO resigned.  Poor Microsoft.  Sinking ship ....	-1
Office 365 is less than $100 per year for 5 users.  We purchased this and our kids use it on their Macs while my wife and I use it on our PC's.  What did we do with the 5th license?  Donated it to a friend who is a single mom and widow.  It's really nice to have that flexibility.	1
I really thought this was one of those programs I could get a lot of use out of. However I have used this program so very little that I cannot give a meaningful review to it. From what I've seen of it and had I really got into using itI can say that it's a top shelf program.	1
I guess it all depends on your needs. The software is great, but this is essentially a rental program. You buy again next year for $100 (if you have need for software for 5 machines and you need the cloud, then it is pretty reasonable at $20 per machine.) I guess we are all looking for cost effective solutions, so this may work better for some than for others. Personally, I have resisted Adobe's efforts to put me into the rental group, I feel the same about this. But times they are a changing and sooner or later, we are all going to end up in a rental program.	1
Innovation is a good thing when the point of innovation is to improve one's products and to enhance the experience of ones customers. But innovation as a way of creating a false impression of progress to mask a need to perpetually carve out market share is vile, and it has long driven Microsoft's business plan and service model. But two other marks of Microsoft has been its attempt corner a portion of the market, give the consumer no real alternative, and then force them to pay through the nose, meanwhile making it harder and harder to use previously purchased versions of the product. And to complete my portrait of the Microsoft that I hated to like, Microsoft had an absolutely dreadful customer service department. Not that Customer Service was inept, but merely unavailable. And turning the old department store adage on its head, not only was the customer never right, they were most likely very much wrong.  As a result, Microsoft had over time created a way of doing business that was out of touch with the needs of the customer. Indeed, I had come to dislike Microsoft so much that I stuck with my old copy of Office 2000 for years longer thatn I had any desire to. But I was not going to pay an absurd amount of money for a piece of software that they were only going to allow me to put onto one device, and that was not going to be supported by technical support.  So imagine my shock when I found myself something of a fan of their new way of doing business. Instead of being prohibitively expensive, Office 365 is reasonably priced. You pay less than $80 for a key to unlock a download on up to five devices. Or if $80 is too pricey, you can pay just under ten dollars a month for the same five-device key. And unlike in the past, when you paid a large amount of money for a single-user key to Office Lite (the Student Edition was essentially Word and Excel, while the subscription grants you the use of more Office programs, including Outlook, PowerPoint, Access, Publisher, and One Note. What was once a prohibitively expensive suite of programs suddenly became very reasonably priced (no doubt in part because pirated editions meant that instead of paying an absurd amount of money to Microsoft, people would simply go to a Torrent site and get a free copy of Office).  And to make everything even more impressive, Microsoft's customer service is more accessible than ever. I had a particularly difficult installation due to preinstalled trial editions of Office 365 on my new computers. Microsoft worked with me at length to make sure Office 365 installed properly on all of my devices. Not just that, but when I expressed the wish to use my Hotmail e-mail address on Outlook, they escalated the problem to a higher level tech support person.  Now, that doesn't mean that this is a perfect product. I have not liked the direction that Office has taken since Office 2007. And Microsoft still fails to include a crackerjack WYSIWYG HTML editor. But all in all I'm impressed with the nontechnical aspects of Office 365. And I have to admit that it is kind of fun having at least portions of Office installed on my desktop, my lap top, my smart phone, and my tablet. In a family with multiple computer owners, it should be possible for each family member to have a full version of Office installed on their computer. I'm still not a huge fan of Microsoft, but I'm delighted to see them make their products more consumer-friendly.	1
First let me say the updates that have occured in Office over the past few updates have been GREAT!  If you are thinking about updating your version of office this is a great thing to consider.  However, many software companies are doing this "rent" the software idea.  I like that the Office 2007 I own is mine and I can use it for as long as I have a computer that runs it.  One thing I really like about this Office version is that it contains Outlook at a somewhat reasonable price point.  I really like using Outlook at home (I have my own domain name so it is kind of a necessity for me).  The whole "cloud" thing is concern.  There may be files that I will be willing to put there however while it may be more secure (from hackers) than my home computer the court decisions on data I've "shared" with other vendors may not have as strong of legal protection as my home hard disk. (NPR did an interesting story on this)  All that being said I love the idea of being able to access document that I've been working on at home from other locations.	1
I have to admit that one of my paranoid fears is that my computer will crash and that I'll lose all of my files and projects that I've spent a long time working on. One positive feature of Office 365 is the SkyDrive which enables you to save your documents and projects to the cloud and access them from other locations. I also like that 365 makes it possibly to easily collaborate on projects by inviting others to access the document. The other person does not have to have the same version of Office that you do, it can pull up the document in a browser and they can view and make changes as needed. You can also work on SkyDrive documents when you're offline and then they'll update when you have an internet connection again (BUT if the document was updated at another location and you don't have internet access, then you won't be accessing the most up-to-date version, which I view as a bit of a liability.) I have been known to save important documents to both my SkyDrive and my computer just as a back-up in case the Internet gods decide to shut up the data heavens.  An added feature of Office 365 is access to Office Mobile Apps. Unfortunately, my smartphone (HTC Desire) is not compatible with the Office Mobile App and so I can't make use of the mobile features. However, the subscription does include the option of adding up to five mobile devices (but I imagine they have to be fairly recent mobile devices or you might run into the problem I had of the device being incompatible with the app). I was kind of bummed that it won't work on my device. It would have been convenient to be able to access my documents on the go, but oh well, what can you do.  Installation is fairly easy. You just go to the website, enter the product key and connect it to your Microsoft account (or you can start an account with any e-mail address). It will let you download the software on up to five computers, BUT as the name Office 365 indicates, you will only have access to the software for 365 days. After that point you will have to pay all over again for another year's access to the software. The positives of that is that you will always have the most up-to-date Office software (automatic updates are included in the subscription), but the obvious con is that you'll be perpetually paying for a subscription. Honestly, my personal preference would be just to own the software outright (I'm OK with not having the latest and greatest version). They do throw in a few extra perks to help lessen the pain of an annual subscription: Skype 60 minutes a month world calling & SkyDrive with 20 GB storage.  It did take a little while for the program to download, but if you have any experience with Office products, it is pretty easy to find your way around. I do like that you have the option of downloading on up to five computers and five mobile devices, but you do have to be prepared to repay for the right to access the software annually. If you're OK with that, then I think you'll enjoy Office 365. It's user-friendly and helps bring accessible technology to our society that's increasingly mobile and connected. I like that my documents can go with me wherever I am.	1
For most of us, Microsoft Office is the de-facto standard of office suites, with Word being the predominant program. It wasn't always this way, as those who have been computer users for some years will remember well. In fact, we may have all been running WordPerfect Office with its affiliated programs if it wasn't for some strange twists in computer history beginning in the 1990s.  There are a number of variations of this Microsoft Office suite that can be found here, but this review is specifically focused on&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Office-365-Home-Premium/dp/B009SPTUW2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Office 365 Home Premium</a>. This version is is a one-year subscription downloaded from 'Net by entering a product key card, and is licensed for up to five users on PCs, Windows 8 tablets, and Macs (with some limitations - see the specs). It offers the current versions of Word, Outlook, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote. Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Publisher, Access and more.  Please note: I had previously installed the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Office-Home-Business-2013-Key-Card-1PC-1User/dp/B009SPWJ98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Office Home & Business 2013 Key Card 1PC/1User</a>&nbsp;version on a Window 7 PC notebook, and that version had worked quite well. The annual subscription to Office 365 Home Premium became a worthy option for a new PC running Windows 8 as a development/test system for both hardware and software, so when it came to making a decision as to which suite to go with, curiosity won out.  Here are the highly-subjective likes and dislikes found so far with this installation of the new Office 365 Home Premium suite for those looking for just the key points, then followed with some expanded details.   Likes:  + Very smooth installation; simple directions, easy to follow, almost effortless + Clean interface; smooth and minimalist, ribbon can be collapsed as needed + Operates on five PCs or Macs; license for single household with multiple users + Excellent Outlook integration; works well with Outlook.com, Gmail and private email + SkyDrive; allows for access of files on the cloud, file sharing when needed + Easy customization once installed; make it work your way   Rants & Irritants:  - Full ALL CAPS menu tabs; don't like having the Metro-style jammed down my throat   Installation:  The setup is simple and easy to follow. Included in the small box are the directions and a 25-character Product Key card. Go to the Microsoft Office site as indicated, enter the characters from the card as noted, then sign into or create your Microsoft account. Users who already have an Outlook account (possibly converted over from Hotmail) can start with that. Then it's a simple scenario of following the on-screen directions, and the entire installation should be finished in under 30 minutes.  Found the interface to be much cleaner than my older Office 2007 running on another older computer, and with the exception of the CAPS ON menu tabs noted above, it was a good improvement. Though I did not do any precise stopwatch timings, Office 365 seemed to load faster and smoother. The ribbon menu can be collapsed or expanded as needed. When you open up Word, Excel, PowerPoint or Publisher, you'll find a selection of templates on the left side of the screen instead of just a blank document, which is just an extra click away.  What follows are some subjective notes about the various components found within this Office 365 Home Premium suite. I won't attempt to go too heavy into each of these as one could write a full review on most of the modules by themselves, but consider these as observations found from a few weeks use.   SkyDrive:  I like SkyDrive and have been using it for some time. This has been integrated quite well within Office 365 Home Premium, and has built in resilience against jittery Internet connections. Should you should lose your connectivity while working on a file opened from a SkyDrive account, Office 365 saves it temporarily on your local hard drive before synchronizing with SkyDrive at a later point in time. And what is good is that it syncs quite well so that you can retrieve/edit documents (or images) from other computers once you're logged in.   Word:  The features for Word have remained largely the same as those in Office 2007 and those that I've found working on clients' Office 2010 installations. Documents often need to be edited after they are written, and Word 2013 makes the editing process easier with such new features such as the ability to edit PDF files. Previously, you needed to install third-party software, such as Adobe Acrobat. This was available to those of us who have been running Word for Mac 2011 where it does a respectable job, but is new to the PC version. Have not had much time to play with it, but if it works as well as the Mac version, then this will be a big help.  Among the new additions that I've found are that you can watch embedded videos right there within the document, and without having to go to a different application. If you work with collaborative documents, you can reply within comments and those replies will be displayed in threaded conversation style.   Excel:  On a personal note, I have had a love/hate relationship with spreadsheet programs in general since the days of Microsoft Multiplan and Lotus 1-2-3, both of which are distant history now. That being said, Excel has been a program of choice for years now, and one that I've used to input table data into Word and as a flat file database for quite some time. Entering data into spreadsheets can be a tedious and boring chore, so the downward fill feature in Excel that allows you automatically fill the cells in each row with the same number by dragging down has been an ally.  But now there's a new Flash Fill feature that recognizes patterns in your data functions, then automatically fills in the rest of the spreadsheet, and complex formulas are not necessary. You can make it automatically format names the same way (such as last, first, middle initial) just by giving it some examples. Phone numbers can be converted to a uniform format, such as (212) 555-1212, and restore the leading zero to zip codes is a breeze. Look for the Flash Fill button on the Data tab and try it. It's well worth it.   OneNote:  This is probably one of the most overlooked and underrated components of the Office suites. First encountered it in Office 2007, and it became a handy way to keep simple notes and such, but it was limited. The new version will allow you to embed Excel spreadsheets and see the preview within your note. When you update the spreadsheet, the preview automatically updates, as well. Searching within OneNote is better, as you can now search for words that are embedded in graphics files.   PowerPoint:  There's a new, cleaner look to PowerPoint. You can start a new presentation using a theme, a template, an older presentation or a more recent one, as well as a blank one. New users should find PowerPoint 2013 to be more intuitive than older versions, and those who are experienced PowerPoint pros will find that everything seems to go smoother. I pulled up some old presentations, including one that was from the late 1990s, and found that doing a few edits was a very smooth process. The themes now come with variations, so tightening up on the look you want is simpler.   Outlook:  There's an openness to this upgraded version. Outlook is a powerful module, but it will take new users a bit of time to learn to navigate among all of the functions and to understand the numerous toolbar icons, as I found out when showing mine to a colleague. I've been using Outlook under Office for Mac 2011 on a MacBook Pro, and never had an issue with Outlook on the OS X platform. I'm currently trying to sync the two versions as much as possible.   Publisher:  I personally use Publisher infrequently at this point. Like the other modules in Office 365, you'll find a selection of templates on the left side of the screen instead of just a blank document.   Access:  The Office Access relational database management system was a product that at one time was a favorite when I was converting over from dBase III many years ago. Speaking honestly, I have not accessed this module, and pardon the pun.   Annoyances & Irritants:  My primary gripe with the new Office suites has to do with the full ALL CAPS menu tabs, and I'm trying my best to see if I can learn to adapt or if I'll change it. As noted earlier, I don't like the "new" Microsoft Metro style being jammed down my throat without the option to change it easily. It's essentially the same one that we find on the Office pages on the Web. There is a workaround, but it must be done in each individual Office 2013 module that you use: go to File > Options > Customize Ribbon, then use the Rename button on each one of the main menu items listed in the right pane under Customize the Ribbon. Instead of changing the name, however, add a space to the end of the name, and then click OK. When you return to the Home tab, the ribbon menu items will be displayed in a title case, with only the first letter capitalized. You can also go back to the ALL CAPS default by resetting them.   Suggestions:  Putting this simply, if you're happy with Office 2007 or 2010, you may want to weigh your choices between the various versions here, read some of the reviews that best apply to your own needs, then decide whether you wish to keep the earlier version or go for the upgrade. My decision to try Office 365 was based on the fact that it was going to be a 'clean' install on a new Windows 8 PC and that I had a year to use it and see if it was worth the subscription, or if it might be better to go with a 'regular' license for another version. My installation went smoothly and it works well; your results may differ from mine.  I have not tried an installation on a Windows 7 PC to date, but have been largely impressed with how well it runs on a standard, out-of-the-box Windows 8 PC. Please note: this review will be dynamic in that as I find experiences worth sharing, be they pro or con, they will be appended to this review. Other findings or additional resources may be listed in the comments.   Summary:  <a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Office-365-Home-Premium/dp/B009SPTUW2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Office 365 Home Premium</a>&nbsp;as a one year subscription for five users/computers has proven to be an interesting choice for my needs as noted in this review. Please keep in mind that with such a program, your needs and mine may differ, as we each use such office suites in different fashions. Currently I'll rate this suite at a solid 4-star product that can be recommended on the Windows 8 platform.  9/30/2013	1
We have several computers in my house, and I was looking for an economical option. Considering the fact that I probably go through a primary PC for work about once every two years, the price point of the Key Card was very attractive to me.  As far as the software itself, the tweaks took a little getting used to, as always; but, after using them for a while now, I definitely prefer the new Word and Excel to their predecessors. Of course, there will always be some things that can be done without, like having to select a new page, or blank workbook from among templates every time the program is opened, or the cutesy graphics around the borders of the applications.  Office is still a five star product in my book. Perhaps even more so now that Microsoft is offering different licensing options.	1
Microsoft Office is pretty much the standard software used by most businesses and individuals.  This version contains Word for word processing, Excel for spreadsheets, PowerPoint for presentations, OneNote to help keep you and projects organized, and Outlook to manage your email.  This is the version that can be installed on up to five devices and is only valid for a one year subscription.  I'm not a fan of this type of subscription, but the cost is lower than buying the one pc version, and this can be used on windows tablets and phones, as well.  It's just a matter of determining how you will use this software and deciding which version is right for you.  For those who prefer cloud storage, 27GB on MS SkyDrive is included with this subscription.  This means you can log in from any pc and access the documents you have stored there. (like google drive)  Although, I have not used this feature, the documentation states that you receive 60 minutes per month of Skype international calling.  If you are updating from Office 2007 or 2010, you shouldn't have too much of a learning curve.  The change from Office 2003 (if you are still using that version) is pretty drastic, though.  There are many tutorials on the MS website to help you along.  I've used this software for years, and recommend it highly. I'm particularly fond of the Outlook mail program, and wouldn't get a version that doesn't include it.	1
It's really hard to get any quantity of work down without Microsoft Office.  And this product, aside from all it's normal MS Office glory, has a nifty Office Cloud you can work from---even if you're stuck on a borrowed PC or Mac.  Sharing documents or working on them from multiple places is a breeze.  However, MS Office, I have somewhat against you!  This thing was a bear to install on my Windows 8 PC.  I actually had to uninstall then reinstall.  I also tried loading this to a Mac, same issues.  However, between the Win 8 attempt and the Mac install, I tried it on a Windows 7: everything installed like a dream.  I have no idea why this is fussy on some systems.  It does work FINE with them, but on some systems it seems a little awkward about installing.  So, clear a little space of time.	1
This is the standard for office suites as far as I an many others are concerned. This is a version that operates from the www. It has all the core applications of Office Professional. It has Publisher and Access as well. It is a wonderful option for a family in that it licens 5 devices. The only drawback is the yearly subscription of around $99.00. It is a very nice alternative for a family.	1
I'm the proud owner / renter / reviewer of this product.  Only Microsoft knows for sure. They seem to have me down as an owner, which, considering that I have a "not for sale" marked copy is unusual. A letter to them a few days ago hasn't had a reply yet.  When you get this product there is no CD - just a card with a keycode on it. I did what I thought Microsoft wanted of me - downloaded the demo copy from them, and then entered the keycode. I now have a working copy, but did I just pay for the privilege?  Apart from that, this is the best way to buy Office. You can install this five times on five different computers which means that if you split the costs with four others you end up paying less than $20 a year (though Microsoft won't guarantee the price will be the same next year). You get the use of Office 365 days a year, with any improvements that transpire during that time.  I like Office considerably, and this is basically Office 2013. Because I use Office a lot, I'm used to things that people get upset about. For instance, I feel very positive about the Ribbon which other people don't like. I find it hard to recommend anything else, and as long as Microsoft keep offering this at a low price it's a no-brainer.  All I dislike about this is the installation problem I've mentioned. Just be sure that if you buy this, your account is correct.	1
(Note to Mac users: OneNote, Access and Publisher not available.)  I have two computers for work, one is a desktop (iMac) that I use in my home office and the other is a MacBook Pro that I use on the road.  For me the SkyDrive is outstanding because it allows me to quickly and easily share my important Word docs, PowerPoint presentations and Excel spreadsheets to the SkyDrive where I can access them from either of my Macs and also from ANY computer via my account at [...] This also ensures that if something happens to one computer (or both), my important files are safe.  I can also access everything from my iPhone with the Office Mobile app. I also have a Kindle Fire, but it isn't supported at this time.  You can see all of your uploaded documents on the  "My Office" web page. You can also create new Word, Excel, PowerPoints there, too. Using the "Web" version to do so is very similar to Google Docs - only with more features/functionality.  Unlike other cloud-based sharing sites, saving to your SkyDrive is as simple as saving the document. For a Word doc, for example, the path is: File, Share, Save to SkyDrive. From there you have the option of saving it to your documents, which is a private folder, or to Shared/Public folder. (I uploaded a screenshot of this menu at the top of the Amazon product page).  The public folder is ideal for sharing videos and other large files with friends, family, etc. Microsoft hasn't quite perfected the public sharing side, but it is close. Since I'm on a Mac, I have the option of sharing via email, Message (IM), AirDrop or Vimeo. I would like to see one more choice: "Direct Link," which would copy a shortened URL onto your clipboard that you could paste into anything.  I've also installed Office 365 onto my wife's MacBook and her iPhone. It's good to know we have "room to grow" should we get another computer or smartphone. Up to 5 computers are supported, and also 5 smartphones.  Installation. All you need is that Product Key despite the boxy packaging (a vestige from another era).  Installation is easy: Enter your product key at [...] You can then install Office onto your Mac (or PC). There is a drop-down menu with a choice between a Mac or a PC. Up to 5 machines  Same page for smartphones The drop-down menu lets you choose either Windows Phone, iPhone or Android phone. You can use Office apps on up to 5 devices. For my iPhone, I was instructed to enter my mobile phone number and it then sent an SMS with a url. I clicked that and a webpage opened then opened the AppStore to download the Office 365 app.  Final note: I advise all Office 365 users to make a copy (or two) of their product key (which comes on a business card-sized card) and store it in a safe place - better safe than sorry.	1
Even though glo was the winner of the 2010 ECPA Bible of the Year award, the software was a bit buggy and there were many complaints, all of which have been addressed.  After a seamless, but lengthy installation (there is a tremendous amount of information being loaded) it didn't take me long to realize that glo was good to go.  The only minor glitch was that I had to install Roxio first.  If you've never installed a program you may need a bit of guidance, but for anyone else installation is quite simple.  Glo seriously listened to the user of the last version.  Things glo has improved upon:  ++ They now have a help system that is both in and outside the program.  There are "lenses" that "distribute content over a zoomable interface," media containers, a result's grid, basic and advanced searches, menus, and a link to online tutorials.  All of these are explained in the help menu with visuals to assist the user.  ++  Glo has added online tutorials for those who would like an overview prior to either purchasing or using the software.  ++  The user can check out the "contributors and sources" on the company website.  I did notice that when I clicked on information on Syria I was taken to an Wikipedia article on the web.  ++  There is a "Quick Install" option (I didn't opt to use this one) and an uninstall option on your control panel.  ++  When you start glo up it will immediately look for updates, something that most people will appreciate as it will keep your information from becoming dated or obsolete.  ++ You can install glo on five personal devices,including PC, Mac, iPhone and iPad.  The only thing I didn't find was a user manual, something that I would have appreciated as would many other users.  Sometimes a user manual is greatly appreciated by those who are a little less high tech.  I can't fault glo as they are selling software and not manuals, but it would have been a nice touch.  With all the nice additions, I'll give a little bit of information on what you are getting.  If you already know you want this software, you can simply bypass the rest of this review.  In this "revolutionary new Bible" (NIV study Bible) you'll find an an amazing array of all aspects of Biblical lore from the historical aspects, to spirituality, the arts, and many more factual aspects you can weave into your own life and studies.  GLO features:  ++  450+ Virtual Tours   These are 360-degree tours of "modern-day and re-created" ancient biblical locations."  ++  3.5 Hours of HD Videos   You'll be able to enjoy the "In His Shoes" HD interactive documentary.  ++  2,300+ High Resolution Photos   The zoom feature is a real plus when you want to look more closely at a photograph.  ++  7,500+ Articles   The large variety of articles will help you as you create your own Bible reading plan  Take for example when I wanted to take a look at Syria.  There was a columnar format that presented the information GLO had to offer provided I wanted to explore its relation to the Bible in my readings.  I was offered thirty-three scripture references, one internal article, twelve maps, and one web article.  ++  650+ Works of Art  ++  Integration with the best web content  ++  Continual additions to the content each time you load the program  ++  Concise, compact organization through five "lenses"  ++  You have the ability to journal and take notes as you study  LENSES:  BIBLE:  You can easily navigate and find the verse or chapter you want easily.  TIMELINE:  You can compare and contrast when many events occurred through time starting with the Creation  MyGlo:  This is where you will house all your notes, journal, bookmarks, and "reading plans."  MEDIA:  This area houses the videos, thousands of articles, photographs, artwork, maps, virtual tours, and more.  ATLAS:  This is a zoomable atlas where you can see the larger "picture" or zoom in to see a particular area of interest.  TOPICAL:  Here you can "quickly find relevant verses and articles on thousands of key concepts."  There are three DVDs in this packet.  You can now install it on both Windows and Mac systems.  Below are the system requirements.  PC System Requirements:  Microsoft Windows XP, Vista, or Windows 7 operating system with latest service pack installed  Duel core processor  1GB RAM for Microsoft Windows XP, or 2GB RAM for Vista or Window 7  At lease 1GB of free hard disk space, 18GB for full media install  Video card with Microsoft DirectX 9 support  Internet Connection  DVD-ROM drive  Mac System Requirements  Intel-Based Mac  Mac OS 10.5.8 (Leopard) or higher  2GB RAM  At least 200MB of free hard disk space, 18 GB for full media install  Internet Connection  DVD-ROM drive  This is an astounding digital Bible experience that is well worth the money, especially given the improvements that have been made in the software.  If you simply browse someone else's program you'll certainly want to have a copy as it brings out the wow factor.  The one thing to keep in mind is that it does use the NIV version of the Bible by Biblica (copyright 1984), Zondervan, as I realize this is not the version of choice by all people.  If you want to create and tailor your own Bible reading plan in a new, innovative way, this is one program you will probably enjoy tremendously.	1
<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/GLO-Premium-Multi-device/dp/0982697813/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">GLO Premium: Multi-device</a>&nbsp;is a program that provides Bible content and integrates it with tools, maps, images, videos and more.  From my perspective, I have taken a lot of time to get used to the interface and explore the features.  As somebody who is admittedly not an expert in the subject matter, I find the interactive features to add new dimensions to the content that is presented.  And considering the amount of investment required to produce software of this caliber, I think this program is a great value.  Many have reported installation problems.  For PC use, I can report that I had no problems installing this on Windows 7.  The program required that I install Microsoft .NET framework 4 first, and the related updates.  But as of November 2011, it seems like some of the installation problems have been fixed.  The initial install allows you to access the basic features, but you will need to register to use things like the Atlas.  The actual space required to install the software is about 1 GB for a PC and 200 MB for a Mac.  You can use the interface to stream the data off the internet, and while there is some lag it wasn't significant for me.  But yes, if you want all the files on your local hard drive you will need to use all 3 disks and it will take up about 18 GBs.  That seems like a small price to pay for those who choose to have all the content stored locally.  This product is advertised to work for multiple devices.  While I had no problem with a PC install, it seems getting it to work on a tablet or iPod requires separate installs.  I will update this further once I confirm that my license key works for all the devices.  The best features for me are the Atlas, which integrates historical content from the Bible with geographical data and images.  This is the kind of resource that I think would be very valuable when visiting the various regions of Europe, Africa and the Middle East depicted in the Bible.  CONCLUSION  This is a very good program.  Though it takes some time to learn the interface, I think it's worth the effort.  Enjoy.	1
I am not a Biblical scholar whatsoever not have I ever played one on TV.  I enjoy reading the Bible for its historical information and have found over the years many different iterations of the Bible.  GLO, however, is the best collection of information not only pertaining directly to the written words contained in the King James Version and for many others.  There is nothing quite as pleasant as sitting in front of a monitor and just going from verse to verse but having those verses explained in a way the layman can fully understand some of the background.  For comparison I have a 1810 version of The King James Bible that has been passed down from several generations and is quite used.  The words, however, come through and are the same.  The annotations for each page, where applicable, are similar to GLO's annotations except the time in years actually makes a difference.  That's a good thing and GLO does it well.  I was not prepared for the full range of information contained in the program and even though it slows the speed of my computer it is well worth the small wait.  There are hundreds of meaningful pictures coupled with historical facts and comparisons.  I have found that reading the Bible is significantly rewarding and far better than listening to it on a recording.  Additionally, GLO sends its audience updates for contents and historical facts.	1
This is a Bible software like I never seen before. It is so full of very useful material that I don't even know where to start so I will keep it simple. I love that it has the ESV and NIV among other translations with study notes, articles, videos, illustrations, maps, commentaries. Everything you could ever use to prepare a sermon or a Bible study. Even if you are not a Pastor you will still benefit from this software. it can be used in up to 3 computers as well as your iPhone and/or iPad. WARNING: The description says that you need 18 GB of free disk space to fully install this software. You may also want to consider your RAM memory because in order to have two or three things going on at the same time you will need all the memory you can get. So I recommend that the computer that you use for GLO Premium has at least: 320 GB memory, 4GB RAM memory,i5 or i7 processor and a decent video/sound card as well as a decent screen. The reason for this personal recommendation is to ensure you get the most out of this amazing product.	1
GLO is a visually stunning bible program with so much to offer. Gorgeous graphics, a unique interface, beautiful easy-on-the eyes bible pages, and so much more it's overwhelming. You can go from casual reading to in-depth historical research with a few clicks. There's so much to GLO...I'm still discovering stuff about it.  GLO at its base offers the bible in five versions, an atlas, a timeline, topical, media, and a place for your stuff. Reading the bible on GLO is a joy. The pages are laid out beautifully - like a book displayed on a screen. Makes it easy to read. In the bottom you can view commentaries or add your own notes. You can also see notes that other have made via YouVersion. (Nice feature!) Also, it will display any media (video, pics, and more) that may be relevant to the part of the bible you're reading. If you right-click on bible passages, another sub-menu appears to copy it or take your study further.  GLO's gorgeous screens reminds me Linux Ubuntu's darkly colorful Unity interface mixed with Apple's love of icons all in a unique interface package. Icons glow and grow, screens slide, all on a black background - except for when you're reading the bible. Your work sessions are recorded as icons you can return to. The different parts of the menu and program options are accessed on sliding tabs and icons. This is not a flat bible program - it's a 3D bible world that you are navigating through. Is visually exciting, but the possibility to get lost or wander is too easy as well.  Be forwarned: you do need a very capable computer with a good amount of processing power. GLO is graphically intensive. Icons glow and fade, the background shifts, something is always moving making it visually exciting. However, I don't doubt this will tax some older computers graphics capabilities. Make sure you have the minimum requirements (hopefully more) so you can enjoy this program for how it is created.  The one thing that annoys me to pieces is that I really don't know how to process all this information. I have a fully loaded and gorgeous program and no skills to how to use it to my benefit. I wish GLO had included a follow-along tutorial explaining all the different features, how they work together, and the different ways I can benefit from it. I did see a short video trailer about GLO and it just affirmed that there's so much that can be done with this program that I haven't conceived yet.  I'm also disappointed that there isn't a Strong's concordance or similar (or at least I haven't found it yet) to do word research on the Greek or Hebrew meaning. That's so automatic with so many other bible programs it's surprising not to find it with this one.  GLO is quite frankly mind-boggling! It offers so much that you are pretty much blown away. It offers a stunningly beautiful interface and a tons of information and resources to draw from. It also offers the ability to link your information to an iPhone/iPad app so you can carry it around with you. The only drawback is that you do need a rather powerful computer to get the most out of it without lag or frustration. I also believe a tutorial is would have been sorely helpful so you get the most bang for you buck rather than just wandering around.	1
GLO Premium is a fantastic piece of software for everyone from the casual bible studyist to dedicated students, and can also be a valuable resource for teachers and preachers. The program is stable, well thought out, easy to navigate and is packed full of features, making it an incredible value. GLO Premium installed quickly and easily on my homebrew Vista x64 Intel Core i7 system, full install taking less than 15 minutes from start to finish, using all 3 discs provided. GLO has proven to provide a new way to study the bible in the digital age, giving a streamlined and efficient approach to learning and exploring the bible that would take hours longer manually cross-referencing multiple material via reference books. Highly recommended!	1
I've not had nearly enough to look at this all the way through. It would probably take years. But thus far I am very impressed. The content is rich and informative. It's fun to hunt down all the "rabbit trails" looking for new information. Very well done!	1
It took a little over an hour for me to do a full media install of  Glo Premium on my ASUS, Windows 7, laptop.  Glo's features are listed in the Amazon's Product Description so I won't go into those.  I've been using this program off and on for a few weeks now. I think the loading time..switching between the lenses, topics, multi-media, etc..sometimes takes a few seconds  but is fairly quick for such a large program. If I ever become an owner of a tablet, IPod Touch or IPad, I plan on downloading the Glo Bible IPad app & syncing my notes and/or bookmarks to the device. I hope to prepare presentations for Children's Church. By the way, the collection of media in this program is amazing. There's HD video,  articles, photos, art, 360 degree virtual tours & more. I needed to use 'Help' to learn how to find my way around.  As a test,  I did a search for Galatians 5:22; first it turned up nothing, but then I did a search in Galatians & also on the home page both searches pulled up the verse, 2 photos and a map. Clicking on the verse took me to the Galations 5,  the highlighted Bible passage, study notes and a map. Clicking the photos brought up the photo, its description and other pertinent info.  Clicking on the map brought up even more information. By the way, the amount of information that is brought up can be overwhelming.  Check out The Glo Blog, News & Updates on All Things Glo, g l o b i b l e. com / blog/  to learn how to use Glo in your presentations, and the usefulness of the right-click context menu. Clicking on 'Features' at the top of the page might be helpful to you too. Be sure to use the 'help' menu in this program too. If the web address isn't showing in my review, just do a search for Glo Bible Blog to find the web page.  This program has many features, as I used it, I could only think that it needed a few more. To make this program perfect & even more useful to me, I'd like to see the following added:  Audible dictionary; I'd like to be able to click on a word, go to the definition & also hear how it's pronounced.  A few more Bible versions; currently it has NIV 1984 & 2010, KJV, The Message & ESV. I'd like to see NLT added. I'd also like the Bible versions in parallel format so I could read the same passage in different versions side-by-side.  I wish the Bible timeline also showed the events happening in world history.  And, I  wish the Life Application Notes were included.  In my opinion, adding these items would make this software perfect!  This program is huge with many, many interactive features; it can be overwhelming. Take your time, don't feel intimidated & soon you'll be comfortable with the wealth of information found in Glo Premium.  UPDATE: I recently rec'd an IPod Touch & added the Glo Bible App; now I have Glo Premium on my IPod Touch, it syncs with the program on my laptop. Some of the Premium features are not included in the IPod app. I'm loving this on the IPod.	1
I got this installed on my computer, and it was almost overwhelming how much data and information that is presented.  An attempt is made to segregate it, but if you watch any of the company's videos, you'll see there's an overwhelming amount of data.  It's all good mind, you and it's easy to get lost looking at pictures, seeing videos, watching trails.  It's a superb product, but I can easily see where some people might get overwhelmed.  Still, if you dive into it, you're gonna experience the Bible in a completely new way.  Not that this product is changing the word of God, but just presenting it in a new fashion.  In this day and age of multimedia everything, and online that, and Twitter this...  It's kind of inevitable that a multimedia bible like this would exist.  One issue though.  Installation takes awhile if you want to put everything on your hard drive.  There are three DVD's in the package, and the default installation just goes from Disc 1.  That's not too bad.  But if you want to do the "full" installation, it took me about an hour to install all the data from the other two DVD,s which is pretty slow for a disc based install.  I've installed multi disc programs before, and they haven't taken anywhere near that amount of time.  Once it was all installed, the C:\ProgramData\Glo directory on my Windows 7 machine had a total of 10.8Gb of data, and a whopping 351,892 files!  Wow.	1
I don't know anything about writing a will.  But doing it the traditional way can't be any easier than using WillMaker.  I wasn't looking for anything fancy or complicated.  I just wanted a simple, bare-bones, straightforward will that divides up my possessions among a handful of people.  It took me less than 30 minutes to install the software (Windows 7, install went smoothly) and create a basic will that met my needs.  And of course if things ever change I can easily modify the will.  There are a lot of more options that I didn't try yet because I don't need them.  But should the need arise, it's nice to know those additional features are there.	1
I just couldn't get to grips with this software. It's not bad, but I just thought that in this case, it would be easier just to eat the cost and pay an attorney to do this for you. Not for me, but might be for you.	-1
My husband & I used this software in late 2010- early 2011 to update our wills, a long overdue necessity. Quicken Willmaker Plus is simple to use, fairly easy for the non-legal experienced. We live in California so we used this to make our own "holographic" wills without needing a lawyer. The book included was helpful and answered the more common questions. I would definitely recommend however, checking the laws in your state before proceeding. We will probably purchase this software again around 2015 to update again, unless circumstances seem to indicate that we need to update sooner.	1
For me, WillMaker served better as a guide than as a replacement for an attorney. I admit it. I drug my feet on completing my will. I didn't realize just how much paperwork is needed to die. The software provided me an excellent step-by-step guidance of the process; it was more like a "For Dummies" kit than a complete tool itself. The templates aren't forgiving for creative wishes but the time spent practicing with WillMaker no doubt will reduce the time spent with an attorney. For that reason alone, I recommend the software. Whether you use WillMaker alone or use it as a springboard to develop your will with an attorney, the software will educate you and save you money.  Rating: Four stars.	1
A will is a must even if you don't have much of an estate. If you die without a will your estate must go to probate and that will just be added delays,expense and headaches for your family. This software makes it easy to prepare a will and give you a chance to let your final wishes be known out as well as sparing your family the hassles of probate. Its the best gift you can give your loved ones.	1
Super fast install in Windows 7. Includes a small book called, "Legal Companion". It just gives you a few pages on each topic for a total of 200 pages. Too many topics to list here but a good reference first read when getting into any situation.  I wasn't able to download "Nolo's Encyclopedia of Everyday Law" so I chose the 2012 option instead, "101 Law Forms for Personal Use".  The 2012 version is out now so I would advise getting that one instead.&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Quicken-Willmaker-Plus-2012-Edition-Book-Software-Kit/dp/1413316352/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Quicken Willmaker Plus 2012 Edition: Book & Software Kit</a>  Instead of me going through the specifics that are already so well covered in other reviews, I chose to share with you additional material on QWP2011 instead.  As far as programming is concerned its application reminds you of the basic text only style; no fancy graphics here. I don't say that to detract the value of the program. For example the legal manual provides legal and practical answers to help you create specific documents.  I have been a fan of Quicken/Intuit products for well over a decade or more, and now have also been a fan of NOLO books; they are so beneficial at this point I have a library of them. This is a joint effort by those two powerhouse entities.  For the cost of admission this program will at the very least provide you with a set of decisions you will need to make when creating your will if not sufficient thoroughness in order to provided you with the actually final document itself. Personally if you have a large family, or a complicated situation, I wouldn't hesitate to seek out professional legal counsel to avoid a lot of heartaches later to those you love.	1
I wanted some quick and easy software to create a legal will for myself (you know, just in case, always a good idea 'they' say), and this software does just that!  In about the space of 45 minutes, I had created a great customized will for myself, including leaving multiple specific bequests: the software is super easy, with templates already installed, and you run through the prompts and answer the questions to produce a will: great product, would definitely recommend!	1
I have Nolo products I bought in the past and I have used Quicken since their first version (I got it from the original owners of the company in person).  Nolo makes (made) some valuable applications but they tend to look like something you would find in MSDOS 3.0.  Quicken, on the other hand has a very slick and easy to understand user interface.  WillMaker Plus is very much a Nolo product. Although it contains the basic forms you buy it for, the user interface is so basic it looks like something you would find on PC's from the 1980's.  The willmaking app (the part that most people buy this for) consists of 7 questions.  Seriously, that's it. You are allowed to enter only what the software will let you enter and there are some really basic non-interactive guidelines that are at the same time too basic and also too confusing.  I wrote my own will in about 10 minutes, but the software didn't permit me to include ANY specific details for someone to know what my "final intentions" are. I can't imagine anyone having such a basic lifestyle as to just say "give it all to so-and-so".  I think anyone could just hand-write that sort of thing on a piece of paper and hand it to their next of kin.  I expected the software to be more like TurboTax in that it would interview me about what the provisions of my mortgage are, what and where my investments are, what and where my life insurance policies are, what I owe and how to pay that off, what special provisions I may have for friends who are not in my will but who I may want to leave certain things that they've admired to.  But no.  None of the above.  Just 7 questions and a print-out of something that to me really has no practical value.  I think Quicken is doing themselves a disservice to put their name on this product. It's not worth the 35 bucks and especially not worth the "list price" of 70. There are hundreds of websites you can go to and download a simple will form that will be just as useful to you as WillMaker Plus.  The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is that it does give you the convenience of having some basic forms all on one disk, a bit of a timesaver.  By the way, if you buy this toward the end of 2011, note that the "free updates" are only good through the end of December.	-1
I have to say that this software is great to save yourself a lot of legal fees. From what I gathered from using it, I would have to say that it doesn't leave out anything in terms of how you want your things distributed. It answers many questions on a lot of different subjects, like elderly parents, children that reside in different countries, right down to how to direct your items to people other then direct family members. I used this to create a will for myself, and am glad I did. I may in the future decide to go to a professional if I so desire, but with using this, I don't really feel the need. My brother in law saw me using this software and wanted to know if my kids bought it for me LOL!	1
If you're like us, you thought about getting something like this for a long time but since you're in good health and all is well, you put it off. Approaching our 50's and losing friends our age has made us think twice about our invincibility. This software is very easy to use and has had the added benefit of being a great conversation starter. Our brother, a lawyer, checked it all over and loved it, too.	1
There are multiple versions of Quicken Willmaker 2011. This version,<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Quicken-WillMaker-Plus-2011/dp/1413313701/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Quicken WillMaker Plus 2011</a>&nbsp;is sold as software and includes a copy of&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Your-Little-Legal-Companion-Helpful-Advice-for-Life-s-Big-Events/dp/B000PY4T6C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Your Little Legal Companion: Helpful Advice for Life's Big Events</a>&nbsp;as a bonus feature. It does not however come with a printed manual. For those  who prefer manuals there's&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Quicken-Willmaker-2011-Edition-Book-Software-Kit/dp/1413312748/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Quicken Willmaker 2011 Edition: Book & Software Kit</a>, which is sold as a book which includes the software. Both versions include  a free download of Nolo's Encyclopedia of Everyday Law upon registration. Also included is Nolo's Online Living Trust software.	1
Quicken's WillMaker Plus 2011 is simple to install and comes with three free bonuses:  "Your Little Legal Companion" booklet that covers topics from Going to College to Planning Your Estate; an e-book, "Nolo's Encyclopedia of Everyday Law"; and an Online Living Trust.  It also provides free online legal updates through 2011.  The program is categorized into four main sections: Estate Planning, Executors, Home and Family, and Personal Finance.  Examples: under Estate Planning, the documents include Will, Health Care Directive (Living Will & Power of Attorney), Durable Power of Attorney for Finances, etc. Under Home and Family, there's Child Care Agreement, Pet Care Agreement, Elder Care Agreement, Housesitting instructions, etc.  This program guides users using a simple questions and answers format by clicking on or entering relevant info.  I hammered out a rudimentary yet legal will and printed it in less than five minutes.  Overall: perhaps a bit oversimplified but sometimes simplicity makes the entire legal process easier to understand and execute for most users.  Users requiring more detailed/complicated legal documents can reference Nolo's online resources or seek professional legal counsel.	1
If you are looking at this product, then it is probably for you. If you had a large estate that was complicated, you would have already consulted a lawyer. Being that you are looking at this at Amazon, then this should easily fit the bill. The standardized forms have been written by legal folk who have tried to ensure the estate or wishes of the author are granted. Most judges will take these forms and understand the intent.  However, be careful on tweaking in any way. The smallest of things can lead to ambiguity and create messes later on that you were trying to avoid with this software. If you need to tinker - get a lawyer.	1
This program is remarkable, it really is.  Included are lengthy, exhaustive lists, dozens of do-it-yourself legal documents, with versions valid in every state (except Louisiana).  Simple will,  living trust, powers of attorney, durable powers of attorney, revocable powers of attorney, disposition of estate, health-care directives, final arrangements, care-giver, and children and beneficiary documents.  <a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Quicken-WillMaker-Plus-2011/dp/1413313701/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Quicken WillMaker Plus 2011</a>&nbsp;can save you and yours some serious money ... not just the legal fees to prepare wills and trusts, but also through strategies that help you avoid probate. Probate is costly and time consuming, estates often take several years to wind through probate court before your beneficiaries. This program doesn't provide solutions for more complex estate planning, the kind required for estates with extensive holdings, say, multiple business and real estate interests. But for 90-plus percent of us, this will do the job.  The program guides you through each form question by question - it's a bit rigid in it's navigation of the forms, but when you're finished you have a professional product a beautiful,  Also included in the box is a "Legal Companion" manual, chocked full of information and advice on all manner of everyday legal issues, from parking tickets to credit repair, from buying a used car to changing your name, from starting a small business to adopting a child.  This manual is a nice bonus to a valuable program.	1
This Windows "program" is a hodge-podge amalgamation of a variety of eBooks, PDFs, and help guides without integration and coordination.  Confusion was the only consistent theme in this application.  Put out by Quicken, the documents are actually created by Nolo, which is a trusted source of legal information.  I'd suggest buying their books instead.  The program includes sections on: Buying or Selling a Business; Contracts for Goods and Services; Corporate Minutes and Consents; Forming a Business; Hiring Workers; Leasing Space; LLC Minutes and Consents; Managing Finances; Buying and Selling Real Estate; and Tax Forms.  In these sections, instead of giving you a handy Microsoft Word Document that you can fill in obvious blanks on, the program makes you go through a step by step interview and often doesn't remember the information you enter from one form to another so you must enter your name, the name of the business and so forth all over again.  Nor does it integrate with any contact managers so you can easily fill in from there.  When your interview is complete, the document saves only in text or RTF format, which are highly compatible with most programs but at this point, .doc is pretty standard.  Many of the items in these sections are simply Adobe Acrobat forms without the ability to edit or annotate them unless you have something besides Acrobat reader.  Included in the program are "checklists"  that are very short guides on very weighty subjects such as "How to Form an LLC" and "How to Set Up Tax Reporting and Accounting".  All these checklists do though is point you to other Nolo books or websites and are unable to offer any advice in and of themselves.  In other words, pretty much worthless.  Most frustrating to me was the business library which were simple PDFs (or Windows antiquated "Book Reader" format of:  Starting & Running a Small Business; Tax Savvy for Small Business; The Manager's Legal Handbook; How to Write a Business Plan; and Business Loans From Family and Friends.  Unfortunately, these books were previous versions and the newest versions of these books (despite the 2011 in the title of the program) are available elsewhere.  Additionally, also included with the program is a printed book called "Your Little Legal Companion" that has absolutely nothing to do with business and contains basic personal legal information that borders on the silly such as "Moving in with your Lover" and "Getting Old." These tidbits of advice had little substantive or legal value and were more like a sidebar from a Sunday newspaper magazine than anything that could be used for real reference or planning.  Upon registering the book, Nolo will send you a PDF of their book "101 Law Forms for Personal Use".  Again, this is just a PDF and not any templates that can actually be used within a program.  Combined together the program is a good value for all that you are getting.  However if you don't really need all that or want the current versions, I recommend purchasing this collection of eBooks and PDFs individually.	-1
As an owner of a small business, there are often times when I need a simple contract or legal document drafted up.  Time and resources are valuable.  Not everyone can afford to pay lawyers or legal aides $400+ to fill out some template.  This package gives you the convenience to do it yourself.  This library of forms and books is comprehensive and can save you a bundle.  After installing and using it for a few weeks here are the pros and cons that I have come up with:  PROS: - Simple and straightforward installation - Easy to use - Extensive collection of forms - While I haven't had the time to read it all, the Nolo business books is a great point of reference  CONS: - fill-in process is required.  IMO it would be much easier to input the information directly into the document. - no index of documents - could not find any way to export information to other file formats.  Overall, this collection of forms and books presents a great value that can save you money on your first use, and I'd highly recommend it for other small business owners.	1
The pre-made contracts and forms are a blessing in disguise.  They are certainly very useful to get you going and give you an idea of what you may need to have in an agreement on many issues, however, if it's something really serious I wouldn't blindly use the forms here but edit them very carefully or have a lawyer look at them for you.  One really good feature of this product are the fully sercheable books which is really nice to keyword something in and find as much information as you can.  You can google it too, however, you have to sort out a lot of useless information on Google, here, it's all organized and professional!  Also:  buying this instead of the books individually certainly saves you a bundle, so might as well get them like this, sercheable, than in print.	1
Before reading on, please note that the newer, updated version (2012) is now available for less --&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Quicken-Legal-Business-Pro-2012/dp/B005CELLZM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Quicken Legal Business Pro 2012</a>. (Today, the price is just $26 for the updated version)  That said, I have not looked at the 2012 version, but it claims to have everything the old version has plus more. So I'll go ahead and comment on the old version we've used:  First, most (probably all) of these forms can be found online for free. The real estate & leasing contracts, for example, can be found on your state realtors web site, or your state's bar association web site. Contracts for goods & services can be found on your state web site (department of motor vehicles for a bill of sale for a car, etc). But if you're like me and don't have time to browse, surf & download, here they are offered on one disc for a pretty reasonable price.  I will also add, most of these forms are what you see on Nolo.com, usually on sale for $15-$20 each. So if you've ever downloaded a form or contract from Nolo, you can get a couple hundred forms here for the price of 2. They claim this contains $900 worth of forms (real estate & leases, bill of sale, service contract & invoicing, paperwork for hiring employees, corporate minutes, IRS tax forms, sample forms for corporate policies, and a few more).  All of that said, this is nowhere near exhaustive - if you are run a fairly straightforward service or contracting business, or are a sole proprietor, this might meet many of your needs. But if you have a corporation (even an LLC), this software is insufficient.  I don't really agree with the reviewers who say this will save you legal fees - I don't know anyone who hires a lawyer to write such simple forms. There is nothing here that saved us any legal fees.  Also, none of the forms were usable "as-is" for me. Fortunately they can be customized, but I ended up adding huge addendums to any form I used. And, most of these forms are very common, we already had form letters on the computer for most of these topics (we store form letters online for free on our Google Docs account - saves file space, never worry about a crashed hard drive, and any employee can access & download a blank form from anywhere in the world, for free).  Nonetheless I still give this 3.5 to 4 stars. For me, it's all about saving time. There were a few useful things on here, which saved me an hour or two, so it's not perfect but it deserves a decent rating.	1
Quicken Legal Business Pro 2011 is meant for owners of small to medium businesses.  However, it contains a large amount of information that makes it handy to non-business owners as well.  Many subjects are covered, including buying and selling real estate, leasing, contracts, tax forms, managing finances, etc.  The software itself is fairly intuitive to use.	1
Nolo does an excellent job in bringing together over 100 contracts forms.  From buying goods to selling goods they have you covered. More importantly the type of business type you plan to form. Knowning if you are going to be a partnership, a LLC, or an independent contractor and the legal agreement you should have in place is important. However, there still may be some confusion, so you should the advice or a lawyer. Also the internet is your friend but of course be carefull of misinformation.  Creating document are easy.  Open the document you wish to create, answer the questions you are presented with and your document is done.  The software also includes multiple forms. Including various policy documents for when your business grows a little larger and you need to start implement various employee policies.  There are employee agreements, non-compete clauses, NDA, and various tax forms.  There are 5 ebooks included to help you business plans, loans, legal guide, employment law, and tax information.  This is a must have software for anyone just starting out in business. It is invaluable but as I have already stated you still should be hiring outside legal help.  Highly Recommended	1
This software is great for many different things. Anywhere from buying a house without an agent to starting your own business. This software also provides forms and contracts that you can print out, which would save a lot in legal fees. I'm glad I got this software. There is also advice on buying a new car, and things to look out for. This is very valuable information.	1
I've had this software for about 6 months now. And although I haven't officially used any of the forms yet, I find this software to be really good reference material. I feel like I can rely on the information in this software more than I would from a random source I found on Google.  Even with all the info, I don't think I would close on a property purchase without an agent and lawyer. But I feel like there's enough documentation in this software that I could do my homework and educate myself before intelligently speaking to an agent. I probably won't use 75% of the information here, but it's very nice to know that information is available and reliable.	1
This software is great.  It has a large selection of business legal forms ready for you to complete and customize.  It is so easy to use.  You don't have to be a lawyer to work the software, but you might want to have one review the documents before signing.  I highly recommend this software.  I can think of lots of uses for business owners.	1
The Quicken Legal Business Pro book and application is a terrific addition to my business software arsenal.  Full of useful information, and a comprehensive collection of highly useable legal forms,  its a great help in getting your paperwork in order and standardizing your forms.  Highly recommended!	1
This is a pretty good piece of software if you're a small company, looking to save some money on legal documents.  Lawyers can cost an arm and a leg (and part of the other arm too) where I live, so this kind of software is a good thing to have.  I wouldn't use this if I were a huge corporation with 1,000 employees, though.  But if you're small, and need some help with things like this, then it's probably right up your alley.  On top of the documents you can prepare, there's also five legal books on the CD as well.  I won't list them all, you can just look at the main product listing for that.  It also has another side benefit - it's not JUST for businesses.  Your home can get some benefit from this as well.  This isn't a substitute for a good attorney, but definitely will get you moving on a number of legal issues cheaply.	1
This program is ideal for the small business owner and home-based business. It uses a simple question and answer format using a combination of questions, drop-downs and menu options.  You're guided through the process step by step. This can feel tedious if you're used to using a spreadsheet, but actually makes sense for the forms provided.  It took about 10 minutes to create an invoice, but during that process the software stored my customer's information and my information - so next time it will go even faster.  The program could not be any easier to use!  Installation was easy, and as a bonus for registering you're sent a download link for "101 Law Forms for Personal Use" - a 392 page version of the book.  The program and the PDF file both depend on the nolo website for support, online forms, updates. etc. Some of these services are free to registered users, others are free to all.	1
Received the order fast and it works on snow leppord! Installed on my MacBook pro in a matter of minutes. Packaging was like new. National geographic rocks and is faster than the new version since I have older hardware. Also, it comes with free updates. .	1
National Geographic is one of the items that is part of the fabric of our lives.  Every one of us, from somewhere, remembers reading them as a child.  Pictures of faraway places, animals and people different from us stoked our imaginations while creating a sense of wonder that such things existed.  Originally sold only by subscription many homes treasured the magazines carefully preserving them in bookcases.  This set provides all the issues from 1888 to 2008, 120 years, in one small box.  Each issue is presented page by page, starting at the front cover and proceeding to the back cover.  All the maps are here too.  The set shows the world as it was and the process of changing into the world of today.  This is a living history lesson showing how America changes and adjusts into the modern world. I am running this on a 64-bit VISTA system with no problems.  Print quality is excellent in even the 1888 issues.  A page magnifier is available but I have not found it necessary.  Photo quality varies over time.  The early issues have poor quality photographs because the printing process was not that great.  You can view all of the old photos but many are not that clear an image.  The interface is not intuitive but it is not impossible to use either.  I have several of these collections and cannot comment of how a first time user will find this.  There are better interfaces but this is not an impossible one and it is fully supported. Is it worth it?  That depends on you.  Can you lose yourself in looking at pictures of Europe in 1925?  Would you want to read about the Pacific Northwest in the 1930?  Can you spend a couple of hours looking at advertisement of products that no longer exist?  When was the last time you bought an icebox or considered buying a Cord?  If you can answer yes to these questions, this set will provide all the opportunities to do these things you can wish for.	1
There's so much history in here...120 years, in a package you can hold in your hands, complete with photographs, advertising - everything. What a great concept.  Yes, it has install issues on Windows 7, the search functions aren't as good as what you find on Google, and as of now, there's no way to keep it updated as new content becomes available. But, with a product like this, the long-term view is what counts - eventually these issues will be worked out, and you get to own a piece of history for something like three cents an issue.  Now, if only we could get the same deal from the NY Times. :)	1
All the National Geographics together, and easily searched! I made the 'mistake' of buying direct from NG, but even with a discount it was more than on Amazon.	1
As of December 2009 there are definitely ways to copy the DVDs to a hard drive so that the DVDs are not required to use the program.  If you install the software and use the update option in Preferences to install the latest update then you get an option to specify where the DVD data is stored, and you just need to copy the contents of the disk1-6 folders from each disk to that location. Note that this copy process is rather slow (if you have more than one DVD drive you can do more than one copy at the same time) and the data are stored in inividual image files for each page so it has to copy around 34,000 files per disk. Each file copy seems to cause the DVD drive to seek back and forth across the disk once, which means 34,000 seeks per disk which slows the process significantly (to over an hour per disk) and also might result in a significant amount of wear and tear on the DVD drive (this is speculation).  Note that you'll need 50GB of available disk space if you choose to install all the data to disk!  The developers are actively updating the program and the latest Mac version has a "copy everything to disk" feature which does the work for you, and the Windows version should have this same function enabled literally any day now. The web site to follow for the latest info is COMPLETENATGEO.  This version of the Complete National Geographic is *much* improved over the one from several years ago. The viewing application is a much nicer application, it scales the images to the size of the application window nicely, and the full two-page spread images are quite readable on a 24" 1920x1200 monitor.  Our local Costco has had a huge pile of these this holiday season, so I hope this review helps out some of the new purchasers looking for information about the product. If you haven't bought it yet, it's a great deal and an amazing wealth of information and imagery. Issues through (most of?) 2008 are included, and they say there will be an option in 2010 to buy the 2009 issues to add to your existing collection.  Highly recommended.  G.	1
I'm going to order this, so this review isn't about the main product.  One of the things genealogists do is not simply looking up names, birthdates, marriage dates, etc.  To add "color" to the statistical information and "bring it alive", information about the period and locality is also used.  What were the contents of a Sears & Roebuck catalog from the late 1880's?  According to one reviewer this package includes the original ads.  Sample excerpts can be used by genealogists.  What were my grandparents seeing in magazines when my mom was born in 1923?	1
This system is helpful for both beginners and advanced students. It is as good as other systems that cost you much more.  I think that Spanish should be learned by any who wish to succeed in business in the coming years, and this system gives you a good start.	1
It's kind of a fun program.  My boys (3 & 5) love computer "games", and to them, this is something of a game.  The vocabulary lessons are presented in a manner of: here are some words, now you repeat them, now you answer which is which.  That seems to work pretty well.  I have not yet gotten to any grammar lessons yet, so I can't say anything there at this time.  One factor that I really like is that the program has TWO Spanish speakers, so that you can hear two different tones of voice and accents pronouncing the words.  We will keep using this, and I hope to come back and update this review when I have gotten to the grammar lessons.	1
Instant Immersion Spanish is a good place to start learning Spanish.  The cost alone makes it a nearly risk free purchase.  Will it make you fluent?  No it won't, but I'm seeing it for a 'low' price with free shipping.  What have you got to lose?  I can't comment on how it compares to Rosetta  Stone,  but just their Level 1 alone is 5 x the $'s. The program CD's focus on teaching words and basic phrases, these are OK, but really don't get too in depth with what you need to know to really learn Spanish.  The real guts of the course is what they call the Mp3/iPod Audio Disk.  This is where they go over verb conjugation and such, basically the rules of Spanish.  There isn't any pretty interface, but I found this one CD alone worth the purchase price. The "Who is Oscar Lake" CD game is really lame.  They could have just omitted it.  As I said, the other GUI CDs are OK, and worth going through for the most part.  The Level 1 Disk 2 CD looks like it was left over from the 90's.  I really didn't get too much out of it and it did appear to be information that was covered elsewhere.  There are several different looks to the CDs, so it really looks like they have just bundled programs that they compiled over the years.  I also noticed that some of the translations are not 100% accurate.  For instance, the Spanish phrasing would obviously contain the words Madrid or Barcelona, but the English translations would not.  This kind of made me wonder why.  Based primarily of the price point, I do recommend this program as a starting point for learning Spanish.  There are many other free resources online that you can use to supplement the course including translators, traveler cheat sheets and so on.	1
Before ordering this product directly from Amazon, I did my homework by posting comments in the comments sections of the most popular Amazon reviewers who have purchased and reviewed this product and other popular Spanish learning software.  After doing my homework, I finally decided to invest in this product.  Many people complain about the teaching method of this software but I think the problem is that many people are comparing this economically priced software with foreign language learning software that costs several hundred dollars.  If the price of this software were several hundred dollars, I would have probably only given it 1 star. But this software does not cost several hundred dollars and happens to be one of the most economically priced software programs available for learning a foreign language. At the very least, this software will teach you how to say and recognize a few hundred words. For that reason, I must give this software at least 4 stars.  Without a doubt, what I like most about this program is that it has lots of Spanish lessons at a very good price. The first level consists of 2 CDs that cover a lot of basic words and phrases that are helpful to know. And the second level also has 2 CDs that build on the words and phrases covered in Level 1 by giving the learner the tools to put together increasingly more complex sentences while ensuring that you are also learning proper pronunciation.  I found that the second level taught enough so that at the completion of the second level, the student should be able to string together basic phrase or sentences in order to converse about members of the family, sports, etc.  The third level which consisted of two CDs as well was my favorite level because it was the most challenging which is ideal for me because  I have been studying Spanish for quite a while. The actual conversations in the third level were a lot more challenging for me than the single vocabulary words covered in level 1 and the basic phrases covered in level 2. The third level also helped to reinforce what I learned in the other lessons.  There is a bonus CD with a game that comes with Immersion Spanish called Oscar On The Lake which I did not find fun at all.  I could have easily done without the Oscar On The Lake game. In fact, I don't see what was the point in including this Oscar On The Lake game with the program.  But I did find that the audio CD was very helpful. The audio CD thoroughly covered the alphabet, greetings, pronouns (including vosotros) conjugating AR, ER, and IR verbs, weather, numbers, and vocabulary for shopping and at the post office. What I liked most about the audio CD is that the instructor gave a lot grammatical explanations  including when the "vos" (as opposed to "vosotros") is used instead of the "tu" form. One of the bonuses that I received with my Immersion Spanish software was in interactive DVD with Spanish learning games for the whole family. The DVD is can be used on the TV.  But I haven't had a chance to use the DVD because the 3 Levels consisting of 6 CDs and the audio CD, have enough to keep me busy for a quite a while.  One feature about Immersion Spanish the appeals to me is that the software can be used by both children and adults who want to learn Spanish.  Based on the product's price and the content, I recommend it.  Some other products that I recommend for Spanish language learners are Visual Link Spanish. This is a great  learning Spanish software program for the visual learner. Before I discovered&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Visual-Link-Spanish-Level-I/dp/B0000C08KK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Visual Link Spanish - Level I</a>, in all of my reviews I used to recommend Rosetta software. But after using Visual Link, it is clear to me that this software is a much better alternative for the visual learner. If you do not consider  yourself a visual learner, then&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Fluenz-Version-F2-Spanish-1-2-3-4-5-with-supplemental-Audio-CDs-and-Podcasts/dp/B002ZF31NQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Fluenz Version F2: Spanish 1+2+3+4+5 with supplemental Audio CDs and Podcasts</a>&nbsp;is probably the way to go.  To speak Spanish fluently besides having a stand alone course as your base and a method to learn new Spanish words, you will also need to master conjugating Spanish verbs. The best product for that is the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Verbarrator-Version-1-1-Windows-Version/dp/B002EADP1A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Verbarrator Version 1.1 (Windows Version)</a>&nbsp;software. The Verbarrator software does a great job of replacing the boring Spanish verb conjugation books and makes learning Spanish verbs enough fun that you will want to use the software every day. And the more you use the tool the quicker that you will learn how to conjugate Spanish verbs and reach fluency. The Verbarrator is probably the best investment that I have made in my journey to learn Spanish because it is a product that I use almost daily.  The last product that I recommend for anyone who is really serious about learning Spanish is&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/The-Ultimate-Spanish-Review-and-Practice-w-CD-ROM-UItimate-Review-Reference-Series/dp/0071492151/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">The Ultimate Spanish Review and Practice w/CD-ROM (UItimate Review & Reference Series)</a>. This Spanish grammar book covers every aspect of Spanish grammar imaginable. To get the equivalent learning-Spanish value of this one book you would have to buy 3 or 4 books in the Practice Makes Perfect series	1
This is a slow and tedious way to learn a language and I am running on Win7 with an i7 processor and 8 gigs of memory so it is the program, not my machine. It slowly reads a lot of short old tired videos from the CD. The product appears to be a recycled jumble of mostly old language disks. Two are more modern and move at a reasonable pace. Some disks require installing programs such as Flash, and Quick Time. I don't like programs that use because Flash contains spy-ware (tracking) that you have to go to the Adobe website to disable. Some disks seem to repeat the material on others but in a different format. If I had demoed Instant Immersion first I never would have bought it.	-1
I found Instant Immersion to be ok -- I mean, it's no Rosetta Stone, but of course Rosetta Stone costs HUNDREDS of dollars -- so this is a GREAT value for what you get.  I find that it's probably most helpful as a supplement for a beginning Spanish class,  if it's been a couple of years since your last class and your basic Spanish is rusty (like me), or if you just want to learn a few conversational phrases for a trip or to be able to communicate on a very basic level.  WAY more interesting than just having a book or a cassette.  I would hardly call it "immersion," however, unless they sent several Spanish-speaking people to your house along with the program!  (Which they don't.)  ;-)  By the way, it's nice that it works on both PC and Mac...I don't see that a lot with software (especially when it's fairly inexpensive).	1
Takes a bit for slower computers to kick up the CD-ROM drive (I'd suggest loading this on you HD if possible) seems OK on computer with faster processor and CD-ROM/DVD drive. The first disks take a little fishing around with unlabeled tabs, but this could be intentional to get your mind into another space???  Fun and easy to use.includes flash card type games, lots of repetition of vocabulary and as much on pronunciation as you'd like.  Covers general travel conversation, including medical emergencies and business. A great start for starting to learn a new language. Can't beat the price!  Would suggest for students who are considering or will be taking Spanish in high school and/or college.. It's good to familiarize yourself with the language, sentence structure, etc. before jumping in, and this is at your own pace.  Is NOT Mexican Spanish, but Castillian Spanish!  Good to use if you are going to take a trip, as the basics are very helpful, even if shopping!!!  Great way to start learning Spanish and you'll find there is much cross-over to Mexican Spanish, Italian, Potugese, etc. on your own if you go onto learn more languages.	1
I don't think there's much I can add to the other reviewers here--there's lots of vocab, but not a lot of grammar.  The option to listen to vocab lists on an MP3 player is nice and convenient and lets me review while driving.  The flash cards are good reinforcement.  I'm not finished with the whole set yet, but even when I get there, I'm certainly not going to be fluent--that's impossible, but I think this would be a great companion to a Spanish class.  I don't think there is enough grammar to be a stand-alone course, though--I'd like to see more grammar lessons.  Bottom line: if you are trying to learn Spanish, go ahead and give this a try--at this cost you don't have much to lose!	1
I like this langauge learning system MUCH better than other ones I've tried, such as Fluenz. I have not tried Rosetta Stone (too expensive.)  likes: colorful, clickable graphics menu system Excellent organization (colors, numbers, foods, phrases, etc.) both male and female speech examples for all. Games are fun and easy to learn. Some games show how the word is spelled as well as spoken works with Apple products, including ipod and iphone professionally done  dislikes; There is one bad recording for "Hola" on the DVD Didn't automatically run upon putting in the disk- (have Windows Vista, had to manually begin install.)  Am I actually learning the language? YES, at least the basics. Overall, this company is on the right track.	1
I have wanted to learn Spanish as a second language for years.  I have used tapes, CDs and software, but I always found them boring and I didn't stick with them.  What is different about Instant Immersion Spanish is the fun you have while learning the language.  While the approach used in this software is similar to other more expensive programs, it is less of an investment than if you bought one of the high priced programs and still comparable in quality.  For someone beginning to learn Spanish Instant Immersion Spanish is fun and effective.  It would rate this program a high value for the price.	1
If you want a good introduction to the Spanish language, I think this program would be helpful to you. It would also be a good companion product if you were taking a Spanish class or using a more comprehensive Spanish course product. Since I don't speak Spanish, I think I'm a good test subject. Here's what I liked and didn't like about this course:  I received the product as a Vine Voices item to review, but if I were to buy it, the price is reasonable for the amount of material you receive. There are 9 disc included, with lessons, in levels 1, 2 and 3, an Oscar Lake game, one disc that includes phrases in everyday language, and to perfect your pronunciation. There's also a disc that you can transfer to an MP3 player and carry with you. I didn't like that it's necessary to insert the discs in your computer in order to use the program, other than the one MP3 disc that I just mentioned. So if you're traveling, it's extra materials to carry around. It would have been nice to be able to just load them on a laptop. With a netbook, most which come without CD drives, this would have been even more of a problem.  There were a lot of lessons with phrases and some with sentences, but it was difficult without much knowledge of the language to figure out what some of the individual words meant. Many times I was guessing. It was nice to have all the photos and video of people talking, or at least of their mouths moving. I liked that they used both male and female voices and that they repeated phrases and sentences twice in most cases. I've learned numbers and some phrases, but I would have a difficult time putting together a sentence on the basis of what I've learned with this course. Different verb tenses which are important to learning a language weren't covered in a meaningful way. The MP3/iPod audio disc was useful, as far as it went, carried some information on verb tenses, but just not enough that I had enough understanding beyond the phrases covered.  I'm not sure how this program compares to Rosetta Stone because it's been at least 12 years since I've tried Rosetta Stone and in a different language than this and I'm sure there have been many changes in the program over the years.  If you need a companion course to a class you're taking or to a more comprehensive course I think this would be an great way to supplement that. Or if you just want a nice introduction to Spanish, to see if it's a language that you'd enjoy learning this product would also be excellent and the price is very reasonable. But to actually learn to converse with Spanish speakers, I think you need something more.	1
In my line of work, it's a great idea to learn another language, and Spanish being the main lingo outside of English in my area, the Instant Immersion program seemed like the ticket.  It may very well be. If it WORKED.  I don't want to stay how many times I put the various DVDs that come with this program in my computer, to bring up a program that did nothing. I looked in the box: no instructions. I went to the developer's website: no useful information. I went to another Immersion-only website: no helpful links.  Now this might be because I have a Macbook, and not a PC. But the program is supposed to be Mac-compatible, so what gives??  I may revise this if and when the developer gets back to me (so far, no replies, and with a program this problematic, that's not a good sign.)  I give this two stars for what it MIGHT be like if I can ever figure out how to make this work, and of course, the bargain price. But it ain't much of a bargain if it doesn't WORK. I'll be glad to revise it if and when.  Meanwhile, Rosetta Stone's looking better and better. Now if it only they'd do something bout the price!	-1
The Encyclopedia Britannica 2011 Ultimate Edition (formerly "Student and Home Edition") builds on the success of its completely revamped previous editions in 2006-10. The rate of innovation in the last five versions was impressive and welcome. It continues apace in this rendition with Britannica Biographies (Great Minds, Heroes and Villains, and Leaders), Classical Music (500 audio files arranged by composer), and a great Workspace for Project Management (a kind of friendly digital den). Six months of free access to the myriad riches of the Britannica Online complete the package (as well as monthly updates and discounts on a plethora of products).  The Britannica comes bundled with an atlas (close to 1800 maps linked to articles and 287 World Data Profiles of individual countries and territories); the Merriam-Webster Dictionary and Thesaurus, augmented by a Spanish-English translation dictionary; classic articles from previous editions; thirteen yearbooks (12,200 articles in total); Interactive Timelines with 4000+ indexed timeline entries; a Research Organizer; and a Knowledge Navigator (called The Brain or BrainStormer). All told, it offers a directory of more than 166,000 reviewed and vetted links to online content.  In its new form the Britannica is user-friendly, with an A to Z Quick Search feature. The Britannica's newest interface is even more intuitive and uncluttered than previously and is great fun to use. It offers morsels of knowledge, some of it date-specific, appetizingly presented through a ticker tape of visuals that leisurely scrolls across the bottom of the screen plus highly edifying interactive tours of articles and attendant media.  When you enter even the first few letters of a term in the search box, it offers various options and is persistent: no need to click on the toolbar's "search" button every time you want to find something in this vast storehouse of knowledge. Moreover, the user can save search results onto handy "Virtual Notecards". Whole articles can be copied onto the seemingly inexhaustible Workspace.  The new Britannica's display is tab-based, avoiding the erstwhile confusing proliferation of windows with every move. Most importantly, articles appear in full, not in sections. This major improvement facilitates the finding of relevant keywords in and the printing of entire texts. These are only a few of the numerous alterations and enhancements.  Perhaps the most refreshing change is the Britannica's Update Center. Dozens of monthly updates and new, timely articles are made available online (subject to free registration). A special button alerts the user when an entry in the base product has been updated.  Regrettably, the updates are not incorporated into the vast encyclopedia and its search interface: they are out there on a website. Moreover, the product does not alert its user to the existence of completely new articles, only to updated ones. It takes a manual scan of the monthly lists to reveal newly added content.  Speaking of updates, one must not forget to dwell on the Britannica's unequalled yearbooks. Each annual volume contains the year in events, scientific developments, and everything you wanted to know about the latest in any and every conceivable field of human endeavor, or Nature. About 12,200 articles culled from the last 13 editions buttress and update the Encyclopedia's anyhow impressive offerings.  The Britannica provides considerably more text than any other extant traditional encyclopedia, print or digital (a total of 62 million words). But it has noticeably enhanced its non-textual content over the years (the 1994-7 editions had nothing or very little but words, words, and more words): it now boasts in excess of 30,000 images and illustrations (depending on the version) and 900 video and audio clips. This is not to mention the Britannica Classics: articles from Britannica's most famous contributors: from Sigmund Freud and Albert Einstein to Harry Houdini and from Marie Curie to Orville Wright.  The Britannica fully supports serious research. It is a sober assemblage of first-rate essays, up to date bibliographies, and relevant multimedia. It constitutes a desktop university library: thorough, well-researched, comprehensive, trustworthy.  The Britannica's 84-107,000 articles (depending on the version) are long and thorough, supported by impressive bibliographies, and written by the best scholars in their respective fields. The company's Editorial Board of Advisors reads like the who's who of the global intellectual and scientific community.  The Britannica is an embarrassment of riches. Users often find the wealth and breadth of information daunting and data mining is fast becoming an art form. This is why the Britannica incorporated the "Personal Brain" to cope with this predicament. But an informal poll I conducted online shows that few know how to deploy it effectively.  The Britannica also sports Student and Elementary versions of its venerable flagship product, replete with a Homework Helpdesk, "how to" documents, and interactive games, activities, and math and science tutorials. Still, the Britannica is far better geared to tackle the information needs of adults and, even more so, professionals. It provides unequalled coverage of its topics.  Ironically, this is precisely why the market positioning of the Britannica's Elementary and Student Encyclopedias is problematic: compared to the Wikipedia, the Britannica's brand is distinctly adult and scholarly. The vacuum left by the Encarta (lamented) discontinuance, though, should make it easier to market the Student and Elementary versions (which are an integral part of the Ultimate Edition and not sold separately).  Still, the 2011 editions of both the Student and Elementary encyclopedias improve on the past in terms of both coverage and facilities: the Homework Helpdesk is a collection of useful homework resources including a video subject browse; online learning games and activities; online subject spotlights; and how-to documents on topics such as writing a book review. There are also Learning Games and Activities: hundreds of fun and interactive games and activities to help students with subjects like Math, Science, and Social Studies. Both versions are updated monthly with new online-only articles.  The current edition is fully integrated with the Internet. Apart from articles about new topics and personalities in the news, it offers additional and timely content and revisions on a dedicated Web site. The digital product includes a staggering number of links (165,808!) to third party content and articles on the Web. The GeoAnalyzer, which compares national statistical data and generates charts and graphs, is now Web-based and greatly enhanced.  The Britannica would do well to offer a browser add-on search bar and to integrate with desktop search tools from Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, and others. Currently it offers search results through Google but this requires the user to install add-ons or plug-ins and to go through a convoluted rite of passage. A seamless experience is in the cards. Users must and will be able to ferret content from all over - their desktop, their encyclopedias, and the Web - using a single, intuitive interface.  Some minor gripes:  The atlas, dictionary, and thesaurus incorporated in the Britannica are still surprisingly outdated. Why not use a more current - and dynamically updated - offering? What about dictionaries for specialty terms (medical or computer glossaries, for instance)?  Despite considerable improvement over the previous edition, the Britannica still consumes (not to say hogs) computer resource far in excess of the official specifications. This makes it less suitable for installation on older PCs and on netbooks. If you own a machine with anything earlier than Pentium 4, less than 1 Gb RAM, and less than 10 Gb of really free space, the Britannica would be clunky at best.  But that's it. Don't think twice. Run to the closest retail outlet (or surf to the Britannica's Web site) and purchase the 2010 edition now. It offers excellent value for money (less than $40, with a rebate). For less than the price of an antivirus software and for a fraction of the cost of Windows 7, you will significantly enhance your access to the sum total of human knowledge and wisdom.  With the demise of Microsoft's Encarta (it has been discontinued) and the tribulations of the Wikipedia (its rules have been revamped to resemble a traditional encyclopedia, alienating its contributors in the process), the Encyclopedia Britannica 2010 (established in 1768) may have won the battle of reference.

I installed the software on both  Mac 10.6.4 and Win 7 machines and it works well.  Recommended.	1
I loved this game.  Of course it didn't have all of the amazing features the others have.  I bought it so along ago that it doesn't play on windows xp.  It makes me mad i can't still play it.  It was a blast.  Switching cds was annoying.  But this game is a classic.  You can get it for so cheap now too.  I wouldn't pass it up.	1
You, as Nancy Drew, are asked to stay at your Aunt Eloise's house to solve a murder: Who killed Jake Rogers? In this small Florida town, you will meet four people who all had ties to Jake. Who is it and why? Is it Daryl Grey whose secret had been discovered by Jake? Or is it Connie Watson, who too had been blackmailed by Jake? Or is it that exchange student from Japan, Hal who would do anything to get a scholorship? Or is it that football jock Hector "Hulk" Sanchez who seems to had ties to a drug store theft? Blackmail, deceit, and lies all take part in HerInteractive's 1st in a series of award-winning CD-ROMS.  Why was it only given 4 stars? Graphics for one. The cartoon-like characters in a world of 3D makes the game slightly tacky. The 2 CD-ROMS is another. The game goes by slow enough without making it worse. My computer often froze during the CD change. Also, the game was on the difficult side, not too difficult but complex nonetheless. The story was great, and the ending was awesome! I recommend buying!	1
Ok, Secrets Can Kill was a good game, don't get me wrong! The graphics are okay, but the people look like cartoon characters. I beat S.C.K. and it was easy but hard enough for me to take awhile on figuring things out. Anyone who adores Nancy Drew anything would like or love this game!	1
If you're going to get an ND (Nancy Drew) game at all, don't get this one, at least not until you're done with all the other ones. Because this is the first one out of the entire Nancy Drew game series, it has terrible graphics. The people are 2D and look like they were cut out of a cartoon. It's even worse when the environment is 3D! Plus, you have to keep on switching between 2 disks! It's very tiring and annoying. If you have a fast computer, the likeliness of it is that it'll freeze a lot. That's what happened on my computer and it's fast, but when my friend played it (who has a slow computer), it only froze ONCE. But on the plus side, the whole concept of taking Nancy Drew books and turning them into interactive mystery games for children is brilliant. It's absolutely fun and educating but not to the point that it's boring. I don't suggest THIS specific mystery game, but I do suggest you start playing Nancy Drew games because all of them are fun except this one.	-1
I have now played all 3 of the Nancy Drew mystery games (that are available as I type this).  This one, "Secrets Can Kill", was my least favorite.  In all fairness, this was the first Nancy Drew game they made, and it's understandable that the graphics aren't as good as in the later two.  This also may explain why the game is shorter; I'm guessing they realized that the game would be better if it took longer, so the other two games ("Stay Tuned For Danger" and "Message In a Haunted Mansion") have more playing time.  On the other hand, because it is shorter, it's also easier, so this might be better for slightly younger girls than the other two.  Also, this game requires 2 CDs--you have to switch back and forth.  This was annoying at first, but soon became bearable.  But really, this game was a lot of fun.  Even with the less-than-stellar graphics, there were still a lot of word puzzles and things to explore.  This game and "Message" both have slide puzzles, though, which I can't stand.  (Okay, I'm just no good at them, I'll admit it!)  Anyway, if you're interested in trying a Nancy Drew game, I highly recommend it, but I suggest you try one of the other ones first.	1
I couldn't wait to ditch the Windows ME that came on my new PC. I had plenty of RAM (you need at least 64 MB and in my opinion that is cutting it a bit fine.) The installation went smoothly, most of my applications work fine. This is a new PC, just shy of 1GB cpu speed and with components that have drivers for Windows 2000. Warning: upgrading an older computer? Make sure the drivers for sound cards and peripherals are available for Windows 2000. You can do this by checking the website support section for the various devices you own. Download any new drivers you might need. If your PC is too old, you may not find any drivers for certain components. This happened to one of our PC's at home. If you are setting up a home network, Windows 2000 is MUCH better than Win98 and WinME for doing this. And it boots a lot faster than WinME and WAY way faster than NT. I did have the occasional system hang but nothing like with WinME or Win98. In short, this is the operating system of choice for PC's if your PC can handle it.	1
Stay Tuned for Danger is the follow-up Nancy Drew game to the award-winning Secrets Can Kill. While Stay Tuned for Danger still leaves quite a lot to be desired, it definitely shows improvement in the overall quality of the Nancy Drew games. This is a step in the right direction.  This game takes place shortly after Secrets Can Kill. Famous soap opera star of "Light of Our Love" fame, Mattie Jensen, has caught ear of how Nancy solved her last case. Mattie calls Nancy's Aunt Eloise (who's coincidentally a friend of hers) to request that Nancy fly up to her apartment in New York City to solve a brand new case. Mattie's co-star, Rick Arlen, has been receiving death threats. Nobody knows who they're coming from, and despite the treats becoming more serious, Rick refuses to go to the police. It's now up to Nancy to go undercover as an extra on the set to find a would-be killer...  The plot is solid, and despite the age of this game, it remains one of the greatest plots I've ever seen in a Nancy Drew game. It has a very mature, dark, and frightening atmosphere. Even though this game doesn't deal with curses or ghostly haunts, the threats that Rick (and later, Nancy) receives from the culprit become very life-threatening and haunting in and of themselves.  The quality of the game leaves a lot to be desired, but it's a big step up from Secrets Can Kill. Thankfully there is no longer any need to switch between discs. The controls still lack user friendliness, but they have improved slightly (now there is no longer need to scroll up and down through the environment as well as left to right). There are also more puzzles, some of them holding on to the quality level that the modern games have.  Sadly, it's very easy to run into glitches and have to start the game over. It's easy to miss important items that Nancy must pick up to solve the case, and therefore requires the player to start the game over again or wait a long period of time doing nothing until finally being able to get where Nancy needs to be to pick up the item. This is my biggest complaint about the game, as this makes it very frustrating for the player if he/she runs into these setbacks.  The graphics are still weak, but they've improved significantly. The characters are now 3D like the environments. They look more like Barbie dolls than actual people, but it's much better than having them look like 2D cartoons. The environmental graphics are of mostly the same quality as the first game, but that isn't a very bad thing (especially considering the age of this game).  The characters in this game probably rank among the best casts in a Nancy Drew game yet. There are SO many characters in the game (six suspects, with eleven characters playing a part of the story). The suspects include Mattie Jensen, who might be using Nancy to throw suspicion off of herself, Rick Arlen, who might be behind the threats to gain publicity, Dwayne Powers, Mattie's agent (formerly Rick's too) who is jealous of Rick's success, Millie Strathorn, the eccentric old lady who owns the WWB Network (the studio where "Light of Our Love" is recorded) and has a hard time differentiating truth from reality, Bill Pappas, the unseen producer of the show, and Lillian Weiss, the angry and bitter director of "Light of Our Love". There are also two characters who play roles in the story, but aren't interactive "suspects". These include Ralph Guardino, who is the security guard of WWB but can never really be questioned as a suspect, and Owen Spayder, an unseen stagehand who seems to have a larger role in the story later on. Nancy's best friends Bess Marvin and George Fayne and her boyfriend Ned Nickerson can still be called for help like in the first game, but they're also able to be conversed with about her case and even provide insight into the case itself.  The music in the game is also well done. I prefer the Secrets Can Kill soundtrack, but the soundtrack heard in this game is also very enjoyable. It held on to the perfect "New York City" feel while leaving off an atmosphere of mystery. The music heard while sneaking into the studio at night made the place all the more eerie, while the music heard while exploring Mattie's apartment during the day was rather upbeat. I'd say that the soundtrack was perfect.  While Stay Tuned for Danger remains a bit of a sub-par game, it's a drastic improvement compared to its predecessor. If you've played this and are considering giving up of the Nancy Drew games, please don't do so yet. Starting with Message in a Haunted Mansion, the Nancy Drew games really do get better from here on out, and Stay Tuned for Danger does tell an awesome story that's worth experiencing. I'm hoping that a re-release of this game is issued (like the one they did with Secrets Can Kill, but staying more true to the original this time), because it could use some improvements and the original isn't compatible with computers more advanced than Windows XP. Those who started playing the Nancy Drew games later on deserve to experience the first two games, and the first two games also deserve better quality. So, here's to hoping for Stay Tuned for Danger Remastered!	-1
NOTE:I am posting this review on both product pages for this game since Amazon has the same game listed as two different products.  After getting stuck on this game for a while, I had put it away to try later. After I tried it again and managed to finish it, this game quickly became one of my favorite Nancy Drew games. "Stay Tuned for Danger" may be one of the older games in the Nancy Drew adventure game series, but it is also one of the best.  Story-A soap opera star has called you to New York to figure out who is sending death threats to her co star. It soon becomes evident that someone is out to hurt or kill him as the threats elevate and some near fatal accidents occur. It is up to you to figure out who is causing it all.  Graphics-Although the graphics are much better than the first game, they still aren't perfect. They are in 3D, and the 3D is done pretty well. The characters are also pretty good, but they tend to freeze in awkward positions as they are done talking, only resuming movement when they start to talk again. But, overall, the graphics are pretty good.  Sound-The music in the game is OK, but it really doesn't stand out as being catchy. The background sounds are good in the game, and the voice acting is good, too. Some of the voice actors sound like they were really into their parts while some sounded like they were bored.  Gameplay-This game, like all games in the Nancy Drew adventure series, is a first-person point-and-click game. You will move around between 3 main locations while solving puzzles, questioning suspects, and finding clues. The puzzles in this game are very innovative and may require some serious thought to solve them, but although they are a challenge, they are still really fun. In addition to talking to about 6 people in the game, you can also call your friends on the phone to talk over the case from them. You can also ask them for help which is a way to get hints for what to do next.  Length-It's a pretty good-sized game. There's a lot to do throughout the game, and it's not necessarily very obvious what to do next. The game should probably last several hours at least.  All in all, this is probably one of the most challenging and fun games in the Nancy Drew series. It lasts a while, and it incorporates great adventure gaming elements into the gameplay. I highly recommend it to fans of the Nancy Drew series and adventure gamers everywhere!	1
Here you are again as Nancy Drew now solving another mystery: Why is Rick Arlen, the soap opera star of "Light of Our Love," receiving these horribe death threats? And why is it that everyone in and out of the studio seems to have something against him? You're about to set foot as an extra on the set to sneak around to find out more about the odd death threats. Even clues from cod liver oil to 3D glasses could become important in "Stay Tuned for Danger."  Oh, wow! The characters are now 3D in the second of the Nancy Drew PC game series. This game was so much easier than the first, no 2-disk garbage, and an amazing story that you almost want to never end! Two thumbs up!	1
Stay Tuned for Danger is, once again, a Nancy Drew game I beat. I love it! I mean, this game pulls you in...There are so many suspects and one minute you will be "This person is definitely the culprit," but the next you'll be saying, "Wait, this person is the culprit!" I loved this game a lot! Even though it's only the 2nd Nancy Drew game in the series, the grpahics are wayy better than Secrets Can Kill! I recommend this game to anyone!	1
I have used just about every version of Windows. These are my observations.  1. Windows 98. Windows 98 was easy on the memory-hogging a/v pizazz, but where Windows 98 ultimately fails is in the security department. I expect my OS to be secure. In addition, I expect my OS to be stable. Windows 98 frequently crashes...sometimes for what seems like no reason at all! Windows 98 fails these tests.  2. Windows XP. Windows XP is based on the stable Windows NT architecture, but XP fails with me on several issues. The first issue is too much a/v pizazz in the GUI. I want an OS with a GUI that "just works" without any frilly stuff. Number two, Windows XP has been very suspectible to security flaws since its release. And number three, Windows XP is not as stable as Windows 2000 Professional and crashes from time to time. So Windows XP fails these tests.  3. Linux. I mainly use Xandros and Linspire as my choices of Linux distributions. Linux was built to be secure and stable. Xandros and Linspire are both secure and stable, but sometimes their GUIs (the KDE desktop environment) seem memory-hogging. Ubuntu Linux has a GUI called GNOME which isn't as memory-hogging, but GNOME just doesn't feel the same as Windows. I don't consider any of these Linux distributions to fail my test because I use Linux more than any other OS, including Windows 2000 Professional.  4. Windows 2000 Professional. Windows 2000 Professional offers me many security options...even though a good firewall and antivirus tool helps out more, Windows 2000 Professional was BUILT to be secure and stable. Windows 98 crashed like a mofo, and Windows XP likes to crash from time to time. I have yet to have Windows 2000 Professional to crash on me. In addition, Windows 2000 Professional gives me a GUI which doesn't rely on frilly nonsense...the a/v pizazz I mentioned above.  Windows 2000 Professional is an OS that is stable, secure, and "just works". Next to the very secure and stable Linux distributions, you can't go wrong with Windows 2000 Professional.	1
As a registered OEM system builder with Microsoft, I was invited and attended the introduction of W2000 Pro. A lot of Microsoft staff was there. One quick note is that there were two types of staff. One wore red shirts, and the others wore blue shirts. The whole day seminar/presentation started with an explanation of, "If you have a technical question, ask one of the Microsoft staff in a red shirt, if you have a sales or marketing question, ask a blue shirt". I got a charge out of that. Sales people are enamored with what the software can do for you, and the technical staff is enamored in how it can do it.  What I really wanted to share with you is the major difference between W2000 and 98; In W2000 the system files are off bounds by different programs regarding, not being able to modify them for each program. In 98, that doesn't hold true. If a change needs to be made to a system file, then the outside software manufacturer can do it. The only help is that you can run system file checker in 98 to check for modified system files, and correct them.  What W2000 does is amazing. Not only can an outside manufacturer not be able to change system files, if you go in and delete a system file, then exit out of the folder, then go back in, sure enough the system file you just deleted was automatically restored when you exited out of the folder.  Another point I wanted to make; the overwhelming advantage of using W2000 over XP when installing in an older machine is that it is compatible with a lot of the older hardware.    Here is the problem: You install XP, and up comes a warning that your hardware is not compatible, or needs drivers loaded in order to work. The manufacturers on the other hand, made your older component, whether it is a sound card, or video card, long before XP arrived, so they never created software drivers for it to run in XP. Nor do they want to spend the resources, to create drivers for a product that they stopped manufacturing 6 years ago. You have to check with the individual components to see if drivers are available for XP before buying it, or replace components. The advantage with W2000 is that you are getting the reliability, and the older hardware (within reason) compatibility.   XP is built on the Windows 2000 platform.  I just built a new machine, so I installed XP Pro on it, and I also picked up a copy of W2000 from an independent seller here at Amazon, and loaded it on my AMD K62-500 for the network. Although I did have one video card that didn't have a W2000 driver, so I changed that very inexpensively with a great 128meg video card on sale with rebates for $29. So my old machines that were built in 1999 run W2000 great. No more programs freeze when several programs are open at the same time. You can leave a machine sitting for a couple of hours and not have it respond poorly when you come back to it, and have to reboot. No more blue screen error reports, having to reboot and run scan disk.  On my new XP machine, I had a bad program loaded, and when would run it, I would get a millisecond error screen, with an instant shut down, then it would reboot without having to run scan disk. I am assuming that since you can't mess with system files, no errors are created. I removed the program, which was a Mickey mouse add on included with a hardware bundle.  Windows 2000 pro rocks. Highly recommended.	1
I love the Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional. I think it manages all the things I have to do and it does it perfectally well. If you have a Pentium 4 and have this OS it is really a good combination. If you have a Pentium through Pentium III you really might want to think about XP because it does make it run a little bit faster. I love the applications this version has. I can just scroll through all the screens and everything is right there! If you buy 2000 Professional Edition you should get the Microsoft Office 2000 Professional Edition also. Microsoft is a very nice company and I think Bill Gates is the man. Microsoft just went wrong with the XP but that is the only Microsoft OS I dislike. I might be trying to convert to Apple but I am still going to keep Microsoft computers. If you were born and raised on Microsoft it isn't too hard to run it! People keep on saying Mac OS (earlier than X) was easier to operate than 95-2000 versions but for real life most people in the U.S. and other countries have Microsoft. I like both companies and if Microsoft makes another good OS after XP I will stick with them from then on.	1
The year is nearly 2004 and I am still using Windows 2000. I used to be an NT 4 user but 2000 has to be the most solid Windows OS I have had the experience of using. Most software packages will still run under 2000 and so will new ones, even most games. Windows 2000 is very secure and I use it mostly for hardcore multimedia work. I can count the amount of crashes I have had within almost 4 years using this OS on 1 hand! For the type of work that I do (Video, web, 3D) I need an OS that is going to be put through some intensive processes. 2000 did it for me. Going with 2000 may not be the best choice for everybody, and XP is probably much better for the domestic home computer user, but if you want a solid system then look no further than 2000. It will not let you down.	1
The amount of BSODs have all but disappeared.  If you have a laptop, you can't go wrong with this.  NT on a laptop was a nightmare, but this is a great OS for it!	1
Excellent OS Very stable. I have a copy running non stop for 1.5 years with no reboots. i will be rebooting it soon so i can do all the latest updates. For games it runs just fine. Don't be fooled and go with XP. Stick with WIndows 2000 Pro and save your money.	1
It is refreshing to have a game show up in the industry that seems sold out to blood and gore that is purely fun entertainment. In the orginal tradition with slightly modern adaptations, the Nancy Drew game STAY TUNED FOR DANGER is easy enough for young inexperienced gamers, but with a challenging level for older gamers wanting more fun. The story is fun, the scenery beautiful... P>Great game to give a young lady for a gift.	1
This is the second game in the Nancy Drew software series that I've tried (I've also played "Message In a Haunted Mansion"), and this was by far the more difficult of the two.  In this game, Nancy is staying with a soap star, Mattie, whose on-screen co-star, Rick, has been receiving death threats.  It's up to Nancy to find out who is behind them.  The game requires not only patience but a smart mind; you have to remember things and write down clues, solve puzzles, and plan things accordingly.  Although I enjoyed playing it, it was frustrating at times, and one time, I spent several hours thinking I was stuck, because I had not noticed the arrival of an important new object. (Boy did I feel silly when I finally noticed it!)  This game will take you many hours to complete.  For fans of the older Nancy Drew books, there's an added bonus -- the games feature objects from the books (look for the clock from "The Secret of the Old Clock", with the crescent on the top!) and other little fun things like that.  I want to offer two hints that I think will be helpful: #1, pay attention to the chair in Mattie's house, near the phone.  #2, explore all rooms **thoroughly**.  You will pick up many objects during this game, and all will either be important, or finding them will just advance the game.  You may need to explore rooms two or three times to find everything.  Also, if after you've installed this game (or Message In A Haunted Mansion), you get an error message that the game can not locate a Direct Draw Surface, and you KNOW your computer meets all the system requirements, make sure your hardware acceleration is set to FULL.  If you're using Windows 98 you can do this by going to your Control Panel, clicking on "Display", then clicking on the "Settings" tab, then clicking the "Advanced..." button, then clicking the "Performance" tab, and pushing the bar all the way up to "Full."  Then you'll need to restart you computer.  This solved the problem for me.  Hope this helps!  All in all, this is a very fun game for teenage girls and young women (and hey, guys too!), great for friends and family members to play together, and just an all-in-all wonderful game.  I hope Dreamcatcher and HER Interactive make more of these!	1
When deciding on an operating system (OS), several factors come into play. Will this OS be intalled onto a laptop or desktop? Is it networked? Will I use this for "business type applications" or "personal type applications"? Do I need strong multimedia capabilities? Windows 2000 Professional is an extremely stable OS. After running it for almost two weeks non-stop, I never had a single problem. Crashes and the infamous "blue screen of death" became obsolete things of the past (unless you're using ME). As long as I did what the OS told me, for example not installing unsigned drivers, the OS behaved the way I wanted it to. Windows 2000 is also an excellent machine for networking, which is simplified by helpful wizards that will guide even a novice through. Because it is so simple to accomplish, this is a favorite OS for laptop users and businesses. Windows 2000 lacks multimedia capabilities found in Windows ME. Some very simplistic multimedia functions are lost in this OS... If you are finding a gaming system, this is NOT it. Another downfall is that many of the drivers are special for 2000, because it lacks the DOS background in ME. This is very similar to XP. Do not worry about this problem however, because almost all equipment will have 2000 drivers. Finally, Windows 2000 looks a lot like ME, making it convenient for an individual who is used to the 9x/ME environment to convert over to the 2000 environment, without crossing over the problems of ME. This is a great OS, however, for the individual desiring the stability and power of this NT based system, as well as the multimedia components of 9x/ME, Windows XP Professional is the way to go...	1
It is worst piece of crap I ever had to install.  As a systems programmer, I can tell you that this OS is defintly not stable enough.  I installed the OS 20+ times in number of different systems.  The Windows File Protection, supposely designed to protect you from over-writing system files, interfere with installation process, and bring systems down the day after the installation.  The BOOT recovery did not work as documented, and in order to recover, you have to bring up recovery console, which is undocumented.  Installing Service Pack 1 patch the system but partitions over 8GB is not reconized, and MS Knowledge base suggested actions did not fix the problem.  At installation, it wriped out the Master Boot Record clean, which make me lose the access to number of different operating systems.  Windows Exporer Picture Browser format has been changed, browsing directory between Windows 98 and Windows 2000 would currupt the picture database, and crash the exporer.  After installation, running setup second time marks drive as "Unreconized or Damaged" partition even if the partition table is in perfect condition.  Once service pack 1 is installed, the system refuse to format these drives due to inability to access drive over 8GB.  Installed Microsoft Visual Studio and Watcom C++ v11 for programming work and the whole system went down after reboot with stop 0x7B, Inaccessible boot device error message.  The system wouldn't even boot in safe mode.  Back to system recovery console again! Install Driver for Symbios 53c785 SCSI controller, GeForce Video Driver, and adding different SCSI contoller sent me back to recovery console again.  The OS appears to be too unstable!	-1
I got tired of the Win98 crashes, so decided to buy and install this. I do web design for a living and so am commonly running a web server locally on  my machine, as well as an application server, editor, browser, email, etc.  all at the same time. Lockups and crashes were pretty common. What a  difference W2K has made! I did a complete reinstall, something that I  definitely recommend if at all possible. Most computers these days can boot  from the CD, which makes this infinitely more easy to do than in the past.  Installation went flawlessly for me...then I ran into the problems others  have mentioned regarding drivers and various programs not working. It's not  as bad as you might think though. At this point, the OS has been out long  enough that most manufacturers are providing drivers. The only one I ran  into a problem with was my CD-R driver software, there was no free upgrade  from Adaptec, so I was stuck paying $100 to get something that worked. 1  star out of 5 to them for their lack of providing a decent option for W2K  users. Other than that, I definitely recommend this upgrade. In addition to  stability, it has a lot of nice features and improvements that make the  Windows experience even better. Only main complaint I have is the price. To  those who still think Microsoft is not a monopoly, I would point to this  product as a perfect example of how the price for their upgrades keeps  going up, while other software keeps going down. If you're not having any  problems with Win 98, you may want to really consider whether this upgrade  is worth the price.	1
I bought this program 2.5 years ago and have been using it to create plots for novels, short stories, etc.  Versions 2 and 3 were tedious and full of technical jargon, which kept me looking at their dictionary of terms.  I  snatched up version 4 immediately because of one feature.  They added a  toggle switch which converts all the technicality into layman's terms.  So,  it's easier to understand, thus easier to use. For those of you who are not  familiar with Dramatica, it is a creative writing tool which helps you  decide where your story is going by asking you certain questions about  plot, themes, character motivation, and story dynamics. It offers you two  ways to do this: the short version (50 questions), which only takes you a  day, or the long version (200+ questions), which could take you up to a  week.  This program doesn't write your story for you; it makes you think.  And, it can give you ideas which you may have never considered before.  To  me, it's well worth the price.	1
I was just looking for formatting software when I came across  Dramatica Pro and decided it was worth a closer look. I found the demo for the program at write-bros.com, and due to other reviews,  also tried the WritePro demo. I found that Dramatica Pro helped me to do all the things I try to remember to do when I'm putting together a story, and it makes it so much easier to reference, add and change things down the line. I'd have given this 5 stars if there was a module for character naming and dialogue working. Of course then it would be a total crutch. I emphatically did not like WritePro, I found it much more confining, more like a writing class than a tool to create and work on my own stories. From write-bros.com you can demo Dramatica Pro, Hollywood Screenwriter, Movie Magic Screenwriter, StoryView and Writer's DreamKit. WritePro you can demo from writepro.com, but they have no demo for FictionMaster which looks like a good program.  If you are more the old fashioned type and don't want or need help creating and writing your stories you can try WriteItNow (writeitnow.com) It has a demo too. The CD costs about $44 and its bound to be slow, it comes over from the UK. I wish that was available from Amazon.com or Amazon.com. UK but it's not.	1
Having worked with, and studied the Dramatica theory of story development, and also looked at and read a few of the examples it is based on, it seems to me that Dramatica 4 is a product somewhat ahead of itself. By this I mean, that to convey the principles of Dramatica the prior art examples are  either too archetypical with no real requirement for the use of Dramatica by those who intend writing such archetypes, or are too flawed so that they do Dramatica no favours due to them being little more than the nearest point of common reference. But by treating Dramatica as a philosophy and an abstraction, and not using it to see how prior art can be aligned to its principles, one can quickly see how Dramatica will enable the writer to create stories and forms hitherto unattainable, simply  because the organisation of the story's elements and form would have been too difficult to keep track of. Therefore, in order to get the desired results from using Dramatica, the user has to gain expertise in the way of defining and structuring a story's elements with Dramatica, and not be trying to defend the outcome on prior art which is a close call. This is the hard part to Dramatica, since  ideal prior art probably doesn't exist, from which to refer,  except for the possibility of future works skilfully created with Dramatica. Now there's a chicken or the egg paradox.	1
Dramatica is a way to organise your thoughts about theme, plot-theme, and characters into a story form as opposed to something that isn't. Using its own terminology allied to templates, the user is required to fill in a set of questionnaires, which act as the input from which their story is distilled. This can be amended at will if the user feels that they are being too boxed in. The end result is more easily managed than stacks of cards and papers. It can also be easily shared with other Dramatica users by distributing files across the internet to each other (given that version sync isn't an issue). It's like having a collaborator in front of you all the time - if needed - with regard to the structure, but won't be of any help with poor prose, prose-style, bad dialogue, lack of motivation or any other essential aspects that the writer would need to know about. A badly written story, which is bang-on structurally, as far as Dramatica is concerned, is not  a useful end product. In other words, the user would need to be a decent writer in the first place, using Dramatica as a tool to refine and focus their work, and not regard it an easy way out. It's not. So bearing that in mind, Dramatica shouldn't disappoint so long as  the user is prepared for the discipline of story writing, in its strictest sense.	1
This is a great extension to the Windows 98 line of operating systems. Unfortunately it is also the last in that line. The flexibility of having a modern operating system with Dos compatibility was a great idea so long as it was handled correctly.	1
I have this OS on an old laptop and it is truly madning. Crashes like there's no tommorw.  Security holes the size of the ozone.  Windows 95/98 were good but this is when the wheels came off, this was like a pre Vista it was that bad, thus far I would say ME and Vista are still the worst version of windows I have ever used, yes even worse than Windows 8 in terms of bugs/crashes.	-1
Windows Me is basically Windows 98 with a fancy new name to allude to the year it was released (2000)...it was just some PR stunt. As with Windows 98, Windows Me is crash prone...so expect to see one BSoD (Blue Screen of Death) after another. I tried Windows Me back when it was released...I went right back to Windows 98...and since then I have migrated to Linux.  Really, there is no reason to use Windows 98 or Windows Me on ANY computer. If you have to have an OS but don't want Windows XP or the upcoming Windows Vista, then your best best for your Wintel PC is to switch to an easy-to-use Linux distro such as Xandros, Ubuntu/Kubuntu, Linspire, or Freespire.	-1
I program computers, and we had number of compatibility problems with this OS.  MS dropped much of good old DDE, causing number of shell application to crash, including number of uninstall programs.	-1
.......it was invented.  Windows ME came with my new machine a P1500 with 128 Megs of RAM.  When the machine is turned on it loads at lightning speed. It's all downhill from there.  ME is unstable, crashes and locks up regularly.  It is slower than my old pentium pro 200 with 96 megs of RAM running Win98 (which I have been forced to pull out of the closet to setup once again) If you are interested in connecting a web site to a database, or even just learning how to do it, (with a program such as Macromedia UltraDev) ME does not support Personal Web Server, so you will have to go back to 95, 98, or get Win 2000 to explore this arena. 95, 98, or 2000 may be better choices than waiting for XP to come out.  If you change the configuration of your computer "too much", XP will lock up your computer and you will have to call Microsoft to get an code to unlock it.  What will they think of next?	-1
Finally! A really fun, exciting, game for girls -- that DOESN'T come in a pink box, for heaven's sake.  As a video game fan growing up in the 80s, I noticed that there were very few "girl-oriented" games out there.  There were plenty for boys; and a few for both sexes, like "Tetris" and "Wheel of Fortune", and, of course, the ever-popular "Mario Bros." series.  But even the Mario games favored boys.  There were always more male characters to choose from than females (there'd be, maybe one girl, the Princess, who sported a pink dress.) And the games JUST for girls would be, like, Atari's "Strawberry Shortcake" game, where you'd get to switch around everybody's outfits.  Now, in the year 2001, there's plenty of girl software out there, but I'm not interested in PC Diaries, where girls can record their innermost secrets and keep them locked up with a voice-activated password.  I've outgrown being interested in designing clothes for Barbie.  (They need a game where you can design a Barbie house!  Now that would be cool.)  Not that there's anything wrong with those games; it's just that they're very tame, and some girls, like myself, want adventure.  Believe it or not, the box for this Nancy Drew game sports the phrase "For adventurous girls, ages 10 and up."  That's me! (A bit over 10, but who's counting?)  But enough with the introductions -- let me describe the game.  It's an adventure game; "Choose Your Own Adventure"-esque.  Nancy is staying in a mansion that's someday going to be a Bed & Breakfast.  There's a problem though -- a bunch of accidents have been happening.  Your job, as Nancy, is to find clues, solve puzzles, talk to people, and solve the mystery of who's responsible for the accidents.  But you soon discover that you have a SECOND mystery to deal with.  This game requires logic, patience, and a curious mind.  What amazed me was how long the game took to complete; there's really a lot to do.  But after about 14-16 hours of game play, I have finished the game, and I'm sad.  So -- I think I'll order the other two Nancy Drew games that are on amazon! ;)  Please, DreamCatcher games and Her Interactive -- keep these coming!  I want more Nancy Drew games.  I've always loved the books; and fans of the books might even laugh at how closely the game resembles the books in some instances.  Just like the Nancy Drew books changed the world of adventure books for girls; this game is a true icon of the progress in Girls' Games that's come along in the last decade.  Nancy is smart, intuitive, and strong -- and best of all, she doesn't wear a pink dress!	1
This is an old Nancy Drew game. But I've learned not to pre-judge the older games; it's the plot and puzzles that drive these games, not the graphics. That said, this game was not mind-blowing. If you want to go for a classic Nancy Drew title, I would suggest the game that came after this, Treasure in the Royal Tower (#4). I'm going to split my review up into different sections so I can give the game a more accurate rating.  PLOT - 4/5: Nancy is off to San Francisco to help a friend of Hannah's renovate a Victorian mansion. This friend, Rose Green, spent her life savings on the historic home and plans to turn it into a Bed & Breakfast. But strange accidents have been setting back the renovations and if things keep going badly Rose will have to sell the house and lose her investment.  I thought this was an alright plot,  it was very short though. On the back of the CD case it said "20+ hours of gameplay", but I finished mine in about 4 hours. Other than that, there were lots of snooping opportunities - in fact, Nancy gets to snoop through all four of the suspects' things. The plot flowed nicely and there was enough progression in the story that I never felt stuck in the same place for too long. But it wasn't as educational as other games have been. I love San Francisco and it would have been great if they had included more information about its Victorian houses, its role in the Gold Rush, how it recovered from the earthquake of 1906, or how its Chinese history influences its style and culture - really, any of those things would have been great because it gave you little tid-bits about each of them but not nearly enough information to be considered "educational". Which is a shame really because the plot and setting gave the game the perfect set up; it could have seamlessly put in so much information without having the player feel like "Oh great, here comes another history lesson."  CHARACTERS - 3.5/5: The suspect list in this game is pretty straightforward. There are two male suspects and two female suspects (a formula which I believe is pretty common to the earlier ND titles). The suspects include Rose Green, the owner of the mansion, a quiet woman who didn't have too much to say throughout the game. Abby Sideris, a friend of Rose's and is also co-owner of the mansion, who believes the mansion is haunted. Charlie Murphy, a college student and inexperienced handyman helping with renovating the mansion (Charlie was voiced by Scott Carty, who does Ned's voice in the later games). Louis Chandler is an antique dealer specializing in Victorian era furniture and decorations.  The graphics were... interesting - but I wasn't expecting a whole lot considering it's an older game. Louis was probably the strangest to talk to because it would seem that sometimes his eyes would be closed for an entire conversation, which may or may not have been a glitch in my game. The characters were not too memorable. Rose and Louis were particularly boring. I don't know if the voice acting on these characters was just bland or if their characters were meant to be more reserved.  Phone friends included Bess and George, a woman named Emily who is apparently a friend of Nancy's in San Francisco, and Hannah. In the books Hannah is the Drew's live-in house keeper who is practically a surrogate mother to Nancy, and the games also allude to the fact that Hannah is an important part of the Drew family. This was the first time I've been able to talk to Hannah in a Nancy Drew game. But Hannah's voice was really odd, like a young person that was obviously trying to sound like an old woman, so I didn't call her very much.  SETTING - 4.5/5: The mansion was very lovely and nicely decorated. It was pretty big too; Nancy can explore her room, the dining room, the basement saloon, the foyer, the parlor, and the library as well as a handful of secret rooms. I sort of wished you could go outside, or look out a window or something, but I guess the weather was supposed to be bad and that was the reason for staying indoors.  PUZZLES - 4.5/5: The puzzles were not too challenging in this game. I suppose that if you struggled with them then you might spend 20+ hours playing the game like the CD case promised. But I have played enough Nancy Drew games to recognize a clue when I see one and got through the puzzles pretty easily. My only complaint would be that at times the instructions were kind of vague, for instance at one point a character asked Nancy to take a look at a puzzle "in the corner". I spent over a half an hour looking for that corner before eventually looking it up online and discovering that the puzzle was directly behind the character.  IS IT CHALLENGING? No. I'm starting to wonder if maybe I'm getting better at these games or if I just happen to be playing the easiest titles in the series. Either way, I didn't have to use a walkthrough. I did call Bess and George a lot, though. And they were very explicit with their hints. It wasn't like "Maybe you should take a look at the library again!" it was more "Go into the library, turn left, and read the red book on the middle shelf." Which was sort of a bummer; I just wanted a push in the right direction, I didn't want to know exactly how to solve the next puzzle and what would happen when I did. I would give the game a 2.5/5 for challenge.  ENDING - 3.5/5: The ending was okay. The culprit was not surprising to me. Catching them took me a few tries even though I knew exactly what to do. But it was still a solid ending and the wrap up in the epilogue at the end was nice.  FINAL SCORE: Plot: 4 Characters: 3.5 Setting: 4.5 Puzzles: 4.5 Challenge: 2.5 Ending: 3.5 = 22.5 divided by 6 = 3.75 rounded to 4 stars	1
I think this game is when the company really got into it's groove. The first two were fun, don't get me wrong, but it's with this one that we really start to get into the intrigue that I love about these games so much. This also sets up for the ever-present light spook factor that is present from here until Blackmoor.  I played this game as a child, put it away for a few years, then pulled it out and played it again recently. I could still recite the games poem perfectly. "Listen my child to this story of dreams..." I loved that. I think I annoyed my mother with how many times I repeated back when I first received the game in 2001/2002.  For people looking to get into the series, I might recommend this to you, but make sure you get another game (preferably from the first eleven, if you want a true example of what this company can do) to accompany it. It does have it's issues, since it is so old and only the third game they made, but it's also an extremely satisfying game.	1
Message in a Haunted Mansion is the third Nancy Drew game, and far superior compared to the first two. This game sets the standard to what the majority of Nancy Drew games contain, and is the first to use the formal "Nancy Drew case formula". It is this game that employs several aspects that become rules for future cases, such as "there must always be four suspects" and "there must always be a long-lost treasure".  Rose Green, a friend of Hannah Gruen's (Nancy's housekeeper), has recently purchased a Victorian mansion in San Francisco, California. She and her friend and co-owner, Abby Sideris, hope to turn the place into a bed-and-breakfast by the following month. However, several peculiar accidents have been getting in the way of the renovations. Hannah asks that Nancy go over to help complete the renovation, while secretly performing an investigation to find out just what's causing the accidents. Nancy soon finds herself in an old mansion that's filled with a dark past, unexplainable shadows, ghostly voices, and unexpected accidents that could happen at any moment. Is an inhabitant of this manor trying to scare everybody away, or are the restless spirits of the previous owners truly back to haunt the place?  The plot used in this game is phenomenal, and a great idea for Nancy's first "haunted house" mystery. Even though the criminal in this game isn't a killer, it still holds on to the scare factor that the first two held, and the danger does become life-threatening at times. The game itself does get pretty scary, and all of the references to the history of California and China that were employed in the plot were very well-integrated.  I will come out and say this about the plot: the ending does become very predictable if one pays attention closely. The location of the ending, the history of the Valdez family (the family who originally owned the manor), the culprit, and his/her intentions all become rather obvious. This is a slight downside, but regardless, all of these aspects of the plot were perfectly executed.  Even though this is only the third game, the quality of this game rivals (and usually even goes beyond) most of the modern games. There are still chores that need to be done and puzzles to solve, but Nancy doesn't spend more time doing chores than investigating or performing puzzle after puzzle after puzzle like she does in several of the more recent games. This game has the perfect blend of sleuthing, puzzle-solving, and chores.  The graphics in this game might show the age on occasion, but they're still rather nice, and almost as good as graphics in a modern game would be. The manor is beautifully detailed, and all of the ghostly haunts that are seen with the eye are wonderfully animated. The character designs are a little more smooth and realistic than the ones in the previous game, now looking like a cross between Barbie dolls and actual human anatomy.  The characters were casted wonderfully, and they were all well-integrated into the story. Rose Green, the owner, is the frustrated woman who spent her entire life savings into the house. She's very determined to stick with the place, but is starting to get discouraged. Abby Sideris is her eccentric business partner, who believes in ghosts and all sorts of supernatural phenomenon. At one point in the game, she even hosts a sance to contact the spirit haunting the house. Charlie Murphy is a young man who's currently employed to help with the renovations. He seems young and inexperienced, but is actually very knowledgeable and is studying history at the local community college. Louis Chandler is an antique dealer about Rose's age, and he's helping the others find some good authentic dcor to keep the traditional Victorian feel while renovating the manor into a B&B.  One wonderful aspect about the cast in Message in a Haunted Mansion that definitely deserves mention is the perfect choice for the culprit. It's not quite like the previous game, Stay Tuned for Danger, in which Mattie, Rick, Dwayne, Lillian, Bill, and Millie all have solid motives to send the threats to Rick and could very well be the culprit at the end. There's only one character in this game that would seem to profit well from performing these acts of vandalism around the house, and I cannot see any of the other suspects being the culprit in the end.  The music in the game was perfect. It made an already very frightening house seem even more haunted. There wasn't a single track that felt out of place, and they ranged from slightly eerie to downright terrifying. The Chinese music heard in Nancy's bedroom complimented the dcor as well, as her room is full of old Chinese furnishings.  Message in a Haunted Mansion has brought the Nancy Drew games from sub-par, old school fun to true accomplishments in the history of adventure gaming. From this point forward, the Nancy Drew games have a tendency to be amazing. Despite the age, this beautiful game full of ghostly frights remains in my top ten favorite Nancy Drew games of all time.	1
After success with the first two games in the Nancy Drew adventure game series, the creators tried to step up the suspense with a scarier mystery.  In "Message in a Haunted Mansion" they definitely did that while still making it a fun adventure game that wasn't horrifying.  Story-You are going to help a family friend find out why there are so many accidents happening at the house that she's renovating.  Some people claim that a ghost is at work, while others think that something human is the cause.  It's up to you to find out who or what is sabotaging the renovation work.  Graphics-Like the previous games, the graphics are 3D, and once again, they are pretty good.  Some of the characters have some awkward movements, but the backgrounds are very well done.  Sound-The music is spooky and definitely creates a good atmosphere.  There are also some creepy background sounds that happen from time-to-time to startle the player a bit.  As for the voice acting, the characters could have been voiced much better.  They often sound bored or confused as to what they are reading, but they are still good enough to not distract from the gameplay.  Gameplay-Just like the previous games in the series, this is a first person point-and-click adventure game.  It only takes place in one location (a mansion), but you are still able to explore many rooms as you search for clues as to who or what is causing the accidents.  There are four suspects to talk to in this game, and there are also several people that you can call on the phone to ask for help in your investigation.  There are a few puzzles in the game that are more like chores than puzzles, but they are a good variety of inventory puzzles and logic puzzles.  There are a few scary moments in the game where you see a shadow move or something in order to startle you, but they would happen over and over again at the same place that by the end of the game, you are just bored by them.  It does add a certain scare factor to the game the first time you see them, though.  There are also some bonus backstories for two of the characters that you don't necessarily have to discover to finish the game, but it was fun to figure out, and it adds a bit to the plot.  Length-It's a fairly long game.  It will definitely take several hours to finish.  Overall, it can be a slightly creepy game if you let it get to you.  But whether you get spooked or not, it truly is a fascinating mystery adventure game that is worth a playthrough.  SPECIAL NOTE-There is also a version of this game available for the Game Boy Advance.	1
"Message" is the first Nancy Drew Pc game that I have tried and I was very favorably impressed. The game is literate: it is not directed towards very young players per se and young people will have to read well to appreciate the many tidbits of literature scattered around the Victorian mansion. I am 76 and could read them quite well. :)  The sets are beautifully rendered in elegant color and the Chinese antiques are a feast for the eye. The characters are well animated with gestures that are completely natural. The voices are good, too.  "Message" is Nirvana for the Point and Click enthusiasts. No expert mouse maneuvers are required such as jumping into a fast moving bucket in "Uru." Nothing is timed. We take our PC games very seriously and it is an affront to the ego when one isn't fast enough to perform an intricate mouse gyration. In fact, I could get stage fright just looking at a high ledge I knew I had to vault upon and therefore couldn't perforn at all.  "Message" is scary. This is by no means a plain dish of vanilla. There are creaks and groans and shadowy forms passing in the night. Atmosphere plus. And you can wander around just as you wish poking into this and that and getting a delicious scary thrill when a curtain suddenly billows into your face with hissing sound.  Captions are provided which are very helpful as the characters speak rapidly. All in all "Message in a Haunted Mansion" is a very solid piece of work for all ages.	1
Yet another great Nancy Drew game!  In "Message in a Haunted Mansion", Nancy is hired to help renovate an old victorian house, as the owners are hoping to turn it into a bed & breakfast.  Upon her arrival, Nancy finds out that a lot of strange things & accidents have been occuring at the home - ever since they began the renovations...  Is a ghost behind it all - as one of the owners believes, or is one of the hired help or even one of the owners to blame for all that's going on?  And if it's one of "the living", what reason do they have to cause all of this havoc?  Your job as Nancy Drew, teen detective will be to answer these questions, and get to the bottom of it.  Overall, I would highly recommend this game for anyone who enjoyed (or is enjoying) the Nancy Drew series.  I am 36 years old, and still love playing these games - a testament to the fact that they are appropriate for pre-teen, teen & adults alike!	1
Message in a Haunted Mansion is the 3rd Nancy Drew game of the series! I beat it also, and I love it because it is kinda scary. You hear noises, and see ghosts sometimes too! Some parts you'll have to use "Second Chance" which is a great thing to use when you did something wrong, and you need to redo it, so you can do it right. I love this game a lot, thumbs up to DreamCatcher!	1
The other reviewers have talked about the quality gameplay. I'll talk about how to play it as an adult with a 6-year old:    * Write down the clues yourself, showing her what you are doing and why.    * Let her explore the mansion. That's the most fun part.    * Read the books and letters out loud. Ask how they might connect to the plot.    * Enjoy many hours with your daughter.  Five stars, easy.	1
This was the first Nancy Drew game I played. I played it with my older sister and it took us 7 days to complete it. It freaked me out several times but not enough to give me nightmares or anything (besides I wasn't THAT young at the time). It's extremely fun and it exercises a child's mind well. It also teaches them some educational things. The graphics are great, much better than the first one (Secrets Can Kill). Buy this game!	1
"Message in a Haunted Mansion" was my second Nancy Drew game (my first was "The Final Scene.") The graphics are beautiful, with numerous little details that really made the Victorian mansion come alive. Nancy is staying with a friend and helping her fix up a Victorian mansion that she is going to turn into a B&B, except strange accidents keep happening that delay the grand opening. Is the house really haunted? The only problem I encountered was that I must have played out of order, because I kept finding clues and I had no idea what they were related to. The story seemed disjointed and not as in-depth as with "Treasure in the Royal Tower." But I really enjoyed the bandit/Chinese subplot, the sance, and the many puzzles. The sound effects were genuinely creepy: one minute you will be walking down the hallway and the sound of a woman crying comes from nowhere. Or you're walking up a deserted staircase and you hear ghostly whispers. There are two levels, junior and senior detective. The puzzles are slightly harder for senior detectives, but the plot is the same. If you get stuck you can call your friends Bess and George for hints. I needed to look online for hints quite a bit since, as I said earlier, I must have missed clues since large parts of the story were missing for me. One of the things that bugged me was the fact that there really weren't many places to explore. You can't leave the house, and you only have access to your room and one other room, the attic, the dining room, parlor, and basement. I was hoping for more rooms/secret passageways to explore. Not having more locations really cut down on the game's length/replayability. Overall, "Message in a Haunted Mansion" is a fun outing for detectives: a chance to explore a spooky haunted house, gather clues, learn about Chinese art and writing, and dig up clues about a timeless love story and hidden treasure.	1
I am very satisfied with the purchase of this wireless router. The setup took just a few minutes to complete the setup wizard and after that everything worked from the first time, perfectly. I have now wireless connectivity throughout the whole house. The connection is stable and the speed is as advertised. I considered Linksys and Netgear routers, but there always was some kind of problem with them. I have not found any complaints with this 3Com router. Also my personal experience with 3Com products was another factor for my decision to by this product. Bottom line - if you are looking for reliable, easy to use router this product is for you.	1
Need to network computers on different floors?  This product can be used as a bridge or as an interface for an individual machine.  All I had to do was take the units out of the box, plug them in to the power line and the Ethernet switch (using the supplied patch cable), and it all worked right away.  Just a word of warning, though;  you can't plug these into a surge protector (including any surge protector inside a power strip.)	1
You can't go wrong with this device.  It's the only hub I have that operates solely on power supplied by the PC.  Plug it in and go.  It's that easy to use.	1
I thought this to be very inexpensive for all that we got.  Great for the you boys for their computer center in our home school.	1
very good computer the intel Dual Core i3-2120 3.3GHz CPU, 4GB DDR3 RAM, 500GB HDD configuration is good enough for light use. The price is amazing	1
fantastic deal. very fast. great screen. solid laptop. really good.	1
Convertible Size HArd drive space Like everything	1
awesome fast	1
It covers screen barely on sides. Falls bit short on top n bottom too. It may look like large size guy wearing medium size pants. Display is amazingly sharp, stunning and beautiful. It catches No fingerprints. It doesn't create a glare either. Works perfectly in outdoor too. Giving 5 stars only due to size issue. I wish it would be bit larger on all edges. I haven't dropped my phone since applying this screen protector so can't speak for that part. Will see how it goes.	1
thanks	1
I have been using this for over a month. It is very fast and starts up quickly, and screen is especially pleasing to the eye.	1
Delivered on time and product was exactly as described. Would buy from this vendor again. Thank You	1
Estupendo	1
Took a whole to get here but it works well and seems to be well constructed. Connected mine to a M2 bullet	1
great value wap	1
My Grandson is very happy with this laptop!	1
Great find.  Seller stellar.  Need more.	1
great	1
Unit came used, but in fine condition. Seems to be working well. I have not tried any advanced functionality as I just got a null-modem cable to get into that part.	1
Excellent	1
Great price from a company that also provides massive amounts of help for all your communication needs.	1
I have had this for years, it works great, no power sag.	1
This AP rocks!!! I miss you 3Com!!!!	1
Love this! Good deal too!	1
shelved the item when  i found significant rf noise	1
It has worked for us reliably, and we don' have any complaint with its functioning. Besides, this switch offers a lightweight and reduced dimensions that allows to easily locate it in any place.	1
very good after about four years	1
Bought for son's Mac works great on my HP laptop	1
nice & simple works!	1
omg this router is amazing	1
Works as expected	1
OK here is the deal...  I got this 2 in 1 i5core/ 6GB/ 1TB hard drive machine on Christmas eve 2015 and it was unbelievably slow. I had to wait about 15 seconds to see a row of my pictures, downloads took extremely long, YouTube videos buffered at lease 10 times in one minute, updates kept popping up every time I turned this machine on. I began looking into replacing my NEW hard drive with a newer SSD hard drive and I was getting extremely stressed and pissed off. I mean, my girlfriends 5 yrs old $300 HP laptop was faster, so I called Asus tech support 1-888-678-3688. They talked me through a hard reboot and, "OMG!" This is the fastest computer ever! I don't know if it needed a factory update or what, but it is really fast. I can go on Netflix, YouTube, listen to music, watch picture, and surface yahoo news, with no buffering or delays.	1
NICE PRICE AND JUST LIKE THE ONE MY PHONE COMPANY WANTED $100.00 FOR AND IT WORKS FINE	1
Work perfectly with my hackintosh	1
Works nicely on a 10+ year old laptop.	1
Excellent	1

Worked great!	1
I give it a 5 star because it did increase range. Not significantly, but just enough to reach the distance I needed.  Worth the ROI.  IMO. Soon I will replace the router and hopefully reuse these.	1
Super for home or business networks. In addition to this eight port, I also have the 16 port that i run my office with. The design and mounting of these switches is great looking and functional. First switch to ever look cool. Power supply is built in so there is no power brick / wall wart. Simple to mount. Simple to setup. And simple to manage with software (windows only)'or direct IP address of switch through any browser. You will be impressed.	1
EXCELLENT	1
The Netgear ProSAFE 8-port Gigabit Click Switch is a office-space networking game changer. The unique office-friendly design with integrated mounting and cable management are stand-out differentiators. This "smart-switch" has management capability appropriate for a office environment switch with power-saving electronics.  Design: One of the first things that stands out on the ProSAFE Click switches is the form factor. The sleek dimensions clearly have the modular office environment in mind and can mount at many places in modular non-modular office environments.  The click mounting system makes mounting a snap - literally. The locking tab make secure mounting of the Click Switch to the base in any of 2 orientations.  The 8 port version has a sturdy plastic case in a silent fanless design. The 16 port model is also fanless, but has a durable metal case.  The 8 port model provides 2 convenient USB charging ports suitable for tablets and other high-charge USB applications.  The power budget is 15W for both and any one port limited to 10W. This makes it handy in offices and conference rooms making it convenient for tablets or phones to get a charge boost. I like this in my home office because it eliminates 2 power bricks from my power strip.  The interesting power connection can be plugged in to have the cable exit either in the same direction and the network cables or at 90 degrees to that out the long dimension. There is no "power brick" to clog up power strips - the power adapter is internal to the switch. Something I find a very desirable feature.  The included Velcro cables tie completes the picture of switch design by someone who was thinking about usability in the real world as much as moving bits and bytes.  Configuration: I downloaded and installed the ProSafe Plus Configuration Utility from the Netgear support site. The configuration utility found the switch automagically making it super easy perform initial setup on the Click Switch. The intuitive process was easy and there are only a couple of things to setup unless you need advanced features.  ' Set the IP address - I recommend setting either a static IP address or a DHCP reserved address (what I did in my firewall) so the switch will always be at the same IP address. ' Change the password - The default password is "password", so change it to something better!  The Click Switch also has a web based management interface that is very usable if you prefer that instead of the configuration utility. I do.  The advanced (and just nice) configurable features include: ' The port LEDs can be turned off so they are not distracting (Just nice and good for bedrooms too!) ' IEEE 802.1Q-or port-based VLANs are supported for segregated traffic (i.e. voip/data) ' Extensive QoS by WRR, strict priority, or both, Port-based QoS, IEEE 801.2p QoS, ToS QoS and DSCP based QoS. These are to help make sure time sensitive traffic gets priority (i.e. voip or video). ' Port by port Rate limiting ' Port by port link speed and flow control settings (including a "disable" setting to turn a port off if desired) ' Port by port Broadcast Filtering ' Port by port cable testing (good for a quick cable integrity check) ' Multicast control via IGMP snooping ' Port mirroring which connects two ports like a old school hub (good for troubleshooting or some monitoring)  Note: the 8 port model has no LAG (Link Aggregation Groups aka Trunking). The 16 port model has up to 2 LAG group which can be nice for devices with 2 LAN ports that support static LAG. NAS devices come to mind.  Most users will not need to mess with most of the advanced features.  Green Power Use: The 8 port Click Switch uses a max of 20.1W of power including 15W of USB charging occurring at the same time. This means without someone charging their device power maxes out about 5W. With smart port power management most of the time power consumption should be less. Perhaps much less. This is less power than used to be common for unmanaged or "dumb" switches. The savings can add up if you have a bunch of these in your business.  Support: I did not need to contact support with the 8 port Click switch, but while testing my 16 port model I did and got excellent support. Be sure to register your Click switch within 30 days of purchase and you'll get  a lifetime warranty for a little extra peace of mind.  Conclusions: The Netgear ProSAFE 8-Port Gigabit Click Switch has game-changing office oriented design and usability in a silent package. It is a capable smart switch which has good management and important features. The advanced features can make it possible to reliably integrate time sensitive traffic in the same switch as NAS file sharing, isolate traffic via VLAN support and more.  The switch is wire-speed which means it can move traffic as fast as it can be pushed over the individual LAN cables. In my testing this is the case as with pretty much any modern smart and many "dumb" switches. Getting data through a switch has become pretty much a given these days.  I had moved away from Netgear switches in recent years. Other manufacturers had more attractive solutions for my clients' needs. Not so with the Click Switch. Because Netgear has built a compelling product for office (and many other) environments with a fairly rich feature set and easily managed I'm giving it 5 stars.  I'll be placing these into my client environments as new switches are needed. Well done Netgear.  Hope this helps someone!	1
Item came quickly, exactly as described, and a great price. Way cheaper from this seller than other places online. Easy to add modules makes this switch extremely flexible and future-proof	1
Perfect for my needs. I used this cable to extend from an amp to the antenna.	1
Great!	1
This unit is much faster and more powerful that Trendnets other access points, but it comes at about double the price. I had tested two of the TEW-653AP that were needed to cover the desired area of use with no dead spots. Ended up replacing both of those with one of these access points. Very pleased with the results. I had originally considered the Trendnet TEW-653AP but the lack of features for modern high speed needs left that one out of the running. Speed of 300mbps vs 600 mbps. I needed the extended power rating along with gigabit ethernet WAN ports that this unit has. Also wanted the 5gb ability that the TEW 653 did not offer.  Here is the power output for those who want the details. Transmit. 802.11a: FCC/CE: 17 dBm/-75 dBm (typical) @ 54 Mbps 802.11b: FCC/CE: 20 dBm/-90 dBm (typical) @ 11 Mbps 802.11g: FCC/CE: 17 dBm/-76 dBm (typical) @ 54 Mbps 802.11n: FCC/CE: 17 dBm/-69 dBm (typical) @ 300 Mbps 2.4GHz &5 GHz 802.11n: FCC/CE: 18 dBm/-70 dBm (typical) @ 300 Mbps 5 GHz  The Wifi Standards are: IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n, IEEE 802.3/3u/3ab, IEEE 802.3af/az	1

21 Mbpbs  with T-Mobile 3G,  need to tape pin 20,  and flash Thinkpad with non-whitelist bios.  I also want to test it under MAC OSX, it has driver and software for MAC OSX from vender's web site  Works perfectly under both Windows 2012 Server and Apple Mavericks 10.9.2	1
Not too many users will have a need for a Power Over Ethernet Injector, but if you do... The price to usefulness/quality ratio of this Poe is definitely worth it. I had it in use for a SOLID THREE YEARS without even a hiccup. I had a headset w/mic that I used for work, on a daily basis, and this item was a charm and one of the best small investments I made; Once connected I never gave it a second thought. The only reason it's not in use any longer is I no longer have the device I used it with. However, I know when I get another device that can utilize Poe, this little baby will come off the shelf. I know this review is not timely at all, but I totally forgot about it until I saw it in my items to be reviewed list. SMC has been around a long time, and if this particular model is no longer available, you can feel safe with any product manufactured by SMC Two Thumbs Up!...	1
This card is great for ESXi. If a person wanted to they can pass each individual port through to a different VM as this card uses a PLX PCI Express bridge to give dedicated PCIe lanes to each controller. There are two USB3 1042a controllers (Which may need to be downgraded to a lower level firmware as ESXi represents the PCI Device IDs incorrectly), and two Marvell storage controllers which I haven't messed with much.	1
perfect, product worked as stated, basically no set up, just open box and go.  Looks well constructed. Would recommend product to others.	1
Professional design for tablet, android, IOS Inner 2000mAh Li-on battery, emergency power charge for your phone Built-in 2000mAh Li-ion, lasting power supply. Complete charging for iphone And charging four hours for 3G hot spot.	1
Thank you for a product well suited for small business requirement at a price that is beyond belief. This switch has been in opperation for more than 4 years and replaced previous model that was more than twice the price and lasted 2 years.	1
This switch is perfect for desk use with its Classy Transparent design.  It is a simple setup and I have never had a problem with the functionality of this switch.	1
My old one failed to work after continuously working for 4 years.  Unfortunately the company behind this product can no longer be found.  Luckily I found this one as a replacement.	1
Small, completely portable, inexpensive, and, best of all, WORKS GREAT and BETTER than expected!  I'm using this in my RV to take advantage of the public WiFi.  So glad I bought this & now I can watch streaming videos and music on YouTube, CNN.com, & other websites whereas before I could not get a strong enough signal.	1
Bought this hotspot for a hotel guest wireless system and it did the job right. Antenna was a little weak but the features were great.	1
We've all read the technology blurbs - "Fax is Dead". This is not true. Many business offices -like real estate- still use fax. So what if one doesn't want a big machine sitting on the desk? This USB external device is a gem. Operation is simple and flawless	1
I am particularly pleased that this device comes with 2 sizes of bracket.  It was easy to exchange the high-profile bracket for the low-profile one I need.  The device is easy to install and performs well.	1
Good product.  Five stars means I had no issues with shipping or the product. It met my expectations and was as listed.	1
This isn't just a 5-port metal sheathed battleship of switching goodness, it's also a networking IT guys secret weapon. This Gigabit switch (and it's larger ProSafe Plus kin) has port mirroring and other advanced functions for comprehensive service quality, diagnosing, and monitoring of network traffic on-the-cheap. It's impossible to find this stuff in the average, everyday un-managed switches at the lower end of the price pool where this one also swims.  To get similar functionality, high-end switches are available in the multi-hundred to thousands of dollars apiece range, and single purpose 'Network Tap' devices are close to the same. This little guy offers most of the same capabilities at an incredible $50/60-ish price tag.  Does it work for everyday home and small office users who need to expand but don't need the extras? Absolutely, and it does it very well. It even comes in 8, 16, or 24 port models if needed. This is my second one of these, with the first still happily humming away since day 1, in 2009.	1
This product was researched by a co worker for an application we needed. I was looking for a place to purchase. This price was $20.00 less than any place I could find. The product worked as advertised.	1
works and our AV guys love it people show up with laptops and need to connect plus you can have a secondary monitor as an output (we use it for PowerPoint)	1
It was amazingly easy to set up for a person like me who knows nearly nothing about computer networks. I was expecting a painful experience and a need to call customer support, but after responding to some simple questions from the "Setup assistant" on my Mac, I was suddenly told that it was all done! It works flawlessly ever since, never needing any attention. Just exactly what technology should be like. Thank you Apple!	1
Installed in 4 different computer workstations, all worked without issues.  Highly recommend for all windows O/S systems, and the price is hard to beat.	1
This brand is one of the best on the market I got this hooked up and running astonishing speed throughout my house in all rooms. Nothing beats this	1
I used this on one of my older laptops to sync my Bluetooth mouse and it works perfectly, the only thing I complain about is that it doesnt work with A2DP...	1
There are a ton of digital media streaming devices out right now and a lot of them claim they work for digital signage.  They don't.  This one does.  You plug it into an HDMI on any TV or monitor, log it into your Wi-Fi and then create an account on their wensite and you can immediately create any presentation you want.  I have 3 coffee shops and this lets me create new content and post it toall of them at once with no software fee.	1
I have spent hundreds of dollars and dozens of hours messing around with digital media players trying to create a Digital Sign.  Until I found the DSS media player it seemed like the only options were over $500, bulky and overkill, or $59 junk that just didn't do what I needed it to do and broke down heavy use.  This media player just works. I can create and upload new images and RRS feeds to play in my store even when I am at home and it uploads instantly.  The little thing runs 12 hours a day and has no problems.	1
I bought this gadget to be able to detect and avoid wifi, as wifi gives me headaches, nausea and heart disturbances. I carry this in my purse and it is an easy way to figure out what the strength of the wifi signals are. [...] If this item is not available there are others like it on Amazon, do a search on WiFi detectors, or a RF field meter can be obtained, such as an Electrosmog Meter.	1
This is an old model, but I have two of them which were both purchased used.  The first has been in service for several years now without a single complaint.  I've found them to be much more stable than the consumer-grade products available at most retail outlets.	1
no problems. easy way to update my sony bravia that is 60 feet from my modem/router. i can even watch netflix with no issues.	1
Loved this thing, i went thru so many external 56k modems on my laptop with dial-up internet kept pulling the wires out of it. This thing solved everything. Highly recommended if you live in an area where your stuck to dial-up. And it might not be that bad if you have an office with multiple fax machines instead of buying a modem for each.	1
The install was easy, it comes with a disc and it's fairly good price for the item,  These serial ports were standard on PCs in days gone by.  Nobody really carries this item any more.  I was glad to find it here.	1
I have used this to put all my papers, business cards,power cords and my Microsoft Surface.  It is perfect for visiting clients.	1
I needed a Wireless N PCMCIA adapter for my older laptop.  There are not many low price adapters on the market, so I went ahead and ordered this one.  It works great!  Easy to install.  Excellent reception. This product was delivered on time and was brand new when I received it.	1
I've had no issues with this hub.  It does exactly what I needed it for, at a good price.  I would highly recommend this to anyone needing to expand their USB port capacity.	1
As expected. I've used lots of switches over the years and this one is every bit as good as the inexpensive ones from Micro-center.	1
This product is excelent, i receeived in justig time, all OK.  In this case all is excelent.  For what more words, you haave more time ???	1
I get free wifi from the library across the street and download bit torrents all day with this thing....great deal!	1
I stress-tested this product by purchasing 1,000 ft of CAT5e stranded UTP cable and connecting both ends using RJ-11 connectors and just one pair of copper conductor.  Although the manufacturer recommends solid copper telephone wires, I thought I'd give it a shot anyways.  The results were impressive.  I got 50 Mbps on the other side and a SpeedTest.net test confirms the same internet speed I get when using my local Giganet LAN (i.e. around 30 Mbps).  Highly recommended product, principally if you need to take a ride on an unused pair of telephone wires to extend a LAN. Bravo B&B.	1
pluged into my second pc ( other office ) presto internet. easy simple i love easy and simple. would recomend it to a freind	1
Geart deal, quick shipping and it works great. All you do is plug it into your PC and follow the instructions. Well worth the price and the  shippng was fast	1
I CAN FINALLY GET RID OF MY USB / STRAINER COMBO OUT OF MY WINDOW...THE SIGNALS I GOT BEFORE WERE 1/2 BARS ..NOW THOSE ARE 4/5 AND I HAVE NUMEROUS SIGNALS I NEVER RECEIVED BEFORE...HAVENT TRIED ANY DOWNLOADS YET BUT SO FAR THIS SET UP ROCKS...THANK YOU	1
I was surprised that this product worked. The product is compatible with Dell's Optiplex 320. I have been using the product 24/7 and the product continues to work well.	1
Arrived quickly, was exactly as described, and seems very reliable.  The driver uploaded very quickly.  It works as described, and is very competitive price-wise.	1
This product is an excellent - low cost for great product.  We have used it many times on numerous jobs & recommend it highly.	1
Using a MX846 to upgrade my Dell Vostro gave it new life.  Download and install the driver from Dell before you install the chip.  Super easy if you are not queasy about removing your keyboard.	1
Better than average, quite well as a matter of fact.  Still running after 2 years.  Good range also.  XP users be advised to have at least Service Pack 2 (or 3 is recomended) installed to identify stations properly that use more than WEP encryption.	1
Overview  This is a great array for someone looking to expand their home storage network or possibly someone with a SOHO setup that needs plenty of storage. I used this array to combine many different drives I had laying around from past system builds as well as to give me a central place to go for over 15TB of storage.  Unpacking  The array arrived well packed with two layers of boxes and internal Styrofoam.  Installation  You will definitely want to buy the optional rackmount mounting rails. The railkit costs approximately $32 more but was worth not having to sit the array on top of another rackmount device. There is no way the front brackets will hold the weight of the array empty let alone full of hard drives.  Hardware  All hardware was included. eSATA cables, SATA cables, power cables, drive trays, and drive tray mounting screws were included. The chassis is reasonably high quality metal, and I believe the power supply is a standard ATX power supply which is always preferred over some custom form factor so that if the OE PS dies you can get another one from anywhere. The array has plenty of fans, so far I have 12 drives in the array and no cooling issues.  The array is surprisingly quiet even when fully populated with WD Caviar Greens. The fans are barely noticeable to include the power supply fan. The indicator lights on the front are sparse but do provide basic information such as which drive bays are filled, which drives are active, and which internal RAID controller is active. A nice to have would have been a LCD screen with temp and other environmental info but at this price point its not surprising that its lacking.  One HW feature that I found totally cool was that you can bring your own eSATA port multiplying RAID controller card if you wanted, disable the RAID controller in the array, and use all of your own features with your own RAID controller card.  Software  The CD that came with mine was useless, trying to read it locked up two different laptops so I ended up downloading the latest software right from their website. The GUI interface for their drives and software is terrible, incredibly cheesy, and felt like something developed in the 90's, but it did install without a hitch and instantly recognized the attached array. Configuration of the RAID went without a hitch.  I did all of my configurations from a server running Windows Server 8 BETA x64 so I can say its not only Windows Server 8 BETA compatible its also 64bit compatible driver software.  A nice feature is that the HD's SMART monitoring information is available via the array's driver software.  Features  The amount of storage options this unit provides is awesome. I was looking for a budget eSATA rackmount enclosure with at least 8 drive bays and this unit definitely performs above and beyond my expectations. It offers all the usual RAID levels but the best part is that internally it is comprised of 3 separate RAID controllers which are accessible via 3 separate eSATA ports on the back so if you wanted to you could connect 3 different servers to this array. Also, if you choose to connect a device to the array that does not have a port multiplier eSATA port, you can configure the internal controller of the array to do the port multiplication for you and present a single logical storage volume to the connected device.  During my burn-in testing of my 2TB WDC Green RAID array I saw sustained writes of approximately 86MB/s and reads of approximately 98MB/s for a RAID 5 array of 4 1TB WDC Greens.  The Bad  The only bad thing about this array is the incredibly cheap hard drive carriages. You have to be very careful when mounting, inserting, or removing hard drives from this array. The carriages are very fragile, thin, plastic and will easily crack or break if handled roughly.  Once the drives are properly inserted into the array you should be ok.  Conclusion  This is a great budget minded eSATA RAID enclosure for anyone seeking a ton of drive bays, HW RAID controllers, and storage flexibilty for less than $1000.00. It certainly is not enterprise class, but then again, neither is the price.	1

We have 2 of these as our backbone for our 70 machine office. They are a bit noisy, but their performance is perfect.  Main points: -Does not need to be a "managed" switch. -Easy plug and go. -Light enough to put into a U1 rack spot with just the from brackets. -Uses standard UNC power cable. -Fans make a little noise. Good enough to hide in a room, but not in an open space next to office workers.	1
I needed some simple switches not too long ago to place in low volume traffic areas.  A prime concern was price, and these fit the bill quite nicely.  Although there are only three connections to the switches that I placed, they are expected to handle some rather large transfers at times - they are connected to networked printers in the premises, as well as to a networked copy controller.  I have not seen any issues with them since their installation, and they look decent enough to not cause any raised eyebrows when they are in plain sight.  Time will obviously tell how well they last, but considering that a similarly placed "name brand" switch recently gave up the ghost after 8 months, these have more than paid for themselves by now.	1
This USB hub works just fine, and I love the design.  I have never liked the solidly-built hubs, because when you have several items coming in from different angles/directions, they tend to move the hub around or even damage it. That's never an issue with this design.  Inexpensive and it does what I want - recommended.	1
I used this item in an older laptop that had only wireless G.  It is a perfect upgrade due to the super small form factor.  It does tie up a USB port but you can hardly see the adapter once its on.	1
I have bought two or three of these for myself and friends. They work really good, and seem to have better reception than other bluetooth adapters that I have used. If you buy this I don't think you will be disappointed!	1
Simple set up, expandable, and flexible. For the price and performance this unit is a solid value. QNAP offers a fantastic UI and Linux based stability for an blended Linux/Mac/PC environment.	1
Great service, great product. It does everything I need it to. Arrived in good time and price was right. good deal.	1
This switch has a built in TDR!  For those of you that don't know, that is the method used to find faults in cables.  If you have broken or shorted cables then this should find them.  It found a break in one of my cables I didn't even know about!  Well, didn't know about until it failed to link at 1Gb/s anyways...)  This switch is fill gig, supports an SFP, and is small.  From the pictures you may think it is rack sized by its proportions, but it is only about 1" tall in reality.  It also has a serial connection.  I haven't used it yet, but it is very nice to know it is there in case I botch up the settings.  I did find the vlan settings convoluted.  I had a heck of time getting traffic tagged properly on the SFP.  However, I think this was exacerbated by the fact that I haven't migrated off PVID 1 yet.  Read the manual before configuring 802.1Q on it.  The switch I got had 3com firmware which is very different from HP ProCurve firmware.	1
I have owned this NAS for almost a year now and actually purchased a second one.  It works flawlessly and QNAP live tech support is superb. There is also a fairly comprehensive forum for users as well. I have slowly upgraded my capacities as newer larger capacity drives have come out on the market.  All have been recognized and the space expanded without a hitch. I highly recommend this product.	1
This router works like a charm and I cannot get my hands off this one. I needed a router to practice for my CCNA and CCNP and decided to look online for a place to get a good router; Amazon was great and this store was awesome. I mean they were fast and effecient, it took less than a week to get my router into my hands... It was like clockwork. Keep up the good work.	1
I was looking for a way to connect multiple devices to my Yaesu FT-897 Amateur Radio. I had 3 devices that needed access to the 1 socket in the radio. (a CAT cable for computer control, a linear amplifier and an AT-897 external tuner) After switching the plugs out manually for a few weeks, I happened to see this product during a search for a multi-port switch. The price was much lower than the 2 port switch I had been considering, so I ordered it. Delivery was quite prompt and installing it to my station was easy. I'm very happy that I ran across it before ordering something less capable.	1
Product is excellent. Priced fairly and arrived less than three days after purchase. Worked very well considering that it was different from the hardrive adapter that originally accompanied the unit. Overall, great deal! Highly recommend.	1
I bought this to watch my 2 kittys while I am out for work. I check them on my iphone periodically. The image is good enough to meet my need both in bright and dark. The installation and set up were easy. I though I had problem and emailed cutomer service. they reponded immediately but I found it was a small issue and solve it before scheduled an phone appt with them. I bought the one with wireless adapter and love that I can leave it in my kitty room which is diffdernet room from my PC and wireless rooter are. Only one note is that you can communiate with speaker and microphone when you are on PC; but on iphone via Seedonk, it is speaker only, i.e., you can hear them but you cannot talk to them. This item really gave me a peace of my mind... thank you!	1
I purchased this router looking for power with stable software.  It has provided me with both!  Range is excellent and the software is able to do everything I need.  I run a server on my network along with network accessible video cameras, netflix streaming roku's etc.  I've had the system up for over a week and have had no problems.  I like the fact you can easily create multiple SSID's along with settings for power, port forwarding etc.  I did add a 12v fan to the unit to keep it running cool but I don't think this is really required.	1
Works well on my 64-bit Windows 7 Pro machine. Installation was a breeze, and it has no problems connecting to my router in another room. The software it comes with seems streamlined and intuitive, with no excessive bloat.	1
I am using this antenna with a pair of Linksys WAP54G wireless APs, one acting as a repeater.  The main unit has a 1 watt amplifier hooked to this antenna, the repeater had nothing.  I had to locate the repeater in a favorable location within my home .25 miles from the base unit.  This worked for 6 months until I redecorated and had to move the repeater. I added a 1 watt amplifier to it with the standard antenna and it has been working for the past 6 months in that configuration.  I have been broadcasting for more than a year without issues except for power outages, this sometimes forces a reset of the equipment, but nothing too serious.  Rain and snow have not effected the performance.	1
I can hardly believe broadband has not covered the US yet and so many still have to suffer with dialup. In the meantime, this is the way to go with laptop or notebooks. Get a power and phoneline surge protecter too. Mine blu-up and I had to replace it.	1
Excellent product.  made our small company much more efficient.  I would recommend this product to anyone who has a slow network.  Trust me.	1
I researched reviews, tech specs, drives for the last two years before I settled on this product.  QNAP has one of the best reputations in the industry for quality and workmanship.  This has an extremely low power draw and I've acheived write speeds of 65 MB a second over gigabit ethernet which is far greater than USB 2.0 (roughly 25 MB a second).  This product is half the price of a TS-459 Pro+ ($900 before tax).  I bought all enterprise drives for additional reliability (WD RE4) I'm currently upgrading to Hitachi Ultrastar 3 TB drives.  The new firmware (3.4) from QNAP provides support 3 TB drives.  So max would be 6 TB for Raid-1, 12 TB for (JBOD, RAID 0), and somewhere inbetween for Raid 5.  Good luck and don't forget to get a UPS to protect your data in case of a power outage!	1
This is a fine replacement for a Broadcom wifi adapter in a laptop.  It's connects faster, and the speed is very quick.	1
I own a prior NAS from QNAP (a TS409 purchased about 2 years ago).  I have had little to no problems with the NAS device, and when I did have 1 problem updating the firmware, QNAP tech support was top notch.  They remoted into my NAS and fixed the issue.  When I decided to purchase another NAS device (extra speed, more storage), I could not find a better product than this QNAP.  You can find CHEAPER devices from synology, or thecus, but I feel this device is one of the best.  The build quality feels excellent.  When it arrived, it feels and looks like a serious piece of IT equipment (which it is).  The front panel makes it easy to setup.  I had no issues mounting my drives (also purchased through amazon), and performing the setup.  There are a lot of options with the firmware of this device!  It can be setup to email or sms txt message you if there is a problem with it, it has several different built in software applications (like ITUNES server, and bittorrent downloading software), and is expandable with applications you can install through the firmware separately.  It IS a lot of money, and you could build a computer for less money, but at full load this device uses much less energy than a computer, is quieter, and QNAP is always updating the firmware with new features.  They even updated the firmware for my old NAS with most of the new features of the newer ones, so they do not just abandon the old devices until technology has fully passed them by.  Highly recommend this product.	1
outstanding product -- if you are having trouble connecting to the internet with a weak signal for wireless use -- this is the product.......  the one problem Mac has with the Mac Pro Laptop is a built in "N" card that works ok when the signals around are strong but if they are weak the signal will keep kicking in and out..............this product with solve the problem..............5 star	1
I am using this to monitor  temperature in a data center. The readings are accurate and the email alarms give just enough information without bombarding me with too much information.  Configuration was simple and in less than 15 minuets I had the device configured and installed into its home. The web interface is simple and to the point. The only issue I had was concerning the devices ability to send out email, and with a little help from tech support that was easily fixed. I just ordered a second device for my other data center. The quality is way better than expected, especially for the price.	1
I have enjoyed the Netgear a lot.  I have had it for a year, but just put it into action last month.	1
Did my homework on these network-through-your-household-wiring things, and was skeptical.  Found reviews of the Corinex HomeNet Powerline HD200 adapters, found lots of either one-star or five-star ratings, and lots of sob stories about how poor the installation instructions were, and what a terrible ordeal it was to get them installed and working properly.  I needed what they offer, though, so I ordered a pair and braced myself for a terrible experience.  I have to say that the "2 Minute Installation" note on the front of the package turned out to be a significant understatement.  It took me at least five minutes to get the adapters cabled, plugged into wall outlets, and synced.  I did exactly what the instructions said to do - six easy steps - and everything worked perfectly.  I didn't have to touch any of our network settings.  I can now stream Netflix movies on my PS3 in an area of our house that has been a dead zone for the signal from our wireless router.  I had resigned myself to spending hours screwing around with these things, and now I can watch movies instead!  Couldn't be happier with this product.	1
Two of these switches replaced two Linksys switches that continually needed to be re-booted.  The two Asante switches worked flawlessly for day one.  When I had a question I got outstanding support within less than 5 minutes from someone in the United States who could answer my question. As a result, I just purchased a Asante wireless router.	1
Attached the antenna to a linksys pci card.  Increased a weak and unstable 2 bar signal to a rock solid 5 bar between two buildings about 250 ft. apart.  Can watch videos and TV, listen to music, etc. with no problems.  Highly recommend.	1
Easy to order and check out. Great item and price. Shipping quick as expected. Thanks very professional.	1
Works like a charm. I hooked up the ethernet cables, plugged in, the units automatically connected to one another, and my DirecTV receiver connected to the internet. I was amazed that this worked straight away the first time it is plugged in. Highly recommended.	1
I used two of these to WDS bridge two Asus wl-520gu routers together and it worked great! Very stable connection if using Tomato firmware with transmit power set to around 80.  If the two antennas have a clear view of each other, there should be zero problem in getting a rock solid connection.  Make sure you buy the correct antenna cable to hook up to your router as this package does not come with it.	1
This product is just as described and on testing performs as I had hoped it would. I am still in the set up and testing phase after receiving the ET-2 in the mail. After talking with the tech support I felt more confident in my purchase based on their knowledge of the product. If this item fits your needs, purchase it with confidence. It is very professionally made and comes as a complete package including power supply. Temperature readings are accurate and easy to monitor over the internet. An absolute great product. rt	1
Once my IT expert set it up the NAS has run flawlessly.  Good peace of mine!  We have not expanded it to 4 TB because we do video - Large files!	1
I needed a high speed router and purchased this one to replace an older Cisco-Linksys router.  I also use it as a hardware based firewall.  I'm very impressed with the security, the good signal quality, long range and many other features too numerous to mention.  Buy it... this is the one you need!	1
I bought this item a week ago to share the printer on two machines. There is no problem in setting up this network server. I have an old hp office jet printer which has parallel port; I connect printer to usb 4 hub by cable which has on one end IEEE connector go to printer and other end is usb which is connected to usb 4 hub and hub is connected to arkview server. Software of arkview easily recognize the printer. I attached other usb flash drive. It recognize it too. I installed server on two computers. It is working good.	1
If you are going to record your phone calls and get caller id I recommend this modem. I would also recommend Phonetray free and and a commercial software TRx Phone Recorder which work great with this modem.	1
Installed in new Win 7 machine where I needed a USB 2.0 internal port.  Installed in an open PCI slot, Win 7 recognized immediately. Can't beat the price.	1
As an IT for a large corporation, I spend a lot of time testing out different vendor's products.  This 19dbi panel antenna is by far the most powerful wifi antenna I have ever used.  I installed the first one at a marina, expecting to need at least three additional repeaters.  After connecting the antenna at the beginning of the docks I was able to get signal all the way to the end of the docks, (about 1 mile), with houseboats completely obscuring any line of sight.  I had five bars almost the entire way to the end of the dock.  When I reached the furthest point from the antenna, I had one bar of signal.  I kept a persistent ping going the entire time, and I did not get a single timeout, even when reduced to one bar.  I tested my Iphone as well and received similar results.  I have now purchased quite a few more of these antennas.  These are definitely a goldmine for the wifi world.  It is a relief to finally find an antenna that lives up to its expectations so that I don't have end users always complaining to me about poor signal strength.  I will be installing these at several lodging establishments and rv parks over the next few months, so I will post again with the results of those scenarios.	1
I bought this router knowing that it was an old model, I needed an access point to set up a wireless home network for my nephews on my mom's home. It was a pleasant surprise how good the Linksys router worked not only for the easy setup to the cable modem but also for the quality of the signal, with high stability and a wider range than the router I replaced.	1
USB hubs are mostly all the same and serve the same function. This stands out because of its clever and cute design. It folds together nicely for traveling and the ports are situated a good distance apart.	1
Great product. Advanced knowledge needed to take full advantage of all the features.  Wish list: More memory, more configuration ability with the setup wizard (for less-advanced operators), gigabit ethernet, wireless N. I imagine most if not all of these will make it into the next model upgrade.	1
The router was in excellent shape, and, the vendor communicated well.  Shipping was slow, but, that was noted in the listing.  Works great.	1
So far this product has performed flawlessly!! Very sorry I had not used US Robotics from the start.  Previously I had used the Linksys/Cisco switches and routers and have been let down every time with breakdowns and many, many resets!!  All I can say is US Robotics has them beat hands down!!	1
I received my adapter before the wireless router (also EnGenius) and setup an ad hoc connection. Windows 7 found the adapter right after I connected it to a usb port. It is a small but stylish adapter. I like everything about it. After that it was just a matter of using Windows 7 Network and Sharing Center to setup the connection.  Of course, once the router arrived, it was a snap to setup the network, since Windows 7 had no problems finding the adapter and router. To setup a network using a router, plug in the wireless adapter and then follow the instructions for setting up the router. Easy installation and use, and low price makes each EnGenius product an excellent value.	1
Great 8-port switch.  I've owned it for over a year and it remains just warm to the touch. I have several ports at a gig and several at 100FDX.  I leave everything at autonegotiate.  There were a couple times where I switched off autonegotiate on a port and a particular PC because of an intermittent link outage and I was suspecting a problem with the autonegotiate.  But in the end, both times ended up being the same RJ-45 plug at the PC end of the 60 foot CAT-5 cable.  After finally cutting it off and crimping on a new connector, my intermittent problem went away.  This was one of my gig links.  My system maxes out at 450 Mbps point-to-point so I can't test at gig speeds.  Inserting the switch did not make any difference which is good.  One time, I configured three ports in two VLANs, (i.e. port 1 tagged to VLAN 2; port 2 untagged to default VLAN; port 3 tagged to VLAN 2 and a member of the default VLAN).  I could not get it to work with my PCs but I believe my NICs were not working properly with VLAN tags because Wireshark on all three computers never showed me a tagged frame even when I ran straight cable between two PCs configured for tagged VLANs.  In any event, while going through all these configuration changes on the switch, it never locked up or acted strangely.  The unaffected ports outside my little VLAN test remained functional.  So the only gripe I have with small devices like this is that they are too light.  They are at the mercy of the weight of the cables plugged into them.  They need lead in the bottom to hold them in place.  Alrighty then.	1
this item is wonderful.  it enabled me to install things permanently instead of having to disconnect and reconnect.  i couldn't be happier.  and it has the power to run things.  i'm a computer illiterate but i know when my life is easier and less complicated.	1
This item came with WIDCOMM software. After the installation, it worked very well. I ordered several more, but it was no longer available.	1
These are great little switches I use them in the school district where I work and love them.  No problems with them and I have been using them for over a year now.	1
All I can say is wow...had some trouble setting it up at first but with the Tech support and a little Microsoft fix...wala...this thing is amazing for the price.	1
I'm very pleased with the size and quality of the product.  It's tiny, with just enough of the unit exposed so that it can be easily grasped and removed.  It performs quite well with a good range (I was able to walk anywhere in a 15x15 room without loss of connectivity).  The product does come with a CD that contains both the basic drivers as well as the application that I needed to make this headset work with Skype on my Windows XP machine.  If I may offer a tip for fellow Skype users to help reduce frustration:  Insert the dongle into the USB slot & allow XP to install the drivers.  Then, go to the CD & install the BTW utility that applies to your operating system.  If the CD doesn't auto-run, just open the drive via My Computer & double click on the index.html icon.  It will walk you though several options, including pairing a headset.  Finally, go into Skype's audio settings (Tools/Options/Audio Settings) and choose blue tooth from the drop down lists for microphone, speakers, ringing, what ever you want to work through the headset.  I have had to re-select the Bluetooth option in Skype each time I shut down my PC.  I believe that is an issue with Skype though & not an issue really related in any way to the dongle.  It's a painless 3 clicks, so it's not a huge deal in my opinion.  I'm really glad that I bought it based both on the performance & the fact that it was a third of the cost of similar items sold in local stores.	1
I have owned the NV+ and this NVX is much better, read much faster.  It validated all the new disks I bought and said two of them were bad even though they worked in a PC.  It is very quiet and does not take much power.  Software is very versatile - lot of options and the web interface is very straight forward.  5 year warranty is also appreciated.	1
Great interface to work with (we have tried several others). Solid software and integration with systems. Formatted working raid 5 and connected at GB speed immediately with no problems	1
This is a great switch. I wish, so bad I had found this before I wasted money on my netgear switches. This is so feature rich, I spent quite some time learning how all the features work. You do need another kind of switch to fully use the vlans offered by this unit. I did figure out this trunking is not the cisco type of trunking. If you want the cisco type, it is called "tagged" in the vlan config. This trunking is more like link aggregation. This is a nice feature to have! On a final note, this model has been discontinued. The new HP hotness is the 1810G-8.  My only complaints are. This switch does not support STP, or spanning tree protocol. They have updated the firmware the pass the traffic to prevent a packet storm. Also the IP you use to manage this switch does not support IPv6. This should be really easy to add. I just want it to have a set IPv6 address.  Wonderful unit.	1
Simple to set up, faultless performance, slightly big and could be smaller.  Price was right.  Overall a 95% in my book!	1
A very good inexpensive 24 port switch. The body of the switch actually takes up the entire width of the rack. This makes for a sturdy installation since the rack ears are very short. The switch is also better looking than the Netgear unit it replaced.	1
A nice little flying saucer shaped USB hub a little over 3.5 inch in diameter also comes with an extra 56 inch USB cable works very well vista quickly loaded it nice product made in china .	1
If you don't like bells and whistles,  this is great, plenty of room for all conponents. Very good price too.	1
I've used this modem since DSL came out, I still use it.  It's built like a tank and probably fair to say that it's better than using a new dsl modem.  Also, there is no router inside, which is good.  There is no complicated settings, you merely hook this up to a router.  There is no USB port.  Simply hook this up to the wan port of a router.  I have used this modem 24/7 for more years then I can count.	1
I bought it two month ago, my modem and router are like 50 yards away from my bedroom, I was trying to get some internet access while I was watching tv or looking over my child, it was impossible not only for the distance, it was also for the material of the walls of the house, it is some kind of hard concrete that blocks away any type of signals, even 900 mhz frecuency from my wireless phones. I tried getting out the wireless router and aim it to the room, it did not work. I tried buying a wireless signal extender, did not work eather, I tried buying an extra large antenna that comes with a long cable, I hooked it to my router and put it rigth in the hallway aiming directly to my bedroom, it showed some signal but poorly enough to not be accesible. I was comited to find the solution and while I was searching around the internet I found this product. dessperate as I was I decided to try it even if I did not have any prior reference of it. I came home, hooked it and it has not stopped working since. I recomended it widely, easy to set up and noiseless. Wonderful product, congrats.  Rafael.	1
Awesome throughput and very stable.  Once I upgraded the firmware it hasn't stalled or crashed on me once (not that it ever should).  If you are serious about home networking, skip the cheap stuff and get this.  You will not regret it!	1
Power and layout are the two big advantages to this USB hub.  This hub has the power to drive not only the full USB 2.0 rated current capacities, but beyond.  It means that, for example, one of its USB ports can power up a Western Digital Passport external USB hard disk drive which is very unusual for a hub.  Since the idea of buying a USB hub is to move functions away from your limited number of computer USB ports (especially a notebook computer!), the more of those functions it can move, the better.  And this device will let you plug that Passport in where it is out of your way.  The device is well laid out, too.  The power, input USB port, and three of the seven USB output ports are on the back end of the device (above where it says "T7Hub" in the photograph) which makes cable routing easier for "permanent" devices like printers, scanners, etc., since the cables for those come from behind it (and don't clutter the front).  And that leaves the other four USB output ports on the front side where they are easy to access, like for a memory stick, or for that WD passport drive to do a monthly software backup.  The following hardware comes inside the box: the hub, its power supply, and a USB 2.0 cable.	1
This switch have very good capabilites, vlan, trunk, LACP (Link aggregation or IEEE 802.1AX-2008), runs very cool and is rock solid.	1
This antenna is great.  I set it up at my house and it provides a good signal all the way to my guest house, which is 250ft away at least and with 5 walls between the computer and the router.  Worked better then "extended range" routers that were 8x more expensive.  If your router has a removable antenna and you need increased range buy this antenna, if you are worried it won't work buy it at Fry's and try it for a week, you won't be disappointed.	1
This is a great little switch. I replaced a big 24 port gig switch with this to save some money on power and to reduce the amount of heat generated by my network gear in my home office. It runs cool and is part of their new "green" switch line that reduces power consumption in a number of ways. It does everything I expect higher end web-managed switches to do, and is extremely affordable. I like that 3Com has redesigned this line to have flat case tops instead of the rounded tops they used to have (no more need for the extra bracket in order to put something on top of it). Make sure that you upgrade the firmware on this switch right out of the box before doing ANYTHING else; there's a bug in the shipped firmware that will brick the switch when you set the password and you'll have to console into it to recover otherwise. The new firmware fixes that.	1
I am using this antenna on a RV mounted on a pole and attached to my rear ladder. I am now able to pick up wifi in rv parks with weak signals. A good buy	1
Easy to install, although one quick tech call to answer a question was required and was answered promptly. Small footprint, well made. Can't expect more for this kind of money.	1
I got a new home computer and was transferring files from my work laptop using my old 10T hub.  After over an hour, it was only one third of the way done. In frustration I bought this Asante switch.  Once I hooked up the Asante, the whole thing copied in 12 minutes!  At first I didn't believe it had actually copied everything.  But it was all there, just 25 times faster.  I should have got a faster switch years ago.	1
It's been working like a charm for the last 5 years, non-stop. I just wish Snapgear cared about its customers and updated the linux kernels for these devices.	1
This switch was purchased for use as our primary gigabit LAN switch fabric, and it has worked as advertised out of the box. Since the model we purchased has been discontinued by 3Com, it's made it a great bargain from a price standpoint for a 48-port gigabit switch, as you can still find some new units. The web-based configuration management interface is well thought-out and easy to navigate. In our testing, we have found that the switch provides the LAN performance that we were looking for, so we are very satisfied with the purchase.	1
Asant is the best. We love their products, just wished they made a 12-port unit in this family. We're in a mixed environment (2 Windoze, 10 Macs, printers and NAS's) and the flow in our units are extremely stable and high-speed. We've done throughput tests and they're pretty much up there at maximum. We have 3 lines in Cat-5e and the rest are Cat-6. The runs are between 3m/12ft and 25m 85ft. We have 4 Asants and would continue to have more. They truly are hassle-free.	1
The new 2009 Mac Pros have no firewire 400 ports, and a number of the add-in cards in the market work poorly in a Mac. This card, however, seems to work just fine. It installs in about a second and needs no drivers. Both ports become immediately available.  I've been testing mine with an iSight camera and a Lexar compactflash card reader. Given an ultra II compact flash card rated to "minimum 9MB/second," I was able to copy a 1.90GB file at a pace of 9.2 MB/second. This is only about 20% the theoretical speed of a firewire 400 port, but I don't have any higher speed firewire device handy on which to apply tougher testing.  Note that the card does not support Target Disk Mode on the Mac.	1
Got this router about a year ago and it has been absolutely trouble-free ever since. I've had three previous wireless routers and they all began to malfunction within a few months of service. This one is as reliable as the sunrise and pretty inexpensive, making it a pretty good buy. At the moment I have my desktop, printer/fax/copier/scanner, laptop and one Panasonic network security camera connected to this router, all wireless, and they all work very reliably. Not a high-end router, but very reliable. Kinda like a VW Bug, not real sexy, but does what it was intended to do.	1
First one I ever bought, so far so good.  Seems to work well and installation was easy, except that the installation instructions were difficult to follow.  I called my cable company and they helped me figure out what to do.	1
This is the perfect switch for someone looking for an affordable managed switch, quite and robust.	1
This modem is just GREAT!  I still use dial-up and this more than fits the bill (much faster than my old modem).  It was very easy to install on my new home built computer that uses Vista Home Premium. I have been using it for about a month now and have had no problems. Thank You Amazon.com for the great service you gave me and I will definitely be using you again for future purchases.	1
This wi fi gaming access point was so easy to set up. My Wii, DS and PSP connected to it with no problem. It only takes a few minutes to set up. If only, everything can be this easy.	1
These things are bullet proof and blow the Cisco LinkSys gear out of the water.  If you need the ability for two separate networks to talk to each other (VLANS), This is the switch for you.  If all you need is a simple GigE switch, check out the ProCurve 1400-8 G switch.  The ProCurves are build smarter and do not overheat.  I've burnt through several Linksys Cisco and Dlink switches. These guys serriosuly need to advertise better.  I would have saved 100's if I just purchased a ProCurve to begin with.	1
We were struggling with how to share a limited resource that needed to be tested by several developers.  The test resource was off in a room far away from me and upstairs from another developer.  Loading our tests onto laptops was a pain.  With Anywhere USB we can all share.  We all run Messenger to chat to coordinate access.  It even works over our wireless lan.  I have used Digi products for years.  As always they just work without any fuss.  Configuration was mostly easy.  It takes a few minutes to load all the drivers.  But once that is done....It just works.  No hassle the next morning.  Great product Digi.  It is a delight to work with such well designed equipment as all the products I have used from Digi.	1
This is a great USB hub, it works perfectly! I love the blue illumination, so you can see that it's working with a quick glance.	1
I don't have this exact model, I have Zoom's Model #3048, which is nearly identical. I've had it for just over five months, (got it at Staples), and it's a terrific modem. Very reliable and stable. If you're in the market for an external modem, I highly recommend this one.	1
Arrived in several days and worked perfectly in my old Windows 2000 notebook.  Terrific product.  Thanks.	1
I bought this video splitter for a work tradeshow - it was excellent! Plug in all your sources, push the power button to ON, and you're done. If only the rest of the electronics were that easy...	1
Far as I can tell the unit works just fine.  I have it connecting my home office and residential network and works as intended.  Didn't want to spend the money for the managed switch as I don't need it yet so for the price it works great.	1
Bought this card to augment the number of Firewire ports in my new MacPro (only design flaw I find in that computer...not enough Firewire inputs for professional use). It replaced the first Sonnet card I bought as that one (a combo USB/Firewire card) didn't play well with my computer for what I needed (word to wise - before buying a PCI card make sure that your peripherals will work with it. Firebox, for instance, needs a specific chipset and Firewire only cards to work...something buried on their website).  Card installed easily and has worked beautifully with no problems.  Big rave to Sonnet's customer service, btw, for helping me troubleshoot and giving me all the information I needed. About the best I've encountered.	1
I needed to be able to switch a single computer between two completely different networks and I wanted it to be a physical switch so only one cable was actually connected to the computer at a time.  This product did the trick perfectly.	1
If you can find it, buy it.  Gigabit speed is outstanding. Plug and play.	1
Not much you can say about this hub - it does what its supposed to!  I have a lot of FireWire devices, most of which have two ports - but its nice central location to plug them into instead of daisychaining!  I don't have to keep the devices next to each other anymore!	1
What's not to love about a plug-n-play little hockey puck which solves so many of my connectivity problems.  My Mac G4 MDD is notorious for having too few USB and Firewire connections, and a power supply which is a bit week for daisy chained devices.  This powered hub solved my problems and it was a simple as, open the box, hook it up, turn it on, and start using it.	1
After a long search I was finally able to locate this modem that is not only a fax and data modem but also a voice modem.  Voice modem is essential for answering machine type software on my computer.  The product is working as expected.	1
A great little hub for those of us still wired to each other, very fast, no set up issues, just plug it in and it works, with auto speed sensing and nice activity display lights. Perfect for a wired home or small office network.	1
Item shipped quickly and arrived well packed. Extremely easy to set up and use. Good software & instructions. Robust & speedy network, far faster than my WAN. Has worked on every outlet I've tried so far in my 100 year old house, even through an extension cord.	1
So far this matrix switch has been working great for us in a conference room environment.  Although we haven't really put this device through it's paces (testing video resolutions, noise levels, audio, etc.), this item has worked exactly how I had hoped right out of the box.  The only area that I could see improved on this unit would be the addition of a remote control.  Otherwise, great product with no issues so far.	1
As with all Sonnet products I've used, this one works without a flaw. Just installed it and started using it. Sonnet really knows how to make products for the Mac.	1
Bought 3 wireless routers/APs.  This one works the best.  Very stable connection.  I have about 15 PCs connected to it.	1
Having tried a number of different wireless network adapters that connect to the computer via the USB port I have found that this type of device is much better.  It is more reliable; and faster to give you a connection when logging into Windows. This adapter frees you from problems with sleep mode, screen savers, etc. that USB type adapters may have.  If you use Linux, Mac OS, etc. this device is a nice solution as well.  The installation program is slightly buggy, but I was able to get the device configured and it has worked flawlessly ever since.  If you have a device that has an RJ-45 Ethernet port and you want to connect it to an A, B or G wireless network this is the best way that I have found.  Internal cards that plug into the PCI or PCI express ports are also reliable and might be better for online gaming.  But I occasionally like to be able to move my adapter to other devices that have RJ-45 Ethernet ports like Game Consols, other computers, etc.  Many other companies make similar adapters that only use the B & G type networks.  This is the only device that I could find that can use type A networks that I use.  You can only connect to one router or access point at a time.  The only gripe that I have is lack of some encryption protocols.  I live in a rural area so encryption isn't too important to me.  The encryption types that this device support are dated and insufficient for important business use in a location that would be prone to wireless snooping.	1
Easy to install on XP machine, drivers worked great.  Loaded quickly and easily, and worked!  What else could you ask for?	1
This was exactly what I needed.  The Company provided good communication in regards to receiving my order and shipping information.  Very pleased	1
I did my research on this product and found it to be exactly what I was looking for. I have run out of space for additional cards on my system and this card combines USB 2.0, Firewire, and RJ45 onto one card. Great card and Amazon had the best price that I could find online.	1
This modem works with Linux, at least the distros that I've been experimenting with (not Ubuntu, which I gave up on a long time ago so I didn't test this modem with Ubuntu, but rather some of the other Linux versions). I haven't tried all the fancy features of the modem (fax, etc) because I don't need that stuff, but dial-up works. I had some problems getting the modem's speaker to be silent, but I think that's probably an issue with my Linux software, and probably not a problem with the modem itself. Given my earlier frustrations with so-called "WinModems", I'm just happy to finally have this Zoom modem that actually works.	1
I know little about computers. I wanted to be able to use the desktop without having to have our wireless router on all the time. Ordered this, at first it scared me that there was really no instructions. I plugged in the Cat5 from the cable box, ran one cat 5 to desktop, one to wireless router, turned it all back on, and everything works!!! If it's easy enough that I can do it, anyone can. <G>	1
Installed the Lantronix USB device server in 10 minutes, just connected to ethernet, installed software, and plugged in devices. I am using it with an epson scanner and an HP Officejet K60- which is supposed to be (acording to hp) non-compatible with a wireless network. I bought this with the expectation it probably wouldn't work with the HP but it did! wireless connection is great- entire network has full control over devices on other side of house, 2 ports left for any other devices I wish to network, couldn't be happier this product was worth the price for me.  Update: When DSL signal is low or reset, device server sometimes needs to be reconnected or reset as well - usually this is just a matter of disconnecting power and usb devices then reconnecting but sometimes pressing the pinhole reset button is required. It can be annoying but it's mostly attributed to my poor dsl signal, other than that still works great, still highly recommend!	1
I've been using it for the last 1 year and enjoyed this antenna. Thanks to this antenna, my wi-fi internet is available in the entire house + children's playground, which was NOT the case with my router's original antenna. In addition, I must note that unlike other brands, TrendNet is cheaper and offers compatible quality. In short - highly recommended.	1
This little USB/Firewire Hub is tops.  Lots of ports, and it works like a charm.  This is one great product for the price.	1
One of few that have 8 ports.  It was a great price.  It worked right away and got our system up in running in no time.	1
I bought this mouse about a year ago, it's been great. I love that I can charge it, I cannot tell you how frustrated I've been with other wireless mice when the battery dies. It's cute, small, perfect to use when I travel or work from home without my docking station.	1
The built in cable is just the right size.  The hub works like a charm.  After fussing with a USB 1.0 hub for a few months, this 2.0 hub is definitely a plus for any travel bag.	1
Have it plugged into my wan/router so people visiting can use both WiFi or Bluetooth.. Especially handy since some of my customers have PDA's that only have Bluetooth built in. Also have several GigaBytes of MP3's for download, and those work fine on both the PDA's and phones.	1
This router is great. The setup and installation was very easy. I've tried other routers, but this is by far the best.	1
If you ship VHS tapes, you must get these mailers. They make shipping so secure and easy. The only way to fly for those who sell VHS through an online store. They have made my life as a seller so easy!	1
Plugged it in.  Set it up the same as my previously failed SMC Barricade Router.  Haven't had any trouble.  I have not used the VPN feature.  Have not used many other features, just an 8-port broadband router.  Works great.	1
I like it !! It has nice features like web administration and it works pretty well. Great Product for an awesome price.	1
Smallest 4 port hub that I could find.  I use it to recharge power on my road warrier devices (cell phone, mp3 player, camera, etc) from my laptop... using USB cables/plugs from boxwave.	1
It works, what else can I say?  I purchased it as a replacement for an older DSL modem in the hopes that it would do a better job of maintaining my connection to the Internet.  There were no installation problems (I use it in connection with a router) and it does appear to be slightly more robust.	1
Installation under Linux is a snap  I am the proud owner of te modem now for 2 months  And I hope it will be my modem for years to come	1
I have owned this router for about 1 month. When i got it, i though "Again standart router...". But when i launched router nad connected it, and begin configuration via Telnet, i saw perfect menus, which are easy in use. this router have so much great features! And all of them in small box. Also, you can put this router onto wall. It has 8-port switch, up to two Uplinks (WAN or Ethernet hub), powerful feauters and other great stuff. It packed in small, neatly blue box.  If you looking for great router - buy this one, and you will be very happy, like me!	1
I am a computer geek. I have a lot of devices, many of those with ethernet ports. For instance, I have a PRISMIQ Media Player that hooks to the TV to watch videos and photos stored on the computer.  That device has BOTH an ethernet port for wired lans, and a PCMCIA slot to insert a wireless networking card, but it must be of a given brand and model (from a list of supported cards).  I wanted to hook the device to my LAN without drilling holes on walls, and I didn't want to have to seek a special pcmcia card. So I went with one Sony PCWA-DE80. I connected to the Prismiq ethernet port and Bingo!, instant wireless connectivity to my Netgear 802.11a Wireless Access Point!.  A bonus with one of these devices you can say GOODBYE to WIFI driver issues. You just need a WIFI access point next to your adsl or cable modem, and this device. Then you can hook ANYTHING with a working ethernet port to your wireless lan!. It could be  a PC or any other device (could be a game console!). You plug the Sony ethernet-to-wifi converter into the device's RJ45 ethernet port and ... instant wireless connectivity. As far as the PC or  device is concerned, it's talking to a wired ethernet, even while it's not, as the sony devices bridges wifi to wired ethernet networks!.  Setup is a breeze. Just point your browser to the devices's IP address and enter your wifi configuration data (supports wep up to 128 bits), the IP address that you want assigned to it, and that's it!. Then when you plug this unit to any device with an ethernet port, that device will immediately connect to your wifi network!. I even used one of these boxes to get instant WiFi connectivity on my old lan server running IBM OS/2, an operating system that doesn't have plenty of WiFi cards supported (if any).  Another bonus: switch operating systems painlessly, don't worry about the availability of wifi drivers!. I test software for a living, so I often find myself installing several flavors of Linux on my notebook. However, availability of Wifi drivers for Linux is scarce. So, instead of having to thinker with the computer, I just tell linux to use the notebook's ethernet port, and I then plug the SONY ethernet to wifi converter and that's it. Instant connection and no need to drill holes on the walls.  The downside: It's expensive, like most Sony gear. You can probably find several less expensive "ethernet to Wi-Fi" converters on the market, but to my knowledge the Sony ones are the ONLY that support the 5 Ghz 802.11a standard!, all cheaper devices work ONLY in the 2.4 Ghz frequency, using either 802.11b or 802.11g. I choose 802.11a because, while older, the 5 Ghz band is less prone to interference from 2.4 Ghz cordless phones, microwave ovens (did you know your microwave oven operates at 2.4 ghz?), and wireless security cameras, all of which pollute the 2.4 Ghz frequency spectrum.  The PCWADE80 works BOTH in 2.4 Ghz frequency (802.11b ang "g") and also in 802.11a. Unlike the previous model (PCWADE50) this one claims to support 72mbps "turbo" mode in 802.11a! (haven't tested it).	1
Finally, a sub $100.00 8 port switch/router/VPN/firewall with Stateful Packet Inspection and everything you need to get your SOHO safely connected to the Internet. There are other's out there, but nowhere near the features at this price range. Setup in place of an older Linksys HPRO200 router/firewall was about 10 minutes including wiring and cycling the cable modem.  Rule sets will take awhile longer, but should be nice once it's done with configuration backup and restore features.	1
I am running a Intel Celeron 1.0 Ghz custom built PC which only has USB 1.0 built on the motherboard. Recently, I bought a less expensive USB 2.0 card at a local retailer thinking a usb card is a usb card.  I had a horrible time installing it and it never really worked right.  When I purchased a Western Digital USB 2.0 External Hard Drive to add to my system is when I found out not all usb cards are created the same. The WD hard drive just would not operate on the cheaper usb 2.0 card. I could not transfer files or write to the drive without getting errors.  I thought it was the hard drive but after exchanging it and getting another one only to have the same problem I determined it must be the usb controller. That is when I searched the net and looked at reviews for the best USB 2.0 card out right now.  Every computer magazine website gave this card excellent reviews so I thought I would buy it from Amazon.com and give it a try. It was very easy to install and I absolutely love the added front USB port which is included in the box and fits in an open 5 1/4 bay.  Since I have an older machine I did not have any front usb ports. With this in mind along with the great reviews it has been given the purchase was a no brainer. I believe the NEC drivers which this card uses makes it top notch.  I would recommend this card highly.	1
This is my first modification on any type of computer. In fact, I did it incorrectly, and it still worked. What I mean is, you are supposed to download the driver (CDROM or online) and then install the card. Windows XP recognized it immediately and it works as advertised at 480 Mbits/sec. If you must know just one important thing about USB 2.0, remember not to unplug the peripheral device when the PC is on. Power down first, then unplug the device, be it printer, digital camera, external HD, or cordless microphone. It could result in a crash and/or data loss (Thanks to Christine for this word of advice).	1
This is a PCI card to add USB to an older computer; 3 slots on the back and one internal--this card included a USB slot in a drive-bay cover, which you can install if you've got a free bay on your PC, connecting it to the internal USB slot with a supplied cord.  The card works great on my P3-800 at work, running Windows 2000.  Installed without a bit of trouble, and works perfectly.  Following the installation directions had me up and running in a few minutes, and the PC recognized the card and loaded the drivers (which I'd put on from the install CD) immediately without a single hitch.  Good as it gets!	1
This program is average to below average in it's abilities.  That said, just hope you don't need any Roxio tech support.  Why? because Roxio's  support bites!  You CANNOT contact anyone online or by email for help;  whenever their dis-functional "web portal" [web-based support] system traps you in an endless loop.  I needed an couple simples updates for a pc that is NOT ALLOWED on the internet.  It used to be you could download Roxio's PATCHES from any pc having internet access.  Then burn patch[s] to a CD, or copy to floppy/jumpdrive.  Then "sneakernet" the patches to the pc needing them.  NO MORE.  What happened today was that their webpage was apparently trying to download/patch a roxio product directly on MY pc.  [EZCD5 doesn't exist on my pc].  Instead of simply letting me download it somewhere, like to my hard drive, vs patchging it directly from their webpage to my pc,  [which won't work in my case as I'm not using roxio, nor have it installed on my pc];   apparently the morons that did the roxio webpage coding make the download/patch process STOP/END and proceed to send the customer back to Roxio's initial patch download page.  When you need a patch, all these endless loops and support games  are enough to get me looking for a different product/different company.  If you want to minimize human contact with customers, fine.  But let folks at least download the patches they need in order to keep their pc going.  Don't hand over your customer support system [almost] completely to a WEB SERVER.  That ignorant arrangement works about as well as when companies try to save a few pennies and get rid of phone receptionists for customer service telephone calls.  Then they let customers wade through a 100 layer deep voicemail system to find the answer to a simple problem.  IT JUST DOESN'T WORK.  If a company won't provide access to PATCHES,  even after I have logged into their website with username and password, [so they know is accessing their patches]  AND they  don't offer any type of  FTP site  as a download backup  option, then  I sure as heck won't be buying anymore of their products.  I see why Roxio bought up CeQuadrat and other companies.  [Though I hate to see such quality companies be devoured like that].  When a competitor has a better product, why fight to improve your prodsuct's quality/features, when you can buy the other company out.  Thank goodness Nero is not under the Roxio umbrella.	-1
After learning some HTML on my own, and struggling to set up my first Web page, I came to appreciate FrontPage 98. Later, I upgraded to FrontPage 2002. Microsoft had a winner in this affordable, easy-to-use Web page design tool.  I use it exlusively to do all of my Web site design these days. It has a few quirks, and is not always as intuitive as I think that it should be, but, hey--it sure beats doing markup manually!  I like it!	1
CD burning is becoming a way of life, much the same way that audio CDs did. In order to make the best use of your CD-RW drive, however, you must have good software that will transfer your files or music onto the CD. Easy CD Creator 5 will do that and much more. Using this software, you will be able to easily create music and data CDs, record music from non-digital sources (tapes, records, and even the radio), create labels, and backup your computer. DirectCD will even allow you to use your CD-RW drive much the same way as you would a floppy. Just drag your files over, or save them from within your favorite application. This software is compatible with Windows XP (although you will need to download a patch, which is simple to install). If you will just be using your CD-RW drive for basic functions, then the software that came with your drive should work fine. If you want to make the most use out of that drive, buy Easy CD Creator 5! USERS OF EASY CD CREATOR 4 DELUXE: If you are not running Windows XP (or plan to run), save your money. This version is very similar to 4.0 Deluxe, and you will notice very few improvements over your version!	1
I must say that Front Page 2002 is a dream program compared to the 2000 version.  I had some very weird things happen with 2000 such as its not publishing to the web on the index page unless I also saved it in Notepad.  All the bugs are gone in 2002 plus it is much easier to use.  I use it for everything, rarely using Word, Office and so forth.  My two major tools for editing and writing are Front Page and super Notepad instead.  I am going to learn Dreamweaver next term at the college where I teach because I am finally ready to move on and learn more about professional  web design.  Besides, I can now read and write html so I am not as utterly dependent on Front Page as I once was.  If you don't know any html coding, the basis of all web pages, Front Page is the program for you.  I also do all my image editing in Photoshop so don't even need that function in Front Page.  Dreamweaver is the industry standard instead of Front Page yet Front Page is the ordinary user's program of choice.  The reason for this is that you can know very little about computers and still make a website with Front Page.  It even made publishing websites idiot proof by using Front Page Server extensions with many web host providers.  Thus, one can totally skip learning ftp protocol by using Front Page server extensions instead.  If someone wants to go professionally into web page design, this is not the product, Dreamweaver is.  People who already are professionals in the computer industry or in web design tell me they don't like Front Page.  I think the reason is that since they don't need (or want) Front Page to do their work for them, they desire a program which gives them a much freer hand.  For the average computer user though, that is all pie in the sky, beyond their reach, and Front Page 2002 will more than do the job for them.	1
I received a 30 day trial of this software from Microsoft. I used it to update my website that is hosted by Yahoo. I had to load the FrontPage extensions to the server then convert my current pages to FrontPage. This made me go through the process of reformatting nearly everything. The simple on-line tools that yahoo provides did a better job and quicker than this software. I suppose if you really are an office expert and want the look and feel of the office interface then you might like it. Otherwise I think you can do better elsewhere. This software takes the cookie cutter approach to building a web presence. Microsoft was offering a 30 day CD trial but have stopped that. I wonder why they don't want you to try it out any more before you buy it? Why indeed!	-1

FrontPage 2002 is a great what-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG) HTML editor, and maintains enough power that interested individuals can still write the actual HTML code. If you have ever used Office, you will be able to learn most of FrontPage 2002's features with relative ease. FrontPage Server Extensions are required to be on the server hosting your page for some of the more advanced features, but many hosts are beginning to add these extensions as their use increases. If all you'll be doing is adding content to a page, you should have no problems using FrontPage on any servers. FrontPage is an extremely powerful software package that costs a lot less than most other equivalent products. As a piece of the Office XP product line, FrontPage 2002 will be as easy and as powerful as other products you are using, and will integrate itself with those other products. If you need to put part, or even a whole, word document on a page FrontPage will do that with ease. You can also include Excel data, and other types of office documents. If you have not yet purchased an HTML editor, get FrontPage and save yourself a lot of hassle and money with other brands. If you have already begun that hassle, end it now with FrontPage 2002. A WORD OF CAUTION: Users of Microsoft Windows 95 and prior will NOT be able to use FrontPage 2002, or any other Office XP product... Take a look at FrontPage 2000 for this OS.	1
I made the exact same mistake with version 4.0 that I did with this version.  Because it was the newest/greatest I picked it up as soon as it came out and it proceeded destroy my system. I use Win98 SE on a 1gig Athlon with a Toshiba CD-ROM and HP CDRW for those who care.  Ever since installing it I have had conflicts with different devices and problems accessing my CD Rom.  The famed "blue screen of death" which was almost a distant memory is now returning on a daily basis.  I tried uninstalling 5.0 and reinstalling 4.0 but whatever the program  did is now permanent in my system.  I then reinstalled Win 98 completely and while the conflicts are gone (from a device manager standpoint), the B.S.O.D. still shows up frequently when either my CD-ROM or CDRW is being accessed.  Short of reformatting my hard drive, I don't think I'm going to rid myself of this nuisance. I was actually pleased with version 4.0 (after about the 3rd or 4th patch), but this is just inexcusable.  Now I understand many Win2000 users are having problems as well.  XP users are having a nightmare - even with the patches!  Please avoid this software and let this company die.  After trying a number of different competitors, I would recommend the much more stable and less bloated Nero for CD Burning.  You can find more info about it at ....	-1
The famous roxio or Adaptec and some people might know develops vet another crashing software program. Similar to previous verions of easy cd creator this software is NOT STABLE even if you install all the patches. The older version came with my burner and i thought maybe this would be the best but i was wrong. I have found that it is much slower than all other burning software that i tried, and takes way to much resources to run. Its a hog. It does not work well with windows xp (with all patches installed) Get Nero!! (its cheaper and better)	-1
I've had my CD burner and version 3.5 of this product for some time now. Loved it. I wanted version 5 "Platinum" so that I could make Video CDs. But it looks like 5 can't read some AVI formats that every other program I have can read with no problems at all. In addition, 5's audio noise reduction algorithms are horrible. It sounds better to leave even noisy vinyl untouched. The "Realizer" enhancement function must be designed for the tinniest of cheap speakers, because on any decent system it gives way too much bass. Before getting Easy CD 5, I happily encoded MP3s at 128kbps, but Easy CD 5's encoding sounded horrible at that rate, forcing me to use the more wasteful 160kbps. Then, when I finally had something I wanted to put on CD, I found that my trusty CD-RW drive was unable to make any CDs at all. Even though the program reported "CD created successfully", any audio or data CD I made crashed Windows as soon as I tried to read it. I can't think of anything I like about the program, and I don't think it's a coincidence that my Windows system is very unstable since I installed Easy CD Creator 5 Platinum.	-1
Honestly, I think you should wait a year or two before you upgrade most of the new features are not really relevant to consumers, but are aimed more at businesses. I don't know if they are shipping Office XP with Service release 1, but I think most users who would like to uprgade should at least wait until it is being shipped with the bug fixes. The applications look beautiful. They are easy to use of course, but if you are just typing documents, sending e-mail, adding numbers things like that stick with Office 2000. Because in these rough times you don't want to waste money on something you are actually getting over and over and over again. I'm not saying it's the same applications but for users who are doing simple things in Office it really does not make sense to buy something that is packed up with 90% of features you are not using. Just have a little patience and wait the year or two by that time Microsoft will be releasing Office XP 2005, and trust me they are, I read in an interview, where the Microsoft Office Team manager said the next version of Office XP will be based more on collaboration and services. I am making sure you don't make any regrets, buying this product.	1
Yes, Office XP performs all the tricks so that any document, presentation and/or spread sheet looks like a million dollars but how many times is Microsoft going to slap a label on a product and declare it to be a major improvement? The features found in Office XP are almost a clone to the previous Office suite's.  Yes, you can now hold 24 items in your clipboard and that is indeed something but isn't that a nifty trick that could have been added as a download?  The task panes, etc. look nice but nobody in the work world is going to use them.  Also, you need a full screen when you are seriously working and some of Office XP's innovations reduce the work area. If you are happy with the Office suite you are currently using, keep it and ignore this upgrade.  There are no improvements big or small that justify the cost.  Yes, it has the best programs going but it is difficult to install and after you finally get it on your system you are left with - a clone of the Office Suite you were previously using.	1
Office XP is a great improvement over version of Office prior to 2000. Smart tags help to bring key features out that once were hidden from view, making it much easier to be productive in Office. Great improvements have been made in Access 2002 which is now much easier to use than its predecessor was, even easy enough that a novice user could figure out how to setup a basic database with little problem. PowerPoint 2002 also features some nice new transitions and other "bells and whistles" to help make your presentation look more professional. For those of you who may have created Binder files, in previous versions of Office, this feature is no longer available, however an unbind feature comes with Office XP. The downside that I have heard much about is the dreaded Product Activation. If you work within your license to use Office, you should never have any problems. My computer gets worked pretty hard, and I often have to reinstall Windows. Needless to say, Office has to be reactivated. Never once has MS staff refused to activate my product. This "torment" is really more dreaded than most users will ever find it to actually be. Be more productive with a copy of Office XP today!	1
Publisher 2002 is a pretty good product. I haven't had any of the prolems that some other people have had. It runs great on my machine never crashed once. It has some really good templates from menus to flyers to paper airplanes. and it is pretty simple to use once to get a little used to it. But stay away from the bundle with the photo editior included because the photo editior has almost no functionality	1
Microsoft Publisher 2002 contains new features for users such as the Microsoft Office Word-Art, which I think is a plus. It was so difficult in previous versions of Publisher to insert Text Art so that's one major benefit from the program. It has the familiar Task Pane which makes integration across all the Office (XP) applications work seamlessly. You get ton's Clip Art that are very unique so that Publications can look different and fancy. You also get more design templates for better variety and individuality in your publications, so that's another added bonus. It's cheaper than most high-end desk top publishers such as PageMaker or Quark Xpress. So if you are a person who does simple projects such as creating Post Cards, News Letters Publisher I think will come in very handy for those types of Projects. ... I think Microsoft Publisher is worth the buy. And it's better for first users of desktop publishing. Some experienced users might experience some problems with publications created in previous versions of Publisher but, it's not a major problem. Older files do convert thou, you just have remember if you are going to save a file as a previous version, you have to select file type. One of the main things is that it get's the job done and thats what we all want to do, right!	1
I posted my review of Publisher 2000, when it existed, and basically feel the same way about 2002.  HOWEVER, I have a few more concerns.  I loaded it onto my computer to check it out.  I didn't like what I saw so I unloaded it.  Out of curiosity, I loaded it again.  It behaved as if I had never unloaded it the first time.  My alloted number of uses (before activation) decreased so something is still in there saying it was on there before (yes, yes, yes...in the registry).  Ok, Bill wants a new mansion so he is trying to prevent piracy.  I can understand that.  HOWEVER, my next concern is realllllyyy big.  In ME, you can set a restore point.  This restore point allows you to reconfigure your PC to a point from the past.  This is present just in case a new program you load has some problems, etc....  Now remember, ME is Mr. Gate's program just like Publisher.  I had to reformat my hard drive (thanks to Microsoft's Encarta Reference Library).  My system was fresh as a daisy.  I re-loaded Publisher out of curiosity to see what would happen.  I created a restore point PRIOR to loading it.  I didn't activate it because I didn't want it.  I unloaded it.  Just to test the system, I used my restore function.  If you are following me carefully, you can tell I have already made two changes since creating the restore point:  loading and unloading Publisher.  Guess What!?!  ME wouldn't allow the restoration because NOTHING HAD CHANGED ON MY PC!  HELLO???  I loaded and unloaded a program; I consider that a change.  Let's say Publisher had a problem and didn't work.  In order to get it off my PC, I would have to do ANOTHER format for my hard drive.  That, my friends, is scary.  And to add on to another person's review.  That person was incorrect when he/she said you could only have it on two PC's and would be out of luck if one crashed.  You can get it activated again and give some excuse as to why it needs to be reactivated (at least, that's what the support person told me).  But who wants to go through that every single time you want to load this program???  I know piracy exists but I don't see Microsoft in any financial distress.  I find it degrading that its customers have to do such a time-consuming procedure for a program which retails for $...  $..??  Maybe.  But $...??  That's pretty sad.  If you have it, stick with Publisher '98.  You can load it and not have to call Microsoft every time you need to install it.  I also challenge Microsoft to (A) Give me an upgrade worth $130 or (B) Give a better "upgrade" rebate ($...-Whooppeee!!).	-1
I was very happy with this game- it took the bets parts of the previous Oregon Trail incarnations and wove them together for a good overall product. I can appreciate a company which recognizes both the weaknesses and the strengths of their products and uses this information to get better. In this Oregon Trail you can once again chose how many you will travel with and name them (for some crazy reason this feature was eliminated in the 4th Oregon Trail edition), but you can also CHOOSE the times you stop to collect wild fruit or fish, instead of these circumstances just happening randomly (which does not make as much sense). To me, these were the biggest changes to previous games, but they were improvements.  Aside from the above changes, the basics of the game remain the same, and it will look familiar to those who have played other editions. A few things have been updated, particularly some aspects concerning Native Americans and some geography, but the good times still keep rolling.	1

Well, the awesome folks at HER Interactive have done it again.  This time, Nancy Drew is snowed in at a modern-day castle in Wisconsin. She'll meet some strange people, sneak through creepy secret passages, and find beautiful trinkets and treasures ... not without the usual dangers, of course... Nancy Drew can't really avoid those.  There will always be an evil villain trying to do her in.  But hey, it's all in good fun.  If you've played the other Nancy Drew games, this is more of the same.  Most similar to "Message In A Haunted Mansion" (in my opinion), this game offers puzzles that are similar to puzzles in the first 3 games, but with one or two totally original ones.  Other than a few surprises, there's nothing in here that's really superior to the other games; I'd say they are all pretty equal.  Still, another Nancy Drew adventure is a good time waiting to happen.  It took me about 12 hours to complete on the junior level, though the box claims it can take you 20.  So... take your time, take the 20, and have fun, this game is great.  Keep em coming!	1
This is my 21st review and completed adventure in the Nancy Drew series.  First, I'd like to start by dividing my review into two factions. 1) The game itself 2) My personal detective work.  * PART 1 *  PLOT: A fierce blizzard at a Wisconsin ski resort has Nancy Drew holed-up with a handful of vacationers. She is on the trail of a missing journal of Marie Antoinette's that would lead to a sacred treasure hidden by the ill-fated queen back in the 18th century. Her sanctuary was the Chteau Rochemont in France relocated & rebuilt by a chocolate milk tycoon in America.  I found it generally interesting to be able to explore the monstrosity that was the castle, but later became irritated by the tasks that had me zipping all over the place with a clunky interface.  INITIAL SCORE: 88  CHARACTERS:  Dexter Egan: This was one of the more interesting characters that HER has ever produced as it showed the light and dark side of a man growing up as an adopted child by the millionaire, Ezra Wickford. Ezra had such affection for the boy Dexter [spelling bee champion, volunteer work during WW2 era]  until he felt he could no longer trust him with his future estate based on criminal fraud convictions. Great plot line and I loved the two journals in the secret study!  Jacques Brunais: He was sappy right from the start! I was very surprised that HER had the character end relations with Nancy on such a horrible note, but I actually LIKED that story derivative!  It showed the live emotions of irrational people [like in real life].  Lisa Ostrum: Usually when a shady past is shoved in your face early in the storyline, that is a sign that this isn't the culprit.  I had Lisa pegged as my # 1 suspect only because the other characters were pressed into showing their flaws throughout the adventure too thoroughly and I had reasons to think they HAD problems, but they weren't directly related to the vandalism. Tara V. Smith [who voiced Lisa] did a fine job, but it sounded rather cartoonish also [like a Peanuts character] and I found it hard to take this photojournalist seriously.  Professor Beatrice Hotchkiss: God, this woman was something else. I loved the HER comedy bit with the fifty chicken legs and probably would never had done most of  the chores she asked out of shock she would ever impose this on me.  I doubt I would have been so forthcoming with her as the ND did, because she was just as much a suspect as anyone else there.  Ned/Bess/George: The voice actors [Claire Gallagher & Maureen Nelson] sounded like they were reading scripts because half of the dialogue didn't flow naturally, but the written dialogue did make me laugh.  Lani Minella actually laughed in this one which is a rare event in ND games. You can check her talent out on a youtube video I recently found! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm1BGVfqWC0  CUMUL SCORE: - 1 = 87  SCORE/GRAPHICS/SOUND EFFECTS: The score was an excellent rendition of a classic, upscale French Society in the Age Of Reason.  It's light, lilting works trickled along amidst fine backings from harpsichords & strings.  The sound effects were adequate and the castle scenery was a solid job by the designers for the year it was made.  CUMUL SCORE: + 1 = 88  PUZZLES/MINI-GAMES: I didn't find many in the game except locker combinations, lever & slider puzzles, but it was okay for what the game provided. Uniqueness and mini games would come in later ND editions.  CUMUL SCORE: - 1 = 87  ADVENTURE ENDING: The way the culprit was caught was rather odd and unsatisfactory. I was confused on what exactly happened and scoffed at the simple and unexplainable way I had to catch them. Perhaps some French punishment should have been introduced :) instead. The climax in the Royal Tower was spectacular on a visual level and again you had to pay close attention to Nancy's notes regarding what happened to everyone in the conclusion.  BTW: How is Nancy able to bounce around the castle in a good mood after being knocked unconscious hours earlier? Seems rather ridiculous to me.  CUMUL SCORE: - 1 = 86  * PART 2 *  I try to solve cases without any hints, walkthroughs, etc, even if it were to take weeks! Well, it took me two days [7 hours] and I gave myself a Detective Score Of : 82  My Strong Points: I guessed the culprit and have been on quite a run lately [14 correct out of 21 games]. I seemed to assimilate into the plot pretty well without being fooled into believing any side story that would skew my detective work. The puzzles were simple to complete and I noticed that similar puzzles were placed in later games.  I was able to deduce that I had to start the ski lift in order to be saved from the cold weather!  My Weak Points: A walkthrough was used only a couple times just to check my game flow because HER had a sloppy time integrating the "incident trigger tree" properly.  In layman's terms, I completed tasks a couple hours ahead due to my prowess only to find out later that the character was still wondering how to do the SAME events just accomplished by asking other people!  OVERALL GAME SCORE: 86 + 82/ 2 = 84 [ B ]  BOTTOMLINE: I saw more written dialogue glitches [Bess [I believe] said "someting" instead of someTHING]. Overall, I learned only a bit more French history than I knew already, but for children, this is a fine starter education of European society.  I recommend it for that, but compared to the future games, it was rather simplistic.  Thus far, on my list of the 21 completed ND games, TREASURE ranks.... # 5 !!!!!  1) GHOST DOGS OF MOON LAKE * 88.5 2) THE SHATTERED MEDALLION * 87 3) GHOST OF THORNTON HALL * 86.5 4) HAUNTING CASTLE MALLOY * 85.5 5) TREASURE ROYAL TOWER  * 84 6) HAUNTED CAROUSEL  * 83 7) WHITE WOLF ICICLE CREEK * 82.5 8) DANGER DECEPTION ISLAND * 81 9) MESSAGE HAUNTED MANSION * 80 10) WARNINGS AT WAVERLY * 78 11) SHADOW AT WATER'S EDGE * 77.5 12) THE CAPTIVE CURSE * 77 13) SECRET SHADOW RANCH * 76 14) TRAIL OF THE TWISTER * 72 15) PHANTOM OF VENICE * 71.5 16) TOMB OF THE LOST QUEEN * 71 17) THE SILENT SPY * 70.5 18) CURSE BLACKMOOR MANOR * 70 19) ALIBI IN ASHES * 69.5 20) THE DEADLY DEVICE * 69 21) SECRETS CAN KILL [REMAST] * 68	1
I might be biased about this game because it was the first I ever played (and the first I ever finished -- since, when I started playing, I had all of the first five that I was flipping between, and six and seven came out very close on the heels of them, so I didn't actually finish any until a while after I'd received them).  However, biases aside, this game still holds as my all-time favorite. I will admit it isn't the best game in the series, but that's ok by me. It isn't extremely difficult, but it isn't overly easy. The characters are all interesting (and this game introduces my favorite ND character, Professor Hotchkiss). I love history, and this game is full of that. But the best part about it? The exploring. I will admit that the movements are a little bit limited, but this is only the fourth game. They hadn't yet refined things. However, in this game, every time you progress (almost) you get to unlock a new area in the game. There are so many places to go in this little castle, so many things to see.  This game gave me so much to imagine, so much to think on, and, now that I'm older, it gives me a ton of inspiration.  To anyone that hasn't played this game, I highly recommend it. If you've played other games but not this one, I'm completely shocked. You need to play this game NOW. And if you're looking for an introduction to the series, look no further. Treasure in a Royal Tower is a wonderful classic that I really hope will enthrall you as much as it has me these last ten years.	1
With certain recent games like WAC and SAW, it's evident that with each and every Nancy Drew PC release, the graphics and voice acting get better and better. But sometimes, no matter how good the graphics are, they usually can't hide an empty storyline and a game in need of many touch ups. This game is an example of a decent edition to the series, and even though it's not one of my favorites, it doesn't need "makeup" to make it shine.  Story: 8.5/10. This game has a decent story that holds together pretty well. Much of the game centers around centuries old history, much of it on Marie Antoinette. Although you ended up learning a few things, the story was still very inticing and it wasn't like they were shoving all of the information down your throat.  Graphics/Setting: 8/10. I'm not going to rate a lot of this game on graphics, mainly because the graphics of today are automatically compared to these graphics, and considering this game and the new games were released a decade apart, I think it's fair to somewhat disregard the graphics. I liked the setting, even though you stay in one place, and I like moving around more. But this castle was ginormous, and I had plenty of trouble just finding my room.  Characters: 8/10. The characters this time all have pretty stand-out personalities. You have Dexter Egan, the caretaker of the building, Professor Hotchkiss, a hilarious if not somewhat annoying author who can never get Nancy's name right, Lisa, a photojournalist, and Jacques Brunais, a french ski intructor. They all have a distinct personality, and are a great touch to the overall atmosphere.  Puzzles: 7.5/10. They're weren't that many puzzles, but the ones that were there were hard, but they fit the game.  Exploration: 9/10. Exploring is a big part of this game, and I got lost a lot. The castle is so big, and there's plenty for you to explore and have an adventure in.  Activities: 4/10. Activities weren't really evident in the older games, and they're weren't any here either.  Ending: 6.5/10. The ending was somewhat not surprising, and a pretty simple one too, yet it still gave me the goosebumps that good Nancy Drew PC endings give me. You people know what I mean.  Total (averaged): 7.3 out of 10, rounded to....  7.5/10.  As a diehard Nancy Drew PC fan, I did enjoy this game, and it deserves a spot on any fan's shelf.	1
With each passing Nancy Drew game, the games have gotten better. In the past three alone, they've gone from containing great plots with terrible gaming quality (Secrets Can Kill) to awesome plots with incredible gaming quality (Message in a Haunted Mansion). Treasure in the Royal Tower is no exception, and definitely the best Nancy Drew game to the date of its release.  Nancy is currently attempting to have some relaxing fun at a ski lodge called Wickford Castle in Butter Ridge, Wisconsin. Shortly after unpacking in her room, she goes downstairs to talk to the caretaker of the lodge. He informs her that Wickford's historic library has been vandalized, and is now off limits. Not only that, but another guest has reported a robbery in her room recently. Nancy decides to sneak around the castle to discover what's going on, only to discover that one of the towers at Wickford Castle was imported from France many years ago, and could hold a precious treasure that once belonged to Marie Antoinette herself. It's now up to Nancy to find this treasure before a would-be thief does...  This is probably the strongest plot to appear in a Nancy Drew game at the time of Treasure in the Royal Tower's release. I loved the setting, and the use of actual events and figures in history was an awesome idea. I learned quite a bit about Marie's character while playing the game, and reading some fictional documents that were written by her ("fictional" meaning they were fictional, but real in this fictional game) really made me curious as to what kind of woman and queen she truly was. The game itself isn't all that scary, but since the past three were, it's good to have one in which the scare factor was a little "toned down" (if they were all scary, then it'd get boring after awhile).  Like the previous game, this game does have a few chores that need to be done, but they're very well-integrated into the game and don't get in the way of sleuthing. Nancy actually spends the vast majority of the game sneaking into hidden passageways, questioning suspects, and looking through confidential areas.  While the graphics do show their age on occasion, they're absolutely phenomenal regardless. I was in awe of the beauty and detail of the castle at times. The explorable areas outside were also very nicely detailed, especially the beautiful garden (covered in snow at the time of Nancy's exploration). I won't say too much for the sake of spoiling this for those who have not played, but my favorite spot of all was the place in which Nancy finds what she and the culprit have been searching for. It was so beautifully detailed, and I could really feel all the awe that a real-life Nancy probably would have felt upon entering this hidden area.  The cast in this game was definitely stronger than the casts in the previous three (though the last one does follow very closely). The first suspect mentioned is Dexter Egan, Wickford Castle's elderly caretaker who seems to know more about the history surrounding the castle than he's admitting. He's currently trying to take care of all the issues going on singlehandedly while the owner is away on business, and believes that the culprit must be somebody else in the castle. Lisa Ostrum is a photojournalist who enjoys gossiping and being buddy-buddy with Nancy, and tells Nancy that she'd like to explore Marie's tower to find out more about the history hidden beyond the castle walls. Jacques Brunais is the handsome French ski instructor at the castle who's currently engaged to an American woman and seems to hold a very special passion for French history.  Professor Beatrice Hotchkiss is an eccentric woman who spends almost all of her time typing in her room, doing research and writing out what she calls her "theory" (she is also the guest who claims to have been robbed).  Like the last game, this game also should be praised for the perfect choice of the culprit in the end. All four of the characters had great motives, and all of them had enough evidence pointing toward them to make me suspect them at times. However, as the loose ends are gradually tied together and the story comes to an exciting end, only one particular suspect could logically be behind all of this. The culprit's character was fantastic, and he/she is definitely one of the cruelest villains that Nancy Drew has ever faced.  The game's musical score is very nicely done. Music heard while exploring the hallways was super catchy, and definitely added to the overall "castle" feel in the game (in the sense that it sounded very stereotypically "royal", for lack of better terms). The music occasionally got a little scarier while Nancy was exploring dark passageways or in the face of danger which could cost her life if she isn't fast enough to find a way out. There wasn't a track out of place, if you ask me.  While the previous game is a close runner-up, "Treasure in the Royal Tower" was definitely the best Nancy Drew game at the time of its release. Some would even say that it's still the best to date, and it remains in the top three as of the release of the Collector's Edition Fan Favorites packaging (along with "The Secret of Shadow Ranch" and "Curse of Blackmoor Manor". Between the rich sense of history, awesome casting, wonderfully detailed settings, and great soundtrack, this surely remains one of Nan's most memorable cases to date. Love it or hate it, you won't forget it.	1
I was at the store when I saw this game on sale for really cheap, so I thought "Hey, why not get it?". I'd seen really good reviews for this game, but I was still kind of apprehensive because it's such an old game, I thought the graphics would be really horrible. But I was surprised at what a quality game it is! I'm going to split my review up into different sections so I can give the game a more accurate rating.  PLOT - 4.5/5: Nancy's ski vacation is cut short when a blizzard keeps her stuck in the Wisconsin castle she's staying at. Apparently in the 1920's, some guy who really loved French castles decided to build one in Wisconsin, and even imported a tower from Marie Antoinette's castle to be added on to his. Nancy learns that Marie Antoinette was rumored to have left a treasure somewhere in the castle, so it's up to her to find the treasure before someone else tears the castle apart trying to find it. I thought this was a really good plot, and everything else into the story tied into it nicely. I only wish it had been longer, it was a little shorter than I had hoped. But overall, I was impressed!  CHARACTERS - 3.5/5: The characters include the castle's caretaker, Dexter, who is very defensive and has a dark past, and Jacques, a famous French skier who was actually really fun to listen to. The hotel's guests were Professor Hotchkiss, an eccentric old woman who studies French history, and Lisa, a photojournalist. Each of the characters had their own personalities and motives, which was good. The voice acting was good, too. My only problem was that the culprit was really obvious, like 20 minutes into the mystery I could tell who it was. That really bothered me, so I'm going to have to knock off a couple of points for it.  SETTING - 5/5: I loved the castle!! It was huge, I got lost plenty of times just trying to find my hotel room, haha. But there was tons to explore. Plus I was surprised how good the graphics were. I thought they might be kind of shabby because it's an older game, but I was way off. And the music was really nice, some of the best music I've heard in a Nancy Drew game.  PUZZLES - 3/5: I felt there was a serious lack of puzzles in this game. Maybe this came out before Her Interactive got the idea of putting in "filler puzzles" to make the games longer. It was kind of nice not having to do a puzzle every second, but I do want to have SOME puzzles. There were probably less than a handfull of puzzles in the whole game, wich must have been why it was so short.  IS IT CHALLENGING?: No. Like I said before theres only a few puzzles, and everything else is pretty easy. I'd give it a 2 for challenge.  ENDING - 5/5: The ending was good. It made perfect sense with the rest of the plot. The culprit isn't a surprise, but catching them was fun.  FINAL SCORE: Plot: 4.5 Characters: 3.5 Setting: 5 Puzzles: 3 Challenge: 2 Ending: 5 = 23 divided by 6 = 3.8 rounded to 4.	1
This was, personally, the first Nancy Drew game that I ever played, and because of it, I am now hooked on the series and buy each new one that comes out.  I am very happy that this was my first game, as it is not only, in my opinion, one of the best games in the Nancy Drew adventure game series, but it is also the perfect mix of mystery and intrigue.  Story-You are on a ski vacation in Wisconsin when you get snowed in at the castle/resort in which you are staying.  You find out that the castle library has been vandalized, and you set out to find out who destroyed the beautiful library and why.  As you make your way through the game, you will also find that the story has quite a bit to do with the history of Marie Antoinette.  Graphics-The graphics are improved from the earlier three games, as the 3D backgrounds have a bit more detail.  Also, the characters have been developed to move a bit more smoothly.  Sound-The music in the game is very regal and pleasant to listen to.  The background sounds are also well done as they sound realistic.  As for the voice acting, this game has some actors/actresses that sound really good and interesting.  Gameplay-First of all, like the games before it in the series, this is a first person point-and-click adventure game.  Although there is only one main location to explore (the castle) it is a very large location filled with many rooms to explore and many puzzles to solve.  The puzzles range from easy to hard, but they are all solvable without any need of a walkthrough.  The hint system is there for you, if you need it though, which basically consists of calling your friends on the phone to ask for a hint.  There are also four characters that you can interact with and interrogate, and they each have a unique and interesting personality.  Length-This is definitely a game with some meat to it length-wise.  It will take you several hours to finish it, and hopefully, you will have fun with every second of it.  If you're looking for an intriguing adventure game with fun puzzles and a great story, then this is the perfect game for you!	1
Imagine this: you're snowbound in a fancy Wiconsin hotel where you're supposed to be on a ski vacation. The manager just told you someone vandalized the historic library... and you're one of the only four people who made it to the hotel! There's Lisa Ostrum, the journalist who seems a bit too eager to become your friend, Jacque Brunais, a ski instructor from France who just lost the Olympics and is convinced something in the hotel will restore his name, Professor Hotchkiss, an old French teacher who is convinced that Marie Antoinette was a good-hearted person and is destined to prove it, and Mr. Egan the hotel manager who apparently has a criminal record and ties to this hotel. Now you feel it's up to you, as Nancy Drew, to question suspects and unveil a new page in French history.  Out of the so far 13 Nancy Drew games, this one is one of my all-time favorites because the story is so good! This game was pratically flawless! You never got stuck on what to do, but you never breezed through it either! It requires just the right amount of skill, thought, and fun to crack this case. Way to go HerInteractive!	1
This was one of my favorite Nancy Drew games (and I only have 2 favorites)! This one wasn't extremely hard but that's kind of good because then it doesn't frustrate you. This one was relatively easy and it was very interesting learning about Marie Antoinette (not sure if I spelled that right). You also get to stay in a castle. All the features of these Nancy Drew games are remarkable. You can talk to characters and explore many different rooms. You have to come up with several ways to get something you want or need. It's very fun and it has great graphics. You should definitely buy THIS game if you're going to buy one at all (which I suggest you do).	1
Product was what I wanted, I did not need software with all the updates included, and the price was fair.  Delivery was prompt from supplier.	1
Beware my friends of old (Xp Professional 2002 oem) copies with fake product keys  being sold on Amazon. By the likes of PBJWorld. He lied and claim it was unopened.  The key was made by a key generator. They want me to return it to the guy who sold it to me. Mircosoft now has the case. I gave them what they needed to go forward. He want me to return it , to make it disappear, I would guess this to be so . By the way, he refuses to deal with me. Shame on Amazon too, for letting this guy sell bogus software. Buy for only those you know. Amazon will not back you UP! I for one will not ever shop on Amazon again. Burned by this. Never NEVER AGAIN . They lost me as a customer. Amazon make false statements that they care . They do not . I have told the truth. Pbjworld sold me a copy of Xp Professional that was not what they claimed . It had been opened, used and packaged with a fake key . Beware buyers of this site. Trust only those you know and no site that gets 5 stars from most buyers . No one's that perfect .  Amazon customer service sucks .There is no real support .	-1
A little slower, a little more buggy and unstable, I'm surprised it's still sold when newer versions of the operating system are available.	-1
My computer at work has windows XP installed on it, and just from navigating around it I am so glad, that I did not waste my money installing it on my home PC. The only good thing about this OS is that its "pretty".  It LOOKS a lot better than windows 2000 and other previous versions, and also it seems to load a lot faster than windows 2000. Which warrants my 2 star rating. The new set up in Windows XP is very cumbersome and sometimes downright confusing.  For those of us that are familiar with Win 2K you will find that many things are not in places where we are used to them being.  This is a small problem and im sure that I will become comfortable with it.  My main gripe is the constant application lock ups in this OS for no apparant reason.  For example if you happen to mistype a URL in Internet Explorer, then be prepared to have IE lock up for at least 45 seconds before windows decides to allow you to control IE again.  Same goes true for Outlook.  Sometimes Outlook will just lock up for no reason and either you have to wait it out, or just do a control-ALT-Delete to end the task which is believe it or not a lot quicker than waiting on windows.  Keep in mind my inbox only has 20 messages since I just started my job Monday.  Yet it still locks up and crashes for no reason.  To add fuel to the fire sometimes applications will just terminate with fatal errors and come up with a message box stating "sorry for the inconvience" and an option to send the error report to microsoft. HA!  It looks like Microsoft expected this OS to have a lot of problems (and that it does) and are using the customers to find all their bugs for them.  I wouldn't mind doing this for a pay check, but for free?  I don't think so. I've only used XP for 4 days and already having a multitude of problems with constant lock ups and crashes.  I haven't had the oppurtunity to do software installations on this OS, and frankly I don't want to, im sure that is also littered with bugs.  As much as I hated windows ME, I think I am beginning to hate XP even more. If you have 2000, then stick with it, don't waste your money on XP.	-1
Windows XP Pro is a very good to use and stable operating system providing it's installed onto a good quality machine. Less than a P4 2GHz and 512 MB of RAM isn't going to really work out. Stick to Windows 2000 Pro, SP4 for anything less. The go back to a previous date feature is tremendously useful for when something goes wrong, but I could do without the snoop-doggy-dog in the file search section. Looks a bit unprofessional to me. It's also good to be able to use the familiar Windows themes instead of the XP ones, if you want to. Users of the latest graphics cards and Adobe multimedia applications will have to upgrade to XP to have the required system support, or even get an installation to proceed. Be sure to check this before buying anything current. Avid DV Express, etc, is also only XP compatible. Any hardware such as printers, scanners, modems, etc install very easily. An anti-virus and firewall are essential additions, Sophos and Kerio Personal Firewall work well for me. Also be sure to never be on the web in Administrator mode. Instead, set yourself up as a user with Power User attributes.  A Restricted User profile is also available, but if you have Screenwriter 2000, or other Screenplay products installed, they may not launch or function properly. XP Pro will give a great deal of satisfaction. XP-Home is much less expensive, but is little better than Win 98.	1
I installed XP Pro a couple weeks ago on a new machine I just built. Installed like a dream. It runs a smooth as can be and the ability it has with photos and video is amazing. I still use my other 2 1/2 year old computer running ME for things. But I know I will be upgrading that on to XP Home. But will do a clean install. that is the best way to go. Running anything other then XP on this new one would have been a waste of my money. P4 2.6Ghz. H/T tech. 1 Gb dual channel ram. 2 Western Digital 120 Gb HDD. DVD rom drive and soon a new DVD burner. I now have a DSL connection. Setting that up took minutes on this machine. On the other machine hooking up a new v. 92 56k modem last year under ME took 2 days to get things working right. My son and his friend both upgraded to XP home last year. Both did a clean install. Both machines are much more stable now. I've had my ME machine freeze as many as 5 times in a day. Always got it up and running again but it was still a pain. I stay up will all updates and maintanance and it would still give me grief. If your running ME make the move to XP.	1
For the first time in many years I have been pleased with a Microsoft Windows family OS.  When Windows XP came out I obtained what I was really expecting, a very solid, stable and enhanceable system. Windows XP is based on the Windows 2000 code base with several major multimedia, administrative tools and security enhancements among other things. This is really the closest you can get to a truly standard OS for all types of users, except system administators obviously.  We are getting closer to not having different Windows flavors running around anymore. The acceptance of this OS will gradually relieve developers from having to design multi-platform applications, a major headache in the past.  As of this writing, Windows 95 has almost been phased out, and almost every piece of software is written for Windows XP (Home and Professional) I've tested this OS on my personal laptop (Thinkpad T-21) and several Pentium family desktops (P-III 750Mhz and P-IV 2.4Ghz) with many different software and hardware combinations without major issues.  Software drivers are becoming quickly available for all types of hardware.  In terms of software applications, I had to wait a bit longer for a few applications to become XP compatible. As with any OS, the compatibility issues were higher when the OS was released, but now you will not find as many, unless you still own very old pieces of hardware and software.  This is in my opinion the primary factor when deciding wether to upgrade or to stay where you are. I will not get into the features of the OS, as they are very well described by Amazon and other reviewers, what I can tell you is what I consider the major highlights of this OS: * Great multimedia features - MovieMaker, Media Player.  Windows Explorer has also been expanded with options to manage digital media such as pictures and music.  Multimedia devices are installed and configured easier than ever * CD Burning options built in - Creating a music or data CD is as easy as drag and drop.  It may not be the most efficient burning system, but its a good place to start * Administrative Tools - The Disk administrator, along with the disk defragmenter are two enhanced tools that I rely on with XP * Windows Update - Microsoft has been updating the OS frequently with many security fixes and tools updates and enhancements. You can set up XP to update your system periodically * Networking - Setting up a network is much easier now.  A firewall is also built in as part of the network security features new in XP * System Help - The help tool has been enhanced to search not only locally on the PC but through the Internet as well.  General Help Topics are very detailed and descriptive with many illustrations.  Great improvement here. * Wizards - Many more settings are performed with wizards.  Is like filling an electronic questionnaire, then XP takes over the rest of the configuration steps based on your answers. And simply the looks.  Icons are more colorful, and they take  advantage of higher end video cards with more color options.  You can select display settings to look like the old Windows or the new XP look. In terms of performance, I admit that Windows by design, does not consider low end machines and it may seem slow on low RAM machines.  I would definitely recommend having more than 256MB of RAM and a high end Pentium processor (P3 and up) for acceptable performance.  Fortunately, there are options to tweak performance settings by eliminating the sometimes unnecessary display effects. I think at this time, you may be assured that Windows XP will be the best choice for you.  Don't hesitate to buy it, taking into consideration the points I mentioned above. Recommended	1
If you have Windows ME, you will want to upgrade (ME being one of the most annoying operating systems ever from Microsoft.) But what about upgrading if you have Windows 2000, which is relatively stable and a very good OS, overall? Windows XP DOES boot faster. I counted it off, and if you keep your desktop reasonable clear of icons, it boots in about 10 seconds, at least on my 900MHz PC. I have not yet had to reboot my system due to an inexplicable hang-up (something that happened from time to time with ME.) I also run this on a laptop (Toshiba Satellite) and the power management feature for dimming the screen and managing the battery is welcome, as the Toshiba battery uptime is a bit limited. All in all, I am quite pleased with XP. Why the Pro version and not the home version, which is the one that usually comes with new PC's right now? I've heard that a lot of new software applications are being developed on and for Professional Version and not the Home Version.	1
I have used every Windows version since Windows v1. This is the best version, yet. I got the Professional version of XP because I wanted Remote Desktop, more access-rights configurability and NTFS (you can manually do it on Home). I have been very pleased with this. It is much more stable than 98SE, 98 or 95. It is more stable than my 2000 as well. It actually is considered a 2000 upgrate -- from 5.0 to 5.1 -- but the feature changes are more dramatic and should warrant a 5.5 or 6.0. It is finally multi-user (not multi-account like 2000), so all users can stay logged on with applications running. That being said, to use that functionality, you definitely want to heed the "minimum requirements".	1
This edition of Windows XP is primarily business oriented, but there are certain features that would be useful in the Home Edition of Windows XP. Example of this would be remote desktop, an amazing feature that allows you to actually control your computer from another computer running Windows XP Pro. Why I do not recommend it for most home users is the architecture of the operating system itself. Certain features such as Administrative tools (turned on by default in XP Pro) would not be recommended for a family PC, if you have a child and he or she enters the Administrative tools and alters any component of the services feature, it can totally ruin your PC. In terms of general functionality Windows XP is "awesome", features worthy of this word include multiple users, beautiful graphical user interface, and easier access to programs. The "start menu", in previous Windows it was like you had to climb a mountain before you reached the programs menu, now that's not ease of use! In Windows XP just click the "start menu" and you are right at the program menu, now that's ease of use! When it comes in comparison to previous versions of Windows such as 95, 98, NT, "ME" and even 2000, it's really worth the upgrade. Windows 95 to ME crashed tremendously NT was horrible on laptops and its basically kind of outdated now, 2000 does not support enough drivers. But overall for the person who travels a lot and needs to either retrieve information from their home or business computer, Windows XP Pro is very good. For performance, I recommend a 500 MHz processor, 128 MB's of memory, anything lower than that you won't be installing much software on that machine. Remember Windows XP requires a lot of resources, in terms of processor speed and memory. If you want to take advantage of some of the features in XP, I suggest that you have a CD burner, you get more out of XP. My pictures has been totally redesigned for integration with online services, you take pictures and upload them to websites for editing e.g. "KODAK". It's not a terrible operating system like I have read in most reviews, but the architecture of the operating system is more business oriented. For users of previous versions of Windows I recommend you buy the Upgrade instead of the full version of Windows XP rather than spend hard earned money buying the full version, because your getting the same thing. If you used 98, ME and want reliability, stability, and ease of use, go for the Home Edition. Persons using NT and 2000 I suggest they upgrade to XP Pro. I like Windows XP Pro a lot; it's better than the Home Edition in minor features. I'm going to buy it soon but for now I'm going to stick with Windows XP Home. It all depends on the user and the environment, as simple as that.	1
Microsoft Windows XP, is the greatest release of Windows yet. This version features a new interface (can be changed easily) and a new set of features... NT/2000 users will now also have at their fingertips the multimedia/gaming features that were great in 9.x/ME and 9.x/ME users will now have the power to harnass the stability of the NT Kernel. The advantage of the Professional version lies in laptops, businesses, and anyone who considers themself a "power user". In the professional version we have enhanced tools for system administrator and advanced networking tools. The only drawback is that some of your DOS based programs and drivers may not work under XP due to its true 32-bit coding. This is a problem with any major upgrade and for the most part can be fixed by updating your version via Microsofts website. Would highly recommend an upgrade to XP for all users... average home users should check out the cheaper Windows XP Home Edition.	1
I may be going out on a limb here, but Windows XP is the most important upgrade to the Windows operating system since Windows 95. In addition to a new look, it offers stability, ease of use and more Internet integration than ever before. Installation was easy. You can either upgrade your existing Windows or do a clean install. I recommend a clean install so be sure to back up your important data (e-mail, accounting programs, etc.) You can boot from the CD and it will pretty much to the rest. Installation takes about 30-60 minutes but it was VERY easy. XP really knows what plug and play means. ALL, and I mean ALL of my peripherals were found and configured automatically. Once installed, you will be prompted to activate. This was an easy and fast process. The next thing it will do is set up your Internet access. Once this is done, you are now ready to go. You will notice right away that the interface is different and very colorful. It may take a little while to get used to but once you do, you will like it. You also have an option of a "classic" Windows 9x view. Windows XP makes a lot of functions very easy. First of all, depending on your BIOS and motherboard, you can tell Windows just what to do when you press your power button. It also has built in CD burning capability, however, to delete a file from a CD-RW, you must erase the CD and then put back the files you want. A little inconvenient but a lot more stable than DirectCD. It is VERY easy to set up individual users. You can set up a personalized account for each member of the family. Also, when installing many programs, it will detect XP and ask if you want certain people to access the program. This is very nice and secure. And with Internet Explorer 6.0, you can now choose the level of cookie protection. You will be amazed on how many third party "usage tracking" cookies that are placed on your PC. Backward compatibly is very good to excellent with XP. XP ran all of my older windows based programs and MOST of my DOS games. A few DOS games worked about 80% and some not at all. I am sure that "DOS EMULATORS" will be available for purchase in the near future. Windows XP seemed designed for Internet integration. Just about every major function in XP has a tie to the Internet. And because of this, Microsoft has included a built in Firewall. It is good, but I would recommend Norton Internet Security 2002. For those of you who are worried about compatibility, Windows XP makes it pretty easy to set up a dual boot. All you need is a partition created before installing. After that, Windows does the rest. For those who want security, go with Windows XP Professional. Everyone else can get by with Windows XP Home. If you have a previous copy of Windows, get the UPGRADE version. It will search for a previous install or ask you for the original Windows 9.x/2000 disk to verify. There is a lot more I can say about Windows XP but you just need to see it for yourself. If you want stability, awesome Internet integration and overall easy of use, you must get this upgrade.	1
This review is based on release candidate 2 (RC2). Can I say anything but Kudos? The new interface is intuitive to the max. It's a big step above former versions of Windows and even a cut above Macs. Stability is, well, I can't get it to crash. Compatibility is phenomenal. DOS, Win 3.1 and Win9x programs run without a problem (remember, this is based on the NT file system and kernel, not the DOS-based file system and kernel). This is what Windows was meant to be when version 1.0 came out. OK, it took 9 years to get it to this level but, now that it's where it's meant to be, there is no reason not to get it if your computer will run it. Most people will be satisfied with the home version. If you have a business or are a real computer geek, then you may want the Pro version. Installation is a snap (takes about an hour) and, if you decide that it's not for you, it uninstalls easily. For me there's no going back. I think that you'll feel the same way once you try it.	1
Generally speaking, to get the best performance from any operating system a clean install of a full version is recommended. The best choice is to choose a full version of the product and enjoy the benefits of not being left with artifacts and leftover's of your previous operating system which can lead to instability in certain cases. I would only buy this on a limited budget.	-1
Windows XP Pro is quite arguably the most reliable operating system that Microsoft has come out with yet. Additionally it comes with the option of converting it to a Windows 98SE desktop appearance, for those who don't want to fuss with learning new instructions to get the old things done. It does so much more though.   One note of caution; do not install XP in an older machine, with older hardware. Your sound card vendor may have stopped making software drivers a long time ago for your now discontinued device. The problem is that they do not want to spend the resources to create drivers for a product that they no longer make. So if you have an old video card, audio card, modem, etc, it quite possibly won't work with XP. If you try to install XP you will get all kinds of incompatible error messages. So do yourself a favor and put old wine into old bottles, and new wine into new ones; consider getting a newer machine if you are going to upgrade to XP. You might wind up spending close to the same amount of money upgrading your components to make it work, as you would to just simply buy a new one. Check with all of your hardware manufacturers to see if they produced XP drivers for your existing hardware. Hope this helps.	1
Windows XP has been the best OS from Microsoft yet.  It is not perfect, but it does not crash very often.  I'm running XP on 3 computers that are networked.  My laptops came with XP, but my desk top came with Windows 98, which was not very stable (it crashed daily).  I tried using ME, but that was the worst operating system ever.  Upgrading my older Compaq 667MH Celeron was very easy with XP.  I downloaded a XP compatibility checker before installing XP to see what software and drivers were compatable.  Downloaded the required updates and Windows XP installed very easy.  XP is very easy when it comes to upgrading and installing new hardware. I highly recommend a clean installation when upgrading.  Saves a lot of headaches.  Also beware that a lot of software that you use with 95,98,and ME are not compatible with XP.  I also recommend having atleast 256MB RAM. The reason I will not give Microsoft XP 5 Stars is that MS does not allow installation on more than one computer and having to activate the product.  I'm buying the software to use as I need, not as Microsoft wants me to use it.  That's like purchasing a Music CD and having to get a activation code and only being allowed to play on your home CD player.  Are you listening MR. Gates????????????????????????????	1
Kind of like driving a Ford Fairmont.  It'll get you there, but that's about it, with a very good chance of crapping out on the side of the road.  Plus, you get to proclaim that you've got the taste of a herd animal. Fun!	-1
I did my 100th upgrade to Windows XP Pro today, for a new client.  All 100 installations went smoothly without a hitch, and the 60+ that have been running for over 2 months have been running rock solid.  If you are coming from Windows 2000 Professional, expect a slight speed increase (assuming you have at least 256MB of RAM) and better stability.  None of the installations I have done, ranging from single desktop workstation to servers to WiFi-enabled laptops, has experienced any crash.  [Of course, the fact that I'm paid to do a good job must have something to do with it. ;) ] The upgrade price is a bit too steep if you are already running Windows 2000.  If you have Windows 95, 98 or ME, then you should probably opt for Windows XP Home edition, which is considerably less expensive and just as speedy and stable as the professional edition... and will make your PC computing life so much more enjoyable. Highly recommended.	1

Perhaps I've become so jaded that all Windows systems now look the same. I'm ashamed to say just what was the first version of Windows I used but I will go on record stating that I have owned Windows 95, 98, ME and now XP. As it is an Upgrade, I suppose that's why there is no significant difference once I get going.  On the plus side however, there is a big improvement on starting up.  It loads almost immediately.  Negatives?  Well, what you gain in booting up, you lose in logging off.  It is the slowest process yet!  And XP did not find either my PALM Pilot or my Iomega Zip drive although both have been attached to the computer since Windows 98. Is it different?  No.  It looks, feels and acts the same.  Is it better?  Well, it seems to me that Windows ME managed to get the crash bugs out of it so here's hoping that this version is just as reliable.  But I wouldn't have noted this as a major improvement over previous versions so, if you're happy with 98, 2000 or ME, don't expect this to be the Promised Land.	1
If your running Win98 or Win ME I would recommend the upgrade to XP. If you just use your PC for everyday email, word processing etc. then you can save money and go with XP Home Edition. However, if you are use to NT or Windows 2000 I would recommend XP Professional for the added administrative features. I've been using XP since RC1 and it has been rock solid. For a home pc it is the operating system of choice. For business users you can stay with Windows 2000 and do just fine as XP is just a more user friendly version of 2000. The XP interface is cleaner but offers nothing special. It takes a little while to find all your favorite old setup features as they are kind of hidden in different areas. Unless your planning on purchasing a new PC I would recommend picking up XP, as long as your current PC has at least 128 megs of RAM.	1
This review is based on release candidate 2 (RC2). Can I say anything but Kudos? The new interface is intuitive to the max. It's a big step above former versions of Windows and even a cut above Macs. Stability is, well, I can't get it to crash. Compatibility is phenomenal. DOS, Win 3.1 and Win9x programs run without a problem (remember, this is based on the NT file system and kernel, not the DOS-based file system and kernel). This is what Windows was meant to be when version 1.0 came out. OK, it took 9 years to get it to this level but, now that it's where it's meant to be, there is no reason not to get it if your computer will run it. Most people will be satisfied with the home version. If you have a business or are a real computer geek, then you may want the Pro version. Installation is a snap (takes about an hour) and, if you decide that it's not for you, it uninstalls easily. For me there's no going back. I think that you'll feel the same way once you try it.	1
WORK FOR WHAT I NEEDED WHICH WAS FOR GAMES ONLY!! OLD COMPUTERS CAN STILL DO THIS!! MY COUSIN USES IT A LOT!!	1
In its early years, this operating system was one of the most unsatisfactory I have ever used --- including DOS, Win 3.1, Windows 95 and Windows 98.  Aside from being incompatible with older hardware, XP Home Edition crashed frequently --- especially if you often work with several windows open at once as I do. This was particularly unhelpful. As a writer, I was forced to save documents no less than once for each new sentence, and at touchy moments, literally every few words.  Most important, the program is highly susceptible to viruses and hackers. Preventing these two problems requires expensive add-on software and hardware.  True enough, the built-in firewall OUGHT to work. But in my case, hackers got in anyway -- four times in six months. With this software, I suffered repeated break ins, the last of which cost me some primary data and several of my original poems. Even installing service pack 2 did not help.  After the last go-round, I was forced to hire an expensive data recovery guru --- another story in itself --- but was still unable to recover everything lost.  Throughout this six-month nightmare, I repeatedly reinstalled the XP program, including, more than once, service pack 2. That, however, didn't plug the security leaks. My computer was completely compromised. In the end, I had to junk the machine all together.  In my experience, Mac and Linux operating systems are both far superior.  Now I've got one Windows machine --- a laptop purchased in early 2007 at or around the release of Service Pack 3 --- to run a BioFeedback program whose authors, unfortunately, had not created a Linux version.  Admittedly, Microsoft's final XP service pack seems to have plugged XP's most serious security holes. Still, after my dreadful experience with XP Home Edition, I forever swore off Windows as my primary operating system. Microsoft operating systems remain magnets for viruses and hackers --- to say nothing of endless bugs and technical issues --- and eons of otherwise unnecessary computer security checks and maintenance.	-1
I recently upgraded form Windows 98 to XP on my home PC.  I use Windows 2000 at work and I have to say that XP is by far the best choice for the home PC.  I did the XP Upgrade and I must say that is was extremely easy to convert my 98 system to XP.  I takes A L-O-N-G time to do the install (a single cd, yet prepare to spend about 2 hours once you hit "go"). MOST IMPORTANT THING TO REMEMBER.... If you do nothing else to prepare for the upgrade; take the time to run the hardware & software compatibility check before you commit yourself to the install.  This is most critical & here's a good example.  The driver for my PC's modem/chipset was incompatible with XP.  This was highlighted when I ran the test and it allowed me to retrieve the updated driver before launching the upgrade.  If I had not done this, then I would have been toast.  After the upgrade I would not have been able to use my modem to access the internet to get the new driver after the fact.  So do yourself a favor, run the test, print it out, get all your patches beforehand & you'll save yourself a ton of frustration and wasted time. Other than that it's great and very easy to load.  They did a great job with the user interface and instructions.  It was a no brainer to install.  Just remeber to read everything first, run the compatibility test, print out the important stuff (it even tells you what the important stuff is!) and get your patches before you hit "go". Now go & dump your 5 year old OS and get up to date.	1
Windows XP really is the best windows operating system to date.  It is not perfect by any means, but it works the way it's supposed to almost all the time.  If you're thinking about using this upgrade version, let me warn you of two things:  (1) You need to check all of your software to see if it's compatible with XP (there is a checking-program on this disc, but you can also download it from Microsoft's website to see which software you have is not compatible).  Even after I checked compatibility, some programs I had were non-functioning after the upgrade and some I had to install again.  (2) Download the most recent drivers for all your hardware to avoid problems.  I didn't do this and when I upgraded, I lost my sound card drivers because they weren't compatible with XP and the XP disc didn't have the new drivers I needed to make my sound card work, so I had to find my sound card manufacturer's website and download an XP compatible driver. You are really better off waiting until you buy a new computer to get XP.  But, if you just can't wait and want to do this upgrade, make sure you do your homework to avoid some headaches during and after installation.  It almost sounds like I'm slamming this upgrade release, I'm not - I absolutely love Windows XP - but the upgrade version does require some extra effort on your part, especially if your computer is older than a year or more.	1
I just read through many of the reviews that claim XP doesn't crash and is rock solid reliable.  I did this after having just experienced my 2nd crash today.  Well, I'm stumped because, while XP performs marvelously for routine, (read: light) usage, I get 9X'ish crashes when I throw some serious processing at it.  The new "BSOD", or blue screen of death, is now more of a "grey hiccup of aggravation".  After a crash, a little grey box pops up and says "you have chosen to end a non-responsive program.  Would you like to send an error report to MS?"  I must see this box 2-3 times a day, no kidding.  When it really has a processor brain-freeze, it just completely reboots, w/o warning.  These things are a normal occurrence for me. This is on a clean install, up-to-date system.  I've seen it with other systems as well.  Many of my friends hate XP for this reason, but I've learned to live with it, just as I did with all its predecessors.  Other than that, I really like a lot of the other features, and pretty much all the new toys and MS add-ins are XP-only, so it's worth the upgrade, (if nothing else), to avoid becoming obsolete.  It just gets my goat that many people are constantly touting how stable it is, and I routinely see otherwise.  Stability is OK, but not as reliable as many would have you believe.	-1
I was using Windows 98SE and overall was happy with it.  While I experienced some lockups and freezing, it didn't happen that often.  What prompted me to switch to XP was a desire for better memory management (Windows 98 doesn't do a very good job), more stability even though Win98 wasn't bad for me, and an overall change of scenery.  So finally I made the plunge, doing a clean install instead of trying to upgrade over 98. The Upgrade Advisor that you can download from Microsoft.com was very useful.  Luckily everything except my NEC printer was compatible with XP.  Next, the Transfer Settings and Files Wizard that comes on the XP disk also came in handy.  It gathers all your settings and/or files from the "old computer," saves them in a file (or transfers them directly - you have various options) which you can then put on the new computer.  I wound up transferring only settings using the wizard.  Originally I told it to transfer files too, but it copied too many things that were unnecessary and the result was way too big to fit on a cd.  I would advise copying your documents and other important files manually but letting XP transfer your settings.  That way you can be more selective about what gets transferred (assuming you are doing a clean install). Installation of XP went very smoothly.  It identified all my hardware, and I was able to reinstall my software with no problems.  Using the Transfer Wizard to move the settings to the new installation worked fine and was a real time saver - it moved all of my internet and e-mail settings and messages over with ease.  All user input was very clearly explained and the process overall was quite simple. Using XP: There's a lot I still have to learn, but so far the system has been stable and I notice memory is managed much better than under 98.  It loads faster and while the much more colorful layout took some getting used to, now it seems like 98 is in black and white by comparison.  I also use the "clear type" option for fonts and find that they are easier to read than under a "normal" display (it seems to me that the main difference is that clear type makes it darker and bolder). I'm glad I made the switch.  I've read some complaints about installation experiences and also the strict registration requirements but my experience so far has been all positive (knock on wood, of course!).  It seems like the Microsoft engineers really gave this a lot of thought and put it into action.	1
For the average web surfer XP is a big step up from WinME.  If you just wanna surf the net, use Office applications, and do basic things, XP is the only upgrade to consider from Win95 or Win98.  XP Home (like Win ME) still lacks basic functionality if you want to do database to website connectivity that was present in 95 and 98.  For that you have to go to XP Pro.  You can work around it in XP Home, but shouldn't have to.  Salespeople don't seem to know this, so tread carefully when buying an OS if you are looking for this functionality. An upgrade to XP may send you on a time consuming, frustrating, chase to upgrade your hardware drivers and software programs.  You may find that you have to shell out $$$ just to keep the same programs working before and after the upgrade.  I bought a system from Gateway, which came with an upgrade to XP.  With the upgrade installed, the CD creator software that came with the machine doesn't work and an upgrade is almost $100.00.  There are other things like a relatively new scanner that still does not work yet. The interface is different from previous versions, and makes you feel like you are in the middle of Super Mario Land. XP Home is more stable than previous versions, but it may require a bigger $$$ outlay for other things to keep it all working. Bottom line in this case was another $200.00 spent on XP PRO to get what I needed.  Anyone want to play Monopoly?	-1
XP is good, but can get better.  It doesn't crash, it just freezes and them comes up with a sign that says, let Microsoft know the problem and automatically sends a message to someone in cyberspace.  Can you imagine millions of such messages a day hitting Renton, Washington?  Forget it.  They can do better and probably will.	1
I recently upgraded to Windows XP from Windows 98 Second Edition, and I have been THOROUGHLY impressed!  With Windows 98 I experienced frequent blue screens and crashes.  With Windows XP all of those problems are now history.  Also, many of the drivers I needed to load AFTER loading Windows 98 are now already included.  My video card drivers were loaded, my CD burner functions were all present, and my scanner worked flawlessly without installing any additional software. The biggest hurdle with this product is successful installation.  If you have older components you may have significant problems getting them to function with the new OS.  Some older apps are also likely to have difficulty.  My hardware and my software are all fairly current, so I had no trouble. I have upgraded my newer computer at home with Windows XP, but the older computer at my church study has Windows 98, and will have it for some time.  I am reluctant to upgrade because of the installation problems inevitable with the older components. This product is definitely worth the price, but some persons may need to upgrade components BEFORE upgrading their OS. If you have a newer or brand new computer and are seeking the smoothest, steadiest and most solid OS, I HIGHLY recommend Windows XP.	1
Windows XP home is a operating system from Microsoft that finally defines stability and ease of use into one. If you are thinking about upgrading from Windows 98, go straight ahead, if you are still using Windows ME, please immediately upgrade. This operating is very easy to use with a redesigned start menu that provides easier access to programs and accessories. More stable because it is built upon the Windows NT kernel so it won't crash but your applications will software apps weren't built on NT, only the Operating System, so you can't get everything perfect! But this operating system is really worth the buy you won't regret it trust me. With soft edged Windows and rich icon pictorials this operating system really makes digital media a lot of fun. Plus the multi-user settings in Windows XP makes it a good purchase, so everyone in the family can have their own settings without interupting other peoples files and  personal settings. People have been asking Microsoft for years to merge both the ease of from 98 and the stability of NT, now they have it, why not take it. And their just too many features to talk about here! Trust me you won't regret it.	1
It is absolutely remarkable the cheers that a seemingly reliable computer operating system can produce.  It's as if we were led to believe for years that even a modicum of stability and interoperability were too much to ask for.  And we were.  The government needs no better proof of why a monopoly is bad for consumers than to add up all the crashes, incompatibilities, and lousy performance results that Windows has chocked up over the past twenty years.  Pathetic.  Those in the know will tell you that Windows has kept a cottage industry of computer technicians and troubleshooters gainfully (and lucratively) employed; to them, it has been the goose that laid the golden egg.  A big, fat egg. Now we have XP.  It's only been out a short time, but it seems to be far more stable than its predecessors.  It's about time.  It still crashes from time to time and gets buggy when you try to "plug and play" various peripherals, but those problems haven't led to system meltdown yet.  Thankfully.  But we should have had an operating system like this from Microsoft years and years ago.  There is nothing technologically innovative or superior about Windows XP.  It simply works pretty well and most people should be happier with their computers than they've ever been.  (Windows 2000 is essentially Windows XP; I've heard the same kinds of comments about it:  It does what it is expected to do most of the time without bringing your system down.  Fingers crossed, it seems to actually be an operating system that isn't an Edsel.) But there are operating systems out there that are well-ahead of Windows XP.  Mac OS X is such an operating system.  Much easier to use.  Much more stable.  Much more elegant.  Yet, because of the entrenched Windows monopoly, few give it a chance.  But, today, there is no reason to stick with Windows.  The new Mac OS is completely compatible with any Windows network (Mac OS X is based on UNIX, which is the most time-tested stable operating system ever, and also the basis for the industrial LINUX operating system), has all the popular programs that work on Windows (including a marvelous new Office for Mac X that bests the Windows version of Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Entourage).  It also has the best multimedia programs in the business--none of which are available for Windows.  Burn CDs and DVDs, use the best mp3 player out there (the iPod), handle digital cameras and photographs effortless, make your own home movies without even cracking an owner's manual.  And, Apple has the best buy in a home computer system:  the new iMac G4. Fight the power.  Try something else.  Linux.  Mac OS X.  Send a signal to Microsoft that it isn't going to be business as usual anymore.	-1
Windows Xp is by far the best operating system to ever come out of Microsoft. - Increased speed, You will notice a 10-15 percent increase in speed when starting applications, doing simple tasks like cutting and pasting large files, Boot time has at least cut in half from previous windows os - Increaed security, If you are a 95, 98, or ME user you are using the fat32 file system. NTFS is a much more advantaced and secure file system - Increased Stability, Tried of the dreded blue screen? No more with xp. I have tried to crash my xp system and it just doesn't happen. No more hitting the switch because your system freezes, and no more scandisk (which is a tribute to the better ntfs file system) - Multiple Users, Windows Xp makes it unbeliveibly easy to manage differnet users. You can set up as many different users as you want with almost no effort. It also has the ability to "fast switch" users so you can logoff and someone else can log on, but when you come back anything you were working on, or windows that you had open are still there! Also the added security makes your files invisible to other users but it allows you to share your files with other, like pictures or music very easily - Hardware Support, I was surprised to see someone complaining about xp not surrporting their hardware, This operating system supports the most amount of hardware from printers to network cards than any other operating system i have ever seen. And i have used amost all different types of operating systems that you can think of from linux to bsd. - The help and support feature is a huge upgrade from any previous os. It is extremely easy to use and includes some of the most common problems or tasks right there for you to use. It can also go onlin on the microsoft site and grab possible answers to your question from there making it almost impossible to not find the answer to your problems. Xp also has a built in remote desktop feature so that you can invite a computer geek friend to connect to your computer and control remotely to help you with your problem. (you can also connect to microsofts help and support and allow them to remotely troubleshoot your system) - Digital Hub, Windows xp is much more robust when it comes to digital photos and music allowing you to view your photots in different ways and even order prints right from your pictures folder! As a previous Windows ME user i was pretty mad at Microsoft for releasing such a bad operating system, but they redemed themselves with the release of XP. If you are thinking of upgrading than do it. You will be happy.	1
I have successfully installed Windows XP on over a dozen computers without a single glitch.  The new OS is simply a beauty to behold and a joy to use.  It's fast (on par with Win2k), stable, and, best of all, compatible with both Win98/ME and Win2k programs.  A lot of hardware drivers are built-in.  The only caveat is you must have the right hardware before you upgrade.  According to PC World 90% of upgrade troubles occur because people don't heed the system requirements. Once you upgrade, you won't regret it.  Windows is getting better and better!	1
I may be going out on a limb here, but Windows XP is the most important upgrade to the Windows operating system since Windows 95. In addition to a new look, it offers stability, ease of use and more Internet integration than ever before. Installation was easy. You can either upgrade your existing Windows or do a clean install. I recommend a clean install so be sure to back up your important data (e-mail, accounting programs, etc.) You can boot from the CD and it will pretty much to the rest. Installation takes about 30-60 minutes but it was VERY easy. XP really knows what plug and play means. ALL, and I mean ALL of my peripherals were found and configured automatically. Once installed, you will be prompted to activate. This was an easy and fast process. The next thing it will do is set up your Internet access. Once this is done, you are now ready to go. You will notice right away that the interface is different and very colorful. It may take a little while to get used to but once you do, you will like it. You also have an option of a "classic" Windows 9x view. Windows XP makes a lot of functions very easy. First of all, depending on your BIOS and motherboard, you can tell Windows just what to do when you press your power button. It also has built in CD burning capability, however, to delete a file from a CD-RW, you must erase the CD and then put back the files you want. A little inconvenient but a lot more stable than DirectCD. It is VERY easy to set up individual users. You can set up a personalized account for each member of the family. Also, when installing many programs, it will detect XP and ask if you want certain people to access the program. This is very nice and secure. And with Internet Explorer 6.0, you can now choose the level of cookie protection. You will be amazed on how many third party "usage tracking" cookies that are placed on your PC. Backward compatibly is very good to excellent with XP. XP ran all of my older windows based programs and MOST of my DOS games. A newer Windows game didn't work correctly but all it took was to make it run in Windows98/ME compatibility mode and it fixed it. A few DOS games worked about 80% and some not at all. I am sure that "DOS EMULATORS" will be available for purchase in the near future. Windows XP seemed designed for Internet integration. Just about every major function in XP has a tie to the Internet. And because of this, Microsoft has included a built in Firewall. It is good, but I would recommend Norton Internet Security 2002. For those of you who are worried about compatibility, Windows XP makes it pretty easy to set up a dual boot. All you need is a partition created before installing. After that, Windows does the rest. For those who want security, go with Windows XP Professional. Everyone else can get by with Windows XP Home. If you have a previous copy of Windows, get the UPGRADE version. It will search for a previous install or ask you for the original Windows 9.x/2000 disk to verify. There is a lot more I can say about Windows XP but you just need to see it for yourself. If you want stability, awesome Internet integration and overall easy of use, you must get this upgrade.	1
This review is based on release candidate 2 (RC2). Can I say anything but Kudos? The new interface is intuitive to the max. It's a big step above former versions of Windows and even a cut above Macs. Stability is, well, I can't get it to crash. Compatibility is phenomenal. DOS, Win 3.1 and Win9x programs run without a problem (remember, this is based on the NT file system and kernel, not the DOS-based file system and kernel). This is what Windows was meant to be when version 1.0 came out. OK, it took 9 years to get it to this level but, now that it's where it's meant to be, there is no reason not to get it if your computer will run it. Most people will be satisfied with the home version. If you have a business or are a real computer geek, then you may want the Pro version. Installation is a snap (takes about an hour) and, if you decide that it's not for you, it uninstalls easily. For me there's no going back. I think that you'll feel the same way once you try it.	1
Norton Internet Security 2002 is one of the best solutions for Internet protection available. Besides getting a top-notch virus checker, you also get a firewall, privacy setting and a parental control to block out sites from children. The firewall is quite powerful. After installing, I went out to a web site which tests your firewall by trying to hack (without intention to damage) your PC. It passed with flying colors and none of the hacking methods made it through. Sure, someday someone will find a way around but, but NIS also comes with LIVEUPDATE. This will download the latest updates for all aspects of NIS automatically or by your request. This version works with all CURRENT Windows versions except 95 and earlier. If you are going to upgrade to XP, this is an excellent add on. A+.	1
With the recent improvements in the security settings in MS Internet Explorer 6.0, many of the features of this software (e.g., cookie blocking) have become redundant. The remaining major feature, ad blocking, is useful but not worth the price of the software. Moreover, the software lacks several functions one would otherwise expect--pop-up blocking and the blocking and removal of spyware (hidden programs that, once downloaded onto your system, report back personal information to whoever installed them). Of particular concern is the fact that this program pre-approves ads provided by certain information-gathering companies, without bothering to tell you. (Improves the bottom line, you know!) To find and remove these sites, you have have to go to "Options--Internet Security--Advanced Options--Ad Blocking" and remove them individually. "But didn't I buy this software to eliminate that kind of problem?", you ask. Exactly my point.	-1
When protecting yourself on the internet, you don't want to take any chances. Viruses and hackers roam the internet looking for unsuspecting and unprotected computers to exploit, usually for bad purposes. The sad truth is that most individuals are vulnerable. Internet Security holds the keys and locks your computer from the outside world. It includes powerful cookie controls, and privacy controls. Did you know that websites sometimes request your private information and your browser often gives it to them? How many people know your address now? Cookies are everywhere even in some HTML emails, this program will allow you to block them permanently. Internet Security also includes an excellent firewall program to help keep unauthorized users off your computer, and a parental control tool to help you decide what you do and do not want to see. There is a lot of trash on the internet these days, and parental control helps all of us filter out that junk! Included with this suite is Norton AntiVirus 2002, to help protect your computer from viruses and trojans. This program scans everything including your incoming and outgoing email to help protect you and your computer. Everything stays up to date for a year with the use of LiveUpdate. This program is completely customizable, easy to install and configure, and the best that you can buy! Don't waste time waiting for your computer to be attacked, protect yourself now!	1
I can't even begin to tell you how much I love Windows XP.  Why?  Because when people used to have computer problems with Windows 95,98, and ME, I was always first on everyone's list to come fix their computer problems.  It was fun at first, but then I was really sick of it.  When XP came out, I recommended to all those people to get XP.  Now, NO ONE has called me since with a computer problem.  That shows you how wonderful this operating system is.  XP is not perfect; but it works well enough to keep the average computer user happy with the condition of their computer. It is virtually idiot proof and it is very difficult to 'mess it up'.  The system restore function is a big plus.  Also, Windows XP keeps your system files from being corrupted by viruses by not allowing unauthorized access to the files.  I'm not saying that it's virus-proof, but much more secure than previous Windows versions.  The only downside to XP is that some computer games don't seem to work good with it unless they were made compatible with XP.	1
Microsoft finally got it right with Windows XP (Home Edition).  Based upon the highly reliable Windows NT, XP is a stable, reliable, and thoroughly functional operating system that cures most of the flaws that earlier versions of Windows are known for. First and foremost, the "Blue Screen of Death" is gone!  I run XP on three computers in my home via a home network, and I have literally never seen the dreaded Blue Screen.  While both Windows 98 (which I thought was a pretty good OS) and Windows ME (horrible!!!) require frequent re-booting, XP does not.  You can go weeks, even months, without rebooting XP.  It is stable and reliable. Speaking of home networks, XP Home Edition does a very good job if you want to set up a peer-to-peer network in your home.  We run one notebook (via a wireless connection base station hub) and two desktops via XP, and you can literally set something like this up in less than an hour, counting hardware hookups.  The Networking Wizard actually works, and takes almost all of the pain out of setting up a network.  If you want a peer-to-peer home network, XP is for you. One warning--XP does not support a domain (server) network.  If you are interested in this sort of configuration you want Windows Professional Edition.  You cannot use XP for this. Windows XP is well-supported as regards various peripheral devices.  When I upgraded, I had no difficulty downloading the necessary drivers for my three printers, one scanner, and various other devices.  Most worked OK out of the box, but upgraded drivers are available from most vendors via the internet. Speaking of the Internet, XP is truly dependent upon the Internet, and I would imagine that a user without Internet access would find XP very difficult to use.  XP is among the new generation of software of which Internet access is an integral design assumption.  The OS uses the Internet to register itself, obtain updates, and obtain drivers.  This is reflective of a trend whereby in my opinion every computer installation will in a very real way have as its centerpiece the Internet connection of the user.  Dial-up's days are numbered too--XP files, like most files nowadays, are simply too large for a 56K dial-up modem. In my opinion Microsoft hit a home run with Windows XP, almost enough to cause me to forgive them for Windows ME, which was absolutely awful.  If you are using ME, RUN, don't walk, to upgrade.	1
I've used Windows 95, 98 and 2000.  I've also used an OS 9 and 10 Mac.  None of them matches Windows XP.  It is simply the best, hands down.  I even like it better for using Photoshop and Illustrator than a Mac and that statement is virtually heresy in the art world! First, it is not buggy and not crash prone.  It reliably works all of the time.  Windows 2000 was very good in that regard and XP is even better. 95 and 98 were terrible regarding crashes and reliability. I'm also using Windows Media Player 9 with it, which is a terrific player, and I'm even able to use all wma files (1/3 the size) rather than mp3 after using a converter. I stopped using Real Player after getting on this Player 9, which works the best with XP.  Second, if I need help on something on my computer, I can have my friend in a different city, also on XP, take over my controls using the Net Meeting feature.  He was able to reinstall a program for me that was giving me fits.  Third, there are loads of special programs that work especially in conjunction with XP that further enhance it, such as Firegraphic 5 where you can see all your images and view them in filmstrips, slide shows and big versions. And that's just one of many special programs that I've used on XP.  It is also a delight to go to any website and find that whatever you can download there is compatible with XP.  One thing that would really turn me off a Mac, by contrast, is the notice on many programs or features on the web that they haven't developed a version yet for a Mac.  I also like the way Windows Explorer works in XP and that it looks better than in any earlier version of Windows.  As my giant file cabinet, it is very easy for me to keep everything organized in WE and the thumbnails of my jpgs, tifs, ais, htms and so forth are terrific.  The task bar is much improved from 2000 and I found I could even get rid of my pop up remover program because XP makes it so easy to close multiple browser windows with one right click on the task bar on a grouped browser window button. I also get beautiful thumbnails now when I use right click.  There is a wonderful XP magazine that comes from the UK (called simply Windows XP) that I would love to see Amazon have available for subscription.  This magazine has a wonderful users forum online that is a great help if you need help with XP.	1
I have had two computers with Windows 98SE and three with ME, and now have one with XP, so I know all the different quirks.  XP is quite stable.  No run time errors like 98SE, no crashes and reboots.  I find it a very easy to use, very stable system.  I also like many of the features, such as the error log.  Instead of listing errors that mean nothing to you, when you right click on the event you get an explanation of what that error means, what caused it and a hyperlink to link to click for further informations and solutions. I highly recommend this to anyone tired of the constant errors and crashes if other windows versions.	1
MS manage to change the Interface again.  For existing users of Windows, this beast takes some time to get used to.  I find myself constantly looking at help, looking for some stupid menu item.  It makes experienced user feels like ignorant as the Windows beginners. Comes with many small programs, but many times, I rather pay for professional software than deal with more of MS [stuff].  All this unwanted features gets in the way of accomplishing my goals. Comming from Windows 2000, I did not see much of speed advantage. Beginners of Windows may like all the extra featurs, but as an experienced user, I cannot get any work done with this POS.	-1
This review is based on release candidate 2 (RC2). Can I say anything but Kudos? The new interface is intuitive to the max. It's a big step above former versions of Windows and even a cut above Macs. Stability is, well, I can't get it to crash. Compatibility is phenomenal. DOS, Win 3.1 and Win9x programs run without a problem (remember, this is based on the NT file system and kernel, not the DOS-based file system and kernel). This is what Windows was meant to be when version 1.0 came out. OK, it took 9 years to get it to this level but, now that it's where it's meant to be, there is no reason not to get it if your computer will run it. Most people will be satisfied with the home version. If you have a business or are a real computer geek, then you may want the Pro version. Installation is a snap (takes about an hour) and, if you decide that it's not for you, it uninstalls easily. For me there's no going back. I think that you'll feel the same way once you try it.	1
I had misplaced my Paint shop Pro saoftware, but found it after I ordered it. I canecelled the software, so I never received the software I ordered.	1
I purchased this software a year ago. Find it very easy to use. I probably ask more of it than the average person would,and it delivers. I used it on 20 old B&W family photos taken back in the 30's and 40's. Was able to scan, repair, and print some wonderful enlargements. On one of the snap shots of my older brother and sister taken in 1943. After enlarging you could clearly read the date on the license plate on the car behind them. Was even able to repair what looked like a coffee stain on one of the photos of my mother with the cloning tool. When you email tech support with a question they get back to you. No matter how many questions you ask they respond until your satisfied. No it is not as powerful as Adobe Photo Shop. But it's not $... either. I have been able to do everything so far that I have wanted to do with this software. I would say I'm a serious photo junkie. And shoot 35mm as well as digital photos weekly. I can't wait to try their new Photo Album 4. I purchased the boxed version of Paint Shop Pro because I like having a manual to read away from computer when learning new tricks that I would not have thought of myself. Their web site is also great for picking up great ideas from other users.	1
By any means, "Jasc Paint Shop Pro 7.0" is a nice imaging tool. This continuity software showcased those genes, which enabled its earlier versions win numerous awards. Apart from being easy-to-deploy and use, it has excellent stability. Its enhanced features ensured that it is highly productive. Web-designers would appreciate the inclusion of JavaScript rollovers, and several other web-imaging tools in this '7.0 Pro' version. However, versatile image-editors should note that this 'Paint Shop' does not have the advanced premium features, which are evident in both 'Adobe Photoshop' and 'Corel Photo-Paint' programs. Still, its value-for-money did exceed those of 'Photoshop' and 'Photo-Paint'.	1
I'm an artist so although I used this product extensively for a year or more, the day dawned where I needed to upgrade to the industry powerhouse of graphics' programs, Photoshop.  Photoshop is a very difficult, expensive and challenging program though and unless you are a photographer or an artist, you can probably do as well or better with Paint Shop Pro 7.  It is easier to learn and operate and does an enormous range of image editing tasks.  I've produced excellent original art work on it.  I also have edited or manipulated images with ease.  It comes in at 1/6th the cost of Photoshop and for a vast pool of users out there, it more than does the job.  For my own students, for one, who are going to image edit digital pictures they take of houses, this program is more than enough.	1
I have over a dozen website at MSN communities, 1 at Angelfire and 1 at Bravenet, and they have improved 1000% since getting this program.  I now make my own splash pages, edit, creating everything and anything. Simple to use, and with an easy step by step manual for both paint shop and animation shop, you will be doing animations, backgrounds, web sets in more in no time at all. There is PSP addictions rampant in MSN communities - everyone loves this program - and the creativity is wonderful to be a part of.  There are many teaching sites there that help you work with PSP.  I have recommended many people to try the free 30 day download of this item and everyone that has tried it buys it. When you buy it, get it here, they often have promotions that bring the price down ridiculously low. WORTH EVERY PENNY!!	1
If you are a casual person looking for a good graphics editor, then this is a great package for you. JASC Paint Shop Pro is economical compared to many other products of its caliber, and offers many advanced features found in pricier packages. This package also includes a FANTASTIC GIF animator that is easier to use than many others that I have tried. For the money that you are paying out you can't get much better. If you are looking for an economical solution, or are involved in minor web/presentation graphics development this is for you. For more money, however, you can purchase Adobe Photoshop which is significantly better than JASC software...but then again you're paying 7x as much. Overall this is a great piece of software.	1
I've been using this software on my laptop for some time now.  Read what the security experts say and they alway suggest Norton over all others.  Once this software is installed you pretty much let it do it's thing.  Auto live updates keep it current and auto scan can scan your whole system while you sleep.  Get it now while it's cheep since the 2003 version is out and offers limited extras.  Don't have any virus protection now?  Can't get the upgrade rebate?  By McAfee VirusScan Ver 7 as well and you will then have two virus protection schemes to choose from and with competitive upgrade rebates pay nothing for either.	1
"Norton Antivirus 2002" may not offer everything an average user might expect from it, but there are lots of good tidings about it. It is compatible with every Windows version that is not earlier than '98. It is easy to install and to update; and automatically repairs common viral infections without interfering in one's work. Also, it serves as a dedicated systems scanner and cleaner. I have never experienced any problem while running it, and would be courageous enough as to recommend it. But that does not mean that it is a perfect software!	1
I got a virus using Nortons, and since then I have had several friends have the same thing happen.  We all do updates and do not open attachments, so I really recommend anything but this!! I have a friend that runs a teaching school for computers, and he said he had trouble with all the machines running Nortons getting viruses.  He changed to Panda and has not had the first antivirus since. I have been running AVG I have had none of the problems, same with my friends.	-1
Norton has been a very popular virus program for many computer, but the actual virus protection of these programs have big problems. I had norton antivirus installed on my 98 box and had a virus for many months even though i kept norton up-to-date and ran it frequently. (thank god for free on-line scans) (...) This is no different i tried to trial and that was the same. If you want a real virus protection program get pc-cillin (or even Panda but that is more expensive). It is recommended by all real computer geeks that i know(including myself, plus it is cheaper!! Plus it doesn't need to be updated ever hour and can detect virus that might be in your system that are not yet descovered. Norton is very slow and sad!	-1
Powerquest and again created a great partition program. It is extremely easy to use whether you know anything about hard drives or not it doesn't matter. Everything is wizard based and askes you if you will install another operating system just using it for data which operating system you are using, everything you could thing when you want to partition your hard drive. This is the only program that i have used to partition my hard drive and wasn't worried about my data. This is BY FAR the best. Its quick too	1
I've used Partition Magic since version 3.0. Partition Magic 7.0 is now WinXP compatable and supports hard drives up to 80 GB. This software is a phenominal program that allows hard drive repartitioning "on-the-fly" and easy booting into different operating systems. I have a PC-DOS/Win3.1 partition and a Win98SE partition on the same hard drive and a WixXP partition (preview version) on a second hard drive. I have also had a Linux partition on the first drive. You can resize partitions and convert from fat 16 to fat32 and back. You can also divide one large hard drive into several drives to help organize data and files. Boot Magic (and the previous Boot Manager) are great to allow easy booting into any OS that you have on your drive. Partition Magic has never given my a problem. I have never lost data. The manual is clear, well written and easy to follow. If you want to have more than one OS on your computer or to try out a new OS or upgrade (like WinXP), then this program is a must have. Highly recommended.	1

After tring different partitioning software i purchased this program and absolutly LOVE IT! The interface is great and it gives you a good amount of detail of your hard drive(S) that windows does not. But the greatest thing about this program is the wizards. There is a wizard for everything that you would want to do in creating, resizing, moving, formating. The wizards take you through step by step in easy to understand terms for anyone type of computer novice or expert. It makes suggestings and seys up the partition even if you want to install a second operating system (like linux or a different version of windows) and tells you why that is the best option to use. Once you deciede what you want to do it will reboot the systme and automacially start doing its job which it does faster than any other program i have used and it never damages any data you already have on your hard drive.	1
PartitionMagic is an excellent program for partitioning down your hard drive. Using a graphical interface that is easy for most people to understand, you can perform numerous operations with almost virtually the click of a button. Partitioning your hard drive with this program is as simple as specifying how much space you want and where that space is to come from. You can even let PartitionMagic change drive references for you if necessary! That little feature saves time and a lot of frustration! Need to resize a partition that is already created? No problem, select resize specify how you want it resized, let the system reboot and you're in business. You can convert partitions from one type (say FAT32) to another (NTFS) especially useful if you upgraded to XP and kept your old FAT file system. This action is performed well... You can also check partitions for errors using this program, although you can do just as well using Windows included utilities. The price is kinda steep, but would you want to risk your data with a cheap piece of software? I have used this software numerous times, on numerous machines, and have had minimal errors. Definitely back your data up just in case, but nine times out of ten you'll be up and running in no time...	1
For some reason in all the years I've been playing these games, when it came time to pick out which title to play next I always skipped over Secret of the Scarlet Hand. I don't know why, but I always just assumed that I wouldn't like this game. Maybe it's because it's notoriously educational (and who wants a game that is like school?) or maybe it's because the previews for it aren't terribly interesting. Whatever the case, Nancy Drew has once again proved me wrong. My intuition on these games must be seriously off, because every game I'm sure I won't like ends up being one of my favorites. And this has indeed become one of my favorites of the early Nancy Drew titles. I'm going to split my review up into different sections so I can give the game a more accurate rating.  PLOT - 5/5: Nancy is hired as the Deputy Curator at a Washington, DC museum called Beech Hill. It is quite an exciting time for Beech Hill because they are preparing to open a new exhibit on the Maya, the highlight of which will be a very rare (and very expensive) artifact - a large elaborately carved stone called a monolith.  But poor Nancy just has the worst luck when it comes to vacations and dream jobs. Before she knows it, Beech Hill is robbed of one of its most beloved artifacts; a rare and unusual jade carving of the Mayan King Pacal. It seems to be related to a string of art thefts happening across the country, since in all the incidents Mayan jade artifacts were the target and a threatening red handprint was left at the scene.  I thought this plot was just wonderful. It was well thought out, thorough, and unique among other ND titles. The length was perfect; I finished it over the course of a few days. There were lots of little twists and turns that I really enjoyed. It was interesting and intriguing, and very educational. Let me repeat that; it was VERY educational. It is set in a museum, after all. There is tons of information to take in - some of which is vital to the mystery of some of which is not. I have always loved history and am especially interested in the Maya and Aztec so this game was just my cup of tea. But if you don't like history - or aren't a big fan of plenty of reading in a ND game - this game might not be for you.  CHARACTERS - 4/5: Suspects in this game include Joanna Riggs, the curator of Beech Hill and therefore Nancy's boss, a fairly serious young woman with a history of being a bit too eager to acquire artifacts for the museum. Henrik van der Hune is the museum's resident expert in translating Mayan glyphs, so he is arguably the only person in the museum who can guess an artifact's true value. Then there is Taylor Sinclair, an art dealer located in DC, who often does business with Joanna and appears to be unusually concerned over the museum's safety. Finally, there is Alejandro del Rio, a Mexican ambassador who accuses Beech Hill and other museums like it of flat-out stealing artifacts that rightfully belong to Mexico.  Phone friends include Bess and George, the Hardy Boys, and Franklin Rose, who is a member of the Beech Hill board of directors and friend of Nancy's father. There are quite a few one or two time phone friends related to the plot as well.  Unfortunately, the four suspects weren't very memorable. Their personalities were not particularly well defined and there wasn't anything quirky or fun about them. Worst of all, none of them were very suspicious. Basically, no one from this cast of characters is going to be making my favorites list anytime soon. However, the previous deputy curator, Sonny Joon, seen only in notebooks he left behind at the museum, was absolutely hilarious and his notebooks were a delightful comic relief. I hear he shows up again in some of the newer titles so I'm really looking forward to that.  SETTING - 5/5: The setting was excellent. Beech Hill was very interesting and there was tons to look at inside. If it were a real museum I would definitely visit. Other places to see include Nancy's hotel room, Taylor's office, Alejandro's office, as well as some other locations that are unlocked throughout the course of the game. One thing that really blew me away was how realistic it all was. There were little things - like how could you see the exterior of every building before you entered it - that made a huge difference. It was so easy to get into the mystery because it really felt like I was there.  PUZZLES - 4.5/5: I liked the puzzles, though this game tended to repeat itself as far as puzzles go. In other words, you do the same thing a few times throughout the game. The puzzles in the museum were mostly information scavenger hunts, where Nancy would be posed with a quiz question and you would have to search the museum exhibits for the answer. That didn't bother me, but I could easily understand someone finding it tedious and too slow-paced. In hindsight this game wasn't as puzzle-heavy as some other ND titles, which worked for me as I'm not a huge puzzle fan. But the puzzles did work in seamlessly with the plot and I never felt like I was stuck doing something unnecessary just to make the game longer.  IS IT CHALLENGING? Not really. Most - if not all - of the puzzles are explained by the game, and Nancy can call her friends for hints. I did go online for help once for a game of "chance" that I lost maybe 20 times in a row, thinking that there might be some strategy I was missing. But it seems that the mini-game couldn't be won until you reached a certain point in the plot, which frankly was pretty frustrating to learn I had wasted all that time. Anyways, I would give it a 3 for challenge.  ENDING - 3.5/5: The ending was probably the only part of this game that really didn't impress me. Although the ending was very intense, it was just sort of awkward and didn't make a whole lot of sense. The culprit wasn't too predictable and their motive made sense. Overall the ending was underwhelming. But be warned that the ending of this game is pretty creepy, and because of it I definitely wouldn't recommend this game for young children.  FINAL SCORE: Plot: 5 Characters: 4 Setting: 5 Puzzles: 4.5 Challenge: 3 Ending: 3.5 = 25, divided by 6 = 4.16 rounded to 4 stars	1
This is one of their learning heavy games, and I really appreciate that. It still manages to be extremely adventurous even though you're in the downtown of a big city rather than out in a castle, or a haunted mansion. The knowledge gained in this game is interesting, which is what makes the learning worth while. Just make sure you actually have a notebook sitting out to take notes.  My favorite part of this game is it's ending. It's hinted at a little bit, but when I first played through this game I never would have guessed at what would happen. As a kid, this ending scared me worse than the Ghost Dogs (of Moon Lake) ever could (I should mention that I got into these games just before this and Ghost Dogs was released, and Message in a Haunted Mansion didn't scare me because I -correctly- guessed at what was going on rather early, since I'd seen it so often before on Scooby Doo).  I mark it as my fourth favorite (1. Treasure, 2. Blackmoor, 3. Shadow at Water's Edge, 4. this one, 5. Danger on Deception Island) and I understand why some people might get frustrated and want to put it down. But, unlike many of the games between 11 and 23, at least it doesn't leave people saying 'that's it?' at the end of it.	1
"Secret of the Scarlet Hand" is here! The follow-up of "The Final Scene" continues to offer some great gaming with complex puzzles, intense plots, and some cool characters. While I prefer the previous three games, "Secret of the Scarlet Hand" is a good game, and among the most important games in the series.  Nancy has decided to take a break and head out for an internship at Beech Hill Museum in Washington, D.C. Her dad's friend, Franklin Rose, has spoken with the Board of Directors to set this up for her, and she'll be working with several other experts of Mayan culture to set up Beech Hill's new exhibit, featuring a jade carving of the Mayan King Pacal and ancient monolith that was recently excavated from Mexico. While Nancy's internship starts off peaceful, Beech Hill soon becomes victim of a burglary! After the theft, Nancy finds a piece of paper with a gruesome scarlet hand left in the place of the now-missing Pacal carving. While investigating, she learns that a series of similar thefts have occurred around the country. Nancy's now determined to retrieve the carving and catch this thief red-handed.  The setting was great, and unlike any that's been seen in a Nancy Drew game before (or since). While there is more limited exploration, the areas that were able to be explored were nicely decorated and fully-interactive. I liked walking through the temple of Maya games and playing them all, as well as exploring other areas in Washington D.C. The abundant exploration that was in the previous three installments is definitely lacking here, though. There were several locations that didn't serve much of a purpose in the game (save to talk with a specific suspect) and the museum lacked any secret passageways. Regardless, the places that the suspects are conversed with are very nicely detailed and I rather enjoyed seeing different areas and buildings in Washington, D.C. while living vicariously through Nancy.  Some of the chores were rather tedious, such as matching up an exhibit with its correct recording. However, chores like these were the exception instead of the rule. Most of the games were rather entertaining, especially the maze and ancient Mayan games.  The suspects are probably the most disappointing aspect in this game. They include the museum curator, Joanna Riggs, Henrik Van Der Hume, the artifact expert, Alejandro del Rio, the attach to the Mexican Consulate, and Taylor Sinclair, the art dealer who helped Joanna get her hands on several of the artifacts that will soon be put on display. As a whole, the suspects are rather flat and unable to be conversed with much. Joanna is especially guilty of this, as her character definitely borders on useless. Most questions Nancy asks her, she answers with something along the lines of "Henrik can help you with that." Taylor and Alejandro are hardly much better when it comes to development, only serving to be conversed with once every so often and not providing much insight into the case. On the contrary, Henrik was awesome and nicely developed, and he winds up playing a very large role in the game itself.  While three of the four suspects weren't very developed, they all did have some great motives to be the culprit in the end. Even though I didn't see this culprit coming when I first played the game, I see in hindsight that he/she is truly the most logical choice. This is definitely another game in which I cannot see anybody but the guilty party as the culprit in the end.  As stated before, the suspects weren't very nicely integrated. The phone friends, on the other hand, were very well scripted and employed. I loved all of the conversations that Nancy has on the phone with people, as they were humorously and cleverly composed. Most importantly, several characters that play important roles in the Nancy Drew series as a whole make their first appearance in this game, including Frank and Joe Hardy (AKA The Hardy Boys), Poppy Dada, Prudence Rutherford, and Sonny Joon. This is also the first game to feature the name of the Krolmeister company, which will play a substantial role in the games to come.  The music was definitely different when compared to other games, in that it has more of a "historical" and "nature" feel to it, while the soundtracks of other games were more "mysterious" and "elegant". This, however, is a bonus for this game. While previous games have focused on bandits, royalty, and magicians, this game focuses on the ancient Mayan civilization. The soundtrack was great for a museum filled with the histories of these ancient people, and all the tracks certainly felt in place.  Is "Secret of the Scarlet Hand" my favorite Nancy Drew game of all time? No. Does it rank high on the list, though? Most definitely. While I did prefer the previous three games, this one certainly holds up to the high standards that the Nancy Drew series has set for itself. The plot is wonderful, and ultimately leads to an unforgettable and heart-pounding encounter that I never saw coming. Certainly can't wait to write about the next game all because of this one! :)	1
This is one of my favorites in the series, but when playing this game I often found that they tried force too much history on you.  Other than that it's a great game, and I have the following comments on it:  Story-You have a summer internship working at a Mayan museum in Washington D.C.  For those of you who don't know, the Mayan civilization was an Indian civilization that vanished without a trace.  Anyway, you are doing basic chores when a certain artifact is stolen, and a scarlet hand print is left at the scene of the crime.  Hence the title.  Eventually, you solve this mystery only to have another one thrown at you in the middle of the game, so you are actually getting 2 stories in 1.  Graphics-These are pretty good graphics, with the backgrounds looking pretty real.  The characters still look definitely fake, but this has pretty good graphics still.  Sound-The music is okay with kind of a Mayan twist on it, but the voice acting really isn't that great.  And the lips are REALLY off.  I ignore it, and it doesn't bother me, but others it might bother a little bit.  Gameplay-The gameplay is exactly the same as the others in the series.  It is first person point-and-click.  You ride a metro system to get places, and the alarm clock is back, allowing you to go to sleep and wake up anytime you want.  The puzzles in this game are a little more difficult and numerous than in other games, and some of them are quite boring, but most are fun, and I can forgive the ones that aren't.  Fun-This game is pretty fun, but unlike the other games where there is just a tad bit of learning mixed in among the mystery, in this game, prepare to learn a LOT about Mayan history.  I hated it, because I hate history, but my friend loved it because he likes history.  I think the producers were just trying to appeal to history lovers as well as mystery lovers in this game, and I understand that.  No bad enough to give 3 stars, but not good enough for 5.  Length-Oh.  My.  Goodness.  This is a rather long game.  It took me several months to finish, and whenever I replay it (which is a lot) it will take me about 12-15 hours because I still have trouble with some of the puzzles!  The puzzles are hard, but the answers are in the game, you just have to look for them.  The history is boring, but the story is great!  A great addition for history buffs, but if you don't like history, this game is still worth playing through at least once!	1
I have played all the Nancy Drew titles from Her Interactive, and Secret of the Scarlet Hand (based on Nancy Drew book 125) is the best (and most impressive) of the lot. In this adventure Nancy is the new deputy curator at Beech Hill Museum in Washington D.C. The museum is almost ready to open its most impressive exhibit: a large collection of priceless Maya artifacts on loan from the Mexican government and private collectors. But shortly before the opening, one of the prized jade carvings is stolen from under Nancy's nose. The only clue is a vivid red handprint and a message in Maya glyphs left by the thief. First, let me say that, as someone who is seriously considering a master's degree in museum studies, this game was an absolute delight! The museum is filled with nooks and crannies to explore: the curator's office, the exhibition hall, a three-storey Maya temple, gardens, shipping and receiving and the lab, filled with neat gadgets such as an analyzer, foam packing machine, ham radio and more, all of which help Nancy on her quest. "Secret of the Scarlet Hand" simply offers more locations than previous games, more characters/suspects, and a much deeper storyline. Nancy travels to different locations by subway, with a static image overlay as the various station lights light up on the metro map. Graphics are, as always, beautiful. The Maya artifacts are photo realistic, extremely detailed and vibrant. Music and ambient sounds are more pronounced than in previous ND games. The score features haunting panpipes, rainforest birdcalls, and flamenco, along with more ominous mood music-although some reviewers though the music was too repetitive, I found that the soundtrack greatly enhanced the gaming experience. This is definitely the most educational of the Nancy Drew games. Players must write down references to Mayan language, religion, rulers and more since there are three temple quizzes that Nancy must pass to progress in the game. Since it is set in a museum, the educational elements fit right into the game world without seeming out of place. "Scarlet Hand" is also the most difficult of the ND games to date, relying on a great deal of snooping, reading, Morse code transmissions in Spanish, telephone calls, and beating puzzles to progress in the investigation, but the great story and characters make it worth it.  Parents may find themselves roped into aiding investigations and end up playing the game themselves-there is plenty of variety in the various puzzles and tasks to keep the game interesting. Once again, Her Interactive has provided young girls with a positive, nonviolent role model in Nancy, and "Scarlet Hand" will be sure to thrill Nancy Drew/mystery fans, museum fans, and anyone looking for an engaging cultural journey. Not just for kids, "Secret of the Scarlet Hand" is an intelligent, gorgeous mystery with Mexican flavour and intrigue.	1
"Nancy Drew: Secret of the Scarlet Hand" is the 6th in this series by HER Interactive. Each game is full of clues, puzzles, and exciting (and possibly dangerous) adventures. "Scarlet Hand" is no exception. In this game, you (as Nancy) take an internship at the Beech Hill Museum, and when a priceless artifact goes missing, it's up to you to find out what's going on. You'll explore the museum (which includes a pyramid with several levels, and an outside exhibit), and take the subway to visit several other key locations. You'll talk to various people, all the while knowing that one of them could be the thief. It's a really fun game; I've played all the others and this one took longer than the previous game ("Final Scene") for me. It took about 10 hours on the senior level, and I was playing it with a partner. There are a lot of facts to write down and recall, and the puzzles in this game are very original. I was very pleased with the number of puzzles; just the right amount. What I really liked about this game, in comparison to some of the other Nancy Drew games, was that you didn't have to maneuver your mouse so much to find things. In some of the other games, you can only see objects if you position your cursor at just the right angle turning just the right direction. In this game, everything was very out in the open and the game was easy to maneuver; surprisingly, however, that didn't make the game any less challenging than its predecessors. Just another great addition to the "Nancy Drew" games collection, "Scarlet Hand" is sure to please gamers and mystery-lovers alike.	1
That's right, the free bill pay offer via MSN is worth more than the price of the software alone.  In 3 months, I have already paid for the price of the software, after rebate, since I cancelled my other Bill Pay.  The integration is awesome, and even better since I use Money for the Pocket PC.	1
I agree with the earlier reviewers about the myriad positive features this upgrade brought.  Faster operations, better stability, exciting new features (e.g., batch bill pay, ability to handle options - finally! - auto balancing, better portfolio views, etc. etc.), and still a great price.  Even without the rebate, this is a worthy upgrade.  BTW, CompUSA has the lowest price I've seen. The only gripe I have with Money is the still confusing interface, esp. for the new Money user.  I've used it for 3 years now and sometimes I still can't find what I'm looking for.  Luckily, the Help's search function is VERY useful and always locates the functionality I need. Highly recommended.	1
I've used Money since Money98, and Money 2003 is (finally!) a very good product/upgrade solution. What I like:  Money 2003 is much more code-efficient than Money 2002 (which was a terrible performer -- even on a fast 2 gig Pentium), so everything is quicker:  reports run quickly, data entry is quick, and budget changes are quick.  Secondly, Money 2003 didn't remove key functionality that its predecessors sometime did -- so if you use an older version of Money, the features you like are still there.  Thirdly, you can batch epayments together and send them all at once (conversely, Money 2002 sent a payment by piecemeal, which was extremely slow and frustrating).  Fourthly, a good product has been tweaked to iron-out some of the frustrations of earlier versions.  In all -- it's a nice piece of software. What I don't like:  So far, I like everything I've seen.  If there is something you don't like about Money, in all likelihood, there is an Options setting that will correct the problem.  For example, to remove "sponsor" ads from within Money, find the option setting to stop displaying all sponsor's ads (by default, they'll show up).  Also, when upgrading from an earlier version of Money, the newly-installed Money 2003 installation isn't smart enough to know that you already have a Money file that you want to just pick-up and use.  You have to exit out of the set-up prompts, click File, Open and go from there.  Not a big problem, but if you're not confident with upgrades, this might raise your stress level a notch.	1
To be honest I spend money as I look at it, but MS Money takes care of that. A wonderful solution that provides informative tutorials on how to budget ones self more efficiently. Money has evolved over the years into an enormous resource for helping users get their financial investments together. The application is becoming more and more integrated allowing users to take care of such task as paying bills online, buying a car, house or any other type of household activity concerning how you spend money. It organises the users investments. It's also a wonderful budgetting tool, comparing itself to Quicken. But the thing about Money 2003, is the interface, it's more pleasing to look at and based on my observation more easier to use based on it's intuitive wizards. I really recommend you purchase money if you don't have it. I implore users. If you are a Quicken user, stick with it, I think Quicken is more powerful than Money regardless of the many bells and whistles it has. If you are new to the budgetting software I try Money because of the ease of use, but for long time Quicken users stick with what you use to. Should you upgrade? If you recently spent money buying Money 2002, don't worry to upgrade to it yet, wait six month's to a year, their is really no reason to rush but if you are still using a previous version of Money prior to version 2002 it's a worthy upgrade. For version 2002 users the reason why I don't recommend you upgrade is because of Microsoft's unpredictable upgrade cycle just as you might purchase this new version of Money, news about Money 2004 start's circulating, I don't want you to make any mistakes wasting your money, here.	1
Good but not great. It loads easy, and manages to get you up and running with a minimum of fuss. But the screens are overloaded.  The expert user wants a few choices - MONEY gives you everything.  Yes, you can customize it but when you first start out (and all you really want to do is pay your bills on line), it is a bit overwhelming to see so many things on one opening screen.  Also, the voice introduction is a bit unnerving but that can be turned off quickly. This is an improvement over previous versions as you can save your payments as drafts and then submit the drafts all at one time for payment. But there still is quite a bit of repetition that should either be eliminated or give the user a choice. My advise would be:  Clear out the clutter but keep the quick and effortless way and this would be a first class program.	1
For the past 5 years I have preferred Money over the competition. This year, the sixth, is no different. For the product itself, I give it five stars, but for M2003 upgrades from last year's M2002, I only give it three stars. There are no earth-shaking changes for me and there were no great error corrections in this version. I could easily live with M2002 for another year, but I do like to have the latest version when practical. If it is your first version, it is definitely worthwhile. The planner functions are great and, so far, the competition has gotten better but still not as good as M2003.	1
Don't be fooled. Don't join the masses. With Apple's new G5 systems, Macs blow everything else out of the water. Sure there are more Windows users than Mac users. There are also more cockroaches than humans. Does that make the cockroach a superior being? (Well, the immunity to radiation bit is in their favor.) Jaguar is the latest release of OS X. A true multitasking operating system based on UNIX. Yes, there is a REAL version of UNIX under the hood and the hackers among you will drool over the possibilities. Apple is beginning to take advantage of the superior hardware design capabilities of the Mac with OS X. The best part, OS X hides the UNIX underpinnings in a superior Graphical User Interface (known as Aqua.) So, if you know nothing about UNIX, don't worry, you don't have to know UNIX to use a Mac. Ease of use has been the hallmark of Macs since their introduction back in 1984. You have the ability to create a true multi-user enviornment. Multiple userids, multiple processes running simultaneously and protected memory. This means if you have a program crash, only the one program will crash, everything else keeps going and going and going. (Sorry Energizer Bunny, I couldn't resist.) If you are a UNIX lover, Apple provides the Terminal application which gives you full access to the UNIX kernel system. If you are among the long-time Mac user community, you may have come to love the capabilities of OS 9 (or 8 or earlier.) Some Macs still have the ability to boot into either OS 9 or OS X. Newer Macs only allow OS X booting. If you still have programs from the days when you could boot into OS 9, you can still run many of them in "Classic" environment. Classic is an emulator, running on OS X to allow you to still run older programs requiring the older OS. Admittedly, there are programs that won't work in Classic. Mostly programs needing custom-made extensions or Control Panels may not load. Also, most of the still-existing software companies are creating native OS X versions of their programs. If you insist on running Windows XP or 2000 or 98 or 95 or DOS, you even have the option of running Virtual PC (which, by the way, is now owned by Microsoft - think about that for a moment.) There is also a Mac version of Microsoft's Office Suite. This allows you to exchange documents with your PC counterparts, seamlessly. Macs have superior video capabilities and OS X takes full advantage of this. OS X has some superior software to go along for the ride - iMovie, iDVD, iPhoto and iTunes, to name a few. These are all free. With OS X, Mac users will be leaving others in the dust. Superior hardware design coupled with well-thought-out software design makes the Mac environment hard to beat. Add to that the ability to use state-of-the art hardware and nothing else even comes close. Long live Mac!	1
Don't be left out with what 99% of personal computer users enjoy.  Stick with the mainstream.  Be part of the masses.  Windows XP is faster, more stable, and has more options than Mac will ever have.  Why should you feel left out?	-1
I'm a 20 year PC veteran who recently bought a Mac PowerBook.  I'm running Windows XP Pro on my other machines, but am finding OS X is more stable, has a cleaner interface, and is simpler to work with when installing software and hardware.  I'll probably switch totally to Mac over the next year, assuming more software becomes available. Note that OS X is built around a Unix-core, which to me is a big plus.  What a pleasant surprise to not have to deal with the Windows registry and never-ending driver issues.	1
I've been working with OS X for several months now. MY resistance to upgrading to Jaguar (OS X.2) was based primarily on the fact that I bought a new iMac last year and didn't want to shell out more money for the new OS. Finally, I gave in. And it was worth the time and effort. Jaguar has a cleaner, faster interface to work in. Start-up is much faster. It's a more stable system than OS X (which is saying something, because OS X was already the most stable Mac OS). The Mail client is also improved immensely over the previous version. Jaguar includes iChat (instant messaging software), Mail, Address Book, and downloads are available for iSync (basically allows you to port your info from home to work and back seamlessly), iCal (scheduling software), and the new Safari web browser. (A warning though, at this writing Safari is still in Beta testing and definitely needs refining before going live.) Put this together with the iLife software package (iTunes, iPhoto, iMovie, and iDVD), and you've got yourself one great computer system. As usual, Apple is letting third parties write their manuals. You'll have to buy those separately if you want them. However, this time they've included an interactive "Getting Started" CD which will get the novice up and running in Jaguar without too much stress.	1
Apple has made a huge leap with this "Mac OS X 10.2 Jaguar". The several components, (as well as the respective features contained in them), are well-integrated and stable. I am particularly thrilled by the ease with which its 'Rendezvous' linked my device to other devices, without requiring any sort of configuration. All other components work just as fine. Like the big cat it was named after, this OS waxes strong. It is resilient too!	1
I just upgraded my G4 667 dvi Powerbook to 10.2 from 10.1.4...OS X is a very good OS. The powerbook is my first Apple and 10.2 make it the main computer I now use. I still have a desktop with XP Pro but I just don't use it as much anymore now that I have the powerbook and 10.2. Compared to 10.1.4, 10.2 has a lot of nice new features for the general user as well as the experienced user. I love the ease of connecting to my XP machine and browsing any shared foldes I have setup. I never got this running under 10.1.4 but under 10.2 it was a breeze. The OS found the workgroup and allowed me to connect to the shared folders in no time. I also like Ichat, Itunes 3.0 and the new Sherlock. All of the applications offer ease of use and great functionality. With OS X 10.2 I feel we are finally getting to the point where for the average user there will be no compelling reason to only think of Microsoft XP. OS X the and software that comes along with it or that you can buy does just about everything that average home user needs. If you are a Mac user I recommend this upgrade, if you are a Windows user thinking of changing...now is the time.	1
When Mac OS X was first launched last year, it was a work in process.  Facing increasing pressure to get "something" out the door, and having gone through several failed attempts to unleash a modern operating system to replace the aging, original Macintosh operating system, Apple threw OS X (10.0) at dedicated Mac users as, essentially, a pay-to-play beta test.  Why, you might ask, would Mac users pay to play with a not-yet-ready for primetime OS?  I suppose you should ask Windows users the same question.  At lease Apple was kind enough to tell people that 10.0 was not for everyone and was going to be revised substantially. Then came 10.1 (now at version 10.1.5).  It improved the speed and features of 10.0 and made it ready for universal adoption. OS X 10.2 completes the cycle.  OS X has now been optimized.  It's fast, elegant, and groundbreaking.  It has been radically improved to work seamlessly with Windows computers and Windows networks.  It has built in, easy to use Bluetooth support.  Over all, it has about 150 additions and improvements.  There is no doubt that it is now the most sophisticated, stable, and appealling operating system out there.  With its UNIX core, it appeals to techies, too. A great OS just got greater.  Much greater.	1
My husband and I are both running Norton Internet Security 2003 on XP systems and neither of us has had any problem with it.  When you first install this software, it guides you through the process to set it up the way you want it.  You can easily reconfigure its many different features later if you change your mind.  NIS warns you when something is accessing the internet, an excellent feature especially if you are always connected with a broadband service.  It also alerts you if there is a potential attack on your computer and automatically blocks the attack.  If there is an attack on your computer, it gives you details about the type of attack and the ISP# where the attack originated so that you can follow up if necessary. Other features I like include ad blocking (you can block pop ups as well as many banner ads) and parental controls.  Also, you can tell Norton about important information you may keep on your computer, such as credit card numbers and account information, that you want Norton to protect and not allow to be sent out.  This comes with the antivirus software, also, so your computer is well protected. Also, you can set Norton to auto update your antivirus and internet security features so that you are always best protected or you can choose to do it manually.  The firewall is also easy to configure to your own liking.  This software is pretty flexible and does a good job protecting my computers without having any difficulties with the XP operating system.	1
Personal Firewall is a must have software (like Anti-virus) for today computer user. I using NIS in my PIII 750MHz Sony notebook w/ Win2K O/S, and Norton System Works 2003. I consider it as an upgrade from Norton Personal Firewall 2002 and everything is fine. Installation process is smooth too, but the program can detect if McAfee's product (mine is VirusScan 7.0 installed) was installed. It will "warn" you to uninstall McAfee before going on. (I installed it anyway but ok) I don't use any software if it installation having problem at the first of the beginning to avoid trouble (like McAfee personal firewall at my another P4 2.4GHz + Win XP desktop, it screw up my home network setup too). I didn't turn on the "Parental control" function, so no comment on this. I didn't configured the Spam Alert too... (I think I should but just too busy). Ad blocking is functioning, I guess... I don't visit such kind of websites much through... The rest is just the same old wine as PFW, upgrade it from version 2002 to 2003 just because I feel the info & programs are more update...and price is right. If you have PFW 2002 installed and satisfy then no need to hurry for this, hope 2004 version have something excite. Again I dislike the rebate "service" from Norton as I stated at the other reviews. Other stores / vendors' rebate handling already have improvement and do the right job... I give this product 4 stars because : 1. McAfee Personal Firewall give me hard time, but Norton didn't. 2. Beside this 2 companies I hardly think of anyone will provide me a complete integrated utilities to use (Anti-virus + Personal Firewall + System Utilities). Many offer some but not all so simply limited choice. Using different vendors programs means expose ourself (users) in such a potential of incompatiable software issues that nobody will help us. Also, add a router (they are so cheap today!!!) if you using boardband for internet access even you have only one computer. This will give you some hardware protection for additional safety.	1
NIS 2k3 is really WRQ's masterpiece AtGuard, brought into the Symantec fold.  For anyone who started their computing hobby or career with Norton's software and books, or Central Point's software and hardware products, you know where I'm going with this: Symantec ruins a good product. All right, "ruins" is a strong word, but let me illustrate in this exact case.  WRQ's AtGuard was a model of simplicity. It threw a popup box whenever it encountered an event it didn't have a rule to match.  Let's say incoming traffic fell through all your rules: AtGuard asks "What should I do?  Allow it all the time, just this once, block it once, or block it all the time?"  Four choice, covers the gamut.  In the cases of ads, that's enough.  In the cases of TCPIP or ICMP traffic, permanent choices also brings you right into a quick dialog of exactly what to block (port, address) and how to name it (blocking 427 incoming, blocking ms-sql-m traffic). For NIS, especially the NIS2k series, you don't have these advanced choices.  You also have a great deal of "preset" rules that aren't always useful, because they err on the side of blocking rather than permitting.  Good for newbies, not good for pros. Another downside if you're experienced is that to get to rule editors and advanced options, you have to click through an enormous cascade of menus.  In AtGuard, it's two clicks away. That's just unacceptable: if the purpose is to keep newbies out of the advanced menus, just add a password and unlock the necessary menus. Finally, NIS2k does away with site-specific ad filtering. Inexplicably, you have to choose to block images from an entire domain instead of a single machine.  For anyone who surfs Yahoo, you understand the value of allowing us.yimg.com and not us.a1.yimg.com. In terms of how NIS2k works with systems, I strongly deter individuals from using it.  It has a poor installation procedure, it doesn't co-exist properly with enough software, and it's a bit of a mess to uninstall.  NIS2k and Symantec's virus scanner products are notorious sources of software conflicts in professional networks, and my professional and personal experiences bear this out. I can't recommend NIS2k3 to anyone who doesn't already use it and like; I wouldn't try to convert anyone who seems satisifed with their results.  However, if you want a better ad blocker, either get the original AtGuard, or use a proxy filter.  For a better firewall, it's tough to beat the free one bundled in McAfee VirusScan.	-1
If you have high-speed internet access, you simply have to have this product. It kills those pop-up ads just about completely, and restores control of your desktop to you. I was being bombarded by pop-ups to the point where it was making me crazy. This product cured that. Mine installed easily and flawlessly during the duration that it took me to drink a beer. It immediately registered and updated itself. And I haven't seen a pop-up since. The anti-virus seems to work perfectly--I've had no infections since getting this program. I have been leery of the Spam-Email protection because I am worried about losing real messages. Maybe I'll get braver later on. This is a fine product that I cannot really imagine being any better or easier to use. The user interface is excellent, and the performance is too.	1
I love Symantec products. When I heard that there was a new version of Norton Internet Security, I rushed to find out all I could about it. I was intrigued most by Norton AntiVirus 2003, which protects instant messaging, so I decided to give it a try. I was unable to install the software for the life of me, until I completely formatted my hard drive and reinstalled everything! Once the product was up and running it was great! The interface is a bit nicer, and much easier to navigate, from earlier versions. The tools are superior to any other Internet protection suite (in my opinion), and when they are running they work great. My computer has come out well protected in many, many tests. That is of course, if you get it working! If you do not have a previous version of Norton products, then this should give you no problems and is a must have. If you are using an older version of Internet Security, you may want to stay where you are for the time being... at least until Symantec gets there act together.	1
I am surprised to see other users referring to problems with this software.  I can speak only for myself (and, for the record, my operating system is Windows XP Home edition), but I made an exceedingly smooth transition from Norton AntiVirus 2002 and Norton Personal Firewall 2002 to Norton Internet Security 2003.  All of my established settings came over without a hitch, I am having no problem at all scanning incoming and outgoing email messages, and the firewall would definitely appear to be doing its job.  The AntiVirus program now has the added capability of scanning instant messages, which is a very big deal, in my opinion.  The Spam Alert function is not quite perfect at distinguishing between true spam and valid messages, but it is a feature of at least some utility, and I am happy to see Symantec trying to incorporate it into their already excellent software package.  The Privacy Control feature is not new, but it is certainly an important part of the deal, affording the user some protection from the accidental release of important personal and financial information across the Internet.  I can't comment on the Parental Control feature because I do not use it, but certainly this is something parents will find appealing.  Last and certainly not least, this software allows you to block a great number of those increasingly annoying pop-up ads proliferating online. If this is your first time using the firewall software, you will have to go through some important steps in order to configure your security system for your own needs, but the system walks you through this pretty well, meaning you don't need to be a computer expert to do it.  You will also have to specify any personal information (such as credit card numbers) you want to protect from accidental release via web forms and the like, but this is not hard to do.  You can quickly and easily run a security check at any time to make sure your security settings are optimized and working properly.  I would not surf online without knowing this great product is there to protect me from all the dangers lurking in cyberspace.	1
Forget that Norton has a good name... I even executed a system rollback to try and rid my computer of it after it failed to uninstall. That just damaged it enough to cause a blue screen. ...	-1
1. As PC mag stated, this version make little difference with 2002 version. Upgrade it ONLY if you get an absolute great deal. 2. SystemWorks usually run well in my Win2K & WinXP system... When I installed it to Win 98 w/ 64Mb RAM... it's still work, but forget the performance talk... 3. While doing check up, it report the (Active X) problem and did the fixing bt itself. Then I re-checked it, the same problem stayed... maybe bug inside? Beside this, everything ok. 4. Follow your rebates carefully... Norton rebates handling is bad. 5. You got to have such system utilities programs on hand just in case. One is enough, just pick your choice. 6. Overall Norton have a stable record not crash my system and need me to reformat my harddisk, so I still bear with it. 7. Better set the LiveUpdate to automatic (if you have Boardband) and save some time for yourself.	1
I hate to be harsh to products, esp. since I was a huge fan of Norton Utilities back in the late 80s/early 90s.  But over the last couple of years I've been disappointed at many Symantec products, which seem more guided by greed than anything else.  Peter Norton, where are you? NSW 2003 continues the tradition of bloatware (lots of files and components, many surreptitiously loaded into your system at runtime even if you don't want them), dangerware (my Windows 2000 laptop went kaput after running WinDoctor and I had to reformat the hard drive), and ripping off the loyal customer (no upgrades from previous versions, as Richard Clayton clearly noted). If you run Windows 2000 and esp. XP, you already have all the tools to help you diagnose your system and keep it running (except anti-virus).  In fact those tools, while not as fancy-looking as NSW, does a much better job and are infinitely more stable.  Also, your PC vendor might have given you other free tools like an anti-virus program, which is probably just as good as NAV.  If you have Windows 98 or earlier, NSW will very likely crash your system rather than keeping it error-free.  I recommend you upgrade to Windows XP, or find a better utility program.	-1
I'm amazed at how Symantec has driven the Norton product line into the ground in the past several years. I've been using Norton products since before Symantec even existed, and at this point I can honestly say it's not worth bothering anymore. The Norton Utilities don't add anything to the existing built-in tools of XP (in fact, the disk optimizer is far worse). The rest of the tools are hobbled under XP. The bottom line is that this set of "tools" is high on gimmicks, low on value, and a waste of system resources.	-1
Virus protection software is too improtant to run without. If you have a constant internet broadband connection like me you are especially wary of what might get into your system. I currently have 4 systems running on a home network and am protecting one system with this product. While I believe the product works as advertised I still prefer Norton AntiVirus. I also use the built in firewall but also prefer using Zone Alarm for my firewall duty. I must say that this product has protected as well as the Norton/Zone Alarm combo I run on my other systems. If your an upgrader it is currently free with rebates. If your a first time buyer of virus protection software buy this product and Norton AntiVirus 2003 and try them both out. You will then qualify for both McAfee and Nortons upgrades and can have both for next to nothing	1
I purchashed this software 5 months ago. I keep my computers OS updated reguarly. Newest security patches ect. Keep hard drive defrag ect. From the minute I loaded this product and it updated itself from their site the computer slowed to a crawl. Would refuse to shut down at times. Would love to freeze up when online. Yes it can scan files quickly for known viruses. But it you have it running while your working it's a dog. Found if I diabled it things were fine then enable and have it run it scan when I had free time to do somthing else. This has to be the worst piece of software that I have purchased in the 15 years I have owned a computer. I finally uninstalled it.	-1
I've used McAfee virus scanners on and off since 1994.  I've used F-Prot, McAfee, and Norton virus scanners, and only McAfee gets it right.  Build an engine, let people download DATs, and keep achieving excellence. The UI is fairly intuitive.  McAfee does suffer from a serious problem with their dialog boxes and UI screens: they are not resizable, so in viewing traffic or network stats, you are spending too much scrolling about in a tiny window.  That's where McAfee misses the fifth star. Aside from that, McAfee has actually scaled back the number of menus, and made it a little easier to manage your advanced settings (where I tend to live in every piece of software I own).  I can still block IP addresses, hostnames, scan all incoming downloads and email attachments, set my extensions, from a familiar screen that hasn't changed much since v4. Coupled with that power (and it has never allowed a virus on my system, eight years of solid detection and prevention), it's also a very stable release.  Version six botched a few things on my system, and was hard to unload.  It also suffered from a case of the "stupids", insisting my license expired when it clearly hadn't.  Version seven fixes that, and aside from a bad case of "unripened install software", it's been running well.  It certainly hasn't conflicted with any software I run on Win2k and WinXPPro boxes. The best part of VS7 is the included firewall.  It doesn't block ads, it doesn't have the natural intuitive feel or settings options of some other products but it's free, it's easy to configure, and it keeps you safe.  It's what I recommend for casual computer use and home users, without qualification.	1
I decided to try this software because I could get it for free (due to promotions) and Norton wanted much more for the subscription. Installation on Windows 2000 immediately presented a problem: the entire system hung after the installation. McAfee's support is useless, just their user's forum on their web site. Many users reported the same installation problem, but nobody has received any help from the company (I stopped watching the forum after a few weeks). To compromise, I had to turn off one of the major services on Windows 2000. Unless the company fixes this problem soon, I am gong back to Norton. This particular problem may not affect you if you don't use the product on Win2K, but being a software developer, I extrapolate my negative experience to the robustness of the McAfee's products in general. This is shame that the last line of defense like anti-viral software is crafted so unprofessionally.	-1
Together with its updated Firewall protection, this 7.0 Home Edition McAfee VirusScan offers more satisfaction for less money. It executes its job with maximum efficiency. It is also more stable and less hassle-laden than most comparative products from other manufacturers. Installation is easy; and updating via Internet is straightforward. However, depending on your Operating System's stability and Hardware configurations, you may run into a hitch if you attempt to customize it.	1
Kept my interest.	1
This is my 17th review and completed adventure in the Nancy Drew series.  First, I'd like to start by dividing my review into two factions. 1) The game itself 2) My personal detective work.  * PART 1 *  PLOT: A lone cabin out in the Pennsylvanian woods and there are ghost dogs that prowl the forest?! Oh my this is going to be exciting!  I was looking forward to some beautiful nature scenery and I wasn't disappointed. Moon Lake and the general lay of the lands [cemetary, speakeasy, sprawling trees] captured my imagination immediately.  The story of Prohibition law-breaking and rum-running really caught my attentions and found myself absorbed in the newspaper clippings and the desire to find the gold bars. This plot line was one of the Top Ten stories HER had to offer us players thus far!  INITIAL SCORE: 93  CHARACTERS:  Red Knott: This weird bird watcher that observes avian only at night gave me the creeps as I thought I caught sexual innuendos when I talked with him in that treehouse. " If I do this this for you, what are you going to do for me? [long pause] and "Pretty girls should be okay out here" [something along those lines].  I immediately went into "stranger-danger" mode and kept to the cabin when he was around. And he ALWAYS was!  Emily Griffen: Her twangy voice was peculiar and I had her pegged as my # 1 suspect I think mostly because I felt force-fed information about the other two residents and didn't want to buy too much into these evidential setups.  Jeff Akers: The park ranger with the big aspirations and familial ties to the mob had all the makings of a culprit served on a platter. He had motives to get the land back into public hands, rumors of hidden gold, etc.  I loved reading all the information in the ranger station which could be opposed by many of the young gamers who "don't want to be educated like they were in school" ha, ha.  Vivian Burnett Whitmore: She has to be on my Top Ten list of ND characters based on how funny it was talking with her and the information she provided me [relationship with the gangster Mickey Malone, the four rottweilers] and the key she mailed over.  Beth/George/Hardy Boys: Again, didn't care for the Hint System, but I know I always had a place to call for a good laugh [my girls!] Dialing the phone feature was VERY tedious!  CUMUL SCORE: Even = 93  SCORE/GRAPHICS/SOUND EFFECTS: Based on how I used to enjoy the woods in my youth, the visuals was absolutely perfect; especially the moonlight sequences!  The speakeasy was lovely, but there really wasn't much to do except examine paintings and I was frankly disappointed. The thuggy jazzy score set up with stirring moody numbers brought my mind back to the roaring 20's.  CUMUL SCORE: + 3 = 96  PUZZLES/MINI-GAMES:  Now that I think about it, I don't think there were ANY mini-games. I know the puzzles revolved mostly on collecting items [bird pictures & critters] and staying focused on the makeup of the dogs colored collars and such.  Not  bad in any sense, but when you compare that to other ND games, those captured your attention more. In this game it was a slight let-down.  CUMUL SCORE: - 1 = 95  ADVENTURE ENDING: I got to see the evidence into making the actual "ghost dogs" and loved the cuteness of these canines [although wanted to release them from their cage].  I guessed the culprit!!!! That makes my rating about 45%  All-in-all, I was pretty pleased.  CUMUL SCORE: Even = 95  * PART 2 *  I try to solve cases without any hints, walkthroughs, etc, even if it were to take weeks! Well, it took me two days [8 hours] and I gave myself a Detective Score Of : 82  My Strong Points: I pushed through at a pretty rapid pace and never really got into any entanglements from puzzles or stuck in plot line devices. The water valve puzzle was solved with my screwdriver ingenuity and the tunnel navigation was nearly flawless.  My Weak Points: I guess I missed it when Vivian said Waldo's other name, because this puzzle kept me grounded in thought needlessly. I died on the rotten floorboards, ha, ha  OVERALL GAME SCORE: 94 + 82/ 2 = 88.5 [ B + ]  BOTTOMLINE: I agree with other gamers that the ghost dogs were underutilized. The fact why I don't consider it a problem was that this wasn't a horror movie, this was an adventure.  I was quite occupied with the engaging storyline and not worried that I was going to by chased through the forests with my life at stake. Although missing the A grade HER so often does, it is one of their top adventures in the series thus far.  Thus far, on my list of the 19 completed ND games, GHOST DOGS ranks.... # 1 !!!!!  1) GHOST DOGS OF MOON LAKE * 88.5 2) THE SHATTERED MEDALLION  * 87.5 3) GHOST OF THORNTON HALL  * 87 4) HAUNTING CASTLE MALLOY  * 85.5 5) HAUNTED CAROUSEL  * 84 6) WHITE WOLF ICICLE CREEK  * 82 7) DANGER DECEPTION ISLAND  * 81 8) SHADOW AT WATER'S EDGE  * 78 9) WARNINGS AT WAVERLY  * 77.5 10) THE CAPTIVE CURSE  * 77 11) SECRET SHADOW RANCH  * 76.5 12) TRAIL OF THE TWISTER  * 72 13) PHANTOM OF VENICE  * 71.5 14) TOMB OF THE LOST QUEEN  * 71 15) THE SILENT SPY  * 70.5 16) ALIBI IN ASHES  * 70 17) THE DEADLY DEVICE  * 69.5 18) SECRETS CAN KILL [REMAST] * 69 19) CURSE BLACKMOOR MANOR * 68	1
The very first time I played this game (waaay back when it was first released), I found myself incapable of finishing it because I was just too scared. Please, if anyone scares easily, know this: This is not a scary game. It has it's wonderful spook elements, but the game overall isn't terrifying. It's actually really beautiful. Especially when you start getting near to the end.  To people looking to buy: There is an interesting historical level, the characters are all interesting, the setting is gorgeous (though now you can really tell that the graphics are dated, but that's ok), and all the loose ends are tied up. Also, you really get an interesting look into the past with this game.  I would not suggest this for people who get bored easily or are impatient because this game does take a bit of digging, and, as the title of this review states, it's not the most riveting game out there. You are stuck out on Moon Lake, which has a very small population of three people and you at this point. But it does have a lot of places to unlock, which is something I like in my games (finding new areas as the game progresses, rather than everything being handed to you upfront). Not that games that don't have secret passages aren't as good, they can be great too. I just get a little tingly 'I'm an adventurer' feeling when I find places that no one has seen in decades (or centuries, in some games). It's those little moments that make this such a great game.	1
The Nancy Drew games are nothing short of phenomenal. Nearly every game before this one has held onto a classical quality of mystery, intrigue, and adventure. This wonderful 7th addition, "Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake", is no exception at all.  This game takes place shortly after the previous game. While interning at Beech Hill, Nancy's friend Sally sent Nancy a letter asking for her help. Something frightening has been happening ever since she's moved into her new home in Moon Lake, Pennsylvania, and she's hoping that Nancy can find out what. Nancy naturally agrees to drive out, only to find out that Sally's been frightened away from her home. What exactly did this? The answer comes all too quickly when pack of four ghost hounds that attack the house while Nancy's inside. Legend has it that they once belonged to Mickey Malone, the gangster who originally lived in the house, until their beloved owner passed away. Upon his death, the dogs ran off into the neighboring woods, and could be heard howling in the distance until they all died. They now return every time somebody tries to live in the old Malone home. Could these dogs be seeking their owner in the netherworld, or is a sinister criminal trying to scare Sally away from her property? And if it's the latter case, why?  The plot used in this game is truly a masterpiece. I've yet to find another story like this one. This case is definitely another stepping stone in the realm of Nancy Drew gaming, offering a plot unlike any other, and giving a fresh, new feel to the series while doing so.  The house is very detailed, and I loved exploring the nearby woods. The graphics are very beautifully realistic, and made me feel as if I was right there with Nancy as she listened to the beautiful birds sing by day or wandered through the creepy woods at night.  This game only has three suspects, which is a move never used before (all games before have had four, except for Stay Tuned for Danger with six). Some might not like this move, but I thought it was a pretty good one, because it left space for originality in the game. It also made it more realistic - really, if we were solving cases in real life, what would be the odds that we'd ALWAYS have four suspects every time?  The suspects include a retired antisocial bird watcher named Red Knott, who spends most of his time on his observation platform making odd noises to get birds out of hiding. Emily Griffin is another suspect in the game, and is the owner of a store called Em's Emporium, specializing in antiques from the 20's. The last suspect is Ranger Jeff Akers, the park ranger for Moon Lake who enjoys bossing people around. All of the characters had very solid motives to want Sally out of her house, but the most solid motives don't come to light until nearly halfway into the game. I wasn't really sure who'd be the culprit in the end, but was rather happy with the culprit choice that was made.  The other six games before this one all had excellent soundtracks. "Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake" is no exception. This game features a lot of music with a strong "nature" feel to it, and it was very peaceful to listen to while exploring the woods and around Moon Lake's community. At night, the music becomes slower and more eerie, and it was complimented by the sound of chirping crickets. The music played whenever Nancy's in danger was as suspenseful as always, but also had a bit of that "dark nature" edge to it like the nighttime music did. "Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake" is yet another example of a game with a perfect soundtrack.  "Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake" is another term for "a great step in the Nancy Drew series". I can't complain about this game much at all, and everything within it is so rich and fresh. I love this game, and I can't wait to write about the next one! :)	1
Now, normally I wouldn't have gotten this game. All the reviews say it's terrifying, and I'm really not into that. But, since I got it as a Christmas present, I gave it a try. And I will be the first to tell you that it's NOT terrifying, and it's actually pretty good! I'm going to split my review up into different sections so I can give the game a more accurate rating.  PLOT - 5/5: Nancy goes to visit her friend Sally MacDonald at Moon Lake because Sally says some terrible things have been happening at her lakeside cabin. When Nancy gets there, though, Sally has left out of fear. So Nancy decides to stay and solve the mystery of the ghost dogs who show up at night and attack the cabin. I thought this was a really good plot. Unlike in some other ND titles, I really wanted to solve the mystery and find out where these dogs were coming from. And trust me, the dogs weren't the least bit scary. The plot wasn't too short or too long. Another solid plot from Her Interactive!  CHARACTERS - 4/5: There was a real lack of characters in this game. There were only 3 that you could actually see. I guess they did that so Moon Lake would really feel desolate, and it worked. The three main characters were Red Knott, an anti-social bird watcher, Emily Griffen, the store owner who has a fun accent, and Jeff Akers, the lone park ranger. Overall, the characters were OK. I kind of wish there was more, though.  SETTING - 4/5: The setting was pretty good. I can't say it was beautiful or anything, because although it was well done, it was just kind of creepy looking. But there was lots to explore, including a whole forest maze that was really hard to get the hang of. There wasn't much to see inside the cabin, or around the lake, but the forest was pretty big so that made up for it.  PUZZLES - 4/5: The puzzles were pretty easy in this game. I could figure most of them out without a walkthrough. The maze was probably one of the hardest puzzles, and I kept getting lost. But other than that they were all short and sweet.  WAS IT CHALLENGEING?: Nope. I never got frusterated, I only died like once, and I barely used a walkthrough. 2/5  ENDING - 5/5: The ending was actually good! I liked how they revealed who the culprit was, and catching them was very clever. Plus everything leading up to the ending was fun too.  FINAL SCORE: Plot: 5 Characters: 4 Setting: 4 Puzzles: 4 Challenge: 2 Ending: 5 = 24, divided by 6 = 4 stars	1
I was expecting another game like "Message in a Haunted Mansion" when I saw the cover for this game, but although the first scenes in the game were a little freaky, it's not as scary as the box makes it seem.  Story-One of your friends, Sally McDonald, has asked you to come help her with a mystery at her house (which is really a log cabin in the middle of nowhere).  She won't tell you over the phone what's scaring her, though, and when you get to her house, she's gone!  You soon find out that dogs with glowing eyes have been attacking her house, and they have scared her away.  You can call her in the game, so don't think she's been kidnapped or something.  Graphics-They were pretty good, and the dogs didn't look that bad.  The characters still need some work, and the backgrounds could be better, but overall, I love the graphics.  Sound-The music has a slight country twist on it, and although I hate country music the music isn't that bad in the game.  The voice acting could have been better, but it's not as bad as it's been before.  Gameplay-The car you drove up in is blocked by a tree that fell down right behind it, so you have to get around via motorboat, which you have to fix first.  Also, there are only 3 characters in the game, so it really gives you the feeling that this is definitely not the city anymore.  Point-and-click is the same.  So is calling Bess and George for hints.  There is a tad bit of history in this game but not as much as in the last game.  Thank goodness!  You have to choose day or night, however, and you don't have an alarm clock in this game.  Fun-Yeah, this is a fun game, but as before mentioned in other reviews, the puzzles don't have much to do with the story, and they revolve a lot around Roman numerals.  The puzzles aren't great, but the story really makes up for it.  Still, the story is not the least bit scary, but it is still a great story.  Length-Not as long as the last one, playing this one through is about 10 hours, but of course, the first time you play it, it will be longer.  It does have a replay value, but the puzzles are rather dull that I just don't bother with this game that much.  A great game with an excellent story but rather dull puzzles.  I definitely recommend buying it, though!	1
This game really got my brain working.  The puzzles were really intriguing and the plot was great.  I love the PDA function that can give you a hint when you need it.  My copy of "Final Scene" didn't have this feature and It was really handy!  I couldn't close it down!!!!!	1
The Nancy Drew PC Mystery Games are fun for anyone to play!  Great 3D graphics, background music and sound effects! You are the detective.  It's fun to interact with the cast of characters, figure out the fun,challenging puzzles & games, gather clues, and narrow down your list of suspects.  "Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake" is one of the more interactive ones.  I also really enjoyed:  "Secret of the Scarlet Hand", "Message in Haunted Mansion" and "Danger on Deception Island".  I first played on the Junior level, but now I play at the Senior Detective level.  You can save your game along the way.  ... I think younger children might need assitance here & there.  Really, all of the N.D. games are great fun!	1
This game was probably one of the scarier Nancy Drew games. The graphics are still amazing and the features are new and improved! In this game, Nancy gets to have a PDA (personal digital assistant) that she takes around with her. It's a phone book and notebook. Nancy jotts down important notes and such in it and this time, you don't have to scroll ALL THE WAY DOWN to look at the new stuff she wrote (unlike the previous Nancy Drew game). It's really scary in the beginning and in other sections too. You have to snoop around at night and go to the graveyard! I'd say it is pretty freaky. But it's loads of fun. I only got stuck really bad ONCE during the entire game. That doesn't mean it's super easy but it just means that it's not extremely hard to the point where you can't figure it out yourself. This one was one of the better Nancy Drew games!	1
"Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake" is the seventh Nancy Drew game from Her Interactive. This time around Nancy is visiting family friend Sally McDonald at her new cabin in Ghost Lake, Pennsylvania, once home to notorious 1920s gangster Mickey Mallone. Sally has fled in fear, and when Nancy arrives she finds herself trapped at the cabin due to a fallen tree. Sally hurriedly calls her from her cell phone, warning her about the "ghost dogs." Soon after, Nancy sees them for herself: four snarling, lunging Rottweilers with glowing teeth and eyes attack the cabin, rattling the doors and throwing themselves at the house. Nancy decides to stay and get to the bottom of her latest mystery: ghost dogs or flesh-and-blood ones? There are three suspects: Emily Griffen, owner of Em's Emporium (Moon Lake's general store), Jeff Akers, park ranger, and Red Knott, retired birdwatcher. All three have some direct connection to the reason behind the "hauntings," and the main motive is the rumoured cache of stolen gold that Mickey Mallone stashed somewhere near the cabin before being hauled off to jail (where he died). Nancy must navigate through a maze of woods to find the cemetery behind the cabin in order to search for clues, as well as interrogating suspects, snooping through secret passageways, and escaping danger. As in all Nancy Drew games, Nancy can die in a number of ways if she's not careful. This time possible deaths include a motorboat explosion, falling through rotten floorboards, falling down a hole in the dark, being clubbed with a human bone, being tied up and left in a burning shed, and being drowned, so be careful and save often! "GDoML" features beautiful graphics of various locations to explore: Mallone's cabin, the woods, several locations on Moon Lake, a cemetery, an underground network of passageways, and a speakeasy. Playing as a Senior Detective, I found that the difficulty level was just about right, however, the woods maze drove me crazy and I had to go online to print off a decent map (the one included in the game didn't help me much). That was by far the most challenging part of the game, since Nancy has to go into the woods a number of times to search for clues, birds, bugs and more. Every screenshot looked the same, and the map had to be brought up each time, with no way to mark Nancy's progress onscreen. One nifty feature was Nancy's PDA, which automatically records clues, phone numbers, and hints. You can also call Sally, a mystery woman connected to the case, and George and Bess if you need clues. Most of the puzzles were of two types: numeric/dials/switches or tasks. There are several dial puzzles, a letter block puzzle, a valve puzzle, and a safe combination to crack. The other three characters will assign Nancy tasks in return for necessary items such as batteries, camouflage gear, sandpaper and a spark plug, including stacking cola cans, finding bait in the woods, taking pictures of birds with a digital camera, and organizing file folders by Roman numerals. Nancy also performs tasks for Sally, such as testing the well water and repairing rotten floorboards. The puzzles in this game seem much more natural and integrated into the gaming environment than in some previous Nancy Drew games. As with previous Nancy Drew games, there is an "alarm clock" setting to change from day to night since some tasks (and events) can only be completed then. Graphics were above average and voice work and sounds were above average as well. The ambient nature sounds were very well done (the forest sounds different between day and night, insects droning, individual bird calls, creaking wooden doors and stairs, the ghost dogs). The music was not memorable other than building tension in certain key scenes. The interface is simple: all actions are accomplished with the left mouse button. You can pan around some screens, making it closer to 360 rather than a static environment, but overall the Nancy Drew games are still in a slideshow format. One improvement is characters: in earlier games characters would only have one or two movements and repeat them while talking to Nancy, and the lip-synching was really bad. In "GDoML," at least one character moves very articulately and randomly and characters lip synch much more realistically. The attention to detail makes this game educational as well as fun: in the ranger station there is a computer with files on local wildlife, park regulations, and the history of Moon Lake. Nancy will do a good deal of reading old newspaper clippings and journals. Nearly everything is subtitled for hearing-impaired players (a very nice touch), including sounds, dialogue and cutscenes. One last feature that I appreciated was the short promos for the other six Nancy Drew games in the series and a trailer for the next Nancy Drew game "The Haunted Carousel." Overall this is a nice introduction to the Nancy Drew series from Her Interactive and a fun mystery to solve with plenty of details and creepy moments. Good luck and happy sleuthing!	1
I have been playing Nancy Drew games for over two years and I've now played all seven.  "Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake" was not my favorite.  In fact, I feel that it could have been better in so many ways.  Don't get me wrong.  The Nancy Drew games series is great.  In each game, you, as Nancy Drew, gather clues, interview people, solve puzzles, explore secret passages, and find the culprits.  The games are engaging, fun, and even educational.  And they're fun for both kids and adults alike.  The first game in the series, "Secrets Can Kill," was well-intentioned but the character graphics (and the fact that you had to switch back and forth between two CDs) left much to be desired.  However, after "Secrets," the games began to significantly improve.  You would think, then, that by the seventh game, the games would be stellar.  Not true.  I think they peaked at game three ("Message in a Haunted Mansion") and four ("Treasure in a Royal Tower").  It's almost as if, by game seven, the designers/creators have run out of ideas.  I don't mean for the plots -- I mean for puzzles, for character's wisecracks, that sort of thing.  Things that move the game along and make it fun.  Most every puzzle in "Ghost Dogs" was eerily similar to a puzzle we've seen in a previous Nancy Drew game, the only exception being the one you have to play when Nancy is in peril toward the middle of the game (this is not a spoiler; in just about every Nancy Drew game, Nancy is in peril about halfway through the game.)  That puzzle was fun.  But the others could have been better.  Also, in each Nancy Drew game there is some sort of educational element.  You learn things as you go along, from books, computers, newspaper articles, or signs.  But in this game, there was a HUGE amount of information on parks on one single computer.  Most of this information wasn't even important to the game.  Why is it there?  Who's going to sit there and read it?  With all due respect, I was just slightly bored with "Ghost Dogs."  My last complaint (and I really don't mean to sound like a picky grouch; I love Nancy Drew, really, I do) is Nancy's personal data assistant that she carries with her now.  She puts all her clues in there.  She even carries maps around with her now!  One of the most fun things about the Nancy Drew games, for me, has been that you have to write down clues (on paper, in real life), trace maps, etc.  If I happen to not notice a clue in "Ghost Dogs," well hey, Nancy (but I thought *I* was Nancy?) has already jotted it down for me.  And this was on the senior level!  I guess I could just NOT look at the PDA, but come on, it's too tempting.  Where's the challenge?  I really hope the next game will be better; from the promo, it looks very intriguing.  And I *do* have faith in the designers to make this next one a winner.  In conclusion, me just say this: if you've never played a Nancy Drew game before, you'd be safe to start with this one, since all the puzzle concepts would be new to you.  But it's not the best.  Still, if you're a Nancy Drew fan, it's still pretty amusing and so I give it 4 stars.	1
The seventh in the series, these games are relatively inexpensive yet provide hours of gameplay. In them, Nancy Drew, the college-aged female detective, explores mysteries and finds solutions to various puzzles. You can see the various improvements in this latest entry. The graphics are much smoother, and as you turn around in a given area the 'snapshot' quality is more of a flow. It's still not a fully immersive environment - in essence you go "to" a spot and then can turn left or right through set images of the room. You can point to a "hot spot" in the room to approach an item or examine it. Still, in a way this makes it easier for younger detectives to know what to do. If you can't click on something, it's not important. There's no violence or blood, although I do have to comment that the ghost dogs are rather scary! I have had younger teenage girls refuse to play some of the games I've lent them because they were too scary after a few hours. This one might fall into that category if you have a skittish nature. The dogs don't actually attack you, but their jumping on the doors, howling and rattling the house can be quite frightning. The game uses very logical puzzles that actually teach you things. You want to test water from a well, but first you have to learn the real technique for priming a pump and do it. You need to use a motorboat, but the pistons aren't in the proper cycle positions. Anyone who uses a boat would see this by looking at the engine, and they helpfully include a diagram to show you (i.e. Nancy) how to fix this before the engine will work. Notes at the ranger station warn you about Hantavirus, a real danger if you're cleaning areas where mice live. There are other puzzles - identifying birds, finding planks to get over rotten floorboards and so on - that fit in as well. In general the game does an admirable job of keeping the game very realistic-feeling, like you're really at this Pennsylvanian lake, amongst the locals there, exploring their world. On the downside, much of the game involves pony-trail sorts of handoffs. You know you need a spark plug. You might think it would be lying around nearby or that one would be in the house. But instead, searching all over creation finds none. Instead, you have to go to sleep, wake up at night, chat with someone who it so happens has one, go back to sleep again, and then in the morning use it. It can get extremely frustrating when at many times in the game you know what you *need* but just have to figure out how the game designers think you should *get* it. Still, many times this means that your gameplay time is stretched out as you wander around, explore, chat with people, and enjoy the world. It's not a game for people who want to race through to the end to have 'beaten it'. If you poke at a walkthrough site, you can probably do so in an hour or two. Instead, it's a game that, for a relatively low price, lets you wander through a well realized world, exercise those "little grey cells" in your brain, and really become knowledgeable about a number of intersting subjects. Give yourself time to have fun with this one!	1
This product keeps getting better. We still get our copy of Ernst & Young tax book as a reference, but TurboTax is getting better all the time. We did ours by hand for many years, before converting to doing both by hand and electronically. Last year was the first year we only did it electronically (even just a few years ago, most of the tax software was not adequate). This year, we are using TurboTax again, after reviewing the competition. Some minor improvements in forms being easier to access have made this year's a little better.	1
This year's Turbo Tax has an annoying anti-piracy lock that won't let you print if you install it on more than one PC, so even if you want to buy it after reading the revealing reviews here, be sure to buy a fresh, factory-sealed copy, not an open package!	-1
My gripe relates exclusively to the activation scheme, which includes surreptitious installation of a rogue program called C-Dilla on your hard drive. I've been using TT for roughly ten years.  The program itself is great, but I'm strongly opposed to the aggravation of the various activation processes used by Intuit, Microsoft and others.  I concur with the need for software developers to protect themselves against piracy, but it shouldn't be done at the expense of honest consumers.  So, next year I switch to TaxCut.	-1
Thank god I did not install the program they sent me in the mail.  This whole activation number thing is a pain and I don't intend to purchase Turbotax 2002.  I also thoroughly dislike installing software that cannot be totally uninstalled as my reading about C-dilla leads me to believe is the case. While I understand their concern about piracy, I also have the right to purchase the program that is the simplest for me to use and clearly from the information I've received, Turbotax is no longer that program.	-1
O2k3 is Microsoft's latest iteration of their cash cow product, Office, and in some ways fully realizes their previous dreams of integration and utility. For example, the taskpane that now appears stage-left (screen- right) does more than display a stacked clipboard; if you've been repeating a series of formatting commands, those too appear in the stack for easy access.  This is what computers have promised to deliver for some time now.  In this and other ways, Microsoft is finally bringing it to users in a usable, intuitive manner. Previous features such as spellchecking, grammar, integration and smart cut-copy-paste operations are all present.  Perhaps the best addition to the suite is Microsoft's OneNote, which promises to capture freeform notes and text in whatever way you like, digitizing tablet handwriting or keyboard entry; the killer app is how it recognizes the handwriting and indexes the text for finding your notes again.  Call it system-wide Graffiti for Windows. Still, this is Office and the usual bloat in disk space, system requirements, and price tag all apply.  This is a release most-targeted for businesses that can afford to roll this out to many users under a favorable license.  If a company such as GE had to pay $450 a seat, you can bet GE would be using a competitor's product tomorrow.  So for an individual, Office is still a four-star player. For anyone considering Office 2003, let me weigh in with a wet blanket on previous rave reviews: if you have Office 2000/2002/XP, you don't need this release.  Honestly.  This iteration does not contain a truly compelling feature set that will bring you to spend a few hundred dollars.  Microsoft's OneNote is good, maybe even killer, but you've gotten along without it for quite some time now, haven't you? To put all this in a single paragraph: if you're on Office 97 or earlier, and can score the upgrade, and have the bucks, this is a good release to use.  However, if you don't have the bucks, Office 2002 or even Office 2000 are still viable alternatives that provide 95% of the features at 30-70% of the cost.	1
I really like this new version of Microsoft Office.  Like previous upgrades, there isn't too much of a difference in Excel and Word other than a few things, it is Outlook which has the largest improvements.  I really like the new look as it uses "screen real-estate" much more efficiently.  The Junk E-Mail filters are better than in previous editions (much better!) and I had no problems working with my previous PST files.  Also, the ability to send busy and free times to people not on Exchange is really nice. However, I do like the changes in Word and Excel, especially as it comes to sharing with other users.  It is nice to have control over what is shared and what isn't shared.  The improved digital signature is a fantastic benefit as well. And Access.  I use Access all the time for my personal databases.  I was really concerned that this might be an upgrade like how 2000 was to 97 where you would need to convert everything over and it wouldn't be backwards compatible.  Thank goodness everything is backwards compatible.  That is a real life saver.  The backup feature is excellent as well!! My hats off to Microsoft for another great product!!	1
This is a justified upgrade for all Office 97, 2000 and some Office XP users. Office has evolved into a system of information gathering tools, a set of solutions for ideas, communication, connecting people and places. Intense XML (extensible markup language) integration for generating solutions that are compatible with today's, tomorrow and future standards. The updated applications integrate with the Windows XP experience featuring a bolder inviting interface. I am disappointed with the default use of the current theme in Windows XP, but with the new tool bar icons, it makes you forget about that. Overall it's a wonderful work experience with Office 2003. The suite offers improved reliability and stability, because of the integration with the supported operating systems. Once the suite is installed, you don't have to restart your computer, just start using the applications, the suite even has its own default programs group (finally), which keeps your programs menu less cluttered. Word 2003 includes development tools that add dynamic features to documents making them powerful than ever. The power beneath all this is XML, allowing the user to embed components for updating data in documents such as stock quotes. Word 2003 offers simple, familiar yet improved features regular users are accustomed to. Majority of the features in Word 2003 are aimed primarily toward businesses and the Enterprise. But are still necessary for the average user because of the control over information across all the Office applications. Tools such as Information Rights Management (IRM), (this controls the flow of information to specific users), persons can be restricted on how they use your Office files; whether it's printing or sharing, very powerful! Reading view is an enhanced mode of print preview; documents are laid out in virtual pages reducing the need to print. The Task Pane is also improved by offering resources to look up information on a particular topic being typed; this is a feature across the core Office applications. Lots of other great features make Word 2003 a worthy upgrade. Excel is a XML mammoth because of the integration with the language. The ability to migrate data between different storage sources and extraction of information to make it flexible in different scenarios. Tables can be transferred back and forth between applications such Word with ease. Excel can continually use the tables from documents as a data source for further expandability. It's the flexibility for data exchange that makes Excel 2003 very powerful. Outlook, is so revamped, this alone is a worthy upgrade. Three panes in Outlook 2003 make e-mail an enjoyable experience. The Mail Pane holds all of the necessary tools found in prior versions of Outlook such as the Outlook Bar, and the different folders such as inbox, calendar, etc. The second pane gives an expanded view of the different items listed in the Mail Pane, like your incoming mail, contacts and calendar, which makes reading these information resources easier on the eye and productive by providing a better view. Reading your e-mail in the third pane (Preview Pane), the user views the message in portrait layout, more content is seen compared to prior versions. Its even better to view e-mails with "Clear Type" turned on for Windows XP users. Other features such as improved Virus and Spam protection makes Outlook 2003 a great upgrade. Outlook is not placed on the desktop by default, it can also be minimized to the system tray in Windows, for users connected to an Exchange Server, this displays all the network settings available. PowerPoint 2003 offers the same features of version 2002, but what makes it an enticing upgrade is the package to CD feature that allows users to save presentations onto CD-ROMS. The PowerPoint Viewer included with each Package to CD allows it to be played on other computer systems even if PowerPoint is not installed. Windows media integration is also in PowerPoint 2003, which makes watching presentations more fun and exciting. The effects are fantastic when combined with these elements. The ability to integrate videos into Presentations to create home movies has long been a request of users, even if they have a DVD burner. For the PowerPoint 2000 user this is a worthy upgrade that provides simple yet Powerful tools to take presentation graphics to a new level. This new version of Access is also XML integrated, enhanced features such as extraction of data from multiple tables, Access 2003 also improves Smart Tag integration. The ability to design solutions within the program makes web services a powerful resource for the enterprise; the flawless integration with Microsoft SQL makes information sharing a productive experience. This makes data storing and retrieval an easy way to control how data is implemented across many scenarios using personalized solutions, allowing your information to have a stronger impact across the Enterprise. Publisher has become a mainstream Office application because of its integration with other Office programs. It connects to product databases; the Mail Merge feature is much improved because it's the same one as Microsoft Word, which offers greater ease of use. The Start Center is awesome, which makes starting publications an organized experience for the user. The interface is less cluttered and more customizable. You can rename pages like Workbooks for better searching, if you are typing large publications. The website features are easier to use; it provides satisfactory integration with FrontPage, for converting websites created in Publisher. With a total of 45 design master sets, users can create attractive e-mails that are fully compatible with many messaging services. The ability to merge data sources using text and images is great. Compatibility goes back to Publisher 2000, which is a draw back for users who might be using Publisher 98 or under. Outlook Business Contact Manager is an application that offers features for Small Businesses for generating customer reports and e-mailing customers. Picture Manager has replaced Photo-Editor; it has better image editing tools, more functionality and ease of use. Office 2003 is a worthy upgrade for many users, especially persons still in an existing Office 97 or 2000 user base. The tools it provides offers a powerful productivity experience that makes information accessible, controllable and connected for you the user. The suite and all the Office 2003 applications are supported only on Windows 2000 Service Pack 3, Windows XP all editions.	1
I am using Microsoft Office 2003 Professional Enterprise edition, obtained through an MSDN subscription. Microsoft Office System 2003 will prove to be the best in its class. The Microsoft Office Family has been revamped to provide industry standard XML and .NET support. Files can be easily shared between applications in the Office System family. Microsoft Office now includes a new research tool that allows you to easily search for information. You can search research books (thesaurus, dictionaries) and web resources. Third party developers are creating even more sources (like Google) that will make this an essential tool for anyone writing reports. Microsoft Outlook has been revamped with a new and improved interface. It is now easy to categorize messages, calendar items, contacts and more. These items can then be sorted by category! Outlook 2003 is easier to use than any previous version. Microsoft Office 2003 is a complete solution for the home and business user alike. It is an essential tool for students and developers. The wave of the future is XML and Microsoft is beginning to shape that future today. If you are new to Microsoft Office this is an essential product. This is a nice upgrade from Office 2000 or XP, but mostly for developers and businesses. If you want to harness the power of XML or .NET this is for you. Microsoft Office System 2003 will only run on systems with Windows 2000 or XP installed.	1
MS Office 2003 is the last 'Great' GUI version, imo -- that is, before the 'Ribbons' innovation happened, and the designers moved everything into hard-to-find places, and similar horrors.  Older MS Office 2000 was the last 5 star version, imo.  This version (2003) -- although superior to later versions -- did pick up a little bloat since 2000, and Help has largely become an online feature (not sure how much/to what extent), and that is mildly unfortunate.  Sad that MS _seems_ to be determined to somewhat ruin their flagship products in numerous ways (??) -- but very grateful their outstanding, earlier products can still be acquired and used, for a while anyway.  So, although not quite as hot as Office 2000, this 2003 version is more current concerning file formats, and new features that are needed on occasion.  IE:  you don't want WORD to crash when you are pasting some content from a Web page, right?  So in these instances, you're going to want a version that is capable of dealing with the newer XML, HTML, what have you.  Otherwise, there is little reason to upgrade from Office '97 for example, LOL.  I bought this used, open box for cheap!  And I am happy to say the Product Key worked, and online Activation was successful!  ...Yet this last point is likely more thanks to my particular vendor for this purchase ( Beadtribe2010 ) and whomever owned it last, for not being a pirate.  Thanks!	1
a fine product  and nothing wrong with older versions of software	1
This version won't load on Vista machine, otherwise good deal.	1
Microsoft is simply sloppy with their programming!  "Open Office" is a better program, is open-source (meaning if you don't want some paperclip's help, you simply don't download that part of it) AND OPEN OFFICE is FREE! It is also compatible with most of the functions that MS Office uses (and is upgraded with new features faster than MS's product, which is a rip-off!)  MS's Office 97 was the best of the Office suites, even though it did have it's problems, Spending the money to supposedly "upgrade" to this (or any other Microsoft product for that matter) is simply burning your money!)  OPen-source software is FREE, it's perfectly legal, it is open t anyone decompiling it, so if you want to make your own custom goodies, you can, but then there are so many written by so many people willing to share, you don't have to develop your own, as there are already *SO* many freebie ones (and some low-cost additions by some places, but most are free) that if you want whistles and bells, or even a Christmas theme in February, you can get it for OPEN OFFICE! (Not so with this or ANY Microsoft product for that matter)  Simply sloppy programming - nothing more, AND you can get a fully functioning and compatable office suite for free legally!	-1
Perhaps I am jaded but again it seems that Microsoft has cranked out another product that looks and acts so much like its predecessor that you wonder at first if you loaded it onto your computer properly.  Office 2003 gives you what you already have in Office XP (and a few earlier versions) so learning how to use it is never going to be a problem.  In virtually every way the program looks and feels like the previous Office versions.  There are improvements although I am not sure how much a home user will need the XML functionality.  It may be a god-send one day but today it is still not a major factor and certainly does not demand a major update.  The RESEARCH option is something to contend with and could be quite useful - it is almost like having Encarta loaded on your machine as well.  I found it a bit limiting though; it is good as a thesaurus but there is no world atlas, quotation source, etc.  Many people have applauded the new look and feel of Outlook.  Again, it behaves just the same as previous versions of Outlook did.  Microsoft chose to retire the Office bar and that is a big mistake.  They are trying to push the Quick Launch bar but most businesses and almost all Office users preferred the Office bar.  Don't get me wrong:  Office 2003 works very well and with Word, Outlook, Excel, Access and Publisher you can literally do anything!  It also preforms very well.  But, again, unless Microsoft starts making major changes, these releases should not be heralded as new.  If anything, they should be upgrades that former users should be able to download if they registered the original product - the cost is too prohibitive to justify upgrading.  And, as your Office 97 or XP works just as well, you should think seriously before spending the money.	1
This is the newest version of Microsoft Office. I think this is the best also because they have added programs that you couldn't get with 2000 or XP. They include:  Microsoft Word 2003  Microsoft Outlook 2003 with Business Contact Manager  Microsoft Excel 2003  Microsoft Access 2003  Microsoft PowerPoint 2003  Microsoft Publisher 2003  Word 2003 has really improved and it has much more fonts than the older versions. I love PowerPoint now and I use it a lot with work and just sometimes to fool around with. Outlook has finally gotten a new look to it which looks awesome. Publisher has even more things you can do with it. Excel has become a little bit easier with more things built into though. I love Office 2003 and no other company can even compare to it.	1
Attempt to use voice dictation has been removed. Internet access is available instantly for templates and clipart. It upgrades readily. In many other respects other than a blue color. I cannot see it differs much from previous versions. For a beginner, it is somewhat difficult to use.	1
I really like this new version of Microsoft Office.  Like previous upgrades, there isn't too much of a difference in Excel and Word other than a few things, it is Outlook which has the largest improvements.  I really like the new look as it uses "screen real-estate" much more efficiently.  The Junk E-Mail filters are better than in previous editions (much better!) and I had no problems working with my previous PST files.  Also, the ability to send busy and free times to people not on Exchange is really nice. However, I do like the changes in Word and Excel, especially as it comes to sharing with other users.  It is nice to have control over what is shared and what isn't shared.  The improved digital signature is a fantastic benefit as well. And Access.  I use Access all the time for my personal databases.  I was really concerned that this might be an upgrade like how 2000 was to 97 where you would need to convert everything over and it wouldn't be backwards compatible.  Thank goodness everything is backwards compatible.  That is a real life saver.  The backup feature is excellent as well!! My hats off to Microsoft for another great product!!	1
This is a justified upgrade for all Office 97, 2000 and some Office XP users. Office has evolved into a system of information gathering tools, a set of solutions for ideas, communication, connecting people and places. Intense XML (extensible markup language) integration for generating solutions that are compatible with today's, tomorrow and future standards. The updated applications integrate with the Windows XP experience featuring a bolder inviting interface. I am disappointed with the default use of the current theme in Windows XP, but with the new tool bar icons, it makes you forget about that. Overall it's a wonderful work experience with Office 2003. The suite offers improved reliability and stability, because of the integration with the supported operating systems. Once the suite is installed, you don't have to restart your computer, just start using the applications, the suite even has its own default programs group (finally), which keeps your programs menu less cluttered. Word 2003 includes development tools that add dynamic features to documents making them powerful than ever. The power beneath all this is XML, allowing the user to embed components for updating data in documents such as stock quotes. Word 2003 offers simple, familiar yet improved features regular users are accustomed to. Majority of the features in Word 2003 are aimed primarily toward businesses and the Enterprise. But are still necessary for the average user because of the control over information across all the Office applications. Tools such as Information Rights Management (IRM), (this controls the flow of information to specific users), persons can be restricted on how they use your Office files; whether it's printing or sharing, very powerful! Reading view is an enhanced mode of print preview; documents are laid out in virtual pages reducing the need to print. The Task Pane is also improved by offering resources to look up information on a particular topic being typed; this is a feature across the core Office applications. Lots of other great features make Word 2003 a worthy upgrade. Excel is a XML mammoth because of the integration with the language. The ability to migrate data between different storage sources and extraction of information to make it flexible in different scenarios. Tables can be transferred back and forth between applications such Word with ease. Excel can continually use the tables from documents as a data source for further expandability. It's the flexibility for data exchange that makes Excel 2003 very powerful. Outlook, is so revamped, this alone is a worthy upgrade. Three panes in Outlook 2003 make e-mail an enjoyable experience. The Mail Pane holds all of the necessary tools found in prior versions of Outlook such as the Outlook Bar, and the different folders such as inbox, calendar, etc. The second pane gives an expanded view of the different items listed in the Mail Pane, like your incoming mail, contacts and calendar, which makes reading these information resources easier on the eye and productive by providing a better view. Reading your e-mail in the third pane (Preview Pane), the user views the message in portrait layout, more content is seen compared to prior versions. Its even better to view e-mails with "Clear Type" turned on for Windows XP users. Other features such as improved Virus and Spam protection makes Outlook 2003 a great upgrade. Outlook is not placed on the desktop by default, it can also be minimized to the system tray in Windows, for users connected to an Exchange Server, this displays all the network settings available. PowerPoint 2003 offers the same features of version 2002, but what makes it an enticing upgrade is the package to CD feature that allows users to save presentations onto CD-ROMS. The PowerPoint Viewer included with each Package to CD allows it to be played on other computer systems even if PowerPoint is not installed. Windows media integration is also in PowerPoint 2003, which makes watching presentations more fun and exciting. The effects are fantastic when combined with these elements. The ability to integrate videos into Presentations to create home movies has long been a request of users, even if they have a DVD burner. For the PowerPoint 2000 user this is a worthy upgrade that provides simple yet Powerful tools to take presentation graphics to a new level. This new version of Access is also XML integrated, enhanced features such as extraction of data from multiple tables, Access 2003 also improves Smart Tag integration. The ability to design solutions within the program makes web services a powerful resource for the enterprise; the flawless integration with Microsoft SQL makes information sharing a productive experience. This makes data storing and retrieval an easy way to control how data is implemented across many scenarios using personalized solutions, allowing your information to have a stronger impact across the Enterprise. Publisher has become a mainstream Office application because of its integration with other Office programs. It connects to product databases; the Mail Merge feature is much improved because it's the same one as Microsoft Word, which offers greater ease of use.

Word is one of those products which has become a victim of its own success, and automatic features that are more annoying than the conveniences they were intended to be. Another issue is the almost non-existent backwards compatibility with previous versions, meaning that only the simplest layouts are likely to successfully transfer across versions. And it doesn't seem to matter whether you save as a rich text file (.rtf) or a previous version of Word.  To get around these problems, I switch all the auto-format features off, and ship anything that needs to be accurately conveyed as a .PDF (Adobe Acrobat), which Word is highly integrated with. Macros work okay, but are best written up in the macro editor. Text for use outside of Word is best saved as a plain Text file, and any formatting done within the destination application. Framemaker, for example.  Word is a good word processor and is not a DTP application to any useful extent. And used in its word processor mode, it does compare more than favourably with any alternative that I have tried. And that's quite a few. The font options and quality of rendition is particularly good. It's also a good idea to visit and subscribe to word tips, who have a huge amount of advice about Word in general and macros in particular.  All in all, there's not too much to complain about if the aforementioned is observed. Users requiring a more sophisticated product should consider Adobe's Framemaker.	1

I purchased this product a couple of days ago and lucky me I did not open the box yet. Browsing Symantec website I realized that they added product activation to their 2004 software like Norton Antivirus, System Works, and Internet Security. I'm a legitimate System Works and Internet Security user. Every year in September I upgrade to the new version. This would have been the fourth upgrade since I already own Norton Internet Security and System Works for 2001, 2002, and 2003. This new activation scheme is outrageous!!! I did not use any pirated software and I don't intend to start now but I change my hardware a lot and reinstall applications and I find that by requiring product activation Symantec hits me as a legitimate user since the product allows only 5 activations. In 4 months I will be unable to use it if I reinstall the OS 5 times, and here I am, a legitimate user and a loyal customer who paid Symantec for 4 years unable to use software I paid for. I find it outrageous and unacceptable. This is not what I deserve as a loyal customer ! There must be better ways to stop piracy. That said, this Norton Internet Security 2004 goes back to the store and this is the last time I buy Symantec Products. I will use my older software for a time and then find some other application suite from some other software vendor, that does not reduce me a legitimate customer to the level of a software thief. Stay away from these activation schemes if you want to be able to control what you own ! They do not protect us, they protect ONLY their revenue. I'm very disappointed in Symantec and they can bet I'm no longer a Symantec user and customer. Like the guy before me said: Avoid like the plague! We have to stand for our rights as legitimate users and the only thing I can do is to stop using these programs. They invested money in developing activation schemes instead of making the program better !!!!! Shame !	-1
I already knew something was wrong, because much of the Spam I've seen in the past six months was from resellers of Norton products.  For Norton to encourage Spammers by letting them sell their products is a very bad sign. But I have been using Norton Antivirus for several years, and McAfee's online ratings aren't much better, so -- I purchased this product online.  There was a lot of confusion and I ended up with a sales basket that included the product I wanted (Norton Internet Security Professional) and also the standard (non-Pro) version I didn't want.  The website also had added automatically, without asking me, the "download warranty" that lets you download again for up to one year ($6.99) for both products.  I zeroed out the quantities for the three things I didn't want and went to the next page, where I expected to see only what I wanted, and a chance to confirm it before making the sale final.  But no, I was charged for all four products, including the two that aren't products at all. The run-around they put me through to request a refund was MONUMENTAL, and apparently the download warranties CAN'T be refunded.  I will complain to the credit card company and get my refunds, but all this run-around is another bad sign.  Is Norton in some kind of melt-down, that they have to treat customers this way?  If so, what about all that support they're promising, if they go down? Next issue: within a few minutes of installing the software, Norton blocked and reported an attempted access from the Internet, called "Default Block NetBus Trojan Horse".  Great, that's what I was hoping to prevent.  BUT: what was that all about?  How do I know who was doing it and who do I tell, in order to get somebody put in jail?  And was it real, or did Norton make it up to justify the money I spent?  Based on the other issues mentioned above, I can't really trust them. My advice: avoid Norton like the plague.	-1
I have tried other antiviruses, and I have found this one to be the best, not giving me false detections of infection of vital files, and easy to use.	1
To be honest this is an indispensable item. Norton probably have the world's best update system for computer viruses even though smaller FREE software packages do the exact same thing except they update later (using what Norton has found, and what other packages have discovered) but Norton still leads the field. If you want the best you have it here. Norton Installs without ANY problems. I have put it on several different systems, uninstalled it and it worked every time. IT IS A SLOW PACKAGE and can not be used in the background without a very fast machine or else you will be on a serious go-slow. For that reason do virus scanning when you are not doing anything on your PC. The Live updater is great and brings your system up to date with the latest viruses and AD-AWARE! So you also get to find things that these types of FREE (and great) software packages offer. To be honest this is a must for any system. The only drawback I found was in the Norton File Protection system. This KEEPS files after you have deleted them from your recycle bin. You need to actually turn it off from the Norton Antivirus control panel and then go into the bin and delete items manually. This took me a few hours how to figure out properly but the documentation is online if you look for it. Although the package is slow - it is extremely solid, robust and finds those files that you need to remove. It may be a bulky added extra to your system but it will save your files some day and in this day and age you must have some protection (Try the FREE software packages out there like AVG and Ad-Aware to see what could be on your system!). Like I said I have never had any install/uninstall problems. It runs smoothly on Windows2000 and XP. It has never crashed on me. It finds the bad guys and kills them for me. It even finds files that the FREE software above can not. I would recommend it... maybe insist on using this software when you can. If you haven't got it then get it.	1
I have sort of evolved into the computer techie for my extended family and therefore am responsible for the digital health of about a dozen computers and a couple dozen people. That is quite a responsibility. Since many computers come equipped with McAfee and various other antivirus programs. Some did not heed my advice and they went and downloaded the freeware antivirus utilities. This may be coincidence, but without fail every single one of those individuals (about 5 or 6 computers in all) ended up being knocked out of commission by viruses. On the computers that have had Norton on them, since 1999, I have not had one instance of a virus. I know that this experience isn't everybody's, and I know that no program can stop all viruses all the time, but so far Norton has a perfect record for me, so I will keep using it. Now that they have developed the Bloodhound feature to protect against new and unknown viruses, I'm assuming that it will be even better. My one warning is that right out of the box, Live Update is not activated. I don't know why this is as many of my family who have installed it themselves do not manually activate it (since they didn't know they had to) and therefore operate with really old virus definitions until I go into the settings and turn LiveUpdate on. I have not hesitate to recommended Norton for every computer that my extended family has purchased. The never-ending rebates which often reduce the price of the software to almost nothing are great too. My recommendation is obvious: Norton is the best out there.	1
I didn't have any major problems installing this software.  The only problem I had was a few components didn't quite load correctly upon startup, but a reboot fixed the problem.  I had NIS 2003 and was very happy with it; this new version really doesn't seem to offer a lot of exciting new features, seems merely the same as 2003 dressed-up to look like a new version.  Anyhow, this software is working fine and no problems since I installed it two weeks ago.  I give it 4-stars only because the installation process - or rather problems that may surface during the installation process - can be frustrating to the average computer user.  If you experience problems with installation, you can visit symantec's website, click the support tab, click the 'home or home office support' and there is an automated support assistant that can scan the Norton program files on your computer and it will tell you what is not working right and how to fix it.  Can't get easier than that!	1
I have read the installation instructions for both NIS 2004 and NAV 2004 prior to installation, but still ended up with the same result...junk software. Why is it that I can install any other type of software and it installs and works properly? But if I installed either one of these Norton products, neither works after installation? It can not be the computer or the owner, since I purchased McAfee Anti-Virus 8 and it installs and works fine with no problems. I have used Norton for the past 5 years and for the last 2 years, the software has gotten more and more disgraceful. I am glad that I do not work for Norton.	-1
I bought Norton Internet Security years ago when it first came out. While it didn't have all the features I would have liked, it was better than anything else I could find at the time. Unfortunately, Symantec has since chosen to follow McAfee's lead in selling unbundled programs (It's better to sell 10 programs at $30 each than one integrated suite at $100), with conflicts between the programs, lots of bugs, no customer service, and a $30/year per program charge for updates. The only way we can show our dissatisfaction with this sort of foolishness is to vote with our feet. So I'm offering the following alternative, hoping that other reviewers will suggest others. Trend Micro has just come out with "PC-cillin Internet Security 2004," an upgrade of "PC-cillin 2003" (a top-rated anti-virus program---see Amazon user reviews), which offers a personal firewall providing protection from network viruses, spam email, inappropriate web content, and Spyware programs. If you do decide to move away from Symantec, you should be aware that the normal uninstall process will not remove all Symantec files from your computer (this has been a serious problem with Symantec from the beginning). In the case of Norton Anti-Virus and Norton Internet Security, the remaining files are likely to conflict with replacement software (they definitely do conflict with Trend Micro's products). To remove them, go to Symantec's website and download a file named "RnisUPG.exe". Run it, and it will remove the offending files.	-1
Okay, how can I say this nicely?  This product is absolutely not ready for release.  It is buggy, slow and basically frustrates the heck out of the user.  I am an IT professional and have used Norton for years, but this product is a complete and utter dud. I just bought a new computer so I figured I would install the new Norton with the new system.  Bad idea.  My new computer which clocks at twice the rate of my old system is SLOWER than my old system when using Norton 2004.  Also, I despise software activation.  Microsoft already treats us like criminals, but we have little choice there.  With Norton we can fight back because we have many alternatives. Bottom line?  Save your money.  Look for copys of Norton 2003 or simply buy an alternative.  This product signals the decline of Symantec and the Norton line.	-1
Norton's AntiVirus 2004 is basically the same thing as 2003 with only a couple of new features, which, in my opinion, are not even worth paying for an upgrade.  It's just a 'touched-up' version of 2003.  I was hoping for a lot of new features in this one, but they just aren't here.  Yes, there is an expanded threat detection and a more comprehensive messenger scanner, but that's it.  If you are happy with 2003, I would recommend skipping this version this year and buy next year's version.  There is not enough about this product that warrants an upgrade.  I gave this 4-stars because it does work well, in my opinion, but I am very disappointed with 'new features'.  I almost wished I would have stayed with 2003 another year.	1
I have used Norton Antivirus since it infancy as a MS-DOS program.  I have stuck with the program because it works and works well, and with each new release it works even better.  For those who use Norton Antivirus 2003, there is little difference in the program, and perhaps the primary reason to move the newer version is the renewed subscription you will receive; the interface is the same.  Rather than radically changing the program from year to year, Symantec has made little improvements which enhance overall performance.  The results have been the consistency of a program that does the job of stopping viruses and does it well. Installation: Installation of Norton Antivirus 2004 is as straight forward as it is easy.  Barring any gaffes, the program will install and then ask you to register with Symantec which I recommend since this will setup the virus signature subscription program which lasts a year. Technical Note: A virus signature is a file which contains information the antivirus program needs to defeat viruses and clean infected files.  Without updated signature files the anti-virus program would soon become outdated.  Symantec, through Live Update, continually downloads new signature files to Norton Antivirus 2004 via a subscription service which is part of the program.  However, the service lasts only a year and must be renewed-for a fee of course. Users-like me-who also use Norton Internet Security 2003 (which shipped with Norton Antivirus 2003), will find that the program also interoperates with Norton Antivirus 2004.  During the installation process the older version will be removed and Norton Antivirus 2004 will be integrated with Internet Security 2003. As is the trend in software these days, Norton Antivirus 2004 will have to be "activated" either by the Internet or phone within 15 days of installation or it will stop working. Upon completion of the installation process Live Update will run and update the program with the latest program files and virus signatures.  Live Update will continue to run in the background (whenever you are on the Internet) in order to keep Norton Antivirus 2004 up to date.  First Impressions: I am still impressed by this program.  As I stated above I have used Norton Antivirus for a number of years and I have grown to respect its functionality.  Symantec has fixed the once vexing problem that plagued earlier releases of Norton Antivirus, resource allocation, as the program had a tendency to consume more than its share.  This is no small issue since the program runs in the background.  However with the release of Norton Antivirus 2003, Symantec licked the resource issue, resulting in a much better functioning program. The sole purpose of an antivirus program is to protect your computer from viruses and this is where Norton Antivirus 2004 outshines the rest. Norton Antivirus 2004 protects your computer in the background in three primary ways: * Auto-Protect: protects your computer in the background by continuously monitoring system files for malicious code, including the boot sector, and memory.  Also checks files as they are downloaded from the Internet or from a floppy or other removable disk.  This option can be turn off.  * Inbound & Outbound Email Scanning: as the title implies, Norton Antivirus 2004 integrates with your email program and automatically scans incoming and outgoing email, or can be set up to scan either.  In the case of outgoing mail a small box will pop up from the task bar indicating scan progress.  And incoming virus via an email will result in a popup box asking you what you want done with the offending code.  This option can be turn off. * Script Blocking: monitors script-based viruses like those encoded in emails of applets executed from the Internet, and alerts you to such behavior, stopping these viruses before they can infect your computer.  This option can be turn off. I utilize all three options because I spend a lot of time on the Internet and I continually receive email, both personal and professional.  Just today Norton Antivirus 2004 detected three viruses in spam sent to one of my email addresses.  To me, the program pays for itself the very first time it saves your computer from a malicious attack. Virus Scanning: Norton Antivirus 2004 can accomplish virus scanning manually or via scheduled events which you can control.  Manual scans can be accomplished at any time and the option exists to scan the following: * My Computer * Scan all removable drives * Scan all floppy disks * Scan drives * Scan folder * Scan files Custom scan jobs can also setup and run immediately, or scheduled to run at a later time.  I have setup the program to scan my network drives every Saturday night at 2:00 A.M. and my computer at the same time on Sunday, thereby freeing me from worrying about doing a complete scan on a regular basis.  Norton Antivirus 2004 does it for me! Conclusion: Virus protection has gone from a nice-to-have utility to a necessity that every computer connected to the Internet, or a network (work or home), or used jointly, cannot do without.  For me Norton Antivirus 2004 is the best anti-virus program on the market, and I highly recommend it.	1
Outdated? Yup. Don't let the 2004 moniker fool you. This is just the latest rehash of a product that is completely outdated and hasn't had a real update in quite some time. They slap some new graphics on every year, but for anybody using Windows XP (or anything derived from NT or later) you're completely wasting your money and the only thing of value will be the Antivirus software. (Don't get me wrong, the Norton Antivirus software is slow and bloated, too, but at least it does the job well otherwise.) Under XP all the other utilities are either disabled, or very close to useless. The native disk check and defragmenter that come with XP work either the same or better than what comes with Norton. Please don't make the same mistake I did. Save your money; there are MUCH better utility suites out there for XP. And the truth is that with XP the only third-party software you really need to get are anti-virus and firewall protection.	-1
I think this is a great all-in-one utility... I have yet to be hacked and i keep my DSL connection connected 24/7... (due to Norton firewall, not included but is integrated with this) It has caught and quarentinned (sp) some viruses from web pages and email... It has found and fixed windows problems... The Speed Disk actually shows a noticable difference in performance...  It works ----> .	1
Having used the Norton Utilities since Peter Norton first brought them out, I am abandoning them. The other reviews on this page describe the problems with them, which get worse with each "upgrade." Symantec is following McAfee's lead: unbundled programs (It's better to sell 10 programs at $30 each than one integrated suite at $100), conflicts between the programs, lots of bugs, no customer service, and a $30/year per program charge for updates. Where we reviewers fall down is in not suggesting alternatives (It doesn't cut it to say that there are better programs available and not identify them by name). So I'm offering these alternatives in the hope that other reviewers will suggest others: 1. ANTI-VIRUS: "PC-cillin" by Trend Micro is the hands-down favorite. 2. TOOL KITS: Take a look at "Fix-It Utilities 5" by Vcom and "WinOptimizer Suite" by AShampoo. Another option is "System Mechanic 3" by Iolo Technologies, although that gets mixed reviews. 3. SUITES (Security, Privacy, Anti-Virus and Anti-Spam): Check out "System Suite 5" by Vcom. Note: Vcom recently purchased "Fix-It Utilities" and "System Suite" from OnTrack, so there may be transition problems. If you do decide to move away from Symantec, you should be aware that the normal uninstall process will not remove all Symantec files from your computer (this has been a serious problem with Symantec from the beginning). In the case of Norton Anti-Virus and Norton Internet Security, the remaining files are likely to conflict with replacement software (they definitely do conflict with Trend Micro's products). To remove them, go to Symantec's website and download a file named "RnisUPG.exe". Run it, and it will remove the offending files.	-1
Teenage sleuth Nancy Drew is back and better than ever in her latest case, Danger on Deception Island. This time around Nancy is visiting marine biologist Katie Firestone at her friends request, but things go wrong as usual. Shortly after Ms. Drews arrival at to the San Juan Islands, Katie discovers that her whale watching boat has been vandalized. While Katie makes everything shipshape, Nancy is hot on the trail of the vandals, along with investigating recent burglaries, digging up Snake Horse Harbors past and making friends with a local legend. Besides Katie, Nancy meets Holt Scotto, fisherman and harbormaster candidate, Jenna Deblin, owner of the Hot Kettle Caf, and Andy Jason, who runs a rival whale watching business and wants to buy Katie out. Add to that strange fish that have been washing up on shore, a string of burglaries, and an eccentric widow who launches messages in bottles into the harbour.  Danger on Deception Island is the most organic and satisfying of the nine current Nancy Drew games from Her Interactive. Several new additions include bicycling (similar to the motorboat interface used in Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake) and kayaking, WWW access from Nancys trusty laptop and more. The puzzles were excellently integrated into the gaming environment, making use of the Pacific Northwests charms: building sand castles, kayaking sea caves, bicycling the winding coastal roads, exploring a lighthouse, and digging for clams on deserted beaches. Nancy must also help Katie restore her boat to working order. There are several fun activities not necessary to win the game, including fixing sandwiches with some not-so-tasty ingredients (jellyfish, Tabasco sauce, expired mayonnaise, baking soda), building sand castles, and educational games about whales. As usual, there are two levels of difficulty, Junior and Senior Detective, and there are plenty of hints and help scattered along the way for both levels, including calling the Hardy Boys for tips and clues. There are many educational elements in Deception Island, including informative webpages about nautical terms, wood identification, Morse code, various types of whales and more that are necessary to solve the mysteries. Graphics are gorgeous (including photo overlays during the biking scenes), character modeling is lifelike, music includes rousing sea chanteys and ominous strings reminiscent of Jaws, and voice acting is above average. Sound effects make you feel like you're really standing on a lonely, windswept shore with only the breaking waves and cries of the gulls to keep you company. And you get to interact with a killer whale as well! Keep up the good work, Her Interactive! (Nancys next mystery is Secret of Shadow Ranch.)	1
Good game!	1
This is my 18th review and completed adventure in the Nancy Drew series.  First, I'd like to start by dividing my review into two factions. 1) The game itself 2) My personal detective work.  * PART 1 *  PLOT: Nancy Drew is introduced to Marine Biologist Katie Firestone through a friend [Georgia Fayne] and a week of relaxation and vacation welcomes the lady detective! Well, you know that never works out especially when Katie is involved with controversy concerning a lone Orca that made its way onto the coast.  The whale isn't leaving and Kati's boat is sabotaged. Many reasons crop up? Was it because she won't sell out to a local tour company? Is it because she is intimately involved in whale correspondence?  Hmmmm.....[as ND would say].  INITIAL SCORE: 87  CHARACTERS:  Katie Firestone: She is involved in repairing her engine the WHOLE adventure! I really don't have confidence she knew what she was doing in regards to mechanical repair.  But, I guess she had nobody she trusted and it seemed it all happened in 24 hours [which is weird]. I didn't expect her to be the culprit at any point.  Holt Scotto: For someone running for a political position such as Harbormaster, he can get pretty mouthy.  It's probably the sailor in him [ya know, you can never take the sailor out of the man....:) ].  I loved his personal quiz. Using the internet wasn't such a problem, but I was a little surprised on how much the game made me rely on it.  I'd have liked it if HER could have included a couple more local characters that provided that information through their life experiences. I know that HER doesn't flesh out it's character list with bodies that don't interact with Nancy directly, but it was also strange to hear the hustle and bustle of the Hot Kettle Cafe patronage when the place was vacant the entire adventure!  Andy Jason: This guy gave me the chills.  He seemed a tool; was that it? Was it the " Whale Rules!" anthem he irritated me by? I don't know, but I had him as my # 1 culprit because the other characters just didn't fit the profile.  Jenna Deblin: She really thought a lot about herself, but she knew how to cook! I had a chance to eat her muffins, but was never given another chance at them after the initial offering! I thought that was quite odd.  Hilda Swenson: This was a major character that ND never had the benefit of seeing. I don't remember another situation like that throughout the games I have played that avoided direct contact. I guess I was okay  with that.  CUMUL SCORE: - 1 = 86  SCORE/GRAPHICS/SOUND EFFECTS: The moodiness of the Pacific Northwest coastline was captured perfectly with fog and drabness.  The sounds of the sea [water splashing] and beach was above par.  The music had you captured in the moment when you were on a small mission and knew when to be subtle when you entered a building.  CUMUL SCORE: + 2 = 88  PUZZLES/MINI-GAMES: The chess game I got from Holt's book was awesome and right up my alley because I am pretty proficient.  I already knew about poker scoring and the plaque punch to earn a royal flush was just okay. The coordinates challenge really bothered a lot of reviewers, but I was fine with that whole system. In general, there was nothing that captured my fancy.  CUMUL SCORE: - 1 = 87  ADVENTURE ENDING:  The new scenario aboard the ship was quite interesting although I wished I could have explored more aboard the deck.  I was happy to interact with the orca whale, but I always have the nervousness in the back of my mind what they can do to humans if they are angered.  CUMUL SCORE: Even = 87  * PART 2 *  I try to solve cases without any hints, walkthroughs, etc, even if it were to take weeks! Well, it took me three days [10 hours] and I gave myself a Detective Score Of : 75  My Strong Points: I guessed the culprit immediately and I didn't waver off my initial thoughts.  I really didn't need a walkthrough for most of the adventure and I navigated well through the bay's waters via kayak.  My Weak Points: A couple puzzles were greatly confusing [sea cave snake puzzle & the wood identification]. I thought I was doing a good job with the descriptions and apparently I wasn't!  OVERALL GAME SCORE: 87 + 75/ 2 = 81 [ B - ]  BOTTOMLINE: I felt my enjoyment level was suppressed the entire game. Was it the gloomy atmosphere, was it the uninviting characters? I know that I wanted to solve the mystery, but there was no hold over me where i felt enthusiastic. This is a solid game entry in the franchise, but if you want thrills, perhaps you should keep this game on the back burner for now.  Thus far, on my list of the 18 completed ND games, DECEPTION ranks.... # 7 !!!!!  1) THE SHATTERED MEDALLION  * 88.5 2) GHOST DOGS OF MOON LAKE * 88 3) GHOST OF THORNTON HALL  * 87 4) HAUNTING CASTLE MALLOY  * 85.5 5) HAUNTED CAROUSEL  * 84.5 6) WHITE WOLF ICICLE CREEK  * 81.5 7) DANGER DECEPTION ISLAND  * 81 8) SHADOW AT WATER'S EDGE  * 77.5 9) THE CAPTIVE CURSE  * 77 10) SECRET SHADOW RANCH  * 76.5 11) TRAIL OF THE TWISTER  * 72 12) PHANTOM OF VENICE  * 71.5 13) TOMB OF THE LOST QUEEN  * 71 14) ALIBI IN ASHES  * 70.5 15) SECRETS CAN KILL [REMAST] * 70 16) THE SILENT SPY  * 69.5 17) THE DEADLY DEVICE  * 69 18) CURSE BLACKMOOR MANOR  * 67	1
As a kid, I really found this game to be quite dull. But now that I'm older, I find myself really attached to it. I think what I disliked is that there is a lot (and I mean a lot) of running around and learning. Which also happened in Secret of the Scarlet Hand, though it was handled better there. So what makes me like it now? Well, it's the most straight forward game (aside from the later games that would literally hand you a letter or a diary that told you exactly how to play the game -- and for not having those, I appreciate this game all the more, since is shows you can have that sort of story and NOT tell the player of a MYSTERY game exactly what they need to do to reach the ending). And really, the learning isn't all that bad.  I appreciate the characters more now, and the ending. I love the ending. Also, after looking at several other games, I've come to love how everything works together. All of the puzzles help you in some way.  However, I wouldn't recommend this game to new-comers to the series, or to the impatient fans. It isn't the most exciting game, so if you're looking for a game to get into the series with I'd point you more towards Treasure in a Royal Tower or Secret of Shadow Ranch. If you want a learning heavy game as your intro, I'd say go for Scarlet Hand, just be prepared as it's ending is a little scary.	1
I first got into the Nancy Drew series when I was 12 (almost four years ago) when I stumbled upon a demo online of this exact game; It was fate I tell you :D! While I might be the one of the rare guys that play Nancy Drew instead of something like Call of Duty, everyone should give these games a chances, especially this one.  Being a relatively old nancy drew game, some may consider it unfair to compare this game to newer ones. But, this game can go toe to toe with some newer nancy drew games and beat them. Here's why:  Story: 8/10. Definitely not the most interesting storyline of the series by a long shot, but the orca's situation of having people fight over what to do with it was surprisingly intriguing to follow. By the end, I was dying to know it's fate.  Graphics: 7.5/10. For a relatively early nancy drew game, the graphics are great for that time period. They obviously can't really hold a candle to the new games (Ransom of the Seven Ships is coastal too and is GORGEOUS). The game looks a bit grey and dull by the boat, but that's probably what HERInteractive was aiming for. Interiors like the diner and Whale World look great.  Characters: 8/10. The characters were pretty tame in this game, but were distinct in themselves. You have the normal number of suspects (3-5) that each have their own personalities without going over the top. None of them are afraid to voice their opinions on what should be done about the orca, which to me was nice to see.  Puzzles: 8.5/10. Some left me clueless, and I had to use walkthroughs from time to time, but they were puzzles that weren't too easy, and weren't too difficult either. Some games in the series have less puzzles and more chores and jobs. Fortunately, that's not this game.  Activities: 8.5/10. Whale World was a great part of the game, and actually educated me about the ocean, which I didn't even realize until after I was finished with the game. The diner was somewhat charming, and the orca at the end was adorable.  Ending: 9/10. Some games end with a large chase with the culprit, but in this one it's a lot of sleuthing and catching the culprit is really satisfying. No more about it though, I'd hate to ruin it.  Total (averaged): 8.25 out of 10, rounded to....  8/10.  I highly recommend this game if you don't already have it, it's probably my second favorite one in the series (behind "Secrets of the Old Clock.").	1
The last 6 Nancy Drew games have all been exceptional. They're so easy to get immersed in, with hours of fun and detective work being spent playing them. "Danger on Deception Island" continues this great series on a wonderful route, and continues to be one of the best Nancy Drew games released to this date.  Nancy's friends Bess and George have arranged a vacation for her. Nancy will be staying with Katie Firestone, a marine biologist friend of George's, in Snake Horse Harbor, Deception Island (one of the San Juan Islands off the cost of Washington state). Nancy is immediately greeted by Katie, who was just getting back to her houseboat from getting groceries. When the two make it back to the boat, they discover that it's been ransacked and vandalized. Could this be the latest work done by an unknown group that's been robbing shops around town? Not only that, but an orphaned killer whale has recently made home in the harbor surrounding the town, and seems to be hanging around all by itself for no apparent reason.  Just who did this to Katie? Who are these vandals and robbers? And what's the real deal with this orca? It's now up to Nancy to submerge herself into the dangers surrounding Snake Horse Harbor to find the truth...  "Danger on Deception Island" employs amazing graphics. Even though this game is a bit older, several of the graphics in this game could rival those used in games today. The suspects look so realistic that they almost look like actual actors and actresses. The graphics seen while kayaking, exploring the town, and walking on the beaches are nothing short of beautiful. Some real (or at least, realistic) photos of sea life are also presented throughout game play, which is a definite bonus. I felt like I was actually walking through a town by the beach while playing this game, instead of just playing a game featuring one.  "Danger on Deception Island" has some of the best mini games, puzzles, and challenges that had been seen in Nancy Drew games upon its release. I especially enjoyed the mini games in Whale World (one of the explorable areas in the game). However, are several ways to die multiple times in this game (which doesn't bother me, but does some others), and one of the puzzles that involves getting a set of coordinates is very challenging and time-consuming. Aside from that puzzle, I can't complain at all.  All of the characters had their quirks, but they were a pretty well-casted bunch. Every suspect fit the story rather nicely, and they all had moments when they looked like they could be the culprit. The culprit becomes rather shocking, as there are several clues that come up and point toward another character(s) at the end of the game, until the ultimate truth is revealed. I could hardly wrap my mind around the fact that this character was the guilty party, but it was definitely a very tasteful twist (though I still would've slightly preferred the culprit being somebody else).  The first suspect met is Katie Firestone, who's a friend of George's and a marine biologist. She's pretty strong-willed, and definitely has some secrets that she's hiding from Nancy. Holt Scotto is an elderly fisherman who's running for harbor master, and doesn't particularly like Katie's defense of a policy that forces boats to stay several feet away from the whale (as he has to take the long way to get out to sea). Jenna Deblin is the owner of the Hot Kettle Caf, and thinks Katie has a lot of secrets as to what she truly wants to do with the whale (i.e. study it instead of help it). Andy Jason is the owner of Whale World, a tourist attraction that specializes in educating visitors in facts about whales, and wants Katie to sell out to him.  What really made the characters awesome was dialogue shared between Nancy and her phone friends. The conversations had with Bess and George and Frank and Joe Hardy were all very nicely scripted. Not a single one ever felt boring. The one-time phone friends were pretty memorable in their own ways too, such as Casey Porterfield (who constantly has a hard time understanding Nancy) and Hilda Swenson (she's so... well, I'll let you find out for yourself). The phone friends in this game were much better than the phone friends in several games were, and I would definitely like to see some of the one-timers make a second appearance.  The musical score in this game was awesome, which could be said about every single game created before it. However, this game does have a bit more going for it musically, as it definitely goes out of its way to make itself unique. The game features a lot of songs that sounded like they belonged in a movie about sailors, or from a kid's special to educate children about the seas and those who travel them. I felt like it went out of its way to make itself more "beachy" than other soundtracks have to make themselves "scarier" or more "royal". The realistic sounds of waves, seagulls, and seals made the music all the more fitting.  So, is Danger on Deception Island the best Nancy Drew game ever? I'd say it ranks among them. There are very few complains that I can make about this game, as nearly everything about it goes above and beyond. I would love to see Nancy re-visit Deception Island in a future case, as well as meet several of the characters she met here again. The game is *THAT* good!	1
I had VERY high expectations for this game, and I'm happy to say that it met all of them! It's definitely one of my new favorites! I'm going to split my review up into different sections so I can give the game a more accurate rating.  PLOT - 5/5: Nancy is invited to Snake Horse Harbor to go whale watching with Katie Firestone. But when Nancy gets there, she discovers Katie's boat has been vandalized. Somebody in Snake Horse Harbor is up to something illegal, and it's up to Nancy to figure who it is! I thought that the plot was excellent. It was really intriguing and had lots of twists and turns and really kept me on the edge of my seat. The plot was so unique and fun, it's a perfect example of just how awesome Nancy Drew games can be!  CHARACTERS - 5/5: There was a good amount of characters in this game, and they all had incriminating evidence against them, so it was practically impossible to guess who the culprit was! There was Katie Firestone, a marine biologist who's nice, but virtually everyone in town hates her. Then there's Holt Scotto, and old school fisherman who's running for political office as Harbormaster. Jenna Dublin, who runs the local cafe and especially hates Katie. Then there's Andy Jason, who owns a whale museum and rivals Katie's whale watching tours. I think Andy was my favorite person to talk to because it was hilarious every time he said "And remember...WHALES RULE!" And, of course, there was the orca herself, who was very cute!  SETTING - 5/5: The setting was really well done. I've been to Washington State, and this game captured exactly what the beaches look like there. It was foggy, but very beautiful. Plus, the cafe was friendly feeling and the stained glass was really pretty. The whale museum looked just like a real museum. Everything in this game was so realistic. And the music was really cheerful and nice, and it never got annoying or repetitive, which was great.  PUZZLES - 5/5: The puzzles in this game were also wonderful. There was just enough so that you didn't feel like you were doing a puzzle every second, but you still always had something to do. Plus the puzzles were challenging, not so much that you get frustrated and want to quit, but just enough so that they're exciting and fun. That's another thing, the puzzles in this game were actually FUN, and as much as I enjoy this series, I can't say that a lot of the puzzles in the other games are fun. They're challenging, but not very much fun. But I can honestly say that I had a blast playing this game!  IS IT CHALLENGING?: Yeah, it's just the right amount of challenge. It was hard, but not so hard that I got frustrated or tired of it. It was really just perfect, I'd give it a 4.5.  ENDING - 5/5: The ending was so exciting. Snooping around, I really felt like I was in danger of being caught. Plus there was a big twist at the end in terms of revealing the culprit. I was surprised how scary the culprit got at the end, they just looked so evil! Catching them was fun, it took me a while to figure it out, but once I did I was very pleased. It was a fantastic ending to a fantastic game!  FINAL SCORE: Plot: 5 Characters: 5 Setting: 5 Puzzles: 5 Challenge: 4.5 Ending: 5 = 29.5 divided by 6 = 4.9 rounded to 5	1
This is one of the best games in the series, I think, but there are just a few tiny issues I have with it, and therefore, I can not give it 5 stars.  However, this what I thought of it.  Story-Bess and George have arranged for you to vacation with one of George's friends, in a place called Snake Horse Harbor.  She owns a whale watching tour business, and when you arrive you find out that someone has vandalized her boat.  She sets to work repairing it as you question suspects to find out that a whale recently spotted in the water might be what has driven someone to wrecking Katie's boat.  Graphics-In this game, they were a little hazy, but that works perfectly with the story, as the island you are on is foggy year round.  The characters were pretty much the same as the last game.  Sound-The music is not that upbeat.  It's rather lazy music.  Pretty much makes you think you can just take your time with this mystery.  And you can.  Although you can die, it's usually from stupidity on your part and not because someone attacked you or something.  Gameplay-The third person point-and-click hasn't changed, and neither has your cell phone.  As in the last game you have your cell phone to call people whenever you have a signal.  But sometimes you don't have a signal which is realistic but annoying.  The puzzles in this game are kind of hard, and they require patience and logic.  This makes the game last a little bit longer.  As in the title, I DID NOT like all the coordinations that you have to find in this game.  You have a GPS, and it seems every challenge is to find a new coordinate.  Not fun.  Fun-Other than that, the game's puzzles are really quite fun in spite of their difficulty.  The mystery is fun, too, as everyone has a motive to have vandalized Katie's boat.  Length-The game lasted me a few weeks, but I think playing it straight through takes about 10 hours.  This is a near perfect game, but because of just a few flaws I have to take a star away.  Don't let that discourage you from getting it, though.  This is a must have for fans of the series!	1
The ninth of the Nancy Drew Mystery Series. This is my favorite game, so I'm gonna go nuts here. Things are graded A-F, just like school.  The Crime: A +  Nancy tries to take another vacation, this time by spending some time on Katie Firestone's whale watching boat in Snake Horse Harbor. The minute she arrives, plans change! Katie's boat has been vandalized. An orphan orca has shown up in the bay and there are different opinions as to what to do with it. Did Katie's big mouth get her in trouble?  Suspects include fisherman Holt Scotto, cafe-owner Jenna Devlin, and rival whale watching tourguide Andy Jason.  I'd never had a chance to learn anything about whales or the ocean and thought this was an endlessly cool premise.  Puzzles: A +  Nancy has to figure out everything from nautical terms to knots to Morse code. People give her tasks and quizzes. It can be as easy as making a sandwich or as hard as traveling underground tunnels and counting rocks.  Gameplay: A +  This game has it all. You can spend time out on the water in a kayak, eat a bowl of hearty chowder (or maybe a blueberry muffin) in the Hot Kettle Cafe, read about the local sea monster, build sand castles on a remote beach and dig for clams in the sand.  The only thing missing is maybe romance. But you get to talk to Frank and Joe Hardy on the phone, so that's close enough. (I love those boys.)  Time Changes: None.  Voice Acting: A +  In a word, perfect.  Favorites -  "Ah. Nuts." Andy Jason  "Next one'll be on the house, too." Jenna Devlin  "Vote for Holt!" Holt Scotto  Music: A +  I loved, loved, loved the music. The travel music was jaunty and perfectly fit the ambiance of the tiny seaside town. Especially cool was the little flute trill that occurred as you finished a puzzle.  Graphics/Video: A +  Getting better and better all the time. Bonus points for the animated sequences such as the whale watching tour.  Technical: B  I'm one of a few people who have had this problem, but no matter what I did, DDI wouldn't fully install on my computer. There was an error copying files and no matter what I did, it wouldn't fix it, even following HI's advice on the technical support board. Running the game from the disc rather than installing to my computer fixed the problem completely though.  Overall, I think this one is the pinnacle of HI's goodness.  If you love Nancy Drew, this one's for you. All-time favorite.	1
This was a wonderful game!  Hours of good, solid game play.  An interesting mystery and intriguing characters.  A chance to interact with aquatic life.  I learned how to work a GPS and a HAM radio.  It was so much fun.  The puzzles were a good mix of ability-levels and types.  Word puzzles, spatial puzzles, problem-solving ones.  I can completely recommend this game.	1
It definately was not one of my favorites.  I hate not having an alarm clock.  The game was so restricted.  Also I had to restart a couple of times, because if you miss one certain thing, it will screw up the rest of the game.  I played in senior detective mode and still found this one too easy.  Then again HerInteractive still delivered quality. It was beautiful on the water parts.  Still a very intriguing.  Of course, if you are a nancy drew player.  You will have to play this one.	1
This 3D Interactive PC game with great background music and sound effects is probably my most favorite one thus far!  I read that another reviewer had to order the guide book, but you can also go online to <[...]> - go to the messages boards for hints & tips.  I love the setting of 'Danger' - the island beaches, kayaking in the cove, bicycling with your helmet on, exploring hidden tunnels and the lighthouse, eating chowder at the restaurant, etc.  Younger detectives may need help and even older ones may need to check the web site I mentioned. I think it's fun to play the Nancy Drew PC mystery games again down the road.  A NEW ND game is suppose to be released this summer:  "The Secret of Shadow Ranch".  I hope it's as interactive and interesting as "Danger on Deception Island".	1
There was a time long, long ago when I enjoy using my Macintosh.  Pleased with so fine a product, I bought many over the years.  Certainly OS X (Panther) has thrown a couple gigabytes of ice water on that romance.  But Panther has made one thing clear that never was before.  Previously I never could quite express what I enjoyed about the older Mac operating systems.  I can now.  Before, I could find things.  And I always knew where I was in the hierarchy of folders.  If I had a document in a folder, stored in a second folder that ordering was always transparent.  I could see the folders open, one inside the other.  And when I closed up, they slipped inside one another quite intuitively.  No more.  In OS X, I haven't a clue.  I do have a 750-page manual that I keep in my lap when working in Panther.  With a trembling finger on the step-by-step instructions and my other hand on the mouse, I can empty the trash successfully.  I know the red buttons close something-sometimes something I wanted closed, but more often my home window.  (Which I've learned to find after a brief but infuriating search.)  There are candy colored yellow and green buttons too though I can't say what they do just now.  It's all there somewhere in the manual, but before reaching for help try a little reason.  If the red pill closes a window, what would logic suggest about the functions of the yellow and green?  Don't bother; logic is no guide in Panther.  And that encapsulates the problem.  In OS X nothing makes much sense, intuition is of no value, everything must be memorized.  The claim is that OS X is bedrock stable.  Try to console yourself with that tradeoff the next time you face the spinning beach ball of death.  Hint: Erase your hard-drive and re-install everything.  A rock after all is a rock.  And don't get me started on the Dock.  I've read (several times) the twenty-page introduction that explains just how easy the Dock is to use.  I condensed all that to a half page of notes, which I've misplaced.  But the little icons do look nifty.  And they do bounce happily-like little corpses on deliberators.  In fact OS X has all the chrome gleam and high-tech awe of a modern hospital.  Yes it is wonderful how technology can keep a body alive on antibiotics, feeding tubes, and assisted breathing.  But remember how wonderful it once was to run free?  Effortlessly if memory serves, and without much pain.	-1
I'm a software tech., and regularly run "several" anti-spyware programs. The older versions of SpySweeper, caused problems...!  I really like the newer 4.5 version (read my review on tips...).	-1
Beware of Amazon.com if you want to buy this item.  While Amazon.com keeps selling this product, three times now I have received emails delaying shipment of this product.  This seems more and more often lately.  I have a downloaded sample of the program and it is good.  It is just really sad that Amazon.com is not truthful in its sale ads - if it doesn't have the product in stock, then say so!	-1
I purchased this because my trial software on my new IMAC had run out.  I figured that since I used Microsoft Office for years on the PC, the best bet was this program.  While it does do the basic Microsoft Office things, It also runs slow and crashes my nearly un-crashable computer.  Also, the conversion between MAC and PC platforms is not very user-friendly, especially when it comes to using Powerpoint.  If you only have text, then fine, but any addition of audio or video, you'll have trouble and will most likely have to download some free program to convert your files to PC friendly ones (which then might not play on your MAC).  It's not my favorite program and the fact that it runs slow and might crash on me, makes me worry every time I use it. That said, I use it quite often and can't complain about the final product when on my own MAC.	-1
Yeah, the title for this review sounds like a law firm. Sadly, there's nothing particularly funny about Office 2004. I bought it primarily for Microsoft Word, and have been very frustrated with the program's tendency to crash almost every time I use it. Additionally, there are so many (ahem) "features" that the program has become very difficult to use. Whenever possible, I use Word 5.1, which seemed to hit the sweet spot of usefulness and stability. Word 2004 just isn't stable enough for me to trust major projects to.	-1

A little slower, a little more buggy and unstable, I'm surprised it's still sold when newer versions of the operating system are available.	-1
IF you have pattern sensitive or motion sensitive epilepsy ( or have problems with blinking, flashing, motion, animations, etc. ) DON'T INSTALL SP3 FOR A WHILE. I cannot use Vista because of accessibility problems so I have to use XP.  2008-05-08 The Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 3 makes changes to XP that severely affect accessibility for people with some forms of epilepsy. I suspect that Microsoft is partially trying to install some Vista style features ( ripped off from Apple ). In particular, I have seen Apple style "sliding down" menu boxes or whatever they are called. As an example, open the "control panel" applet. BEFORE, it was accessible, NOW, the elements at the top of the left column "slide" down. I had enough bad seizures ( bad in this case means very unpleasant - I can actually feel them in my brain ) that, after experimenting trying to disable this abomination, at had to get away from the computer.  For people like me, my computer is my lifeline. Since Macs are absolutely not accessible, we are stuck with Microsoft Windows XP. Vista is absolutely not accessible, as is Leopard, etc. With Microsoft destroying the minimal accessibility of XP, there is nowhere to go.  IF YOU DECIDE TO INSTALL SP3 - FULLY BACKUP YOUR COMPUTER SO YOU CAN REVERT TO SP2 IF YOU HAVE SIMILAR PROBLEMS. ( I have two notebooks; if I cannot figure out a workaround, then I will never be able to install SP3 )  BTW, I review so that other people like me can find information about products to avoid and so that they can realize that the problems that they are having are common to other people. There is essentially no accessibility any more. It is so bad that it is only a matter of years before we can no longer live in this society due to blinking, flashing, etc.  Workaround: Control Panel | System | Advanced | Performance - SETTINGS Unclick EVERYTHING that allows animation, fading, sliding, etc. I am not sure how comprehensive this will be but it helps.  BTW, FULL accessibility demands that the display be totally "quiet" as far as any unnecessary motion or blinking. Unnecessary features that make Windows XP inaccessible are, in particular, "progress bars", animations for copying files. Microsoft Word has major accessibility problems. The animations associated with spell checking ( the IDIOT animated book icon at the bottom of the screen - every time you type the animations start. Also, the rippling red underline when Word autocapitalizes. MICROSOFT - GO AWAY )	-1

It is a national disgrace that Microsoft keeps ripping off the public by selling this garbage software.  Get a Mac.	-1
Windows XP SP2 is a headache especially if you are upgrading.  Windows XP started out as pretty good and then the Microsoft Committees ruined it.  People who have upgraded have had trouples with devices not working, Anti-Virus software not working correctly and guess what--IT STILL HAS SECURITY FLAWS! The IT world has had nothing nice to say about this crappy SP.	-1
In its early years, this operating system was one of the most unsatisfactory I have ever used --- including DOS, Win 3.1, Windows 95 and Windows 98.  Aside from being incompatible with older hardware, XP Home Edition crashed frequently --- especially if you often work with several windows open at once as I do. This was particularly unhelpful. As a writer, I was forced to save documents no less than once for each new sentence, and at touchy moments, literally every few words.  Most important, the program is highly susceptible to viruses and hackers. Preventing these two problems requires expensive add-on software and hardware.  True enough, the built-in firewall OUGHT to work. But in my case, hackers got in anyway -- four times in six months. With this software, I suffered repeated break ins, the last of which cost me some primary data and several of my original poems. Even installing service pack 2 did not help.  After the last go-round, I was forced to hire an expensive data recovery guru --- another story in itself --- but was still unable to recover everything lost.  Throughout this six-month nightmare, I repeatedly reinstalled the XP program, including, more than once, service pack 2. That, however, didn't plug the security leaks. My computer was completely compromised. In the end, I had to junk the machine all together.  In my experience, Mac and Linux operating systems are both far superior.  Now I've got one Windows machine --- a laptop purchased in early 2007 at or around the release of Service Pack 3 --- to run a BioFeedback program whose authors, unfortunately, had not created a Linux version.  Admittedly, Microsoft's final XP service pack seems to have plugged XP's most serious security holes. Still, after my dreadful experience with XP Home Edition, I forever swore off Windows as my primary operating system. Microsoft operating systems remain magnets for viruses and hackers --- to say nothing of endless bugs and technical issues --- and eons of otherwise unnecessary computer security checks and maintenance.	-1
I really do not like how Microsoft has designed this operating system. I liked Windows 95 through the Windows 2000 Professional Edition but this one there is nothing I like. I have a few Microsoft computers left but I have mostly converted to Apple. The Windows XP Home Edition (not Professional Edition) especially was horrible. The only difference I dramatically see is that blue taskbar at the bottom. Also the icons look a bit more 3-D than other versions. The security on Windows totally isn't too safe as the Mac OS. My computer catches viruses all the time and when I take it to a repair shop I have never seen a Apple computer there. If you are a Microsoft fan just get the Professional Edition of XP or 2000 Professional (best OS ever!)	-1
I only use windows xp when Im in my ofice as the company runs on XP.....god help us all.  I bring my macbook pro to work with Mac Office on it and I get more work done saved secure than anything on the Dell Latitude with XP.  Thus far the Latitude sporting XP Pro has lost important documents on me on a regular basis, crashes to many times to count, freezes regularly, is slow as hell, slower to boot up, the mouse drivers/trackpad drivers screw up on a regular basis leaving me without a mouse unless I restart and it doesn't freeze.  I work at large oil companies a lot and I cannot belive they run their process on this crippled, dated, bug ridden, virus laced piece of junk OS.  XP sucks folks, Vista is just as bad and Windows 7 is Vista with a new coat of paint.  If you want a good secure, fast, easy, reliable system use a mac with OSX.  I know you have heard that already and I too was a sceptic for years until I bought a mac and tried it out when Vista and my Compaq presario died a few years back 3 months out of the box.  If you want windows to run stable run it inside a virtual machine or dual boot with mac, it's proven to run better than on any PC due to the cheap hardware used in pc's these days by HP, Compaq, Dell, Acer.  Oh look as I was typing this review on my Macbook Pro the Dell running XP Pro just froze again on start up, shutdown/restart will not work, the keyboard/mouse doesn't respond, I guess I need to remove the battery again.  What a great OS.......garbage.	-1
Generally speaking, to get the best performance from any operating system a clean install of a full version is recommended. The best choice is to choose a full version of the product and enjoy the benefits of not being left with artifacts and leftover's of your previous operating system which can lead to instability in certain cases. I would only buy this on a limited budget.	-1
I remember Powerquest Partition Magic 2.0, back in the days when it was released as an OS/2 *and* MS-DOS utility you could boot and use from a set of two diskettes. I got hands-on experience with Partition Magic up to version 7, in my view their "last good" version (the best was version 3.0).  Slowly they started dropping features over time, like HPFS file system support, for no apparent reason (hey: there are some NT4 systems still running on HPFS to this day!).  Soon after version 8 was released, the corporation dubbed Symantec -which I like to refer to as "Engulf and Devour"- bought powerquest and while I no longer used it, soon I started hearing the complaints about the new "activation scheme" in version 8.x, which insisted on "phoning home" before allowing you to use it.  To boot, when I went to powerquest.com looking for an update that I know was there before the buyout by Symantec for my Partition Magic 7 product, I was redirected to the Symantec.com web page. But when you click on "other versions", you're quickly told that all Powerquest products (that is, any partition magic version < 8) are "obsolete" and "unsupported". They got rid of all the updates for PQMagic versions 3 to 7. Obviously Symantec is only interested in new sales and the dollars, not supporting former Powerquest customers (Partition Magic 7.0 is even listed and in stock for sale on Amazon.com!).  PQMagic and Powerquest Drive Image have been always superior to Symantec's Ghost products. Yet now Symantec bundles the inferior Norton Ghost in a bundle with Partition Magic 8.  It's sad to see such a great company and their products destroyed by Symantec's corporate greed. Welcome to the Symantec partition resizing utility monopoly!. Symantec got rid of their main competitor and destroyed a product in the process. It's just sad.  For a good partition resizer check out V-Com's Partition Commander, and for disk imaging, I now use Acronis TrueImage. Both are for sale here in Amazon.com. Check those out before giving your money to the Symantec juggernaut.	-1
Before I get into a review, let me state that I have ALWAYS been pro-Microsoft.  Despite all the monopolizing and heavy-handedness and rushed updates, I have always felt they did more good than harm.  I have yet to find a Microsoft product I didn't like... until now.  In a word, Microsoft Money 2005 is "horrible".  I only gave it 2 stars because it still beats paper and pen :)  Now, if you're a new user, you probably won't notice anything bad about it and will continue on your merry way.  Bravo for you (just don't do anything online until they release the second patch (yes, there's already one out) since 2005 is apparently quite broken with respect to about 50% of the institutions it claims to support).  If you're a previous Money user, pocket your $30 and invest it, using your old version to track the savings.  I was terribly disappointed in 2005.  To begin with, helpful features such as Bill Minder, "dual category lists", "in-register" spending forecast and upcoming bills, are gone.  What have they been replaced with?  I have no clue.  As far as I can tell, they've replaced them with a HUGE toolbar (a la MSN Explorer but without the option to resize) and a LOT of white space (the register displays about 30 lines max (on "compressed" view) and runs literally down to the bottom of the screen.)  The home page actually displays less information (though it is prettier in a way) and the settings "menu" is a fiasco (again, much like MSN Explorer) with numerous hyperlinks that are not necessarily intuitive.  From what I could tell, reconciliation seemed to work as expected, but seemed to offer less information than 2003 did.  I did not even take the time to get into investing since I uninstalled 2005 within 24 hours (and I am, without doubt, a "give it time" kind of person).  I honestly felt like I had less control over my finances (or at least less information with which to make informed decisions) and didn't want to risk botching up my portfolio.  That's about it.  I know it's a short review and probably leaves many questions unanswered, but I had only invested 24 hors in 2005 so a "roll back" to 2003 was fairly straightforward (and evidently necessary).  To take more time would have meant a more difficult reversal.  Again, I normally like MS products, but I can promise you this one will be going back to Redmond at their expense (30-day Money Back Guarantee).  I would STRONGLY recommend against buying Money 2005.  It just isn't worth the money (I honestly wouldn't even take it free now).  I can see no enhanced functionality and it actually appears reduced in places.  The interface has been radically changed and, aside from being pretty, actually reduced my sense of "control" over my finances.  Again, if you're brand new to Microsoft Money, I think you'll be satisfied.  However, if you're a previous user... well... you've been warned...  PS Did I tell you that Money automatically (read: "Did not ask") reorganized my categories?  It decided to treat "Dining out" as its own primary category instead of as a subcategory of "Food", effectively reorganizing over 100 transactions.  This might have been OK if Money had asked, but it didn't.  Makes me wonder what else was changed without my approval...	-1
The reviews for Money 2005 are very good -- I suggest reading them all to see what you're in for.  The big problems for me were:  1) The ability to have separate category and subcategory lists was removed from the transaction form  2) I couldn't easily use the 'Transfer' category, especially in a split category  3) Annoying duplicate account creation  On the first problem, Money 2005 uses just one combined category-subcategory list, so when you enter a transaction, you must choose a category-subcategory from one big list.  I prefer two distinct selections because it's quicker to enter and easier to find my subcategories.  Microsoft provides a Registery edit in the following Knowledgebase article:  [...]  I used the edit, and my separate lists are restored.  Great, but I am irritated that Money 2005 removed this option and provided no way for a user to change this behavior short of a Registery hack.  On the 2nd problem, my ability to 'Transfer' amounts to different account was resolved once I split my subcategory lists from my category lists using the above Registery hack.  Now, transfers operate as they did in Money 2003, which is the last version I was using.  On the 3rd problem, one financial institution has, for the 2nd time, downloaded duplicate accounts.  I hope it's an anomoly, but we'll see.  Other accounts operate fine.  I haven't explored the strengths of 2005 yet -- this was just post-upgrade issues I've wrestled with over the New Year's weekend.  On the surface, doesn't look like much new is useful to me.  On the matter of online bill payment, I already had that through Wachovia bank (formerly First Union).  I guess what's new is that Microsoft now makes bill payment through Money work with many institutions.  Since Wachovia already provided this function, I don't think I'm adversely affected...or benefitted (though Wachovia dropped the $6 monthly fee for using Money's bill payment function).  One final piece of advice:  after you install, don't open your Money data file unless/until you have had Money perform all its software updates.  For me, I opened my Money 2003 file, was prompted to convert to Money 2005 file format, and then Money 2005 automatically downloaded software patches afterwards.  Wondering whether my conversion worked right nor not, I chose to open a backup of my Money 2003 data file using the patched copy of Money 2005, so any software bug fixes related to data conversion were already installed in Money 2005.  I gave it a 2-star rating based solely on the upgrade process.  This upgrade, bad as it was, was better than when I upgraded from Money 2000 to Money 2001!	-1
Migrated from Microsoft Money 2004 to Microsoft Money 2005 last week and have been fighting with the program to get it to run properly. Spent an hour with Microsoft support in Bangalore this morning - they were very knowledgeable and tried to be helpful but they couldn't get a net worth report to run without the program crashing. Like most Microsoft programs. before version three, let it be. I'll wait a few weeks until they offer another update patch to see if that works unless they recall the software and refund my money.	-1
If you look at the definition of bloatware in the dictionary, there should be a picture of this product. This security suite hogs the computer's resources and wraps itself around it so you can't get rid of it easily. In essence, this software is the worse virus that ever hit my PC. I was shocked when I counted almost 100 threads belonging to this internet suite when the PC was idle. 100 threads!!! Especially if you have an older PC, or one with not a lot of available resources, this software will slow it down to a crawl.  Another issue is when Live Update fails or does not complete for whatever reason (PC crash, reboot, out of disc, internet connection disrupted, etc), there is a chance this software suite will start behaving unpredictably. This is ironic since this is the software suite that is supposed to be protecting your computer, yet it cannot reliably update itself when there are problems during the update.  Perhaps their notion of protection is to slow your PC down to a grind, so if a virus or hacker manages to break through, it will be so slow they won't be able to do a lot of damage - this is my attempt at humor :-)  But to be fair, this suite seems to work most of the time. I did not have any viruses or firewall breaches - at least as far as I can tell. It has some level of customization and control, although you cannot turn off some of their annoying reminders. With rebates and bundles you can get it at a low price, but as always with mail-in rebates, you have to keep copies and records in case it is not received or lost in the mail.	-1
I purchased this product primarily due to the low cost post mail-in rebates. I am myself a systems programmer and well-versed with computers. Essentially, I was distressed with having too many software products from different vendors in order to maintain a secure and healthy computer. This product had all the products and thus I purchased it. I plan to right now purchase quickly a 2nd. product - anything but this!  (a) Anti-virus - works well and good.  (b) Firewall - absolutely useless and very, very un-professionally done. Although it will give you the option to block an ActiveX, it will keep asking you at least 10 times for THE SAME SESSION AND WEB-PAGE! Each time, you have click. Also, if the user enables the option of program checking any sub-programs requesting I-acess, then you are in for a surprise. IRRESPECTIVE of what you give - Norton's window will keep popping up, in 1 case for a single program, within 30 minutes came at least 50 times!  (c) Spyware -catches nothing, absolutely nothing!  (d) Privacy control - well, let's assume you have protected 3 items and a web-site asks these 3 (among others) .. loo behold Norton seeks your permission for the SAME SESSION - 6 times!  (e) Email spam control - my friend's email landed in Norton Junk folder - fine and I clicked the toolbar teaching Norton - well it is not a spam. Next day, day-after and every day - my friend's email still lands in the junk folder. Why should I force myself to add him to my personal address book, he is present in my Outlook contacts, I have instructed Norton NOT to treat that email ID as junk - but nothing. Zilch.  All in all, a terrible, terrible experience.	-1
I installed this over Norton 2000, which I have used and had no problems with. My computer slowed to a crawl. 2005 NAV ate all my computer's resources. Activation is a problem and so is its updating proceedures. I uninstalled it after it just plain was not working. There are still remnents of it on my machine that will not go away. I bought 2005 Zone Alarm Security Suite. ZA Suite is great...uses very little resources and my computer is now speedy again. Norton is totally overgrown and needs to be rewritten from the source code. I will never use a Norton Product again.	-1
This comment is based on extensive (negative) experience with Norton Internet Security 2002. Until early 2004, I recommended NIS very highly because, when it works, it works very well. It not only keeps out viruses, it allows you to block ads and keep hackers from accessing your computer.  However, Symantec does not stand behind its products' quality and technical support is effectively nonexistent. My first experience with this was in February 2002, when I tried to renew my virus subscriptions. There was a problem and I contacted technical support but did not get an answer for a long time. When I did, the reply was 100% nonresponsive. In other words, he apologized for the delay and then simply did not answer the question. Fortunately the problem fixed itself.  The second incident was far more serious. It seemed that (as far as I could gather from other sources on the Internet) there was a Live Update that slowed my Internet browsing capability to a crawl. Here is the reply I got to my complaint (noting that Symantec did accept payment for the virus definitions): "William, please note that Symantec no longer provides interactive support for Norton 2002 and earlier versions of the Product..." Despite subsequent attempts to get help for this problem, which was apparently created by Symantec itself, its customer service representative began to ignore my E-mails and also refused to put me in touch with a manager. Faxes, marked "attention manager," to the customer service department also were ignored.  Fortunately for Symantec, the problem was finally resolved itself three or four weeks later with another Live Update (after wasting dozens of hours of my time) but I forwarded some of the correspondence to the Investor Relations department, with the name of the recalcitrant customer service representative, telling Symantec exactly why I will never buy anything from it in the future.	-1
At least once a week, this program starts giving the message "Norton Antivirus does not support the Repair Utility. Please uninstall and reinstall." This entails going through an hour of uninstalling the program then installing it again. It will work for awhile but, after an update or two, the same error will reappear. Tech support says the solution is to uninstall and reinstall. I'd rather spend an hour reloading my system after a virus once or twice a year than have to go through this week after week. I can't recommend this product, though I have liked past Norton products.	-1
I uninstalled McCaffee virus scan in order to install this product.  The product would not install.  I kept getting error messages that there was no explanation for on the Symantec website.  I figured out I'd have to pay Symantec $30 for a trouble call to have them fix up their own software that wouldn't install.  Meanwhile, I have no antivirus protection.	-1
I got Norton AV pre-installed into my Gateway 7422GX (6-month trial). It started being a real pain with those pop-up notices about "your antivirus subscription ends in x days, please upgrade", and the only options were to be reminded later, or "purchase subscription now". There was no "do not bug me again" or "do not remind me again".  So obviously Symantec wants to annoy the consumer a lot in order to get their dollars. I also noticed that Norton AV was using a LOT of resources (both RAM and CPU), much more than other antivirus I have running in other windows systems (Kaspersky AV -commercial, and AVG - Free Ed.).  So guess what I did?, I headed over to grisoft.com and downloaded the "Free edition" (free for home, non-commercial use) of AVG antivirus and I'm much more pleased with AVG now, it uses less resources and updates faster. AVG gets new virus definitions almost every day. The AVG resident shield also identified and cleaned two viruses (leaving the original .exe files fully functional, not just rendering them unusable and "quarantining" them like Norton AV often does).  And you can't beat the price of AVG!. Short story: before spending your hard earned money on this bloated piece of AV software, try some of the alternatives out there from smaller software companies that produce more efficient code: AVG, Bitdefender, Avast!, Kaspersky, etc.  I can really vouch for the free edition of AVG antivurs from Grisoft.com. Bitdefender is even leaner but the free version of Bitdefender doesn't have a resident scanner (you have to purchase the full version).	-1
Over the last several days I spent over 5 hours with techs from India (nice people) trying to "fix" Norton Anti-virus 2005.  They wanted to spend another hour or so with me and I said I've had enough--I just want a new product sent to me.  The site they sent me to wants me to mail everything back, including my receipts, fill out a form, etc., wait 5-6 weeks.  And can I talk to anyone at Symantec about my frustration and anger?  Of course not!  Try their web site and see if there's any way at all you can talk to a human being and get the customer service you should be able to get after you spend 5 hours of your time trying to help them fix their crappy product.  I have 4 computers and, when current subscriptions run out, I absolutely will switch to another company for my security needs.  Symantec has proven to me once and for all they don't give a rat's behind about the customer.  OK, guess what, I don't care about them either.  I hope they go broke with their arrogant "hide from complaints at all costs" attitude.	-1
Symantec products are getting worse and worse each year, and Peter Norton should be ashamed of selling his erstwhile good name out for a few bucks to a company that does not care about its customers.  (For those who don't know, Peter Norton made a name for himself in the 80s by co-writing a bunch of useful programs called Norton Utilities for MS-DOS and also writing a bunch easy-to-read reference books on PCs and DOS.)  The latest version of Norton Antivirus is simply the worst.  It requires activation, but that's the least of its sins.  Scanning is slow, and it misses lots of trojans and worms.  It also takes up a huge chunk of RAM, and occasionally can crash, esp. doing live update.  Speaking of which, the product installs lots of useless programs without your permission.  In short, Norton Antivirus is a big piece of spyware.  STAY AWAY, STAY AWAY!  And Symantec has the nerves to charge you lots of money for annual update subscriptions.  If you don't update, a reminder will pop up often to remind you not so gently.  Luckily, a free, full-featured alternative exists.  It's called AVG and available from a company called Grisoft (grisoft.com).  It's completely free for personal use (i.e., don't run it on your SOHO or office PC or you'll be violating the end-user agreement).  It updates daily or almost daily.  I've been running the older version 6 and lately the new version 7 for a long time and it has never caused any problems.  It's very effective.  (Too bad the new version has a less friendly user interface than version 6, but seems to be slightly faster in scanning.)  No, I don't work for Grisoft or know anyone who works there.  I just appreciate their free program that works well.  They've been around for a while and many magazines have reviewed the free AVG (="anti virus guard"?), so AVG is a safe program.  I just hope enough business users buy their premium version to keep the free edition going for many years to come.	-1
I used EASY CD since version 1. The latest is a nightmare. Here is a listing of the problems that were experienced. . . 1. The program refused to install. After several unsuccessful attempts, I rebooted my computer with the installation CD in my CD/DVD reader. . 2. By the fifth reboot, the program began to install. It took over 20 minutes. . 3. Trying out the software, I activated the video player. It "bombed" because a file was missing. . 4. I tried the main program. The "blue screen of death" appeared, and I had to reboot the computer. . 5. My Windows 7 OS was destroyed as a consequence. This forced me to reformat the hard drive and re-image my boot partition. . 6. While my OS was being resurrected, I tried installing the program on a second computer. Immediately the screen went black and everything froze. I hard booted my second computer. Luckily my Windows 7 was OK and nothing was damaged. . 7. Next day, I went to the Roxio support website, read the fine print, and described the above problems on its form. This is a "one-shot deal." The company only allowed one free inquiry with its tech department. Any more, the customer is forced to purchase a service plan. . 8. The reply was very interesting. Instead of sending a replacement disk or providing me an internet link to download a good copy, the technician needed time to study the case. If I wanted faster or better service, I had to purchase a support plan for a price. . This was unreal. The installation disk was bad, and the obvious solution was to replace it. There was no need to study the problem - the solution was "brainless." In addition, a paid telephone conversation with a high price technician was not going to cause the defective installation disc to become good. . . It is too bad that the Amazon.com website does not allow a "0 Star" rating." As a result, my "1 Star" award is the best that can be given. . . . --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- . . . UPDATE . Two days later, the technician emailed a link to download a "good copy" of the software. The program installed without any problems. . Unfortunately, my "1 Star" rating remains unchanged for these reasons. . 1. The "brainless" solution should not take two days to resolve. The problem was obvious - defective software. . 2. Limiting free customer service contact to one emailing is a "bad business practice." It is also insulting to require the user to purchase a technical service plan if further technical support was needed. . 3. Consumers should not have to pay $35 per hour to talk to a technician by telephone. This was the company's definition of "quicker and better service."	-1
Roxio Easy CD & DVD is anything but easy.  That's because it causes my PC to freeze and turns blank disks into trash.  Even after I use the Task Manager to close frozen windows, the CD drive is locked shut until I reboot.  This PC is less than six months old, and it doesn't have any hard drive or registry issues - at least it didn't before I loaded this software.  I'm really kicking myself for not taking a look at these reviews before I purchased this.  The Windows Media Center software that came with my PC does it all better anyway.  Live and learn.  NOT recommended,	-1
I've use version 5 for years so I thought this might be a little better. I had not used it since installation but today I wanted to burn a DVD and got the message "trail version expired".  I check the box and no where does it say that it is a trial version.  How many people would spend $25 for a trial version?  This has the earmark of a class action suit.  How many people got riped off with this one.  Never again will I spend money on roxio.	-1
The first time I installed this product on reboot the computer entered safe mode.  The second installation the computer entered chkdsk and replaced alot of files.  At the desktop the product wanted to reinstall itself.  I declined.  I have had computers for 25 years now, never had software act so alien to a computer.  I purchased it from Bestbuy, they declined a refund because the package was open.  Check refund policy before buying this product.	-1
Next year I am going back to Turbo Tax.  I have been doing my own tax returns for over 20 years now and have been using PC software to help for over 12 of those years.  Tax Cut is clumsy and buggy compared to my earlier experiences with TurboTax.  I'm not going to go through a blow-by-blow of the problems with this program, but suffice to say that I think it is a hard to use program which makes the pain of tax time worse, not better.  Back to TurboTax for me!	-1
After using Taxcut Deluxe software for 4 years, I was disappointed with the current 2004 version.  The software showed an Error message for the Charitable Worksheet, simply because you are expected to wait until February to download an update!  It must be corrected before filing.  So, I did more research and ended using TurboTax online free e-filing for my federal return and I paid the $19.95 fee to e-file my state return; which is the method I plan to use next year.  No more Taxcut software expense for me.	-1
I purchased this software, after reading reviews that spoke highly of it. After installing it with no problems, I noticed the computer slowed down to a point, where the mouse pointer would not move.  After I noticed that the files were done downloading, the cursor would then resume moving. I also noticed that the bootup time was extended from any other software I had used, excluding the Junk software from Norton *which either blue screened or crashed the computer*.  The antivirus worked fine, but everything else was slow. The firewall would not work with my home network or my print server, so I had to eliminate that Pc-Cillin firewall from the installed software. I had tried repeated attempts with their tech services to no avail, actually a waste of my time.  They would advise me to do minor adjustments, even after I just got done telling them I had already did the adjustments. I spoke to 2 people, and they both spoke at a below layman type language, which amused me, since I actually seemed to know more than them.  I uninstalled this software and went back to Computer Associates EZ Antivirus 2005 and Sygate. Both work great and both hold up well against the many firewall and antivirus tests I have thrown at them.  Pc Cillin has found a new home, its the trash can!	-1
I used to love PC Cillin, until they became incompatable with Zone Alarm two years back, and I was forced to choose between Zone Alarm's firewall, and PC-Cillin's.  PC-Cillin had everything going for it, except its firewall... Zone Alarm won.  Now, two years later, they have 'fixed' the problem.  You must uninstall zone-alarm, install PC-Cillin, re-insatll Zone alarm... all this because PC-Cillins' firewall is HORRIBLE... it will let programs (i.e. trojans) on your pc access the internet.  Basically, you have no control over what programs get internet access and which ones do not.  So, with two years to fix their zone alarm bug, it seems that they've forgotten to do anything else.  PC-Cillin Internet Security Suite 2005 is little more than the 2003 version with a new name, and has a poorer antivirus program.  I've found that it is frequently 'unable' to delete viruses or even quaranteine them.  I must manually go to the folder where the virus may be located to delete them BOO...  I might go back to the Zone Alarm Security Suite which included antivirus.  So... If you don't mind manually deleting viruses (you need to be fairly experienced on your PC to open the temporary .ie5 files), then get this.  If not, and you'd rather your antivirus actually do its job, go with another product.	-1
*** I don't mind the negative feedback.  I know the application can crash your system, and leave you frustrated and vulnerable.  As a public service, I'm keeping this review in place for the objective readers to use as one source of information.  Fans of the application should not measure their success against this warning.  Your experience does not negate mine; I freely admit the program may work in your circumstances, but all potential buyers should see that PC-Cillin is far from perfect. *** Based on c|net's review, I gave this a try, and could not get it to run without spawning a blue screen error (specifically the STOP 0x0000001D and 0x0000000A errors).  This error was traced back to the firewall network driver of the package, and can only be fixed by uninstalling the software.  For those of you with a technical background, the firewall is hooking into the kernel using an outdated technique (AtGuard used to use the same technique).  Technical notes: installed via web download and purchase (very easy to do, kudos to Trend Micro), onto a WinXP Pro machine (Dell Dimension 4500).  Plenty of space, definitely enough RAM and a fast enough Pentium 4 CPU.  System was recently patched to SP2.  When Trend Micro addresses that issue, I will be able to go over the feature set in more depth.  At this point, however, I cannot recommend the product to anyone who needs a 100% reliable installation the first time.  For that, I would recommend McAfee 9.0.  While it might use more CPU cycles than most, it will install and not crash your PC.  If you need antiviral protection *now* and cannot afford to play around with software, skip this current release.  Fred	-1
This was my first experience with mobile GPS. I decided after riding in my mom's Toyota Sienna that her GPS system was excellent. Keep in mind, she had a high dollar system so I expected it to be much better then anything I would buy that is portable.  I bought Streets and Trips 2006 at my local best buy store for $89, it came with the GPS locator. I had my laptop in the car with me so I installed the software and it started to work immediatly, I was impressed that it pinpointed my location as quickly as it did. I typed in my home address and bingo, it routed me onto the interstate and home. That part worked perfectly. I will say that on the way home on I-40 they shifted the road for road construction, the system was so accurate there that it kept saying "OFF ROUTE" because the lanes were temp. shifted about 30 feet onto the shoulder, that was pretty cool. Overall with this I was impressed.  What I was not impressed with was: I live on a major road, about 1.5 miles behind my place is a wal-mart with several roads that go to it. When I used the GPS system to navigate me to the store it tried to route me on a 10 mile trip, apparently some of the roads I normally take were not in the map database. In fact there was a total of 3 missing roads in this one 1.5 mile area that had been in Knoxville since I moved here 4 years ago. These are not brand new roads, they are at minimum 4 years old and SHOULD be in the map database.  Other issues I have with the software include the Pocket PC piece. While the pocket PC does display the maps perfectly it will not create routes for you. Additionally if you try to hook the GPS locator up to your pocket pc you will find that it does not ROUTE or NAVIGATE you. The GPS locator simply shows you on the map where you are, in my case it was about 1/4 mile off, this was a  huge problem for me. The reason I bought it was so I could put my pocket pc in my truck and use that as my navigation system. Not so, it doesn't speak, it doesn't route, it doesn't navigate. It's just a picture with a moving dot that represesnts your current position.  Speaking of, speaking. The program does offer verbal turn by turn guidance, however do NOT expect this program to announce the names of the streets you are to turn on. It simply says "TURN LEFT", I would have liked it to say "TURN LEFT ON MAIN STREET" for example.  North, south, east or west??? One more thing I don't like about this program is lack of detail in directions. I punched in to go from work to home and it routed me via interstates. When I left work and neared the on-ramp it said "TURN RIGHT in .3 miles", the screen showed "TURN RIGHT ON I-40", it didn't tell me east or west. Then on my way home I take the I-75 split, it said "STAY RIGHT" but it didn't display if I needed I-75 North or south. Had construction been going on and lanes shifted, etc I would not have known what road to take because it didn't say the direction to go in. Simply not enough information.  Another gripe, re-route is not an automated feature. I wish Microsoft would have put an option on the program to "AUTO RE-ROUTE" if you are off of the designated route when using your laptop and the locator. Instead it says "OFF ROUTE" and you either have to drive back on route or press the F3 button or click the "RE-ROUTE" button. Seems silly it can't do this automatically.  And one last gripe, there is an offramp here in knoxville where you can not make a right turn, it is posted and illegal. This software when I am on my way to work constantly tells me to make that right turn. That is one big issue.  Overall, the product works as expected for a $90 GPS solution. It would have received 5 stars if the Pocket PC piece actually was useful and if a few of the roads around me that had been around were in the database. It works decent, but not good enough. This is a good "test" program to use to see if GPS is for you. I have since stopped using the GPS locator part and simply use streets and trips at home to plan my trips, figure out mileage, etc. I now use a Magellan Roadmate 760 which I purchased here at Amazon as my in car navigation system.  I would have expected Microsoft, the large company they are to have a more up to date, hi-tech program. This thing doesn't speak street names, doesn't tell which dirction to go when approaching freeways and interstates. It will get you where you are going, but the lack of updated roads make take you well out of your way to get there.	-1
I've read all of the glowing reviews of Toast Titanium 7 - "makes music DVDs, multi-DVD spanning backups, cures cancer, raises the dead, etc."  And having used previous versions of Toast, I thought I'd spring for the upgrade. Big mistake.  Although I've been using computers for 20 years now (mostly Macs), I've had nothing but problems with this new version of Toast. I haven't had a single successful burn yet, on any kind of media, recording any kind of format.  I thought updating to the latest version might be helpful, but Roxio won't let you download it unless you're a registered user on their website.  Understandable - but I AM a registered user, and their system wouldn't recognize me. So I tried to open a new account, and it wouldn't let me. Okay, I clicked their "forgot my password" button, and they say they'll send me a link via email. I've played that little game for about 3 days now, and never a message/link from Roxio.  Trying to solve my tech problems online hasn't helped; Toast keeps giving me error codes which aren't defined anywhere on Roxio's help pages.  Maybe, some bright and glorious day, I'll actually get the program to work and it will merit more than 1 star. But my old version (5.2.3) worked fine, and I dropped a lot of money for a few glittery features...and instead lost all the previous functionality and raised my blood pressure in the bargain. Shame on you, Roxio!  UPDATE:  Okay, three hair-pulling days later I STILL haven't had a successful burn. It's amazing what new "features" Roxio has added this time around. For instance, Toast will tell you that you have more than enough room on your disk for the burn, then grind away for an hour or so, then pop up a message saying "Ooh, sorry, there's not enough space after all."  Or it's fun to ask it to burn a VCD - at which point it suddenly can't find my disc burner anymore (funny, it was there a moment ago).  Want to compress a long movie the way you can in Popcorn? Well, there's probably a way - but [CENSORED] if I can find it by steering through Toast's incredibly unintuitive interface.  And, oh yes, Roxio's website still won't admit that I'm a customer. If you log on with a new email address and password (as a new user), you'll be able to download the latest update. And you'd better do it during that session, because next time you try to log on, Roxio will have no recollection of your sign-in information (well nearly none - they recognize your email address, but deny your password so you CAN'T log in. Ask them to send you a password reminder, and nothing ever ever ever comes.)  I've used Toast for years, and thought it was a great program. I'm NOT an idiot - honest. But Toast Titanium 7 has so far been a complete and frustrating waste of my money. ZERO STARS!!!!!!!!!!!  (Roxio - I loathe you!)  UPDATE #2 - After a month of trying, I've finally been able to burn a single disk! Wow! Of course, I could have done this with iDVD, any earlier version of Toast, or simply the Mac's OS...but where would the challenge (or expense) be in that? Currently I'm trying to make one of the much-touted "Music DVD" disks - but for some reason, even though all of my music files are ALREADY compressed to the MP3 specs that Roxio wants, it's re-encoding every freakin' song. On a G4 Mac with dual processors, it seems like it will take about 8 hours to create a single disk. And really, all Toast is doing is adding a menu structure to an MP3 disk that should have taken about 10 minutes to burn. To quote Monty Python: "RUN AWAY!! RUN AWAY!!"	-1
This is a great product, but Sonic Solutions (Roxio) bought this product a few years ago from Adaptec and does not seem to care anything about customer service.  Good luck getting your rebate money, I have read many reports of this theft.  It does not matter how many versions you have purchased over the years, they do not care about you.  I was even locked off their forum when I complained.  There is no email, it's automatic and you get a no reply address, the phone contact is on your dime to Canada, and about as useful as ants at a picnic.  I come away feeling this company doesn't care about Mac products and Mac customers, why don't they sell to someone who does?  It's a shame a good product must be so badly represented.  Sonic, you guys are horrible!	-1
If you have dialup NEVER purchase this product. Why?  1) If you have automatic updates ON, it eats up your bandwidth so you can do NOTHING on the Internet until the update completes. Neat. I thought I purchased my computers to use, not to maintain and I purchased this absolutely worthless product to protect me while I was on the Internet  2) If you have automatic updates OFF (which is the only way you can use it given (1, then you basically have to do the updates manually when you know that you will not be using your computer. Great.  3) I have a half dozen licenses for this product. However, because Windows XP is little more than a continuing security exposure, I only use one computer on this Internet, this one. The ONLY time the other computers are on the Internet is for software updates. Normally, therefore, I only update NIS 2006 on a monthly basis or so (Since it is not needed. If you read 4) & 5) you can see why there is absolutely no incentive to update this product at all since it is just a problem). The problem is that essentially 100% of the time, when I attempt to update NIS 2006, it crashes (Internal error, etc).  4) I live in the sticks so that DSL is not available, therefore I am stuck with dialup. (Satellite is not acceptable for many, many reasons, btw). The consequences of 3), that NIS 2006 always ALWAYS crashes during the update process, is that all updates have to be done piecemeal, one at a time as I try to find some workaround to get it to update. The problem with this, is that even the individual updates fail (Internal error) Therefore I have to spend hours updating each computer: Updates | Select individual update from list | LONG download | Internal error. Repeat || Try another individual update from list | LONG download | Internal error. So, as I said, I have to spend hours trying to find some workaround for EACH computer trying to get NIS 2006 to ever update.  5) The consequences of 1) and 3), is there is an extremely strong disincentive to update NIS 2006 at all (Besides the fact that every once in awhile your license spontaneously EXPIRES and you have to solve that problem in addition). The end result of this is that I spend far more time trying to update NIS 2006 than I actually spend doing anything productive. (Then there is that wonderful Windows "Genuine Advantage", that makes the Windows update process miserable)  6) I would estimate that I end up doing several failed UPDATES, before this piece of junk finally updates, properly. That is a lot of time at 28.8K to 38.6K  Symantec has BILLIONS of dollars for acquisitions yet they don't give a damn about providing a product than even works (and they never will give a damn or provide a product that works) (BTW, I notice that as the years progress, almost all software is getting even more unreliable)  Hopefully, I have made my point (The real shame is that the other products have their own problems, as well, so you are pretty well damned if you do and damned if you don't)  Roy	-1
I had Norton Internet Security 2005 on my PC from the manufacture. When my one year subscription expired I updated to NIS 2006 and in the upgrade process it wiped out all of the setting and configuration info that I laboriously entered into NIS2005 during the last year - including several hundred blocked email addresses, firewall rules etc. All I can get out of the miserable indian tech support is 'sorry for the inconvenience - type the information in again'.  In addition to the above I have lost some functionality that was present in NIS2005 and they have added more bloatware to my system that I really don't want.  I will not buy this product for my other PC's	-1
My evaluation is based on my experience with NIS 2002. The only reason I feel obligated to give it two stars is that, when it works, it works very well. (You can ban domains like Doubleclick from accessing your computer at all, and it also blocks ads and intercepts hacking attempts.) However, Symantec's customer support may as well be nonexistent. Its customer and technical support people were recalcitrant and nonresponsive when a Live Update caused a serious problem for me in 2004, and a friend's experience in 2005 shows that the company has changed neither its attitude toward its customers nor its practices.  When I replace my computer, I will look for an alternative to anything made by Symantec because I have no respect whatsoever for this company-- an attitude shaped entirely by the company's total lack of respect for the customers who pay for its existence.  UPDATE February 24 2006 At this point I wish I had given NIS a one-star rating. Upon attempting to renew my virus definition subscription, I got the following message: " We're sorry, a subscription renewal is not available for this product. If you currently use Windows XP/2000, please select from the above recommended replacement upgrades."  Upon wading through several Web pages to get technical support, I got the following:  "The versions of Norton Internet Security listed on this page have been discontinued. Therefore, telephone and online support are no longer available."  It seems to me that Symantec has a nice little racket for digging into its customers' pockets: sell them a product and then stop supporting it so they have to buy an upgrade. The best way to deal with this is simply to not buy anything from them whatsoever. Symantec is permanently disqualified from selling me any new software whatsoever (because of the issues described above and also reviews that say the newer versions cause trouble for many people) and this is my recommendation to all prospective and existing customers.	-1
Beware Norton 2006.  I have used Norton Antivirus (and more recently Internet Security Suite) for at least 5 or 6 years.  I needed to renew my Norton 2005 subscription recently, so I downloaded an upgrade to NIS 2006, paid by credit card, and started the install.  Huge mistake...I should have done some internet research first.  Bottom line, the installation never worked, uninstall never worked, and worse, it corrupted my registry.  Finally I was forced to reinstall Windows XP and all of my major applications that write to the registry, a lengthy and frustrating process.  I had tried every trick and workaround I new of or could find on the web, and I am not a novice on computer hardware and software.  I then contacted Norton for a refund, followed their instructions on how to apply for it, and got no response whatsoever.  After a month of repeated attempts, I then contacted my credit card company, who refunded my purchase price.  As far as I know the credit card company is still battling with Norton.  Norton used to be tops, but has slipped on software quality and customer service to the point that I would never recommend them until there is some serious reform.  The F-Secure suite I am now running has worked perfectly from the outset, so I will probably never go back.	-1
I've had Norton products on my computers for over 10 years. And for most of those 10 years have experienced no problems whatsoever. Since the 2003 and 2004 version of this software program I have experienced SEVERE slowing down of my computer, hanging up of my computer when trying to shut it down, and prolonged start up times ALL of which were cured when I took this bloated software off my computer.  I'm not a software designer or a computer expert but am reasonably adept and skilled on the computer and can for the most part fix nearly every problem I encounter. I don't understand exactly WHY removing Norton solved my problems but I can tell you this: My computer has NEVER run so well and with so few problems. No crashes, no hanging up on shut down or start up, and lightening quick responsiveness once again.  The problems caused by this Norton program flummoxed until I finally isolated Norton as the culprit. I googled my multitude of problems and found that several people were have the same sorts of problems and identified Norton as the root cause. At first I rejected out of hand that a company as legendary and well regarded as Norton could be at the root of my problems, but decided out of frustration to delete the program and see how it impacted the multiple problems I was having.  Low and behold my problems miraculously vanished! I couldn't believe it! My daughter who had problems on start up worse than mine balked too at removing this program from her laptop but also discovered that the removal of Norton solved HER problems as well.  I told one of my friends what I'd discovered and he too deleted the program only to see all of his multiple problems disappear! He told me that he simply couldn't believe how good his computer was once again functioning. My uncle called me yesterday. He resisted taking Norton off his computer because he thought I was exaggerating the problems caused by Norton. He finally took Norton off when another of his friends told him the same thing. He told me he should have acted sooner thereby saving him all sorts of problems and heartaches.  I've replaced Norton System Works with Trend Micro's PC-Cillin and Zone Alarm both of which are highly regarded.  If you are having unexplained problems with your computer that your anti-virus program and spyware programs are not solving and if you have this bloated pig of a program on your computer then you need to delete it.  Norton has been getting these reports on their software for over three years and refuses to correct the problem. It is hard to imagine what is going through their heads. These fools figure they can sell junk software forever. WRONG!! They are destroying their franchise. I will not put ANY Symantec software on my computer.  BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK!!! BEWARE!! You have been warned.	-1
I have been a Norton/Symantec customer since 1991. I always felt that they offered the best choice in internet/anti-virus software. The 2006 Norton Internet program has changed my mind.  The program belongs in Beta(trial)stage and is simply overwhelmed with defects. While a poor introductory product is not uncommon to Symantec, this time they would be wise to scratch the program and move on to 2007.  Perhaps my opinion would be different if they offered a strong support mechanism. Unfortunately, they do not.  The program created havoc with my internet connection and forced me to return to my older version of 2005. When that version expires, I will seek another product.  My computer uses XP PRO and a pentium 4, 3.0GHZ processor. I truly pity those that run this program on lesser hardware.	-1
Every year the installation of this software turns into a major hassle.  The software doesn't properly uninstall  the prior version and I have a mess on my hands.  Every year.  When is Symantec going to wake up?  When am I going to wise up and buy some other company's product.  This is ridiculous really.	-1

After faithfully backing up my hard disc to recovery points for almost a year I tried to do a system restore last night.  The first time failed and said that the registry entries had been corrupted.  The 2nd time I went to a restore point earilier and there were still corrupted registry entries, but it worked better.  Now certain programs won't launch, those that do seem slower.  I'm not certain that reinstalling the software that won't launch will be sufficeint to solve the problem.  I don't reccommend this software.  Fortunately I had backed up my data files to an external hard drive, so if I have to reinstall Windows I've not lost my irreplacable photos.  What I ahve lost is hours and hours of time, time that I would have perfered using to create my digital art instead.	-1
There is nothing wrong with my existing hard drive. I am just trying to upgrade to a larger one. Everytime I try to use this program for anything, whether it is for making a disc image or just using some of the utilities, it freezes up right when it starts. The freeze is so deep that mjy whole computer locks up completely and I have to shut it down and restart it again. I have never had any other program make my computer freeze up like that. I'm talking such a deep freeze the mouse pointer freeezes. So deep you can't even CTRL-ALT-DEL to restart. I haven't dealt with stuff like that in about 7 years since I had a much older computer. This product, at least for me, is 100% worthless.	-1
Norton Ghost reeks of being a scam.  Drive cloning simply did not work at all.  I tried it several times, making sure to click copy mbr and set drive to active (it's a laptop hard drive, cloned with a usb enclosure).  Files do transfer fine and dandy as I can see them copied.  Yet to no avail would it boot up -- just froze itself.  I repeated process several times in case there was some error on my part.  Nope, no success.  Spent hours upon hours going no where.  Norton's website is an awful mess, apparently designed by high school students, so no help there.  Then I took a suggestion to try Acronis Trueimage, as it apparently was a product that could do the same job -- just used demo version downloaded from their website -- and it worked without a hitch the first time -- my cloned drive actually booted just fine, as it was supposed to.  Therefore there was nothing wrong with the hardware end.  Ghost simply is a scam that does not work. An investigation should be engaged for the consumer scam that is going on with this product.	-1
Product crashed my machine. They wanted to charge for service. I switched back to norton 2005 that worked okey power hog a 30 second sign on took 4 minutes and crahed aol. I had to reinstall my internet service... This must be a beta program with new customers as testers just look at the reviews for their 2005 products......"Warning if you have a virus or have had live-update disabled."..the symantec lustsetup on site is outdated..you may need the oct. 12th  2005  version".This applies to all 2006 versions...The automated fix did not work for me beacuse it sent me an old outdated download. This download disabled norton .I had to search the symantec site for the correct download..Once installed norton worked okey...You need to check live update,daily,and check your statistics,for problems. Norton may be disabled,for any number of reasons,such as registration failure. This would turn off your firewall,and your antivirus program. If you don't notice this in time,your computer will be wide open to attack. I hope norton patches this soon,good luck Stewart L.12/30/05. updated. Update 03/07/06.my registration fails every 15 days. System restore failed. I was an early adopter of this product. A bad mistake. How can symantec stay in business?.Yes the product works for some people. But for most people watch out my friends. Check all the reviews for symantec products,and you will see the truth. I see major lawsuits coming and yes symantec should have to pay its customers for ruined computers,and data losses,and more,I thank you Stewart L. 03/07/06.	-1
I bought Norton AntiVirus 2006 and it caused my computer to totally crash. It became totally useless. When I tried the regular support number I could never get through.  In despeation, I called their 900 number and up front I told the rep I would not pay as Norton caused the problem. He went along with that. It turned out Norton AntiVirus is incompatible with another Norton product, and that caused the crash.  When my phone bill came I was shocked to see I was charged $132 for the privilege of having my computer crashed. After numberous calls, I was told by Norton customer "service" in a foreign country that it was impossible for them to refund my money.  So if you want to have major problems with your computer, like losing all your data, buy Norton products. You can not only get a crashed computer, but will be charged through the nose to recover  .  BUYER BEWARE	-1
It is unfortunate that Norton is the de facto antivirus because it sucks! It is buggy and causes unsolicited restarts more often than any program I've ever used.  The "Norton Protection Center" triples startup time and doesn't seem to offer any value over my previous version of NA (2004) which didn't have it.  Symantec has never understood that computer utilities should be effective, inconspicuous, and simple to use.	-1
Tried upgrading from 2005 to 2006, but the activation screen would always freeze before the program could connect to verify. Problem appears to happen quite often when I searched around, but other than making sure all appropriate services and programs were running (and they were) there was no solution. Updating via LIveupdate did not help.  EVEN WORSE... when I went back to 2005 the same thing happened, so now both Norton AV 2005 and Norton AV 2006 are useless.  Support has been no help.  This is a product to stay away from!	-1
I've had Norton products on my computers for over 10 years. And for most of those 10 years have experienced no problems whatsoever. Since the 2003 and 2004 version of this software program I have experienced SEVERE slowing down of my computer, hanging up of my computer when trying to shut it down, and prolonged start up times ALL of which were cured when I took this bloated software off my computer.  I'm not a software designer or a computer expert but am reasonably adept and skilled on the computer and can for the most part fix nearly every problem I encounter. I don't understand exactly WHY removing Norton solved my problems but I can tell you this: My computer has NEVER run so well and with so few problems. No crashes, no hanging up on shut down or start up, and lightening quick responsiveness once again.  The problems caused by this Norton program flummoxed until I finally isolated Norton as the culprit. I googled my multitude of problems and found that several people were have the same sorts of problems and identified Norton as the root cause.  At first I rejected out of hand that a company as legendary and well regarded as Norton could be at the root of my problems, but decided out of frustration to delete the program and see how it impacted the multiple problems I was having.  Low and behold my problems miraculously vanished! I couldn't believe it! My daughter who had problems on start up worse than mine balked too at removing this program from her laptop but also discovered that the removal of Norton solved HER problems as well.  I told one of my friends what I'd discovered and he too deleted the program only to see all of his multiple problems disappear! He told me that he simply couldn't believe how good his computer was once again functioning.  My uncle called me yesterday.  He resisted taking Norton off his computer because he thought I was exaggerating the problems caused by Norton.  He finally took Norton off when another of his friends told him the same thing.  He told me he should have acted sooner thereby saving him all sorts of problems and heartaches.  I've replaced Norton System Works with Trend Micro's PC-Cillin and Zone Alarm both of which are highly regarded.  If you are having unexplained problems with your computer that your anti-virus program and spyware programs are not solving and if you have this bloated pig of a program on your computer then you need to delete it.  Norton has been getting these reports on their software for over three years and refuses to correct the problem.  It is hard to imagine what is going through their heads.  These fools figure they can sell junk software forever.  WRONG!!  They are destroying their franchise.  I will not put ANY Symantec software on my computer.  BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!  BEWARE!!  You have been warned.	-1
Had this product for a year and the virus definition update subscription expired.  So I click on renew and get to the purchase screen.  They wanted to charge me $49.99 to renew for a year.  STAY AWAY FROM THE NORTON MONEYPIT!!	-1
I spent three hours helping a friend uninstall norton systemworks..He thought he could install this over norton nis2006 !!Wrong!! these programs aren't compatible with each other..Both have versions of noton anti-virus 2006.!!! you cant run both...They fought each other until he got a grey screen. Nothing worked!!! I had to perform a clean windows install,and installed norton 2005 antivirus and the 2005 norton firewall...Now all is well...? we have to wait 15 days to see if the registration fails...You install at your own risk...Upgrading is not always better...You be the judge of this.	-1
I believe that Apple has made a serious mistake eliminating features from Imovie 08.  I was planning to switch to a Mac in November after OSX 10.5 was released.  I planned to switch for two reasons:  1.  Clean design - eliminate a lot of cables.  2.  Imovie - I currently do quite a bit of video editing for my church on my Dell 4600 using Pinnacle Studio 9.35.  Pinnacle Studio's interface essentially is a knock off of the old imovie 6.  Very easy to use.  However, Pinnacle is buggy and unreliable!  Imovie 6 is about 80% as powerful as Pinnacle Studio. Unfortunately, I wrongly assumed that the next edition of Imovie would be more powerful than Imovie 6.  Therefore, I have been waiting for over six months for the new Imovie to be released before I purchased a new Imac extreme edition.  Now I see that one of the major reasons for purchasing a new Imac has been removed.  Final Cut Express to me is a difficult and frustrating product to use.  (No automatic segmentation of imported video clips, no storyboard mode.)  If I am stuck with Final Cut Express I might as well keep my PC and buy Sony Vegas.  (It does not have a storyboard mode but at least it does segment video clips).  I sincerely hope that Apple reconsiders Imovie 08 and releases a true competitor to Pinnacle Studio or Sony Vegas Movie Studio Platinum.  As of right now the PC has the lead in mid level video editors when it comes to ease of use.  This should not be!  I don't think that Apple understands what a selling point Imovie was.  I have had several clients buy Macs in the last year and almost all of them wanted to play with Imovie.  These clients are not sophisticated users, yet they figured out Imovie in a matter of minutes and have been producing nice movies now for several months.  They have been eagerly awaiting the new Imovie because they were looking for more features.  Sadly they will be disappointed.  Some may be forced to run Pinnacle  Studio within bootcamp.  Not exactly what I or they had in mind!	-1
After several days of experimenting with iMovie 08 (part of iLife 08), I have found that I cannot use it. I have gone back to iMovie 06. With no ability to set Chapters where desired (without using Garageband!) no timeline editing and no sharing with iDVD I found the program unusable.  iMovie Lite 1.0 (iMovie 08) is fine to edit a 3 minute video to share on youtube, but it lacks features that are needed for longer projects or if you want to make a DVD of your movie.  iMovie Lite 1.0 (iMovie 08) lacks a true timeline, Nor does iMovie Lite 1.0 (iMovie 08) let you add DVD chapter markers to specific spots in a movie, such as the beginning of each major scene (each day in your vacation, for example).  I feel bad for people who purchase iMovie 08 but have never used 06. They may never know how good Apple can be at designing entry level video software.  But what if you want those missing capabilities? Apple has a great video-editing program for you: it's called iMovie HD (iMovie 06).  I am confident that Apple will eventually correct this mistake. (I understand that Apple has made iMovie 06 a free download for owners of iMovie 08!) I believe that the best course of action would be for Apple to continue upgrading iMovie 06 (iMovie HD) with full support for iDVD and DVD burning. Rename iMovie 08 (iVideo?) for small, quick little videos or slideshows for absolute beginners that don't want to burn a DVD.	-1
I have used Quicken for a decade and TurboTax for most of the past few years, but I am seriously considering switching to MS Money and TaxCut.  When trying to import my validated Quicken Premier H&B 2005 data into TurboTax Premier 2005 I invariably receive an error message and Quicken crashes.  Spending hours on the phone with TurboTax's pleasant but unknowledgable "tech support" has been an exercise in futility. There is clearly a problem with the TT software, but the nice young people on the other end of the phone keep trying unsuccessfully to search their "knowledge base" for solutions and refuse to let me speak to anyone more senior and experienced or even give me info on where I can forward the error message to a programmer to look into it. Useless software and lousy tech support is a bad combination.	-1
All the reviews are not for the product listed. Amazon needs to straighten this mess out.	-1
So far, I am not impressed. It did arrive quickly, but it does not work for us. I followed the instructions to a "T" several times on several devices and it would not connect. I started skeptical because there is no product on Amazon that has 300 reviews and every one is 5 stars. This is literally the 2nd 1-star review (and I think the other person was wise for not purchasing).  I've grown even more skeptical and plan on returning this product unless someone from Opticover is willing to help out.	-1
I looked at purchasing this Router.  However, one has to wonder where these ratings are coming from since some of the reviews, along with the questions folks have asked about the product, do not seem to have anything to do with this product. What's-up Amazon.	-1
After upgrading to Windows 7, my Spyder2Express was no longer recognized as a USB device.  I contacted DataColor's support and they said that it "should" work but that it had been replaced "some time ago" by Spyder3.  I should download the latest drivers, which I had already done.  Since I felt as though I was blown off, I decided to try a different brand: Pantone!  I bought a Pantone Huey and it worked nicely and it was cheaper than what I paid for the Spyder2Express several years ago.	-1
I am a systems programmer interested in human factors and usability. For that reason, I very strongly dislike Microsoft Windows, etc. Years ago, based on that dislike, I purchased a Mac G5 2.0GHz swearing to Mac and never look back.  I only lasted six months on the Mac as it was even worse than the PC. Currently, I have been forced to use a Mac exclusively for the past few months so I upgraded to OS-X Leopard hoping that things would be better?  They are not. Apple had that snob-oriented "Think Different" ad campaign almost ten years ago. Not "better" but "different". Almost entirely unusable if you are in the least bit discerning.  1) Installation was reasonably painless 2) Crashes, etc. Had to upgrade from 512MB to 1GB. 3) Crashes, apparent memory leaks? Had to upgrade from 1GB to 2GB. 4) Absolutely no accessibility for people with epilepsy. Blinking cursor cannot be disabled. Stupid ( "Think Different" ) rotating colored disk that comes up at the most inopportune moments. ( this is epileptogenic for some people ). Stupid rippling progress bars ( "Think Different", again. Unfortunately Microsoft has gone to this abomination, too. This, again, is epileptogenic) 5) Worthless help and documentation ( even worse than Microsoft ) 6) Apple applications are generally junk. Preview is worthless but you are basically stuck with it. 7) Idiot bouncing dock icons that DEMAND attention. Again, epileptogenic 8) File management is a PAIN. "My kingdom for 'cut and paste'" 9) Totally idiot ( "Think Different", as usual ) implementation of "invalid password" when switching users. The whole display frame vibrates, so to speak. I have seizures every time this happens. 10) Boot times take about ( at least ) twice as long now. Before, Leopard, we would turn off the computer. Now, we can't as it takes too long to reboot. When switching back and forth between our two accounts, in mine, the mouse speed is always hyperfast when I log in. That I don't understand. Once I open an application it reverts to the speed I set in preferences. 11) As far as crashes, i've lost count. ( this is a simple installation with nothing unusual, btw ).  OS-X is so unfriendly, unusable, undocumented that, to me, it is worthless. I would throw this Mac away if it were mine. ( I made a mistake of having my ex-girlfriend get a Mac as I thought it would be easier for her to use then a PC. BIG MISTAKE ). I don't use computers because I like jerking off with them; I use them to get work done on them. Apples are  for snobs, not people.  Comments: 1) Microsoft is trying to out-apple this lemon operating system and Vista is totally inaccessible to people with epilepsy, too. If you have photosensitive / pattern sensitive epilepsy you had better stock up on XP computers. 2) If I had to chose between the Microsoft Vista juggernaut and this Apple Leopard lemon, I would chuck both computers. Hence staying with XP 'til death do us part. ( XP is fairly inaccessible, too, but at least you can disable the blinking caret. I notice that any newer, Vista compatible application that also runs on XP, is generally inaccessible. The trend seems to use indeterminate progress bars ( the ones with the group of squares rapidly cycling across the progress bar or the one ( used by Norton Internet Security ) that ... Both of those cause very unpleasant seizures. I can't tolerate this Apple blinking cursor as I have trouble so enough	-1
UPDATE----------------------------------------------------------- The Apple issued service packs have essentially eliminated all of the problems with Leopard.  While I am disappointed that there were so many bugs at the time of release, Apple seems to have the worst of it behind them.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  I have been a big Mac fan (not to be confused with the hamburger) for nearly a year. All Apple products have run smooth and installation has been effortless.... and then along comes Leopard. I am very surprised at the number of positive reviews after my recent experiences... my highlights and low-lights after 4 days.  - Internet connectivity - I am "dropped" offline on regular occurrences. At first I thought it was our modem/router until I reset both of them only to still be offline. The only thing that worked... restarting my Mac. Maybe it is a coincidence but the this began happening the day I loaded Leopard.  - Memory HOG! I am not sure where it *went* but I now have an additional 20 gigs of hard-drive that is being occupied!  - Not so plug-and-play. I have a Logitech Harmony al-in-one remote ... it works with all previous versions of Mac o/s... but it will not recognize leopard during the set-up. I wonder how many other devices will have this problem?  - Random freezing. Seriously, this is why we dumped our PC! We were looking for a more stable operating system. I wouldn't compare it to the nightmare that is known as Vista... but Windows XP has an edge over Leopard.  - The added features are nice- Time Machine makes backing up a cinch..... but is it worth it? You also get a much clearer picture when you Ichat... too bad the internet connectivity problems reduce our ability to Ichat.    As a whole....I would like to remove Leopard and wait until a service pack comes out to reinstall it. My recommendation - Hold-off.	-1
I couldn't rename my pre-Leopard files and can't delete a pre-Leopard file without typing my password each time. I'm typing this while waiting about one half hour for help from India where Apple now seems to be going for it's help-desk. I've been passed off to three people and am now waiting for the 4th. The system reaction time seems slower than Tiger despite the promotional literature. I should have passed  on Leopard.	-1
Loaded fine for others here and there but I should've waited: it crashes on the RSS FEEDS SCREENSAVER and won't run Photoshop. The average novice or casual user will follow the simple prompts, but consult an expert first! The promises of easy back-ups and colorful add-ons (Safari, I'll admit, is a lot cooler) can't restore what just won't run right... and I keep a tidy Mac.  Slowed down my eMac to an unbelievably crawl. Reinstalled with an archive, but no change.  Nice overall look and nice features... IF they work for you, but "Dr Mac" Bob Levitus advises to wait; you'd better listen. I can't get ANY help on fixes and Apple's forum is really a long list of people begging for help.  Love Apple, but...	-1
This "software" is extremely slow, even on a new iMac with 4GB of RAM.  Trying to turn it off causes the "pinwheel of death" to spin until the system is rebooted.  The interface is unbelievably clumsy, and the documentation is a joke.  I would give this product zero stars if I could.  Stick with Bootcamp or else try a vastly superior product, VMWare Fusion.	-1
I have a PowerMac G5 and Dell notebook. The notebook went bad so purchase MacBook with Windows XP and Parallels. After working all day getting Parallels and Windows installed and up and running, I thought my life was great. Then after a week things quite working. Parallels would not boot Windows no matter what I tried. The manual is not written for the average business user and has several mistakes in it. They provide an additional manual to try to correct the mistakes in the first manual with such things as, " on Page 3 replace step 4 with the following . . . next place the content of . . .  in the second bullet, the name should be corrented . . ." Then you have to go to their website to find corrections to these corrections. The manual is written in true computer geek language and not for the person that doesn't make his living working on and with computers. Parallels offers support at $30/call or by email that doesn't work. They only work during business hours on West coast time. Suggestion - if you need Windows, buy a PC of Boot Camp.	-1
After years of waiting for Intuit to issue a proper upgrade of Quicken for Mac 2007 with cross-platform compatibility to its Windows range, I gave up in late 2012. I migrated all my financial data to&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/iBank-4/dp/B003WT1KAK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">iBank 4</a>, a far more full-featured and better-supported application. The tipping point was to be told in October 2012 by Intuit not only that there is still no full upgrade to Quicken for Mac 2007, but also that as I'm not a US resident Intuit would not even provide me with the Mac OS X 10.7 Lion-compatible version of Quicken for Mac 2007 from the PowerPC version (16.0.2.- R3) I had been using!  I was a long-term user of Quicken, with 14 years of financial data recorded in it from June 1998 to October 2012.  I had been using both Macs and PCs (Macs preferred) since 1984. I migrated my financial data to Quicken in 1998 from an earlier Mac personal accounting application called Dollars & $ense, from a company called Monogram which went out of business about the same time their product succumbed to the Y2K bug.  Intuit long has had a popular and evidently well-supported financial software range for Windows, but its product development and support for the Mac platform went into terminal decline after 2007. Its support and customer service for Mac users now have degraded to a point of non-existence or uselessness. What totally impenetrable thinking led Intuit to this incredible outcome?  The answer is a mystery. Would Microsoft throw away its market advantage by failing to maintain cross-platform compatibility between Mac and Windows versions of MS Office, or Adobe its cross-platform compatible market dominance in imagery and PDF processing? No way!  When the initially excellent Quicken for Mac 2007 started showing its age, Intuit engaged in some two years of beta-testing and consultation with the Mac-user community.  This was among the largest scale, most hyped beta-testing and consumer consultations ever for any Mac product. It turned out that the long promised, much hyped Quicken Mac upgrade was nothing but vaporware. The only result was a dumbed-down standalone product, so-called&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Quicken-Essentials-for-Mac-Download/dp/B003PDMNCC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Quicken Essentials for Mac  [Download</a>], the exact opposite of everything that the Mac-user community told Intuit we need!  Is it any wonder that we Mac users feel that Intuit has treated us with contempt?  Intuit's failure to build on its market potential with Mac users is a tragedy and farce. I highly recommended Quicken for Mac 2007 in earlier times when it was justly the market leader. Now, sadly, I must strongly recommend that Mac users avoid the product and its makers.  More than seven years now have passed since this last release of Quicken for Mac, in August 2006. Intuit never updated this out-of-date product -- merely patched it two or three times when its bugs and incompatibilities stopped it working in new versions of Mac OS X. Since 2010 Intuit has not even updated its only other personal finance software for Mac, the absurdly named&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Quicken-Essentials-for-Mac-Download/dp/B003PDMNCC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Quicken Essentials for Mac  [Download</a>], a downgrade of Quicken for Mac which has even fewer essential features than its obsolete predecessor.  What on earth has been going on at Intuit that it has abandoned Mac product development? My best guess is that some totally unrealistic and irrational feedback, typically from a small number of noisy Mac personal finance users, has convinced Intuit that we Mac users are just creative types and airheads with no grasp of the mathematical logic, rational thinking and work discipline required to use full-featured personal financial accounting.  The unreasonableness of some customer negative feedback on personal finance software would be enough to alienate the most helpful software developers. Typically, the noisiest unreasonableless ranges across complaints about non-core, third party functions like bank downloads; blaming software for user error, or the consequences of user failure to read user manuals or to follow simple universal accounting principles. Has this unreasonableness convinced not only Intuit, but also other personal finance software makers, that we Mac users are financial and computer illiterates not worth their time and trouble? Could the impossible-to-satisfy high maintenance demands of financially illiterate customers also explain why even Microsoft never released its former personal finance product, Microsoft Money, for Mac -- and discontinued it for Windows in 2009?  Since migrating from Quicken for Mac 2007 to iBank in 2012, I am now in my third year with iBank. I highly recommend the current version&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/iBank-5-Download/dp/B00GUXLRCQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">iBank 5 [Download</a>] to all Mac users who are unafraid of the tiny amount of work, rational thinking and user manual reading necessary for serious, accurate personal finance recordkeeping. iBank's makers, IGG Software (with whom I have no association, except as a satisfied paying customer) specialize only in personal finance software for the Mac OS and portable iOS devices, iPad, iPhone and iPod Touch.  I have almost 16 years of continuous, detailed, accurate data in iBank. This is the best move I ever made in personal finance recordkeeping -- but the most unrealistic, unreasonable and absurd remarks I ever have seen about personal finance software continue to flow in attacks on iBank. Among the most absurd claims is that either of the two outdated Quicken personal finance products is as good as, or better than, the state-of-the-art iBank software, which has had more feature-rich updates in the past year than both Quicken Mac products in their combined lifetimes. This is not a matter of opinion or taste: it is objective fact about all the long list of capabilities iBank has, which are lacked by the Quicken Mac deficient duo.  In these days of widespread fake review writing, star ratings averaged from total positive or negative reviews in Amazon are less trustworthy than ever for product evaluation. Unfortunately, there is no certain method for distinguishing a merely silly or misinformed review from a fake. Significantly, a much higher proportion of helpful customer votes (far more difficult to fake than reviews) appears in Amazon on substantiated, detailed and factual positive reviews of iBank than on negative reviews and comments. The distribution of helpful votes gives the most accurate picture of what the Amazon customer community really thinks about products. It is unsurprising to find, on this measure, that Amazon customers rate an Intuit product,&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Quicken-Essentials-for-Mac-Download/dp/B003PDMNCC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Quicken Essentials for Mac  [Download</a>], the worst of all personal finance software -- not only for the Mac OS, but for Windows, Unix and *all* operating systems.	-1
Absolutely no relation to the Windows version except in name.  A complete disaster that is both a visual and physical mess. If you like the look of the Windows versions, be prepared for a shock - Mac's version is completely different.  Claims to convert QIF files from Windows to Mac which it does -- too bad the end result is nothing like what you previously had.  Loses figures and accounts quicker than you can blink an eye or will mistake one entry for another because the entry code is different from Windows to Mac (for no apparent reason).  Fortunately, I had  60 day money back guarantee.  Took me all of a week to figure out what a disaster this was before I got my money back.	-1
Mac version is a shadow of the PC iteration.  The "One Step Update" basically doesn;t exist since the Mac version requires a more advanced sync system on he bank side than the PC version.  This is NOT worth the Amazon price in the least.  If it ws 20-30 less, maybe.  For now, stick with Boot Camp or a separate PC and run that version.  PS The Mac and PC versions are incompatible, so even the migration is a royal pain...	-1
I own  Quicken Deluxe 2006.  I used Quickbooks PRO in my office for 5 years and found that Quickbooks Pro was easy to use. Quicken Deluxe is a wreck.  It is not at all intuitive. It can't tell that there is a difference between when a check is written and when it clears. The numbers it downloads from brokerages etc don't correlate with what one finds on the brokerage web site. I suppose that there is a reason but I wanted this program to save me time not make more work. So far it has been much more work.  If you are obsessed with money and want to spend all your time playing what amounts to an online game with Quicken then I suppose that you might like this program.  I don't have any suggestions for an alternative but there must be something better.  I think that you would do better making your own Excel spreadsheet or downloading one of the free ones that are available.	-1
I have been a Quicken user for 13 years.  I upgraded to 2007 and it lost some of my data during the conversion.  After several hours with support (live chat) they never found a solution.  Then they say to call them and Intuit wants to charge me twenty four dollars to get assistance for their bug.  Sorry Intuit, you have gotten too big and have forgotten the customers who made you.  Over the last few years your customer service has gotten worse.  You just don't care anymore.  I think it may be time for me to move on to other vendors.  If you are happy with your current, reliable, Quicken version stick with it.  I was on 2002 and am going back to it.  However, I think I will try out some of Quickens competitors.  Never thought I would say that as a huge Quicken fan.	-1
I will definitely NOT buy this product.  I refuse to be RIPPED OFF $10 for EACH AND EVERY time you e-maill or call customer service.  This is totally ludicrous, and the support service should be included with the purchase of the product.  Apparent Nuance Dragon Naturally Speaking is trying to squeeze every nickle and dime out of their customers.  I refuse to by any product by a company that will do that to their customers.  I think this is about the ONLY company that charges for their support.  Try to find an alternative voice recognition software company who will support their product free of charge.  SHAME ON YOU, NUANCE DRAGON NATURALLY SPEAKING.	-1

I originally posted a review of this product which disappeared into the Amazon ether.  Just as well, because it was a more or less positive review and now, even though I have fibromyalgia and typing hurts, I'd rather be in pain than use Dragon Naturally Speaking.  First of all, while it will run on all but the oldest computers, it slows everything way down.  Try running it while you've got anti-virus software running and the lag time after you dictate is really annoying, especially when you realize it's garbled what you said quite badly, or made strange choices among homophones.  It has a particularly bad time with a standard American accent. It does much better if you speak with an exaggerated New York accent (think Mike Meyers doing "Coffee Talk" on SNL).  Otherwise, if you pronounce "dawn" and "Don" the same, it will choose Don everytime, even if the context doesn't make sense.  It's probably great for dictating things like book reports using simple, common words and not too many names or capitalized terms, but if you are dictating something complex or with a lot of specialized terms or abbreviations, or defined terms that are capitalized, it leaves a lot to be desired.  And you've got to get it right the first time, because moving around within a document to edit is downright irritating, especially if you want to correct a word that appears multiple times.  It's supposed to get better the longer you use the program and the more it gets "trained," but honestly it just gets worse.  The program also has an annoying habit of thinking ordinary dictation is a command word and opening up a pull-down menu when you least expect or want it to.  If you really can't type, it's better than nothing, but unless you also use a headset for voice over internet applications, you'll probably want to get a desktop microphone for use with this -- the headset that comes with the software isn't comfortable for extended periods of time and the standard software doesn't work with BlueTooth headsets.  I haven't used this program in a really long time.  It's just too frustrating, so unless I am writing something really long, I'd rather hurt a little.  It would be great for a more phonetic language, but for English it leaves a lot to be desired.	-1
I worked as a radio broadcaster doing news and advertising at large stations. But no matter how well I can enunciate, training this software has proved nearly impossible - at least for me. It fails to work well when attempting to dictate a short sentence or a long one. I spent two full days following their tutorial to get it to work properly. Because they have only high cost manufacturer's support I have avoided contacting them -- especially when the history of factory support for software has not been exemplary. Dragon Speaking Naturally is sure not worth the price they're asking for it. Very disappointing.	-1

PLEASE NOTE -- I'm TYPING this paragraph, but the REST of the review was dictated (unedited for insertion here, except where noted therein) by using Dragon NaturallySpeaking 9 Preferred, using the minimum required training, even though the product is advertised as requiring NO training.  Use your imagination to figure out what I was really saying during that dictation!  The first thing I thought was important to note in this review was that there are a couple full Asia's comments that were used in the advertising for this product on Amazon.com.  First, the advertisement states that, "no script reading required to get started", and "require no training," which are both statements that are utterly untrue.  As soon as installation is completed, you are asked to begin training for the new user -- just as in previous versions. I'm as shocked as such blatantly false statements could be made in the product's manufacturer or not get in trouble for making them.  When you began in and immediately insisted she go to the standard training, in fact I think it's the same training required in Virgin eight with the same selections.  In fact, I tried starting dictation without doing any training, and I was informed that the user files were not ready to allow this user to begin dictation yet; instead, I was required to get into the same training as was required in Virgin eight before I could do any dictation.  Thus, the reason for my giving this product such a low rating out of the box is because of the false advertising, backspace; if it gets better I mean in my original rating to reflect improvements in the product if they happen during further use in training.  "Mean in my" in that last sentence was actually "I may emend" (had to type those three words by hand).  As to whether this program's (that word originally came out as "Koran's"!) dictation is 99% correct as adverse ties in the description, you can be the judge from this dictation's accuracy or inaccuracy.  Oh yes, I also had the same problem of us have had with insistence of either register and reregister and reregister the product.  It is very possible, and that it will improve with use.  However, I'm very frustrated that I opted to delete my previous user files from Virgin eight because I was told by the advertisement of a product that there was no dictation necessary which suggested that I did not need mild user files.  The word "mild" in the previous sentence actually was "my old."  So much for 99% accuracy.  So far, I can't really tell any difference in original accuracy over Virgin eight, other than the fact that the Dragon bar is graphics look a little different.  The tutorials are the saying with the exception of a small addition of conveying its(that was Advanced) tutorials covering a small amount of information.  The training looks the same date, the N. accuracy at star looks about the same, as Virgin eight.  I hope this will improve with training, but I have to say that I'm definitely not throw for false advertising regarding a lack of training needed to begin using this product.  Other than the addition of an extra installation disk or a DVD, I'm really beginning to wonder if there is any difference for improvement with Virgin nine over Virgin eight, other than the fact that I just blew another [...], after the rebate a having gotten yet, to "upgrade."  And, by the way, I truly do not speak ungrammatical he, which I'm guessing is the impression you getting from the gobbledygook you reading here.  Point being, what comes out of my mouth does not as necessarily equal what comes out on the page.  Again judge for yourself the insistence that there is no training needed you can start right away and then it is 99% accurate.  That is In Oh TE what I just said, and so much for the autopunctuation functions accuracy.  Good grief!  Even one I try to correct a nonsensical vacation, what comes out of my correction is anime remotely what appears on the screen to be oh so incredibly accurate Dragon NaturallySpeaking 9.  Oh yes brother, that's got to be in 99th percentile for sure exhalation mark. --- Addendum (this is typed, not dictated) -- Another reviewer here, Chris B, is also absolutely right about the "uninvited guest" InstallShield Update Manager that surreptitiously gets installed with DNS9 Preferred. I didn't see it until after posting my initial review. This "Service" even becomes a permanent fixture in your CONTROL PANEL, and it apparently now "manages" my updates for Jasc and Corel products on my computer in addition to DNS9 Preferred. After finding that it does not work to fix the update error problem (see below), I've simply firewall-blocked its recurrent attempts to access the Internet for unknown/undisclosed reasons. Really annoying, and Chris B is also correct in that I also can not find ANYTHING about this unannounced, background add-on program in the Nuance DNS9 documentation.  Interestingly, in their "knowledge base," there is the following disclaimer:  "The InstallShield Update Manager is not included with any ScanSoft product, but is downloaded from the InstallShield website. To un-install the Update Manager utility, download the remover from Installshield's website."  In other words, it doesn't come on the discs, but during installation, they download a third party's program off of the Internet and install it on your computer without your knowledge or permission.  Sound comforting?  Additionally, my installation of DNS9 can't recognize the fact that the program has been registered (successfully according to the online web page, but unsuccessfully according to the DNS9 on my computer!) THREE times now, so it refuses to check for updates, giving me the "Error 13003: Version Not Registered with the Update Service" message that another reviewer here has also posted about. So, the program won't check for updates. How can I fix that?  The grandiosely named "InstallShield Update Manager" does not function to fix this problem (even when I allow my firewall to let it connect to the Internet), so I dunno, but I can get one "free" help call with Nuance, but any further ones cost $19.99 per "incident."  Even worse, to email for support, you have to complete a "Problem Report Form," which costs $9.95 per "incident." I've rarely seen a company charge for email tech support. So, to get this program installed properly, I'm supposed to pay THEM to help me debug THEIR product? Really revolting. Again, to borrow from Chris B's review, he's absolutely right about the lack of "good ol' customer service with this mob."  The dictation quality is improving slowly, though it's still nowhere near 99% accurate as advertised, and these other headaches, backdoor sneakery, and the CS money racket just to get the product functional make me want to deduct a star from my original review.  I won't do that, though, in hopes that this revision isn't "inadvertently withheld in processing" for a week by this site's management as the first version of my review for this product was.  My Hardware Info -- Dell Dimension XPS Gen 3, Intel Pentium 4 550 w/HyperThreading (HT) Technology (3.40GHz), 1.00GB RAM, Windows XP SP2, Creative SB Audigy 2 ZS (WDM), Telex H-531 DIGITAL USB Microphone  Update -- May 07, 2008 -- Broke my Telex microphone while moving and replaced it with a&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Plantronics-Foldable-USB-Stereo-Headset-Optimized-for-Laptop-Use-Audio-470-USB/dp/B000VVXO7E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Plantronics Foldable USB Stereo Headset (Optimized for Laptop Use) (Audio 470 USB)</a>.  Accuracy is substantially better than the Telex, even with minimal training.  I can't add any stars to my review, though, because even though this microphone works better, DNS 9 Preferred says that the sound quality of the Telex was better than the Plantronics, even when the Plantronics is functioning better.  See my review on the Plantronics microphone for details.	-1
Vista is junk no matter what version your are running. Don't let Mad Doctor FrankenGates experiment with you. If you use this product, your life will only get worse. This is just another failure by microjunk. Your system will crash, run very slow, take forever to boot up and you will get a large dose of the blue window of death. One star is way too generous for this junk	-1
Since micro soft support is an absolute joke, I'm left with only the option of telling the truth to the world. Hopefully you will tell everyone you know, as well. Micro soft (junk) vista is nasty. It is Very slow, it is very unstable, takes forever to boot up, takes for ever to load programs, and should be considered a Down-grade not an up-grade. DON"T WASTE YOUR MONEY. I had to install it 4 different times to get it to work. And my machine is pretty new with 4 gigs of ram, and dual Athlon CPUs. So don't waste your time or money. I'd give it zero stars if I could. And I am seriously considering taking microjunk to Small Claims Court.	-1
As an upgrade, this version just does not work. It hogs all the CPU power your system can put out. I wasted alot of man-hours on this version and regret buying it. I recently bought a new Mac Pro with 2 quad core Xeon CPUs, and tried installing vista on the Mac with Boot-Camp, and to my suprise, vista finally works. However most people do not have a Mac Pro, so again, I would say "don't WASTE your money". Either stick with XP, or buy a Mac.	-1
I tried to upgrade from XP to Vista. I have a very powerful PC - 3GB and dual core processor and sufficient graphic card - but Vista only does about 90% of what it should be doing. Two major problems are after installing vista I can not deinstall firewalls and virus scanners that don't work under vista but that keep screwing up my system. Second big thing, I have two computer screens and the second screen is turned by 90 degrees. Vista does not like that at all. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DON'T INSTALL VISTA. IT IS NOT WORTH THE NIGTHMARE.	-1
My business software did not work with Vista and it is rigged to make it impossible or difficult to downgrade without buying a new Windows XP.  There are serious speed and compatability issues with Vista.  Count on some of your software not running at all and if your computer is less than brand new it will probably slow dramatically as Vista is Processor and memory heavy.  No one therefore should be considering upgrading a less than brand new this year computer to Vista and would be putting their business at risk with compatability issues.  Wait at least a year and check all of your hardware and software for compatability issues.	-1
When WinXP came out I refused to abandon my reliable Win98SE until SP2 was released and WinXP finally became an operating system (from the experimental eye-candy it first was). Experts advise us to do the same with WinVISTA - yet I do not think this is ever gonna happen...  WinVISTA is far WORSE than the initial release of WinXP: NUMEROUS and MAJOR compatibility problems with most third-party Software, Games (well, all games except...HALO2), GFX-Cards, Scanners & Printers, Cameras & USB-Peripherals. Not to mention Microsoft Software!  Even MICROSOFT Software (such as STREETS & TRIPS 2007, ENCARTA 2007, PICTURE-IT or MONEY 2007) refuses to work with WinVISTA! If they did not care to support their own Software, why should anyone else! And all this trouble just for the cool Aero effect (which, by the way, may be NOT supported on your 2007 PC!) and DirectX10 (for which, you do know, there is not one affordable GFX-card compatible with?)? I don't think so!  Windows is an OPERATING SYSTEM! Why is it pretending to be able to DO EVERYTHING? It canNOT! Sure, it is nice to be able to listen to music, burn CDs, browse the Internet. But that is why there are so many Specialized Software available! And, what is even worse, WinVISTA will not let exactly these Software titles function as intended!  I had WinVISTA on my Laptop for about a week. I could not format quick enough! There is NOTHING WRONG with my WinXP-SP2. WHY CHANGE THEM?	-1
It's not because it's so slow that I hate it, it's because Microsoft has decided that I'm too stupid to know what I'm doing so they've decided to protect me from myself and won't allow me to even look at what's on my hard drive. Every mouse click now takes 3 or 4 clicks for the same thing. It's so confusing to look at my documents folders, I can't figure out what is where. I can't view web pages on my own site because they aren't in the security frame of safe. All my USB WiFi devices don't work on Vista and the only ones available are extremely expensive. My cousin bought a Vista installed laptop and with customer support couldn't get it connected to his WiFi router at home because of security issues, so he took it back and got one that has XP Media Center on it for less. I was given a full, licensed copy of Vista Ultimate and I will not install it on any of my computers. If MS stops supporting XP and I have only Vista available in a PC, I'll buy an Apple.	-1
VISTA is appropriated named.  VISTA defines something great to look at.  If all you did was look at Microsoft Vista it would be the perfect operating system indeed.  Unfortunately Vista is a computer operating system that was designed to be used and there is the problem.  Vista is so secure and so over burdened with layers upon burdensome processor power robbing layer of sheer garbage it is rendered totally completely and utterly useless.  Vista will take the fastest XP computer and turn it into a slow worthless pile of trash.  Vista is so slow it takes me back to the days when I used to walk away from my IBM AT computer get a cup of coffee and walk around the building.  What makes Vista worse still is Microsoft Office 2007 the absolute pits in word processing.  Add Office 2007 to Vista and you won't be productive at all but dang won't it look pretty. If you just want to watch your computer make pretty colors and areo-glass catch yourself some goofs watch Vista.  When you want to work and be productive turn on your XP computer.  Windows 2000 and XP work hard while Vista Hardly Works at all.  Vista is garbage don't buy this dreck!  Everything you try to do on Vista is not allowed.  Almost every peice of equipment you run on Vista needs to be updated to so called Vista friendly versions.  The messed up Windows explorer to the point to where it is beyond useless.  The problem with Vista is that Microsoft had taken all the wizards and helpful features far as they could in XP.  In Vista they had to try to top a operating system that pretty much did what you asked of it with little fuss.  In Vista the software code writers were just changing things because they could.  Vista makes nothing better or easier.  In fact Vista is built in a manner that almost seems to go out of its way to make even the most simple compater related tasks unpleasant needlessly long boring and tedious.  In a word TEDIOUS IS THE BEST SINGLE WORD TO DESCRIBE MICROSOFT WINDOWS VISTA.  VISTA HAS SUCCEEDED IN BRINGING THE ENTIRE COMPUTER EXPERIENCE IS PAINFULLY NEW LEVEL OF THE PURELY TEDIOUS THAT HAS NOT BEEN DREAMT OF BEFORE!  I just wish I could give Vista no stars or more honestly a negative star rating.  I won't be buying Vista for my current systems and even when I get a new computer I will not be using Vista is it comes pre installed.  I have my own old trusty XP disks and I will reinstalled XP the last useful usable operating system Microsoft made.  XP is the goofy kiddie skool like interface is ugliest operating system Microsoft ever made but while it was an ugly duckling it did work pretty well.  Vista is by far the prettiest operating system Microsoft has ever made but it is pretty and dumb.  Vista is over burdened with programmatic junk has a way to high opinion of itself.  Vista is so much more secure because all the dumb security features make the operating system unusable.  Any computer you make unusable is the most secure because you can't do any productive work on it.  Vista makes your computer experience endlessly tedious and makes your computer system a must see door stop.  The philosophy of Vista seems to be that a good computer should be seen but never productively used.  Vista is a great system for that  well monied executive that wants to look busy while doing nothing productive.	-1
I recently bought a new laptop, and the changeover involved an "upgrade" to Office 2007. I was aware that there was a new user interface, but was not aware that Office 2007 is, in almost every respect, an INFERIOR product to any Office version that came before it! I have used MS Office for many years, and am what could be called a "power user," especially for Word and Powerpoint, which I use weekly. One of the great features of Office is that it has been totally customizable. For those who use office frequently, it has been easy to create your own custom toolbars so you have what you need easily available. Most tasks could be done with one or two mouse clicks... Until Office 2007! In Office 2007, hardly anything is customizable! You have a constantly changing tool ribbon, which takes up a lot of screen real estate. The ribbon presents a set of icons based on what it "thinks" you will need at the moment. It is rarely right! ... so you go searching through the tabs trying to find the icon that was on the ribbon a few moments earlier! There is one small "tool bar" up on the title bar that you CAN customize, but it is not convenient, and will not hold many icons. It has the option of being moved below the ribbon, which takes up even more screen real estate, but is still very limited, and cannot be docked or moved from there. Granted, there are third party programs, such as Ribbon Customizer and Toolbar Toggle, that add back some of the ability to customize, but it is still far inferior to what Office users are used to! Even the third party programs, however, cannot get around the fact that there are some features in earlier Office versions that are simply NOT included in the new one. In previous versions of Powerpoint, you could add a set of icons that, with one mouse click, allowed you to adjust the vertical spacing of text. That has been omitted in 2007. In the "improved" 2007 version, you must open a dialog box, and make several mouse clicks to adjust vertical spacing! To make matters worse, Office 2007 documents are not compatible with earlier versions. After spending years establishing formats such as .doc and .ppt as industry standards, Microsoft has introduced a version of office that does not use these formats! If you want to send a document to someone who still has Office 2003 (or any other program that reads .doc files) you need to remember to save it in that format. The default 2007 format cannot be opened by earlier versions! Office 2007 CAN open the older formats, but even in opening earlier Office formats, there are problems. For example, most users of Powerpoint have learned the trick of adding drop shadows behind the text to make the text stand out on the screen. Office 2007 has changed the way these shadows are formed. When you open a powerpoint presentation made on an earlier version, your old drop shadows WILL NOT ANIMATE with the text. When a slide appears, the shadows of the letters are already in place, and the letters animate in on top! Mircosoft's only suggestion... go through your slides and take the old shadows out, and put new shadows in! (I tried this... it takes 30-40 minutes per presentation! ...And I have hundreds of powerpoint presentations in my file!) For someone who never used Office before, or who just uses Word to type simple letters, 2007 may be okay, but for anyone who depends on Office for detailed tasks and productivity, 2007 is a nightmare. I have always loved Microsoft Office. It has been an industry standard for ease of use. In my opinion, that is no longer the case. I believe Microsoft tried to produce something "different" to attract new users, but in the process totally ignored the needs of those who have used their products in the past. If you have the option of staying with an earlier version, DO NOT UPGRADE to this product!	-1
EDIT 1-11-2008 In the begining when I first tried VISTA I hated it because it did not play well with all my computers. Now Microsoft has got a lot of the bugs worked of the OS and it runs great and is stable. Microsoft still has TERRIBLE customer support. I hate being treated like a criminal everytime I call them. I raise my rating from 1 star to 3.	-1
After all these years, the trolls in Redmond still have not learned how to produce user-friendly software. There was no reason to make the changes to Office that they've made; it was simply a way to justify an unnecessary upgrade that has turned out to be a downgrade. Users with a moderate understanding of how Office operated will find themselves flummoxed when attempting to do things they had finally learned how to do in the old version.  The much-vaunted ribbons are confusing and counter-intuitive. Microsoft addresses this problem by offering free self-paced trainng courses, apparently oblivious to the fact that time iS money, unless of course, it's Microsoft's time.  At the very least, one expects backward compatibility, that is unless you're dealing with Mr. Bill's minions. I loaded Word files created with Office XP, only to find the Office 2007 converted them with serious defects, like inserting tabs in all paragraphs whenever you inserted one in a single paragraph. And, of course, if you delete a tab stop from one paragraph, you delete it from all of them.  Useless.	-1
Sorry Microsoft, but your "ribbon" user interface is the most retarded upgrade feature ever. It renders all your Office applications useless. I have no interest spending hours to learn a completely different UI and to recustomize the toolbar all over again (I'm not even sure if it's even possible to customize the "ribbon"). The ribbon is ugly and WAY, WAY, WAY, WAY too big.  My advice: try to avoid upgrading for as long as possible.	-1
The new ribbon design is supposed to make it easier to learn and use. It may be for some new users but for experienced users, it isn't. This version takes away some critical nuts & bolts customization features and many tasks now take longer to perform. This is not due to the learning curve, it is the inherent nature of the way the ribbon works. Once you are familiar with the program, nothing is faster than the old menu structure. If Microsoft added an option to allow users to choose between menus and ribbons, it would be the best of both worlds, satisfying the needs of both new and experienced users. The new version does not run macros as fast however. My recommedation for existing users: keep Office 2003 for as long as you can and consider going to Open Office when Microsoft no longer supports 2003 (unless they restore the functionality in a newer release of 2007).	-1
What a nightmare.  If you've read the other reviews here, you probably already know how annoying Vista's access control messages are, and how it was incompatible with nearly everything, so I won't spend time railing about that.  The one issue that I could not solve, or forgive, was one of the most fundamental issues for an operating system: file handling.  Vista didn't like copying files across a network.  In fact, Vista took personal umbrage at being asked to transfer files across a network, and passive-agressively reduced the transfer rate down until it could be measured in bits per minute, instead of kB per second.  I soon came to personify Vista as one of those toad-like elderly women behind the counter at the DMV who take perverse delight in watching people's impatience boil into homicidal rage.  The kind of person/operating system that will let you get to almost the front of a two-hour line/95% complete file transfer and then wordlessly put up a "Next Window" sign/"File I/O error" message with just the hint of a malicious grin.  The kind of person/operating system that justifies the "No Firearms in the DMV"/"Don't keep a hammer near your laptop with Vista installed on it" rule.  The problem wasn't just limited to network file copies, either.  Copying photos from a USB flash drive to the hard drive took so long that I could have recreated them in MS Paint, pixel by pixel, more quickly and with less frustration.  Where else but in Vista will you see a dialog box with the words "0.2 of 4 Mb copied, 240 hours remaining"?  My experience with Vista was so abominable that I swore never to give Microsoft another dime of my business, walked to the Apple store, and plunked down way to much money for a Macbook Pro.  OSX has its issues, some of them serious, but OSX makes Vista look like Microsoft literally implemented the "1,000,000 monkeys with 1,000,000 copies of C++ will probably turn out a well-made operating system" rule, but decided to save money by giving about 200 monkeys 3 computers and one copy of Q-BASIC.	-1
The worst thing you could do to your business is install windows vista on any of you machines. Vista is a bloated, slow, buggy piece of junk that could ruin your business. Stick with XP and don't even think about Microjunk vista. I would give it zero stars as a rating, if I could. May bill gates burn inhell.	-1
Disgusting! After 5 years in the making, and promises of a super-duper search engine (that they couldn't get to work in the end), this is just creaky non-productive yet indcrediby expensive flash-in-the-pan stuff. I have to rely on Windows to use my business software. For starters, all office machines needed at least 2 GB RAM to run all those decorative see-through windows (who really cares). It's slow, buggy, already needs dozens of fixes and - hopefully - an SP1 release to address the worst. The annoying 'permissions' dialog requires you to sit in front of the computer, particularly if your office is networked; 'activation' is better called 'aggravation' - seems you are stealing their copyrights - and viruses and worms still infest the system because the browser (incrediby, really) was integrated into the operating system, thereby offering a direct pipeline into the kernel innards.  There is no instruction manual other than pages of denial of user rights. Customer service is "help yourself" via the (highly technical) Knowlege Base ... you've got to be a bit of a geek to start messing in the registry after digesting those pages of legalese that fully protect the company, but offer no warranties for the hapless consumer.  Enough said - Apple's Bootcamp now lets you install and run both Mac and Win operating systems (go back to XP/SP2!), elegantly executing the occasional Windows program such as Quicken or games. Leopard now is a de facto dual operating system product. Goodbye Bill Gates, hello Steve Jobs!	-1
There are serious compatability and speed issues with Vista.  Count on much of your current bussiness software not to run.  Count on having difficulty downgrading back to Windows XP as Microsoft has rigged Vista to make it difficult to downgrade without buying a new XP from them  Vista is processor and memory heavy.  It will dramatically slow older computers.  Even with a newer computer it may appear no faster than windows xp and possibly slower.  I however, have the home edition on my brand new home computer and it is plenty fast.  However, the premium and business editions are much slower and require more memory.  I recommend never to put Vista on a computer with less than a duo core processor and 2 MB of memory.  All businsess owners should stay away for at least a year until all compatability issues have been resolved - assuming that is possible.	-1
Vista features cause seizures in people with pattern sensitive / motion sensitive epilepsy and they can not be disabled. ( There are options to turn off blinking cursor and "unnecessary animations" if you search for them, while having seizures of course while you do so )  I wanted to purchase a newer notebook than the one I am currently using to write this review so I purchased a brand new HP Pavilion ( HP Pavilion dv9500t ). See order below. I wanted better screen resolution as I have fairly serious eye problems and I wanted better performance than this Compaq R4010T that I had to go back to to write this review on..  I have really bad epilepsy ( and it is getting worse and worse because I keep getting clobbered by this bad technology ) and I am having seizure after seizure using THE NEW COMPUTER WITH WINDOWS VISTA ON IT because of Microsoft Vista's inaccessibility.  The problem is that Microsoft has gone from the innocuous "hourglass" icon to the Apple "spinning wheel" style icon whenever you click on almost ANYTHING. I have turned off every option, feature, flag that I can trying to stop this and I can't.  I absolutely can't use this computer and I can't use Vista. What sort of idiots are these people? Haven't they ever heard of epilepsy? I abandoned Apple Macs because of my epilepsy and now Microsoft has to try to out apple Apple with this lemon.  My brain really can't afford to have any more seizures. I have repeatedly told my doctor that I have to go to ZERO blinking / flashing / animations with NO exceptions. Good luck with all this terrible technology. Unfortunately, nothing will kill me so I have to suffer and suffer and suffer. I have to use a computer as that is the ONLY way I can get anything done such as shopping.  The problem is that I can see that the clock is ticking and it is just a matter of time before I, and people like me, are totally disenfranchised from the moder world. ( Recently I had to go back to a rotary telephone because I no longer tolerated my higher tech LCD phone )  Anyways, this review won't last long because we all have to have a rosy view of how great everything is and we don't want to be disturbed by roadkills like me on the information superhighway.  $1823.27 down the drain.

I recently bought a new laptop, and the changeover involved an "upgrade" to Office 2007. I was aware that there was a new user interface, but was not aware that Office 2007 is, in almost every respect, an INFERIOR product to any Office version that came before it! I have used MS Office for many years, and am what could be called a "power user," especially for Word and Powerpoint, which I use weekly. One of the great features of Office is that it has been totally customizable. For those who use office frequently, it has been easy to create your own custom toolbars so you have what you need easily available. Most tasks could be done with one or two mouse clicks... Until Office 2007! In Office 2007, hardly anything is customizable! You have a constantly changing tool ribbon, which takes up a lot of screen real estate. The ribbon presents a set of icons based on what it "thinks" you will need at the moment. It is rarely right! ... so you go searching through the tabs trying to find the icon that was on the ribbon a few moments earlier! There is one small "tool bar" up on the title bar that you CAN customize, but it is not convenient, and will not hold many icons. It has the option of being moved below the ribbon, which takes up even more screen real estate, but is still very limited, and cannot be docked or moved from there. Granted, there are third party programs, such as Ribbon Customizer and Toolbar Toggle, that add back some of the ability to customize, but it is still far inferior to what Office users are used to! Even the third party programs, however, cannot get around the fact that there are some features in earlier Office versions that are simply NOT included in the new one. In previous versions of Powerpoint, you could add a set of icons that, with one mouse click, allowed you to adjust the vertical spacing of text. That has been omitted in 2007. In the "improved" 2007 version, you must open a dialog box, and make several mouse clicks to adjust vertical spacing! To make matters worse, Office 2007 documents are not compatible with earlier versions. After spending years establishing formats such as .doc and .ppt as industry standards, Microsoft has introduced a version of office that does not use these formats! If you want to send a document to someone who still has Office 2003 (or any other program that reads .doc files) you need to remember to save it in that format. The default 2007 format cannot be opened by earlier versions! Office 2007 CAN open the older formats, but even in opening earlier Office formats, there are problems. For example, most users of Powerpoint have learned the trick of adding drop shadows behind the text to make the text stand out on the screen. Office 2007 has changed the way these shadows are formed. When you open a powerpoint presentation made on an earlier version, your old drop shadows WILL NOT ANIMATE with the text. When a slide appears, the shadows of the letters are already in place, and the letters animate in on top! Mircosoft's only suggestion... go through your slides and take the old shadows out, and put new shadows in! (I tried this... it takes 30-40 minutes per presentation! ...And I have hundreds of powerpoint presentations in my file!) For someone who never used Office before, or who just uses Word to type simple letters, 2007 may be okay, but for anyone who depends on Office for detailed tasks and productivity, 2007 is a nightmare. I have always loved Microsoft Office. It has been an industry standard for ease of use. In my opinion, that is no longer the case. I believe Microsoft tried to produce something "different" to attract new users, but in the process totally ignored the needs of those who have used their products in the past. If you have the option of staying with an earlier version, DO NOT UPGRADE to this product!	-1
I am a fairly well educated person who is handy around the house.  It took a 25 minute call with Microsoft customer support to get the box open.  Customer support had to pull up a diagram and walk me through 18 steps.	-1
I purchased Outlook 2007 because Microsoft has now chosen to exclude it from certain versions of Office 2007. Well, it has way less features than my previous Outlook:   - no animated GIF's  - no support for Outlook Personal Address Book (PAB)  - the Outlook Text Editor has been eliminated  And now I find that if you purchase this `stand alone' version of Outlook 2007 the `Themes and Stationary' feature is disabled. It only works in those versions of Outlook 2007 that are bundled with the Office Suite, not this version!  This is NOT AN UPGRADE, it's a DOWNGRADE!	-1
This doesn't work well with Windows 10, But other then that it was ok.	-1
Sorry Microsoft, but your "ribbon" user interface is the most retarded upgrade feature ever. It renders all your Office applications useless. I have no interest spending hours to learn a completely different UI and to recustomize the toolbar all over again (I'm not even sure if it's even possible to customize the "ribbon"). The ribbon is ugly and WAY, WAY, WAY, WAY too big.  My advice: try to avoid upgrading for as long as possible.	-1
The new ribbon design is supposed to make it easier to learn and use. It may be for some new users but for experienced users, it isn't. This version takes away some critical nuts & bolts customization features and many tasks now take longer to perform. This is not due to the learning curve, it is the inherent nature of the way the ribbon works. Once you are familiar with the program, nothing is faster than the old menu structure. If Microsoft added an option to allow users to choose between menus and ribbons, it would be the best of both worlds, satisfying the needs of both new and experienced users. The new version does not run macros as fast however. My recommedation for existing users: keep Office 2003 for as long as you can and consider going to Open Office when Microsoft no longer supports 2003 (unless they restore the functionality in a newer release of 2007).	-1

You will probably be more productive and less bug ridden if you stick with what you have.  15 years of Outlook and you can't print a single address label or an envelope with one click. (or 10 clicks for that matter)  There is no function to easily print out mailing labels either.  Lets remember Outlook is a Contact manager ... next to many other things...  Maybe Outlook 2010 will be the answer.	-1
The menus in these programs are completely unusable.  Microsoft won't admit they blew it, but instead want us all to believe the menus are "more intuitive".  BS.  I've been researching the issue, and evidently a company has software that makes the menus in Office 2007 look like Office 2003.  ThinK i may get it.  [...]	-1
Office 2007 has some features that are better that 2003, but nothing I couldn't live without.  And be prepared to spend a lot of time relearning the programs. Considering the cost in time and money it may not be worth it to change to the new version. For a real bargain download the free office suite from [...].	-1
Excel is probably one of the best applications in existence in the business world. Power Point is quite pedestrian, which is good for some executives, and quick-presentation fixes. Outlook is great, but here's where it all ends.  WORD is simply an exercise in futility, and more of a waste of time than ever. I learned how to create stunning page layouts in Adobe InDesign faster (my first attempts at using Adobe products outside Photoshop) than I could master an already familiar program-Word. This is because Word suffers from formatting and alignment idiosyncrasies which will burn the user who attempts to delve into any special features, or who attempt to customize even the simplest of things. I recommend using Word for the most basic and time-saving uses, but if you want to create a document that utilizes any advanced features, you will be much more satisfied learning what the Pro's use on a daily basis.	-1

Twenty minutes ago, a senior engineer with advanced degrees and 18 years experience with Microsoft office came to me and asked, "How do you draw a line in Office 2007?"  This seemed like a strange question, since I knew that this individual had been drawing lines in Office for a decade or more. I went to MIT, and have been using Office since before it was Office, starting with Word in 1986, so I was confident that between the two of us we'd figure it out.  Wrong!  The engineer wanted to draw a line between two objects. He did NOT want this line to snap to one of the connection points on these objects. In other words, he wanted a LINE, not a CONNECTOR in Office 2003 lingo. Connectors are fun little things for drawing org charts, but we wanted a plain old LINE.  We tried every variety of line or arrow we could find. Every one snapped to the connection points. After 10 minutes (at our combined billing rate, more than the cost of Microsoft Office), we resorted to the documentation.  We found the answer! The icon for LINE is not a LINE. It is a blobular shape with a right angle on the bottom and a curvy part on top, called a "Freeform". It turns out that all other line-shaped tools have been promoted to connectors, and Freeform is the only tool you can use to draw a line that is NOT a connector. This is a bit awkward, since a line has two ends, and a freeform has infinite inflection points, so you have to double click at the end of your freeform to indicate that you just want a simple two-point line.  Wow!  I am really not interested in becoming the tech support guy who has to retrain experienced, educated people that "When you want a line, choose the blobular tool called 'freeform' because that's what Bill Gates says you should do." I wonder what Microsoft could have accomplished with their development dollars if they had focused on real enhancements instead of changing lines to blobular freeform thingies. We're loyal Office users, but we won't be buying any new copies this time around. Maybe they'll get it right in Office 2010.	-1

Sorry if the title is a little strong but I have been using word processing and spreadsheet software since the 70s and this is a great leap backwards.  I do not know what caused MS to abandon the simple pull down menus and control and alt functions that let word approach 60% of the efficiency of word perfect.  The new programs are cumbersome, mouse intensive and trash for the serious user .  If you need a new computer you are better off with a used computer with the prior generations of this software. It is not just my opinion but that of my grad students.  It is incredible that Microsoft had the arrogance to put this product in the marketplace. A great boon to Apple and if MS removes support for XP as scheduled it is time to BUY Apple stock.  My guess is that market demand will require support for the older versions for many more years.  Hopefully with more European influence MS will fully support universal document formats so that users will have a real choice.  We use both Word 97 and WP in the office. Most of our new people are unable to believe that there is anything other than Word, but after using wP for a while come to prefer that for its easier and more predictable results and far easier to use command structure. Given their choice WP wins for internal documents even though they need to use Word for many external documents.	-1
You will probably be more productive and less bug ridden if you stick with what you have.  Don't expect to turn this version on and be able to use it. Many changes are literally imposed on you, like the ribbons instead of the familiar icon bars. Missing menus and the auto-double space setting every time you hit return.  There are new features which can be helpful to some, but Microsoft probably thinks you can afford a week for retraining.  The arrogance of Microsoft not even to offer the menus everyone is used to as a classic or traditional option is incredible.  You upgrade for hundreds of dollars to get totally stuck and run out to buy a manual.	-1

Vista is absolute junk. Don't waste your money. If you are running XP, keep it. Don't let mad Doctor FrankenGates of Microjunk Corp mess with your mind. Vista is slow, full of bugs, unstable and has imposible customer service. Do yourself a favor. Stick with XP or buy a Mac. End of story.	-1
Fist, I'm no beginner and my system is an HP with a fast Duo Athlon processor, 3gb of ram and Vista preinstalled by the factory.  If you were unfortunate enough to remember WindowsME then you know why Vista is only getting 1 star, they are equally as bug-ridden.  I have been using Windows since 3.0 and have used every flavor with mixed success.  I know how to tweak settings and manually steamline a Windows OS.  Vista is not cooperative.  It's top heavy with pretty blingy glitz that hogs system recourses and slows even the best behaved applications to a crawl.  Then there's the issue that not all software is compatible or works properly in the new OS.  Worse, even after turning off most every feature I could including indexing, Vista still engaged in computer-freezing disk writes that lasted for 10's of minutes at a time for no apparent reason; Microsoft help is at a loss to explain.  Vista is bloatware of the worst kind and is no more safe than XP.  Avoid it if at all possible!	-1
First the seller listed here must be off his rocker or it has to be an error.  9,999 for Vista?!?!  Good luck.  Over blown, bloated, unreliable on any system by any manufacturer I have used (Dell, Compaq, HP, Acer, Toshiba, ASUS etc), virus friendly and just a mess.  It's windows 7 with more pop up windows, slightly less stable design, blue screen happy, and just destroys any system it is used on.  Complete garbage, windows 7 upgrade(?? if you can call it that ??) should have been FREE!!!	-1
I got a new VAIO and couldn't find one with XP so had to get the latest unproven version of Monopoly with it aka - Vista.  The only good thing about it is that it is visually appealing but that is probably part of what makes it so sloooooooooooooow.  The bad - it is sloooooooooow, it crashed right out of the box, seems to not like Flash player, Explorer crashed a number of times just browsing the web, you have to play 20 questions every time you want to install something, its sloooooooooooooooow and this computer has 2 GIGs of RAM - there just isn't that much useful stuff that an OS could have to require anywhere near 2GIGs of RAM.  As soon as I booted it up for the first time and tried to shut down from the start menu, it wouldn't shut down and it didn't say anything, just wouldn't shut down so I had to manually power it off.  The screen flickers on and off at various times when Vista is doing certain things which is strange and sloooooooow but doesn't seem to hurt anything.  The touch pad comes with default settings that make it very difficult to move the cursor while staying in the current application or web page.  If you dig a little bit you can shut that annoying feature off, otherwise your browser starts jumping from site to site if you are using the touch pad to move the pointer.  If you are using something like WordPress that has JavaScript pop-ups to add a URL to your article you can temporarily disable that but it is very temporary and isn't clear how to make it permanent for specific sites.  It is better than Windows "crash" Millenium, doesn't hold a candle to XP thus far.  Unless you have to, don't get Vista, stick with XP.  There is so far no compelling reason to upgrade even if they were giving away the upgrades free of charge.	-1
Windows Vista truly is a step backwards.  After running it on three different high-end systems, and switching back to Windows XP on two of them and Ubuntu linux on the third, I can confirm what everyone else is saying: Stay with Windows XP as long as possible.  And I'm an MCSE (Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer), so I should be towing the company line, but simply cannot:  Here are the primary issues I experienced:  - Lack of stability - Vista running Media Center remains operational for a few days, then slows down to a crawl.  Rebooting may or may not solve the problem.  Windows Defender also crashes at startup, and the computer will periodically blue screen.  No rollbacks, driver updates, BIOS updates or anything else help. - Speed - Vista is significantly slower than Windows XP at everything - games, Internet connectivity, file operations, everything. - Drivers - Per IDG, there are simply no Vista drivers for 72% of peripherals released in the last year, and only 4% of peripherals released within the last three years has a Vista driver. - Security - Windows XP with a good security suite like Trend Micro or Kaspersky is easily as secure as Vista, without the constant popup messages about program actions.  And do you really want Microsoft providing security software to cover the holes that they have left in the operating system software that they are providing?!? - Cost - It is becoming increasingly clear that other options, like Macintosh, are starting to provide the flexibility to over come the usual complaints about them - they can now run Windows XP natively alongside MacOS, and get all of your productivity intact.  It's best to seriously consider going over to Mac land and seeing what they have to offer you! - Lastly, DRM. Microsoft has written draconian DRM into every part of the operating system.  No more ripping DVDs for you!  No more trying yo copy the music you bought and have it automatically loaded and converted to MP3!  NOOOO...Now you only have protected WMA tracks, which only YOU can listen to.  Or even better - try to play an HDDVD or BLURay on your system, experience the joys of downleveling.  Behind the scenes, Microsoft will intentionally degrade your video quality, unless you spend much more to buy "secure" versions of your motherboard, DVD-Drive, Monitor, and cabling that make piracy harder, and your life much harder.  Stick with XP as long as you can, and investigate the alternatives like LinuxMCE and MacOS; Microsoft has seriously dropped the ball, and service pack 1 is not going to address the issues.  It's time to look at other options for operating systems.	-1
This is pretty much the buggiest and slowest OS ever built. How on earth does one spend billions of dollars creating an OS that is a step BACKWARDS from XP? Stay on XP as long as possible, and when you need to upgrade computers, switch to Mac. It'll be another decade before Microsoft gets around to releasing an OS that represents an improvement over XP.	-1
Scam as is. Program stop  working and after I reinstalled MC told me they don't support it anymore and get lost.	-1
What are the guys at Microsoft Thinking??? Windows 3.1, a bad imitation of Mac, Windows 95... better, but still no Mac, Windows ME too bad to review, XP okay give or take the constant patching, a usable operating system, which is user friendly and reasonably trouble free, give or take security vulnerabilities.  Windows Vista, (which was the only option available with my newest laptop), is constantly crashing, will not run any software not specifically designed for it, including software I bought after the computer, for example Print Shop Deluxe (which made my DVD drive disappear to the computer, and I had to get tech support to find it again)  and School House Fonts,  both of which I need to use all the time when doing work for my wife's Kindergarten class (the reason I got this lap-top for in the first place was to do this kind of work in our room rather than going to one of our Desk Top PC's) , and including some that stated they were compatible, for Example Roxio 9 deluxe . The wireless connection is constantly fritzing out,  and it won't network with our XP PC's, or TiVo.  Hopefully, the near universal disappointment with this version of Windows will result in a miraculous patch to resolve the issues, and the Next version will actually be an improvement.  My advice is hang onto your XP as long as you can, unless you are changing all of your computers at the same time, and in that case, maybe look at Apple, for me neither option was feasible, but such is life.   I hope you have better luck!	-1
When WinXP came out I refused to abandon my reliable Win98SE until SP2 was released and WinXP finally became an operating system (from the experimental eye-candy it first was). Experts advise us to do the same with WinVISTA - yet I do not think this is ever gonna happen...  WinVISTA is far WORSE than the initial release of WinXP: NUMEROUS and MAJOR compatibility problems with most third-party Software, Games (well, all games except...HALO2), GFX-Cards, Scanners & Printers, Cameras & USB-Peripherals. Not to mention Microsoft Software!  Even MICROSOFT Software (such as STREETS & TRIPS 2007, ENCARTA 2007, PICTURE-IT or MONEY 2007) refuses to work with WinVISTA! If they did not care to support their own Software, why should anyone else! And all this trouble just for the cool Aero effect (which, by the way, may be NOT supported on your 2007 PC!) and DirectX10 (for which, you do know, there is not one affordable GFX-card compatible with?)? I don't think so!  Windows is an OPERATING SYSTEM! Why is it pretending to be able to DO EVERYTHING? It canNOT! Sure, it is nice to be able to listen to music, burn CDs, browse the Internet. But that is why there are so many specialized Software available!  And, what is even worse, WinVISTA will not let exactly these Software titles function as intended!  I had WinVISTA on my Laptop for about a week. I could not format quick enough! There is NOTHING WRONG with my WinXP-SP2. WHY CHANGE THEM?	-1
This is by far the worst edition of windows I have ever used. Every computer both PC or latop that I tried running this beast on died fairly quickly due to constant crashing and driver issues.  I had Constant crashes, bugs, security issues and noticed it was vastly slower than XP due to how bloated this broken OS is.  Terrible.	-1
As an expert computer user, (started with DOS) I would have to say that this is the worst piece of junk conceived by man. I would give it zero stars if I could. DO NOT down grade your computer with this junk. You will pull your hair out installing it. It will crash. It is much slower than XP. It takes forever to boot. And You Will Be Sorry!!!!!!!! Bill gates will laugh all the way to the bank with your money. The clowns in Redmond WA finally drove me to buy a MAC, and I could not be more pleased with OS X. I hope that this is the beginning of the end for Microjunk.	-1
Windows is so slow  and dorky...why not try a new Mac?  They are great.	-1
If you have an older computer, don't buy!  Vista Premium will bog it down.  If you want this for your business, don't buy!  Vista is incompatible with alot of business (and home) software and peripherals (printers, monitors, etc).  I bought Vista BASIC HOME (not the Premium edition) new on a newer more powerful machine 1.8 Mhz Duo Core and it ran plenty fast and had some nice features but wouldn't take my monitor driver causing it to malfunction, and about half of my non-Microsoft software wouldn't install (Nero Burning, ACT, Home Lawyer, etc).  Take note that the PREMIUM EDITION is supposed to actually slow your system down but the Vista BASIC HOME with a new computer ran fast on my new system albeit incompatible with much of my non-microsoft software.  At any rate, after a day of struggle I sent my computer back to Dell and bought their powerful Vostro 400 2.33 GHz+ at a great deal with $420 off and opted for Windows XP instead. (at dell dot com just select desktops, then business computers, then the gold box at the top of the screen with "smart buys" and select you options).  It is better to start with the already powerful 400 than buy a cheaper Vostro 200 and add the better memory and processor later.  In all fairness, I feel I should mention the obvious that Gateway and others have great bargains also.  If your upgrade doesn't work for you, you will have trouble downgrading as MS rigged Vista to make it near impossible to downgrade Home Premium without purchasing another copy of XP Pro (sounds illegal doesn't it!).  However, if you have a powerful newer home computer with at least 1 MB of RAM (2 MB for Vista Premium) and don't mind replacing much of your incompatible non-microsoft software and possibly peripherals (some drivers not available which may disable your monitor and printer - you can check first at their site for driver downloads for Vista), I think you will like the new Vista  in the HOME EDITION once you adapt to it.  I had it on the new home computer I sent back and liked it with the exception of not running half of my software and making my monitor (Samsung SynMaster 173P) dysfuntion on occasion because it wouldn't take my driver.  Vista is a little prettier and a bit more sophisticated than XP - but it is a little like switching from a powerful good handling sportscar (XP Pro) with a manual shift to a large powerful but lumbering luxury car with an automatic transmission and all the bells and whistles.  As no manual comes with Vista, I recommend getting a book to avoid alot of head scratching and time searching and winding through Microsofts Help-Option with its sometimes limited explanations.  THE WORD UPGRADE IS A CONTRADICTION WITH VISTA.  It should only be installed on a recent powerful computer and currently should NOT BE INSTALLED on an older computer or on a  business machine (software incompatability).  However, if you are getting a new machine for your home and want Vista already installed, then check out the unseen cost of buying some new software and if your hardware drivers are available for Vista and look at the Vista Home BASIC edition as it will be faster than the premium.  Vista Basic Home has a user and guest account password (unlike XP Basic) and some parental controls.  AT PRESENT, WINDOWS XP PRO IS A BETTER OPTION if you are thinking of buying a new machine and UPGRADING TO VISTA IS NOT A PRODUCTIVE OPTION AT ALL for the near future.  If want to keep your software working and even have your machine speed up dramatically, I recommend buying a powerful duo core computer (2MB Ram, 2.33 Ghz processor, 160MB+ hard drive) from the business machine menu (as most home machines won't have XP Pro as an option) and having it configured with  XP Pro on it. (you can still opt get a high end video card etc as on the home machines even though it is called business).  Then a year or so from now  consider  upgrading in the future to Vista when all the bugs and incompatabilities are worked out knowing that you have a powerful computer that can handle Vista with its heavy resource demands.	-1

Now, this is the UPGRADE edition - which means it is to be installed not on a freshly formated disk but over a pre-existing Windows edition. Read reviews in ANY forum: this is the WORST possible scenario in aspect of software compatibility and hardware drivers.  I had WinVISTA on my Laptop for about a week. I could not format quick enough! There is NOTHING WRONG with my WinXP-SP2. WHY CHANGE THEM?	-1
Everything the negative reviewers say is true and MORE. Please note the following as well: 1. If you are a college student taking a class online that uses Blackboard software, Vista will prevent you from posting to the class discussion board and answering any fill-in-the-blank or discussion questions on TESTS! To fix this download the FoxFire browser (free) and use it to access your course. Because Vista uses so much memory and is already so huge, they had to drop quite a few little programs that software needs to access in the Operating system.  2. HUGE MEMORY AND HARD DRIVE DRAIN. Look at this comparison Windows XP Professional  Size on drive 1.5 gig  Memory requirements 128 MB  Windows Vista  Needs 15 GIG To Load. Does not say how large the program is but I wouldn't think its small!!! Memory requirements 1 GIG!  If you check the DELL website you will see that they recommend that you have 2 gig of memory to use Windows Vista. That is a few $$$ worth of memory just to run the operating system while openning a program. Try running a game or doing animation with that kind of a sink hole in your system! The less memory you have available, the slower everything, including websites will load (no matter how fast your internet connection)   What is worse is that to fix what is wrong with it (ie replace all those small programs your software expects to find in the operating system), they will have to ADD patches that can only make it bigger and hungrier for memory!  This is the most pathetic excuse for an upgrade that I have ever seen. I would expect some lawsuits before this is over! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.	-1
I bought a new laptop in Dec 2006.  Specs: Intel Core Duo 1.6 GHZ    2 GB RAM    160 GB Hard Drive    ATI Radeon 256 MB Video    DVD RW drive    Windows XP Media Cener 2005    plus more bells and whistles  I've used every version of DOS and windows since 3.1, and I knew that XP was getting old, so I was excited to install Vista. It was the worst mistake I made since instaling Me 7 years ago. It took so long to install that I was able to watch a full length movie. Afterwards it was so slow that it made my brand new computer feel like my my Celeron 550 Mhz computer from 7 years ago. I turned off "Aero" because I thought it was just a resource hog. Then I got rid of the gadgets, User Account Control, and other annoying "features". Then I figured defragging my hard drive would help. In XP it takes maybe 5 mins on a bad day, but it took 3 hours in Vista. Vista takes forever to boot, and even though Dell gave me a drivers upgrade DVD for Vista one of my components wasn't compatable. So afer a day I decided I wanted to go back to XP. Dell gave me a backup partition, and it should have only taken 6 mins it said. But Vista deletes programs without telling you and certainly without your permission. So I had to reinstall everything by hand. That took days and many calls to Dell. So I guess the "WOW" experience for me is: a trashed hard drive, slower performance, and an expensive paperweight for days.	-1
This software should have never been released. It is not ready. Two machines several tries and no luck.  Save your money, stick with XP	-1
What can anybody say about software for which there is no choice but to buy?  Can't do without it - had to buy it.  Therefore I think the deal could be better.	-1
After all these years, the trolls in Redmond still have not learned how to produce user-friendly software. There was no reason to make the changes to Office that they've made; it was simply a way to justify an unnecessary upgrade that has turned out to be a downgrade. Users with a moderate understanding of how Office operated will find themselves flummoxed when attempting to do things they had finally learned how to do in the old version.  The much-vaunted ribbons are confusing and counter-intuitive. Microsoft addresses this problem by offering free self-paced trainng courses, apparently oblivious to the fact that time iS money, unless of course, it's Microsoft's time.  At the very least, one expects backward compatibility, that is unless you're dealing with Mr. Bill's minions. I loaded Word files created with Office XP, only to find the Office 2007 converted them with serious defects, like inserting tabs in all paragraphs whenever you inserted one in a single paragraph. And, of course, if you delete a tab stop from one paragraph, you delete it from all of them.  Useless.	-1
Sorry Microsoft, but your "ribbon" user interface is the most retarded upgrade feature ever. It renders all your Office applications useless. I have no interest spending hours to learn a completely different UI and to recustomize the toolbar all over again (I'm not even sure if it's even possible to customize the "ribbon"). The ribbon is ugly and WAY, WAY, WAY, WAY too big.  My advice: try to avoid upgrading for as long as possible.	-1
The new ribbon design is supposed to make it easier to learn and use. It may be for some new users but for experienced users, it isn't. This version takes away some critical nuts & bolts customization features and many tasks now take longer to perform. This is not due to the learning curve, it is the inherent nature of the way the ribbon works. Once you are familiar with the program, nothing is faster than the old menu structure. If Microsoft added an option to allow users to choose between menus and ribbons, it would be the best of both worlds, satisfying the needs of both new and experienced users. The new version does not run macros as fast however. My recommedation for existing users: keep Office 2003 for as long as you can and consider going to Open Office when Microsoft no longer supports 2003 (unless they restore the functionality in a newer release of 2007).	-1
When I built my first computer recently, I chose Windows Vista Ultimate. I would be lying if I said that I liked this operating system. I have just had too many problems. First, I could not install the drivers for my APU. It's GPU part says that the standard vga adapter failed to start. I had to put an old Geforce 9600 GSO 512 in it. Next, it had several issues with emulating. I get blue screen when ever I try to emulate n64, and gamecube emulating got progressively slower. Instead of being able to run a game at 150% speed, I only get 85% to 100% game speed. I also had problems with installing Directx. Every time I ran the Directx installer, it failed to install. I had to rely on NBA 2k13 to install Directx for me. So now I bought Windows 7 to replace this OS. I recommend that you save time and money, and just go buy Windows 7.	-1
I just got a nasty virus on my XP powered computer.  This forced me to delete my hard drive and rebuild my computer.  My wife works for a university, so she was able to get Vista for $25.  I figured I would do a fresh install with a full version Vista ultimate.  At first, my computer ran fine, but day by day it kept getting slower and slower.  I have a fast computer, but at any given time, Vista is using 70% of my 1 gig of memory.  I can run about 2 or 3 programs, but after that, things start crashing.  Sure I could upgrade, but why would I want to spend money to upgrade my hardware to do the same stupid tasks I was doing just fine with XP?  Vista also uses 15 extra gigabytes of hard drive space.  15 Gigabytes can hold about 1000 mp3 files or 50,000 pictures.  The pop ups are annoying too.  This means I get to spend $400 and subtract my hard drive space, upgrade my memory, and deal with annoying pop ups that ask me if I know what I'm doing; for a pretty version of XP, right? How did this company manage to dominate the OS market?  I installed a copy of Ubuntu.  It took 10 minutes to install.  All of my pictures, videos, music, MS Word and Excel files transferred over flawlessly.  With Vista, I could multitask with about 4 programs without crashing.  With Ubuntu, I can have 30 programs running and it still doesn't slow down...with 1 gig of memory! Did I mention that 99% of viruses are coded for Windows?  I can actually get better internet security by virtue of flying under the radar.	-1
Vista should get no stars. We are all beta testers for Mad Doctor FrankenGates. I hope he burns inhell for all the trouble he has caused with this junk known as Vista. Microjunk is so worried about themselves and their profits, they have forgotten how to take care of their customers. Don't waste your money on any more micro-junk, buy a Mac like I did. You will not be disappointed. Microsoft vista......What a joke!	-1
I spent $2,000 on a Dell laptop. Also, I upgraded to Vista Ultimate and Office Ultimate. This software is so damn junky! It doesn't work! Office works terribly on Vista, constantly freezing and crashing.  After 10 years of PC use, I've got an Apple computer coming in the mail right now.... I'm DONE with Microsoft!!	-1
This is pretty much the buggiest and slowest OS ever built. How on earth does one spend billions of dollars creating an OS that is a step BACKWARDS from XP? Stay on XP as long as possible, and when you need to upgrade computers, switch to Mac. It'll be another decade before Microsoft gets around to releasing an OS that represents an improvement over XP.	-1
I have spent hours and have yet to get my home network nor email working.  Vista randomly decides that my XP Home computers are not secure (even though for years Microsoft has been saying they are) and refuses to even show they exist.  When it does show them, it still refuses to let me copy files to them because they are not secure.  So, now per Vista's recommendation I have a full backup of my hard drive on that hard drive in case it fails (since it would be insecure to have it on another hard drive.)  So far it is unable in to install Office 2000.  This would be fine except it refuses to import my emails until I install it.  Other key applications like my password safe, etc. are still unable to install.  It is, however, a very nice looking application to surf the web with.  But, I'm not sure that's worth the money.	-1
Where to start?  Bad drivers and non-existent drivers from very big name companies (HP,Nvidia,Soundblaster)  Most benchmarks say Vista is up to 25% slower than XP on the same hardware.  Memory pig. Since when is 2 gigs not enough memory?  Write this down,because of the memory requirements for Vista,the 32 bit version will become obsolete in about 2 to 3 years.  So hold off if you are going to buy this piece of garbage and go 64 bit when things stabilze.  Software issues with anti-virus vendors.  UAC issues up the yin yang. Vista nags more than a drunken, shrewish wife.  Rendundent messages telling me that the software might not have installed properly after cancelling an install. Yeah,I know it didn't install,because I cancelled the d@mn thing!  I am an M$ reseller and get this stuff for a gretly reduced price becuse of a subscription and I do not have it running on any of my business or home systems because it just flat out sucks!  I have installed it on  on a number of different systems along with a couple of Sony laptops that it came preinstalled on and have moved everything back to XP.  This is just a frigging disaster!  Only M$ could get away with selling this bloated piece of garbage to the unsuspecting public.  I flat out hate this OS.	-1
When WinXP came out I refused to abandon my reliable Win98SE until SP2 was released and WinXP finally became an operating system (from the experimental eye-candy it first was). Experts advise us to do the same with WinVISTA - yet I do not think this is ever gonna happen...  WinVISTA is far WORSE than the initial release of WinXP: NUMEROUS and MAJOR compatibility problems with most third-party Software, Games (well, all games except...HALO2), GFX-Cards, Scanners & Printers, Cameras & USB-Peripherals. Not to mention Microsoft Software!  Even MICROSOFT Software (such as STREETS & TRIPS 2007, ENCARTA 2007, PICTURE-IT or MONEY 2007) refuses to work with WinVISTA! If they did not care to support their own Software, why should anyone else! And all this trouble just for the cool Aero effect (which, by the way, may be NOT supported on your 2007 PC!) and DirectX10 (for which, you do know, there is not one affordable GFX-card compatible with?)? I don't think so!  Windows is an OPERATING SYSTEM! Why is it pretending to be able to DO EVERYTHING? It canNOT! Sure, it is nice to be able to listen to music, burn CDs, browse the Internet.

I was really looking forward to Vista.  I ran out and got my copy as soon as it hit shelves.  Two weeks later, I uninstalled it.  I don't know when, or even if, I will reinstall it.  Here's why:  1) Game support - BEFORE you buy Vista, make sure your favorite game has a Vista patch, because it most likely won't work otherwise.  Check online to ensure that they are compatible, because many just aren't.  2) Immature drivers - in point 3 below, you'll see that Vista flat out does not support many hardware devices.  Even for those that it does, the drivers are so new, that the device (like my GeForce 7900GT) actually run SLOWER in Vista than XP.  3) Hardware support - most vendors are NOT releasing Vista drivers, to force people to buy new hardware.  For instance, my scanner (Epson) has no vista compatible driver (I tried the XP driver), and neither does my camera.  BEFORE you buy Vista, check to see that your hardware is supported!  4) Copy protection.  Like to copy a DVD so you can watch it whenever you want?  Forget it!  It WILL NOT happen in Vista, M$ made sure of that.  Same thing with programs like TuneBite that let you convert WMA songs into MP3s.  5) Antivirus.  Vista's security it, well, more secure than XP.  But the antivirus applications compatible with it are VERY lacking at this point.  And there are already viruses (virii?) out for Vista, so you DO need it.  6) Firefox - many sites do not work under Firefox with Vista.  And some extensions do not work.  I can't help but think this might be intentional.	-1
I'll try not to repeat all the negative comments of which I generally agree.  Office 2007 is not intuitive. (If it was, Microsoft would not have gone to the great lengths it has to show users how to find the functions they are looking for - see their website).  I was forced to convert from 2003, which had its deficits but it was intuitive and it worked (most of the time).  An example of problems with Word 2007: I have a simple table for printing file folder labels. When I tried to navigate around or select items (text, rows, columns, etc.), only the keyboard works, NOT THE MOUSE!  I spent an hour researching the problem and could not find a solution, only confirmation that you have to use the keyboard working on a table. Also the table now prints unwanted gridlines. Again I've spent far too long without success to prevent them from printing, changing a number of settings to no avail.  Word 2007 is the only program I've tried so far, but I dread trying to use the "new" Excel or Outlook.  I anticipate the learning curve will be huge. So far I see NO advantage to Office 2007.  If you're using 2003, don't change!!! I see nothing to gain and a lot to lose.	-1
I ordered this Student and Teacher Office package omly becauase I had "used up" the licensed copies from the previous version Office (2003). My reward for trying to obey MicroSoft's license agreement was software that barely recognizable. They also omitted the Outlook Express that was part of the Office 2003 package. Now, I need to relearn Microsoft Word because the 2007 version is sooooo different. Had I known this, I think I would have chosen to download OpenOffice (for free!). It's interface is more intuitive and the price is right.	-1
I used the 2006 version and found no problems with it.  I have purchased the 2007 version and now I have no PCU speed.  I have tried everything on their support site to no avail.  I was getting flashbacks to the past NORTON products, when I clicked my mouse and the cursor would continue turning, with no computer response.  Once I removed this JUNK SOFTWARE, my computer "magically" returned to normal.  My days of using Trend Micro are over.  Also, if you are running a home network, be aware that the enclosed firewall does not automatically setup for you network printserver.  My second printer would not respond, and I received a print server error.  All the past firewalls I used had no problems (zone alarm, kaspersky, norton, CA, etc.), but this one would not work, even with support help.  I did notice with this one, that I had to reinstall all the software for the home network and print servers, for all my printers, after I uninstalled PC-Cillin 2007.  Good Grief !!	-1
This program causes my computers to blue screen. I have contacted Trend twice now and they do not respond.	-1
I am absolutely amazed that this piece of garbage was shoved out the door for sale to the consumer.  Read my reviews, see how I praised the last 2 years of this product.  I was happy to upgrade when I received the email from them.  It's such a great product, I had no qualms for upgrading every year.  I downloaded the new installer and viola! the problems started.  First off, this program requires you to uninstall older versions of the previous product.  Well I was a happy user of PC-Cillin 2006 and thought no problem.  Big mistake!  Their uninstaller couldn't rid my system of all of the files so every time I ran the installer I was told another version existed on my computer and I needed to uninstall.  Guess what?  The uninstaller cleared out enough files that it couldn't launch the uninstaller for 2006.  What a joke!  It took a special uninstaller from the company to clear out all of the garbage.  I should have known right there that 2007 was going to be a disaster.  To my surprise (not really) 2007 would not install/load properly.  And the best part?  It cleared out my 2006 so I had nothing to go back to.  Can you say ZoneLabs Internet Security?  I can, did and I'm not looking back!  How does garbage like this get out to the market?  Steer clear if you value your PC.	-1
What a nightmare. Imagine everything that 2006 was and more bloat to spare. Just read the reviews for norton 2006. Symantec has learned nothing except,how to charge you for the privlege of getting their products to work. The protection may stop working at anytime,without warning. Of course norton will tell you everything is fine. I dare you norton to offer free live telephone support for the life,of your customers subscriptions,like leginamate decent companies offer. Just say no to this junkware. If your programs are working just renew your subscription. Thank you Stewart L.Update 10/24/06. You should know that webroot spysweeper is offering antivirus protection with their antispyware program. Of course symantec would seek to block a competitor. Symantec programs are buggy and unstable to begin with. And Webroot offers free live telephone support and really cares about its customers,unlike nortons get out your credit card support system!!! I am sure this program will work for some without a hitch. But just wait until you do have a problem!!!Many people raved about norton 2006,then reality set in. Well I hope this year is different. Thank You! Update 11/15/06. On my my 3 machines,the intrusion detection has reverted back to sept 22,2006. I wonder how many machines out there have old intrusion detections,running on their machines. This means you not protected against new viruses worms etc. Of course all is reported okey!!!Update 02/17/07. The intrusion error problem can be fixed with complete removel of this program and using their symart,or shall i say their partial removal tool! I am amazed at how many people get suckered into buying this program! It is terrible. And yes please continue to check your intrusion signatures. They may not be current on your computers! Update 02/19/07. My intrusions Detections failed to update. I was told by symantec to uninstall and reinstall again This means if i continue to use their program i have to reinstall monthly.!!!Updates itself great product Not!!	-1
Just like my title says, Symantec is the most awful AV software around. You'd think with all their R&D they would have automatic updates set to more than once a week by default, and actually fix the problems their software has had for the last ten years.  NOD32 blows this out of the water, uses no noticeable resources, and scans 300GB of data in eight minutes. It also updates continually and has a far greater ability to spot patterns of malicious code that are not in virii definitions yet compared to Symantec.  Sorry Norton, you're more useless than anyone can imagine.	-1
I cannot stress enough how bad Symantec is!!  This is by far one of the WORST software companies that exists today.  The poorest customer service, and if you REALLY want a reason to go postal, try finding your way around their website.  ALSO!!  Symantec is far from the best at catching viruses.  There are much better products out from McAfee, Trend Micro, and Sophos.  Go find them and don't waste your time here any longer!	-1
Recently, I have experienced SEVERE slowing down of my computer - hanging up when trying to shut it down, and prolonged start up times ALL of which were cured when I finally figured out the problem and removed this bloated software off my computer.  I'm not a software designer or a computer expert but am reasonably adept and skilled on the computer and can for the most part fix nearly every problem I encounter. I don't understand exactly WHY removing Norton solved my problems but I can tell you this: My computer has NEVER run so well and with so few problems. No crashes, no hanging up on shut down or start up, and lightening quick responsiveness once again.  The problems caused by this Norton program flummoxed until I finally isolated Norton as the culprit. I googled my multitude of problems and found that several people were have the same sorts of problems and identified Norton as the root cause. At first I rejected out of hand that a company as legendary and well regarded as Norton could be at the root of my problems, but decided out of frustration to delete the program and see how it impacted the multiple problems I was having.  Low and behold my problems miraculously vanished! I couldn't believe it! My daughter who had problems on start up worse than mine balked too at removing this program from her laptop but also discovered that the removal of Norton solved HER problems as well.  The new interface, to my way of thinking, is not as good as prior versions. Installation itself can be an adventure in frustration as it was for me. Worse, taking the damn thing off presents unique problems as well.  I told one of my friends what I'd discovered and he too deleted the program only to see all of his multiple problems disappear! He told me that he simply couldn't believe how good his computer was once again functioning. My uncle called me yesterday. He resisted taking Norton off his computer because he thought I was exaggerating the problems caused by Norton. He finally took Norton off when another of his friends told him the same thing. He told me he should have acted sooner thereby saving him all sorts of problems and heartaches.  I've replaced Norton Antivirus with Trend Micro's PC-Cillin and Zone Alarm both of which are highly regarded. Other highly regarded antivirus programs that are NOT resource hogs and do not cause the multitude of problems caused by this bloated pig of a software program are AVG antivirus from Grissoft and Avast! antivirus - both work great.  If you are having unexplained problems with your computer that your anti-virus program and spyware programs are not solving and if you have this bloated pig of a program on your computer then you need to delete it.  Norton is busy destroying its franchise. I will not put ANY Symantec software on my computer. They are quirky, resource hogging, intrusive garbage which are nearly impossible to completely uninstall from your computer. Don't forget: the best way to install any Norton product is to skip it altogether.  BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK!!! BEWARE!! You have been warned.	-1
All of the headaches with this poorly designed resource hogging product are covered in the other reviews.  Want to keep your computer from slowing down?  Avoid Norton.  Want not to have to shell out 40 bucks EVERY YEAR because your virus definitions expire?  Avoid Norton.  Practically every other anti-virus solution is just as good and usually better... and ALWAYS cheaper.	-1
Norton Internet Security 2007 has to be one of the worst products that I have ever purchased.  It slowed my PC to an unacceptable level.  When I disabled some of its unnecessary functions, it continued to slow my PC and gave me the bonus of irritating & uneccesary notifications/ warnings.  I was a longtime, dedicated user of Norton, but that has changed.  Try something else and avoid reduction of speed, adding an addtional bar to screen your screen, additional clutter and other deficiencies. If Amazon had a rating for less than one star, I would have given one of those negative ratings.  Amazon should not sell an item with such poor quality. I have yet to see somebody say something good about it which would come close to justifying its negative characteristics. CAN SOMEBODY RECOMMEND AS BETTER ANTI-VIRUS?	-1
I finally took Norton Internet security 2007 off my computer, which is not an easy task.  I kept getting errors that would turn automatic virus protection off!  Once it is turned off, only by rebooting the computer could it be turned back on. Norton would say that they downloaded a fix for my error, but it would still randomly happen.  It is also slow, large and really takes over your computer. I noticed that other spyware programs would discover spyware when Norton Internet Security did not.  I could see that it is very particular of what software programs it will work with...I am a computer technician, I was in love with System Works, now I will avoid this program until they once again establish their customers trust. I know of others now that will not touch this program.	-1
This program is terrible,but by amazon erasing all the reviews you may be fooled into buying this Dont buy it and file a complaint with amazon for censorship of the truth...Update 7/19/07 The reviews have been restored,but install at your own risk! I would not recommend this program to my worst enemy. Like norton antivirus 2007 and norton 360,you may suffer system crashes computer damage,or a virus that norton misses. Avoid! You have been warned.	-1
I have two desktops, one running Win XP (Dell Dimension 4600, 2.8 Ghz, one running Win Vista, 2.4 Ghz dual core).  I ran the full scan starting at the same time on both using Norton Internet Security 2007.  The XP version scanned almost 600,000 items in less than 2 hours.  The Vista version is still running after almost 8 hours and has managed only about 233,000 items.  The Vista PC is normally a fast machine.  It seems that Norton has some work to do to take advantage of dual core technology.  Had I known it was going to be this slow (not the first time, either), I'd have opted for ZoneLabs.  Zonelabs also found spamware that was not detected by Norton.  Granted that it was low-risk, but Norton should have found this kind of stuff as well.  I'd probably look more carefully next time before buying a security suite.	-1
After 2 days - 7 hours online with tech chat yesterday and 1.5 hours on the phone today, this software will not completely run on my office pc.  I have followed every article, every change, every setting (some they have had me do 3 times!), still same problem, same error message.  They finally refunded my money and told me to buy a disk instead of downloading.  I installed Norton System Works 2007 on home PC and spent 2 days trying to get all the features working on my laptop.  This is the last year I will buy Norton anything!	-1
Numerous people comment about how they are continually pestered by the "your subscription is about to expire" message which, as far as I know, can NOT be disabled. Just another way to get a few bucks since you are forced to decide whether to put up with the messages or just install the newer version.  Since I have multiple computers, I purchased the 3 user pack. Since the NIS 2006 on the three computers did NOT expire at the same time, I waited as long as I could ( I finally gave up as in paragraph 1) before upgrading. These comments are after I have performed three upgrades  Comments:  1) This is the FIRST time NIS has ever installed cleanly and without any problems. Consider what a pain the many previous installations have been I was hoping other problems were corrected too.  2) LiveUpdate required 10-15MB and actually worked on dialup.  3) Norton ripped me off of 1 1/2 months of license time on the third installation. ( which was a month after the first two installations ) Specifically, having lost the end of the previous license period because I was tired off the "renew now" messages, when I activated installation #3 I was told I had 338 days remaining ( THIS IS BASED ON THE FIRST INSTALLATION )  I wish that someone in the US government would go after Norton as I am sick of being rippped off and ripped off and ripped off by this company ( the other ripoff is "your subscription has expired; renew now". You can reactivate but many people don't realize how and they probably just fork up the money )	-1
I've had Norton products on my computers for over 10 years. And for most of those 10 years have experienced no problems whatsoever. Since the 2003 and 2004 version of this software program I have experienced SEVERE slowing down of my computer, hanging up of my computer when trying to shut it down, and prolonged start up times ALL of which were cured when I took this bloated software off my computer.  I'm not a software designer or a computer expert but am reasonably adept and skilled on the computer and can for the most part fix nearly every problem I encounter.

Low and behold my problems miraculously vanished! I couldn't believe it! My daughter who had problems on start up worse than mine balked too at removing this program from her laptop but also discovered that the removal of Norton solved HER problems as well.  This new product has dropped the antispam and ad blocking functionality available in previous versions. You do have the opportunity, however, to buy these separately should you be so foolish.  The new interface, to my way of thinking, is not as good as prior versions.  Installation itself can be an adventure in frustration as it was for me.  Worse, taking the damn thing off presents unique problems as well.  I told one of my friends what I'd discovered and he too deleted the program only to see all of his multiple problems disappear!

Norton has been getting these reports on their software for over three years and refuses to correct the problem. It is hard to imagine what is going through their heads. These fools figure they can sell junk software forever. WRONG!! They are destroying their franchise. I will not put ANY Symantec software on my computer.  They are quirky, resource hogging, intrusive garbage which are nearly impossible to completely uninstall from your computer.  Don't forget:  the best way to install any Norton product is to skip it altogether.  BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK!!! BEWARE!! You have been warned.	-1
Every year I go out and by Turbo Tax for the convenience and that I can down load the information with ease from my quicken program.  This is a big plus in the programming and it's only benefit.  But I always wind up doing it by hand anyway.  In years past, turbo tax was issued and then a follow up final issue with all the information was added so if you waited until April, you would be assured to have the final version which allowed you to print and do your state taxes.  Unfortunately, this is no longer the case.  You have to go online to get the final versions.  What if you do not have online access?  Well then you have you have to call them and are not guaranteed to get any help that way.  The headache is not worth it..  Since the IRS puts all of its final laws into place in June, can't turbo tax and other software put out there final versions by December 1?  Since we are forced to pay taxes every year, shouldn't this be as complete as possible BEFORE they release it?  This way all we need is one program and not worried about getting on line or worried about new product information.  Consider other options until they fix this part of the programming.	-1
If ths following is your idea of good product support, then by all means, purchase Turbo Tax.  While using the software, I had no idea that this limitation to Turbo Tax existed.  As for me, my next purchase will be Tax Cut.  The only provision for claiming excess railroad retirement tax on Form 1040 is for tier 1 withholding. The excess can be derived from a combination of railroad employers or in connection with a railroad and non-railroad employer. The program does properly record the excess of the tier 1 tax on line 67 Form 1040 as a credit against income taxes. It does nothing with the tier 2 excess tax. This must claimed separately, as you noted in your email, on form 843 which is not supported by the Turbo Tax software.  The software's help does contain information regarding tier 1 and 2 railroad retirement withholding. The help clearly indicates that only tier 1 may be claimed as a credit against current year income taxes. It goes on to state, "You cannot claim a refund for excess tier 2 RRTA tax on Form 1040. Instead use Form 843."	-1
I spent hours working on my return. I had it complete except for a form that was not available. When Turbo Tax emailed to come back to my return and they would finish it with the unavailable form, my whole return was lost. I did nothing, except go back to the program. As I opened the program it automatically began to update, no way to stop this process. It updated 10 forms. I had updated the program 3 days before when I began my return. Now I have to start all over again and spend hours working on my return again. Bad flaw in the program. I cannot get to Turbo Tax to tell them about this flaw, I keep running into walls. I also saved everything I did as I went along.	-1
Before you buy this, you should be aware that Intuit charges $15 for each e-file, Federal or state.  There's no free e-filing with Turbo Tax, period.  Seriously, I think $15 is a lot to pay for e-filing.  There are websites that give you completely free e-filing; my favorite is TaxAct (at taxactonline dot com).  With TaxAct, you get the complete Federal plus state package for $7.95, which includes e-filing.  Or you can use their standard package to prepare Federal and e-file for free, with *NO* income restriction!  I don't work for any of these companies, nor any tax-related company, nor any such entity.  I just don't think it's right for Intuit to charge customers such a ridiculously high fee for e-filing, whereas people can e-file for free elsewhere.  BTW, if you use Turbo Tax to prepare your return, you'll have to use Intuit's e-filing service if you want to e-file; you can't just take your file to another website and expect that website to do it for you.  I used TaxAct in the past and they are very dependable.  You can find reviews of TaxAct products in major magazines and on major websites.  Good luck.	-1
Unlike years past, H&R Block (founded by a guy named Bloch) decided to charge $16 for each e-file, Federal or state.  Only one version, "Premium Federal+State+E-file" includes a "free" Federal e-file and state e-file; but that version costs $70, so there's no free lunch at all.  Seriously, $16 is a lot to pay for e-filing.  There are websites that give you completely free e-filing; my favorite is TaxAct (at taxactonline dot com).  With TaxAct, you get the complete Federal plus state package for $7.95, which includes e-filing.  Or you can use their standard package to prepare Federal and e-file for free, with *NO* income restriction!  I don't work for any of these companies, nor any tax-related company, nor any such entity.  I just don't think it's right for H&R Block to charge customers such a ridiculously high fee for e-filing, whereas people can e-file for free elsewhere.  BTW, if you use Taxcut to prepare your return, you'll have to use H&R Block's e-filing service if you want to e-file; you can't just take your file to another website and expect that website to do it for you.  I used TaxAct in the past and they are very dependable.  You can find reviews of TaxAct products in major magazines and on major websites.  Good luck.	-1
and so when they mailed me the free software for my Mac, I decided to use it again. We have rental properties and when I started to input the information, the software quickly recommended upgrading to premium. Ok, so I did. Now, I have to ditch this whole return and buy Turbo Tax as well since it's screwed up my rental figures by applying "real estate professional" to one property only. It's mysteriously disallowed my depreciation.  The questions the program asks are lockstep and don't give enough straight forward help (like the other reviewer it was recommended that I read some lengthy IRS pamphlet- that's a great help-- thanks a lot!!) and it is difficult to know where it goes wrong in the interview. I think this software was rushed onto the market without enough testing. However, I'm sure that if your return is fairly simple and not 35 pgs long like mine, it works OK.	-1
I used Turbo Tax for many years and every year it got better and better.  Then I tried Tax Cut for two years in a row and was surprised how much clumsier of a program it was to use.  I even ran into situations where I had to override TaxCut's built in methods to get certain things done correctly.  I've never had to do so with Turbo Tax.  I finally wrote on my file folder where I collect receipts for the coming tax years "Do Not Buy Tax Cut" so that I wouldn't forget.  If you are doing a simple tax return then almost any software will do, but if you have a more complex return with rental properties, investments, trusts or anything else beyond normal wage and salary income and the common deductions then TurboTax is IMO the way to go.  If your needs are fairly straightforward, then saving a few bucks by getting TaxCut might be OK.	-1
I have to be honest. If you do very little, this package will do very little along with you. I REALLY wish Nero existed for the Mac. Roxio's poorly stable programs, lack of features, and non-existent customer support makes for a pretty ill customer base. Ahh, but they probably don't care about that, they just want your money. So, if you'd like to donate $65 to the Roxio bank account fund-raiser, please click, "Add to cart".  Just don't forget you still need to buy CD/DVD burning software afterwards, mk?	-1
Unlike many other companies, when you want to update toast you are faced with a time consuming process.  You must register the product (with your email address). Create an account. Log into that account. Download your update. Reinstall the software (on my most recent update I had to re-enter the CD license key)!  What a hassle!  If not for the difficult updating procedure this software could be rated 4 or 5 stars.	-1
I purchased a new laptop and it came with Vista and 60 day trial of Norton Internet Security 2007.  Because I am a registered user of a previous version of Norton products I received an offer directly from Symantec to buy Norton 360, 3 PC version for less than the Amazon price even with purchase of the download-for-a-year capability.  The good:  - The download and install of the product went smoothly in about 20 minutes.  - The protection is very broad and covers all the typical types of assaults.  - The controls are easy to manage and tweak.  The bad:  - After the download, whenever I go to PayPal the logon is prevented because the browser think's PayPal's security certificate has been revoked.  Both PayPal and Symantec blame Microsoft, but it worked okay before 360 and it works fine on the Vista desktop I have protected by Live OneCare.  The workaround is temporarily suspend anti-phishing protection, which 360 makes easy.  - 2 days after purchasing the software I went online to load Norton 360 on my second desktop.  The site rejected my order number as invalid.  When I logged in to the Symantec site, it shows I have an active license but doesn't show I have any orders.  After 4 attempts I finally got a response from the Symantec email support team.  It was obvious they hadn't read the details of my problem, only the header.  They gave me the link to put in my order number to download, but of course that is the problem.  The note also warns I shouldn't contact them about the same problem again for 7 days.  I guess I could use my dime and queue up for who knows how long on their phone response support, but that doesn't seem cost effective for less than $50, especially when the result may be the same.  I have contacted the email support team again, no response at this point.  So I am less than a week into a 3 computer license with a year of download protection with only one copy working and no way to get the other copies.  If they do not respond by the time my credit card statement comes I am cancelling the software payment and will unload the software.  I have happily used Symantec products in the past but was never reduced to using their download service or online support.  It appears ignorance is bliss as my experience with the service and support is that they are extremely poor.  So if you do want to try this product I strongly suggest staying away from Symantec's online store and get the CD.  This should reduce the probability of problems and needing to interact with Symantec itself.	-1
I have been an avid Norton Symantec user for over 13 years.  This is the worst product EVER. It slows your system down so much that I had to disable most of the features, which an average user will not know how to do.  My biggest complaint is that once the "virus update" expires.. it renders the entire software useless. I couldn't even go in and make simple changes to the settings, nothing to do with the virus update feature. PLUS  A pop-up comes up everyday twice a day begging me to buy another year subscription. That is false. What they are really asking is that I buy the software again. Once a year is up .. you might as well throw it in the trash OR give it to someone else OR wipe your hard drive and install a fresh copy.  I am not happy with it at all! I will never buy any anti-virus or internet security software from this company again.  I have heard of complaints that it will crash your system the day it expires.  Uninstalling any Norton products are difficult and you should find a good article on the internet on how to do this.  NOTE: You must uninstall any anti-virus software if you are installing a different brand.	-1
Highly recommend not installing this on your system.  It completely took over my office computers and eliminated internet access, disabled all our printers and cost us almost two weeks of manpower to somewhat restore things to normal.  Uninstalling Norton 360 caused extensive damage, we had to reinstall multiple programs.  I would like to see a class action lawsuit against them to recover time and wages lost trying to fix the problems they caused.	-1
This product may be OK for virus and spyware prevention. As best as I can tell I haven't had any viruses sneak through. When it comes to something that I can evaluate well i.e. its' backup capability I can say that it is a complete failure. It is difficult to schedule a backup. You cannot backup to a drive on your home network. Online capability is way too slow and too small. When I click -backup now-  it fails. It will give a message that I am adequately backed up and when I check the backup file I find that none has been done for 2 weeks. I would suggest looking elsewhere for a program such as this. Ithink that the only reason I still use Norton products is simple inertia.	-1
This software makes Internet browsing slow down to a crawl because it's so bloated and resource intensive. Stay away and use anything else but this horrible product.	-1
Try different security software since all manufacturers offer free trials (most 30 days, though Norton's is 15), and no security software works great on all computers. You can then purchase the software you like elsewhere at a lower cost compared to the manufacturer and type in the security key.  I am giving stars to the security software I tried based on how well it protects and what are the odds of the product working well. On the plus side Norton is bullet proof, and I can attest to that since we use it at work (it also has advantages in a network environment). Five star protection.  On the down side, from my perspective that while this is the first year since 1993 performance is not bad but still not good. But my biggest problem is that I think it is locked down so tight that it too easily causes side affects.  I tried 360 at home and I could not get it to work at all, and I have a high level of expertise with computers.  But that is OK since like I said, no security software works perfectly on all computers. However I could not remove it. I tried standard uninstall, a utility program on the Norton site, and standard windows methods including registry deletions. I finally booted up in command mode and deleted the program that way. However I then lost network connections and tried for three hours before I gave up and did a total new install of Windows. It must have thought I was a virus. We have problems at work which we solve with new installs also. Based on all that I hear at work, and my experience with the trials, I feel odds are good it will not work for you hence two stars.  I also evaluated Trend Micro and BitDefender on two of my home computers, a super fast computer and my kids old 1.4ghz clunker, both XP computers built by me. BitDefender was outstanding on my kids virus/malware magnet, but somehow either it or I turned off protection on my computer (granted it warned me with two big red X's and I was too dense to look that up). The 2007 version of Trend Micro does not work on my kid's computer. I hated the McAfee 2007 interface so I never tried the 2008 version.  Bottom line - TrendMicro, BitDefender, Norton, Panda, and others offer great protection. Pick one and see if it works great. If you do not have Norton, I would try one of the others first since I think others have a better chance of working. I decided on TrendMicro, bought the software from Amazon much cheaper then straight from TrendMicro, and inserted the security key into the evaluation copy.	-1
Norton 360 is a terrible program. It is a resource hog,allows viruses and spyware in and may destroy your programs. It cost me over 200 dollars to have my machine repaired,after norton 360 killed it. I wouldnt recommend this program to my worst enemy..I consider this a beta program for paying customers...Tech support is terrible!!!And now get ready for 2008...Please wait for customer reviews by customers using these under real world conditions...Run as fast as you can away from 360...The computer you save may be your own.	-1
Do not buy this junkware Amazon erased all reviews. People may be fooled into buying this junkware. It will kill your programs and erase your critical data. I will add more info on the review if it goes past the amazon censors..Update 7/19/07. The reviews were restored..I just want to add that my computer was essentially destroyed by this wonderful program,costing me over 200 dollars to be repaired. Never Again Goodbye Norton!!!	-1
I have had many many versions of Symantec.  the latest is Norton 360.  I bought it because it was a 3 computer license, and I have 3 computers.  But, true to form, it is STILL one of the most annoying softwares on the market.  thanks largely to one piece - ccapp.exe.  if I put a CD in my laptop, Norton 360 hangs.  No matter how many times I click on it, nothing, and ccapp.exe is running at 50% of my cpu.  Try ANYTHING else.	-1
Having serious systems issues with Windows Live OneCare at the end of my annual subscription I decided to go back to my old Norton standby in its latest format which had everything I wanted in an antivirus, firewall and backup suite. The PC mags gave it glowing reviews so I took the plunge. As others here mentioned, the install and registration took about 20 minutes and was painless. The initial scans went well and no malware was uncovered. When I booted up Outlook it sent my outgoing messages OK but kept bombing out on the receiving. Then the 360 software indicated a fault condition wherein the virus protection had been shut off. Pressing the "fix" button resulted in nothing. Rebooting the system solved everything until I ran Outlook which repeated the cycle all over again. I uninstalled the software, rebooted the system and did a reinstall of the 360. Same results all over again. I think I will stick with McAffee which seems to be more robust on my system albeit the scan times are longer.	-1
I've used Peter Norton programs since the days of CPM and found them to be simple, easy to use and well engineered.  However, this Ghost 12.0 program leaves a lot to be desired before it becomes User friendly.  I assume some outside software engineering company in China designed this program for them.  1.) The program is very slow to load. 2.) Instructions are very hard to follow and you don't get a manual.  The only manual that I could find on-line to print out, was for version 10. 3.) The program is a stand-along and does not intergrate into the System Works Program like their AntiVirus does. 4.) There is no sync feature. 5.) You can't rename your backup profiles without re-entering them. 6.) Their program rating form is joke.  Give them a sad smiling face (low-rating) and your not allowed to forward the survey... 7.) I backup to 2 external drives and I'm alway getting error messages.  One error message said that Norton didn't know what to do inorder to correct the program.  In my opinion, I would never recommend that someone buy this expensive program.  After 12 revisions, they still don't know what to do with it so it's User friendly.  Go buy something else.	-1
I'm updating my review, because I have used it to convert a few more of the family movies and I will say that while slow, it did do the job. I just want to make it clear that this should only be used to make video files you created smaller. And if you created the video files in the first place, the tool you used should be able to do that for you, so I'm not sure you truly need a tool like Crunch. ================================== The misleading description was actually a real issue for me. I do understand the concept of copy protection, but I was also going by the description given to the product. If you do not own an iPod that can display video, this is not a useful tool. My understanding from the description of the product was that I'd be able to "convert your movies and shows" but when they say "your movie" they don't mean DVDs that you purchased but would like to watch on your iPod.  I wanted this product to put a couple of kids movies on my husband's iPhone so my son could watch them on long car rides, but you can't use it to crunch copy protected (i.e. store bought) DVDs.  I guess I don't understand how my paying retail price for a DVD doesn't allow me to put the movie onto my iPod. To be clear, I don't blame Roxio for this problem, but I do blame them for not being clearer about the limitations in the description.  The interface was easy to use, and it did work well on a movie I'd shot with my own video camera (AVI), but that was just not what I'd hoped to use it for, as I have very little need to watch those videos on my iPod.	-1
I was excited about getting and reviewing this product, because I had recently bought an iPhone and wanted a good way to load movies on it.  I already been using an earlier version of another Roxio product, Popcorn.  So, let's say you're the average person who has a iPod or iPhone and wants to take those DVDs you have in your library and view them on your handheld wonder.  Roxio Crunch does that, right?  Wrong.  The legality of taking a DVD movie you own and making a digital copy for your own personal use is still in a legal gray area, so companies like Roxio won't touch it, so actually Crunch can't make copies of any standard copyrighted, copyprotected DVD you buy in a store.  Out of the box it's only good for home-movie DVDs you've made yourself. Now, if you can find another program that will copy the DVD onto your computer (into what is known as a video-ts folder), then Crunch will help.  Or it was supposed to.  I had trouble using it to convert a video ts folder I already had on my computer, and when I emailed their help desk they refused to help me once they learned that the video ts folder was of a copyrighted product. I tried converting another file and it converted, but the video and audio didn't properly sync.  And it gets worse.  Crunch is getting heavily promoted, but it is essentially just a stripped down version of Roxio's flagship product Popcorn 3, which is a much more powerful program for only ten bucks more.  So what did I end up doing?  I'm using HandBrake, a downloadable program that performs beautifully, has more options than Crunch, and will work on most copyrighted DVDs to boot.  And, oh, it's free.	-1
The front of the box states this is "The Essential Video Converter." The first sentence on the back says "Roxy Crunch helps you easily convert your DVDs, movies and TV shows..."  Ha! I was really excited to get this product. In my work, I often have to study cartoons and movies, and being able to store them on my Mac would really save me time. Installing this software was easy, and it was easy to learn how to use. But then... it wouldn't convert ANY of my DVDs. Yes, it does say it won't convert copy-protected material, but that information is in small print on the bottom of the box.  I finally found a DVD it would convert, a promotional freebie. However, just one 30-minute segment took over an hour to convert! Not exactly SAVING me time!  For what it's worth, I have a dual processor G5 with 2G of memory.	-1
I lost trust if a company failed me twice. As many users found out update version 7.0.047 is a piece of junk, I must roll back to version 7.0.462 to make the software work again. This is the second time ZoneAlarm did to their customers or at least, me.  My side job needs me to try out many different (security) software and recommend to my clients, so sorry ZoneAlarm is currently out of my list. Also, I need to call and follow up the rebate or they just think it's their money. Although Norton is a bit bulky, their software is as good as ZoneAlarm and rebate check arrived within a month and worry free (big improvement compare with past history).	-1
There really is in my opinion the only thing that I liked above other security software is the email checking.  On the negative side the software is constantly updating itself which on my PC slowed it down or stopped other use.  When doing a virus check with only 25G in use it would completely stop all other use for over an hour (I could play solitare if I didn't change games).	-1
March 15, 2009: I wrote a review for ZoneAlarm (see below) over a year ago. Recently I updated my computer to version 8. The problem with ZA being a cpu pig continues to be bad. The process scanningprocess.exe still hogs the CPU every time you try to use the computer.  Turning it off under  "antivirus - advanced options" restores the performance of your computer at the expense of ZA not scanning every file that comes into the cpu. Most of the files that you use are simply routine application files that ZA checks over and over at the expense of bringing the performance to a crawl. What you want ZA to check are new files that it has not seen before, but ZA is not smart enough to make the distinction. Norton Security Suite used to be the champion CPU pig along with McAfee, but Norton has now solved the problem. Both XP and VISTA will run smoothly with Norton with only a very modest tax on performamnce (unless you look you will never notice its tiny affects). It's too bad. ZA has been my favorite for many years. I like the level of control it gives you and I like the near-perfect firewall, but the perfromance hit is too much. Now, Nortin has improved its firewall and Antivirus components to match or exceed ZA. For me it's bye-bye ZA, and buy-buy Norton.  Previous Review ZoneAlarm 7.1 for Vista is not ready for retail sale. Once you install it with Vista, your computer will likely slow to a crawl. The reason is simple (for most people).  Zonealarm security suite will continuously run two processes, both called scanningprocess.exe, that along with another ZoneAlarm process, VSMON.exe, will consume most of your cpu. There seems to be no way to turn this off. On my machine, a new Lenovo with 2GB of ram, the cpu useage bounces around from 17% to 90%, with most of the time being above 50%. WIth so much of the computer's resources consumed, there is little left for you, the user. Plus, if you do something,such as starting a program, the useage jumps even higher. Finally, even though ZoneAlarm has just finished updating its files, it will continuously run updclient.exe, which takes up about 25% of the cpu.  The company that produces ZoneAlarm, CheckPoint, will not respond to customer inquiry about this problem. So, go ahead and install it, and see if I am right. Oh, I forgot to mention, once you install it, it is hard tocompletely remove the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Zonealarm-Internet-Security-Suite-3-User/dp/B000Q1N7FS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Zonealarm Internet Security Suite - 3 User</a><a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/ZoneAlarm-Internet-Security-Suite/dp/B000HKPB3E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">ZoneAlarm Internet Security Suite</a>program.  After posting this message, I have found a way to "solve" the problem of ZoneAlarm being CPU pig. You will have to turn off "On Access Scanning".  Go to the AntiVirus/AntiSpyware tab and click on "Advanced Options", the click on "On Access Scanning".  Uncheck the Enable Box. Click OK.  In a few minutes your computer should return to normal civilized behavior.  You have lost a valuable feature, but, hey, you can actually do something useful on your computer.  This problem does not seem to affect the older versions under XP.  Good Luck!  Operating System: Windows Vista Home Premium Software Version: 7.1 (Vista) Product Name: ZoneAlarm Pro	-1
I purchased the three user license, downloaded the latest release from ZA's website, and installed on three fairly new XP PC's.  All have from 512 - 1 GB RAM and processors at least 3 GHz.  This program killed ALL THREE.  The other reviews were totally accurate, boot and shutdown take forever, the computer slows to a crawl, everything just dies.  Click to open a browser and wait five minutes, click ctrl+alt+del for task manager and cross your fingers because even that is hosed.  And if you see the icon indicating a scan is in progress, you might as well go find something else to do for an hour or two.  The scan takes forever and it completely freezes your PC for the most part.  You have a better chance of hitting the lottery than successfully deactivating the scan (or active updates).  I tried everything, tweaked all the settings, checked for updates, tried all the suggestions from the ZA forums and support boards.  Nothing worked.  And I'm not a computer newbie.  After finally getting fed up, I tried several times to uninstall but I keep encountering an error that the "truevector" service cannot be stopped.  So I'm basically stuck with it unless I go in and rip it out manually.  I just activated my license at the beginiing of the summer but I am so disgusted with this product I plan to uninstall it from all three PC's and go with something different.  I hate wasting the money on this program, but I honestly don't know what happened to Zonealarm.  This version of ZAIS is easily the worst AV product I have ever used.... EVER.	-1
This product continues the tradition of slow bloated software.  The program size at over 300Mb is bigger than ever(and slower to).  As the same for the clunky Norton 2007 every time you install a new piece of software with Antivirus 2008 the junk Norton will force a scan of your system(even if auto-protect is turned off).  So if you have an older slower machine be prepared to wait 15 minutes after you install a piece of software before you try out the new program because Norton Antivirus 2008 will hijack your machine without your permission and make it virtually unusable until it finishes scanning.  Last year I tried out Norton Antivirus 2007 and Kaspersky.  Kaspersky found a KEYSTROKE LOGGER that Norton totally missed.  I would not expect this clunky 2008 version to be any better.  Also keep in mind that Norton will charge at least 40 bucks a year to renew the 1 year virus signature subscription.  Avoid the expensive and sluggish Norton moneypit.	-1
I've never been a fan of Norton products, but unfortunately I have to use them on several computers at work. While I don't have a formal education in computers, I've built several of them from scratch, am an early adopter of things like Vista 64-bit, and spend a lot of time reading about them. Frankly, Norton anti-virus uses so much system resources it should be classified as bloatware, or even malware.  If you want your computer to run 30% slower, buy it. If you want your computer to run 10-15% slower, buy Macafee. If you want your computer protected from viruses and to run at peak efficiency, download one of the excellent, free virus software suites that are available.	-1
First, this is only virus protection; it will not protect against spyware.  You need Norton Internet Security Suite or 360 if you really want to use Noton products for fullprotection (And I think poorly of them).  Granted you can use this product and purchase spyware protection such as Webroot or Ad-Aware pro (the free version of Ad-Aware requires you to download updates and start the scan yourself).  But if you really want to mix packages there better virus protection packages out there.  I define "better virus protection" as either: 1)  As good of protection but much cheaper. 2)  Better protection at a somewhat lower price. 3)  More likely to work on your computer (notice that 100% of security software gives some computers problems).  Since Norton is as expensive as it gets and is the least like to work (in my opinion from using it on our systems at work and home use), the only reason to purchase it is that it is not the absolute worst out there.  That is not a good reason.	-1
I used to use NAV on all my computers. The last few years though, it has gone done hill more each year. NAV 2008 is no exception. It is more bloated and than ever. Symantec needs to start over from scratch, and put out a real new version. A version that has less bugs, doesn't slow systems down to a crawl, and doesn't require 100's of MB's of disk space. The only reason I don't give it one star is that the program does do a decent job of stopping viruses.	-1
The tech specs say that Windows XP Pro is sufficient.  WRONG!  Windows XP Pro is insufficient unless Service Pack 2 has been installed.  Neither of my two laptops will accept Service Pack 2, so this product is useless to me.  False advertising!	-1
As a past user of Norton Internet Security (experience with NIS 2002), I feel an obligation to warn people off of this product.  (1) In 2004, a Live Update apparently created a situation in which my computer's performance slowed to a crawl, with NIS using about 99 percent of the CPU as shown by Task Manager.  (2) More than a dozen E-mails to Symantec's customer service and technical support representatives went unanswered, as did at least one fax addressed to the department's manager. This demonstrates the company's attitude toward quality and customer service.  (3) After early 2006, I could no longer buy virus definition updates. Symantec told me I'd have to buy the newest edition of their software, despite online reviews about it ruining entire computers (people had to reformat their hard drives). I recall that one of their technical support people said it was a good idea to reformat one's hard drive every so often. Instead, I bought Frisk F-prot (same annual price for virus definitions) and it has worked fine for 1.5 years.  (4) I can't uninstall Norton Antivirus via Windows Control Panel. If I disable the registry keys, it jams Word for Windows and every other Windows program that calls for a virus scan. In other words, even though I no longer use it, it still takes up space on my computer and I can't get rid of it.  I was an advocate of Symantec products five years ago. My more recent experience is that its software is of poor quality, and it has nothing but contempt for its customers.	-1
WARNING to anyone thinking about buying this product! Please understand that you will not be buying this product only RENTING it. If you do not renew every year the product stops working....COMPLETELY! I'm not just talking about updates, etc. It actually tells you that it has stopped working and it won't work unless you renew. I have just wasted more than 2 hours with Norton's online tech support. This is the case with ALL Norton products and I am quoting the tech.	-1
I bought this on PC Magazine's recommendation. I am running Vista. It really messed up my system. I uninstalled it and installed FREE virus software which does a great job.	-1
I have been a Norton Internet customer for years. But I have given up on them. I purchased NIS 2008 to upgrade my 2007 version, which was working fine, but the subscription was over. I downloaded and installed the eval product while I waited for my CD order to arrive. After installing it I noticed that whenever I filled out a form, particularly an Outlook (OWA)email, and sent the message the parent browser window would close. Sometimes all the opened browsers would close. This was pretty fustrating, so I started a Chat session with Symantec Technical Support. I won't trouble you with all the details,but the guy told me I had a virus and it would cost me $99 for them to fix it. I explained to him that the 2007 version never found any virus and this only occurred after installing 2008. I uninstalled 2008 and reinstalled 2007 the problem went away. After the rude, totally unrelated questions and their demand for me to pay them to fix their problem, I have had enough. I have 6 days left on the NIS subscription then I am going to McAfee. Thanks for nothing Symantec.	-1
Try different security software since all manufacturers offer free trials (most 30 days, though Norton's is 15), and no security software works great on all computers.  You can then purchase the software you like elsewhere at a lower cost compared to the manufacturer and type in the security key.  I am giving stars based on how well it protects and what are the odds of the product working well.  On the plus side Norton is bullet proof, and I can attest to that since we use it at work (it also has advantages in a network environment).  Five star protection.  On the down side, I do not like Norton since while not bad anymore, it is not fast and efficient.  But my biggest problem is that I think it is locked down so tight that it too easily causes side affects.  I tried it at home and I could not get it to work at all, which is OK since like I said, no security software works perfectly on all computers.  However I could not remove it.  I tried standard uninstall, a utility program on the Norton site, and standard windows methods including registry deletions.  I finally booted up in command mode and deleted the program that way.  However I then lost network connections and tried for three hours before I gave up and did a total new install of Windows.  It must have thought I was a virus.  We have problems at work which we solve with new installs also.  Based on my expereince and all that I hear, I feel odds are good it will not work for you hence two stars.  Like I said, nothing works well on all computers I also evaluated Trend Micro and BitDefender on two of my home computers, a super fast computer and my kids old 1.4ghz clunker, both XP computers built by me.  BitDefender was outstanding on my kids virus/malware magnet, but somehow either it or I turned off protection on my computer (granted it warned me with two big red X's and I was too dense to look that up).  The 2007 version of Trend Micro does not work on my kid's computer.  I hated the McAfee 2007 interface so I never tried the 2008 version.  Bottom line - TrendMicro, BitDefender, Norton, Panda, and others offer great protection.  Pick one and see if it works great.  If you do not have Norton, try one of the others first since I think others have a better chance of working.  I decided on TrendMicro, bought the software from Amazon much cheaper then straight from TrendMicro, and will be inserting the security key into the evaluation copy.	-1
Proud of that brand new computer of yours with super high-speed CPU, memory, hard drives and video adapter? Want to slow it down to a crawl so you can relive the early days of computing, of waiting and waiting and waiting for a process to complete?    Well, just add Norton Internet Security 2008!    System boot-up times will be extended by a factor of two or three. Just the thing you want when starting up your computer - a nice long wait. A really long wait.    And if that wasn't enough fun, wait until you launch your web browser. All those hours programmers spent trying to build fast response into their browser creations? Wasted effor. Norton Internet Security 2008 helps your browser pass away minute after minute after minute. You had no better use for your time anyway, did you? Norton Internet Security 2008 will slow your browser to a crawl.    Norton Internet Security 2008 will interrrupt you at least twice a day (and generally more) with an intrusive pop-up that new updates have been downloaded and that you need to restart your computer. Oh, how nice: they five you an option of being reminded in 1, 12 or 24 hours - but apparently no option to set the update schedule or turn off the annoying pop-ups. Symanytec's program architects certainly think that the user is not only clueless, but their slave as well.    Symantec has included a "feature" they call "Identity Safe". Every time you type in a password to a site it launches an annoying pop-up asking if you want to use "Identity Safe". You can click on the convenient "Do not show this window again" option a thousand times - and it will ignore you a thousand times. Norton Internet Security 2008 also grabs web browser tool bar space, but fortunately you can turn it off.    Does the product work for its intended purpose? That I don't know yet. I didn't have any viruses on my machine before I installed Norton Internet Security 2008 and it hasn't reported any.    Overall, Norton Internet Security 2008 slows down my computer to such an extent that I think it is unsuitable for its purpose. I'll be looking for a replacement.  Jerry	-1
Installs fine.  Uninstalls fine, after 3 hrs, due to phishing toolbar not working properly and chat room Norton Tech advising me to do so.  Does not reinstall, but gives off error popups.  Talk with Norton Techs on Chat line for 4 separate times, with no luck, besides frustration.  Norton Tech Chat Line is manned by uncourteous, non-mannered, non prepared and unknowledgeable people.  I was transfered 5 times from different tech's on 1 chat call and then hung up on.  Another tech kept asking if this was the first time I contacted the chat room, even after I said no and sent him my prior 3 chat authorization numbers for his verification. Poor Service on assistance.  I used the normal uninstall procedure and then the Norton Total Uninstall icon, both with negative results.  The registry is now splattered with Norton Reminants.  Software is now unable to be reinstalled (due to error popups), used only 3 hrs, the first night.  This Junk Software has not changed since the last time I swore I would not use it again (2004).  I hope their refund system works right!  P.S. This is a new Dell Computer I tried to install this software on.  I have no other Norton software installed or ever installed.	-1
This is based on my experience with Norton Internet Security 2002. Symantec's products are of low quality, and technical support might as well be nonexistent. Furthermore, Symantec has a nice trick to force you to buy new versions of NIS every few years; it cuts off your ability to download virus updates for older ones.  I am currently relying on Frisk F-Prot for virus protection, so I no longer need Norton Antivirus (part of the NIS package). However, I am unable to uninstall it. If I disable the executable file (e.g. by changing the extension to NULL), it freezes all my Microsoft Office applications like Word, because they still request virus scans from Norton Antivirus.  In 2004, a Live Update from Symantec apparently caused Norton Internet Security to take over a good 99 percent of my computer's CPU while bringing Internet performance to a crawl. Symantec's technical support people ignored more than a dozen E-mails, and a fax to the tech support manager also went unanswered--thus suggesting that Symantec's contempt for its customers comes from at least middle management if not higher.  On the basis of my experience with this product, Symantec is permanently disqualified from selling me anything whatsoever in the future. Its contempt for its customers is quite obvious from its marketing practices (cutting off your ability to buy virus updates for older versions), not having any meaningful technical support, and peddling products that cannot even be uninstalled.	-1
It is difficult to determine how effective this product isin the short term as far as keeping my computer "healthy:, as stated.  BUT it is not difficult to see how this has slowed down my computer.  I cannot believe how much time is wasted. There are frequent McAfee downloads, many of which prevent simultaneous work on the computer.  I am not happy to be in the middle of something and have to wait for a current download to complete itself.  I am removing this from my computer!	-1
You can protect your PC yourself, or just buy a MAC.  Either way all these lame virus scanners subscription software is a money making gimmic that doesen't work.  If you get hacked, or spyware etc this will not stop it only you can by not opening strange web pages, files and emails.  I used this product and my computer when scanned with AVG free (when it was free) and i was overrun with infections.  These products don't work.  Im trying Windows Live Protection right now as we speak as I use Vista/Leopard with dual boot on my MAcbook Pro.  Obviously I don't hve to worry aobut this stuff using Leopard, I have windows live protection for Vista, which Im not expecting much from.	-1
It is very difficult for the typical user to provide a truly insightful review of a product like this. Why? Because most of us are already protected from most internet threats by our Internet Service Provider. For example, the router supplied by my DSL provider has a firewall. My domain host screens for viruses and other malware. And, of course, I don't open attachments from strangers or even many of the people I know.    Additionally, there are many free utilities that perform many of the same tasks with less burden on the computer and less intrusively.    So I simply can't realistically evaluate this package in terms of how well it performs its basic functions.    Those services who do test programs such as this for their actual effectiveness put McAfee Internet Security Internet Suite in the middle of the pack.  I'll have to take their word for it.    Installation is no more difficult than it should be on a computer running Windows XP. I have not tested it on Windows Vista.    In terms of operation, McAfee puts a burden on the CPU, much the same way the Norton competitor does. McAfee is very intrusive with popups and warnings and, frankly, is irritating.    The very worst feature, in my opinion, is the enforced automatic renewal plan. You are compelled to provide a credit card number in the installation process to sign up for this dubious benefit. Yes, you can cancel, but not through McAfee's web site. No, you have to use Chat, Email or Telephone which require 8, 7 and 5 steps respectively. None of these methods provide instant cancellation.    If it were not for this "benefit", I might have given the product three stars. Because of it, I was tempted to give it one star. I find it offensive that a software publisher demands I obligate myself to a financial committment before I have even used the product - and makes me jump through hoops to cancel this forced purchase. McAfee also offers a 30 day refund policy on the entire product.    Overall, ignoring the forced renewal subscription agreement, the product is about average. A bit more streamlined than Norton, it is also more intrusive. It costs a bit less for three computer coverage than Norton. On the whole, computer users are well advised to research and consider both free and other commercial offerings before choosing this product. And if you do purchase this product, be very wary of their forced automatic renewal.  Jerry	-1
Installation was simple, encountered no errors running XP Pro. The interface seemed straight forward and easy to understand. However, I didn't notice any features that I would readily use that aren't available from freeware programs such as Zone Alarm. If you know where to look, you can get everything McAfee offers for free on the net from AdAware to K9 to Spybot. I've been using these freeware programs since release and I've never had a complaint. My PC has never been affected by any virus of any kind. So in my opinion, why fix what ain't broke? I can get better protection for free and I don't have to worry about McAfee dipping into my bank account without warning. Not a difficult choice! Avoid and stick with the freeware. They work better, they're free, and they don't hog all your system resources.	-1
You should ask yourself - "how can a piece of software be capable of generating so much hostility from its user base?" If you can't think up a good answer, go ahead and install Quicken, and you'll have an answer before long.  Some of my favorite quirks from Quicken 2006 & 2007 that I'm glad to see survived the upgrade to Quicken 2008:  Basic arithmetic errors: sometimes, if you edit transactions in the register, every subsequent transaction will get confused about the running total (e.g., change a $10 debit to a $20 debit, and instead of changing the running total by $10, watch in delight and amazement as the running total leaps by thousands, literally thousands, of dollars).  Basic reporting errors: go ahead and open the category list, and click the (very unintuitive) button to generate a report for the category _DivInc. If, like me, you have several years of investment transactions, you're sure to have dividend income, but Quicken will tell you "no transactions for this category." Funny, if you type _DivInc into the global search window, it will bring up all those transactions the report couldn't locate.  File corruption: sometimes, I like to imagine Quicken's routines as a bunch of angry little gnomes running around the traces of my processor and through the registers of my memory. This is because, every so often, the gnomes demand a sacrifice, and offer up burnt offerings of your data integrity to their terrible god of woe. I can't otherwise imagine how downloading QFX data from Hewitt Associates confused Quicken so - in the online center, it shows "number of outstanding transactions: -65,536" Yep, negative 2 to the 16th power of transactions outstanding.  Probably the worst part about Quicken, however, is trying to free your data. If you've got any kind of complicated financial picture (i.e, if you're over 25 years old), you won't be able to free yourself from Quicken's grasp, since the only way to get data out of the program is in QIF format, one measly account at a time. Funny, they don't support _importing_ QIFs, claiming, and I quote, "QIF technology is over 10 years old and was designed for technical support purposes . . . QIF Data Import requires many steps to download, is a poor customer experience and can lead to duplicate transactions and errors." That old technology is good enough for you should you dare to _export_ data from Quicken, however. They're going to make darn sure that you have a "poor customer experience" and suffer from "duplicate transactions and errors" if you try to take your data anywhere else.	-1
It's Quicken.  Those who use Quicken probably realize why I only gave it 2 stars.  Sad that it's the only thing out there now that Money is gone.	-1
[...]  Quicken came with my first Windows computer, a Packard Bell, back in 1996-ish.  It also came with Microsoft Money.  Both sucked then, but Money was better.  I downloaded the trial version of Money and 20-minutes later uninstalled it.  So I went to Wal-Mart and decided to give Quicken Deluxe a try.  Long story short, it's even worse!  First of all, what modern day program doesn't allow you to order your transactions by date in descending order - so the most recent date is on top?  Quicken wouldn't let me do it!  And if it's possible, I couldn't figure out how and frankly all you should have to do is click twice on the date column header like any other self-respecting spreadsheet-like program.  This alone is a brick wall for me.  I have a nearly new top of the line laptop.  Lots of speed, lots of RAM, lots of other things I don't use at their full capacity.  Quicken runs like a freakin' remote control car running out of batteries.  You try and scroll quickly down through your transactions - it can't keep up.  Rubbish.  When is Quicken going to realize that categories are EXTREMELY important and that the program should not make it a freakin' pain in the you know what just to change/edit/add categories.  You have to go into this menu that operates just as bad as the scrolling I just whined about and make changes that should have been (1) more user friendly and (2) capable of being done solely in the register instead of what feels like a third-party category management software program band-aid.  Most importantly, the user interface, easy-of-use, and presentation of the program is no better than the ancient version of Quicken that came on my Packard Bell computer over 10-years ago.  Sure it has tabs but ever since Firefox came up with tabs in its web browser, everyone has tabs.  They don't help a thing in Quicken.  Don't buy this.  Don't buy MS Money.  Read a MS Access book, learn Access, and create your own money management tool.  It'd be 100% customizable then, more user friendly, better looking, and you won't ever have to worry about exporting your data.  Heck, you can even use Excel and have a better experience.  Wow, Intuit, what a waste of money you've produced!  I'm sorry for being so negative, but this software is buggy, slow, ugly, and just plain no good.	-1
I have been a long-time Intuit user of Quicken (15 years)and I have always been happy with their programs.  Trouble free and dependable would be the main words that come to mind.  Last year when using another Intuit product (Turbo Tax)that I've used for almost equally as many years, I could not install some of its features.  I called Tech support but they could NOT HELP solve the problem either.  When I purchased Quicken 2008 and to upgrade from 2007, every thing went along well until the last few closing installation sections and the entire installation had to be uninstalled.  Tech support again was of no help.  They ran out of ideas after I spoke with 2 different levels of support and finally suggested I call Microsoft and see if they could help me.  (My computer runs fine, is not out of date in RAM, ROM, hard drive space, memory, etc.  I decided to download Money 2008 Deluxe and there were no installation issues.  Money transferred all of my 2007 Quicken information correctly and I was up and running with Money 2008 in no time!!  I was very happy and Money was very easy for me to adjust to after so many years of Quicken.  I think that Intuit's copyright protections on Quicken and Turbo Tax were the cause of my installation failures with each of the above programs.  I will be using  Tax Cut for my taxes this coming year also. NO MORE INTUIT frustrations for me!  I highly recommend Money 2008 over Quicken 2008.	-1
Don't buy this product if attempting to convert from MS Money.  According to Quicken Support answer 5901, the company has not released a working converter that will convert MS Money files to Quicken 2008.  The answers I get from Quicken vary, some indicate I should use an 8 year old manual conversion process - which doesn't work well if you have investments.  Others point me to a different answer which contains a process which doesn't work either.  In no case will the company tell me when the converter will be released, nor will they refund my money under their 60 day guarantee, because I can't find my receipt from my local big box warehouse.	-1
Downloaded KIS7 because previous subscription was expiring. During load it said to remove old K product first (why didn't the installation program remove it?) After tedious and time consuming process it finally loaded. Then it said database is obsolete (over one year old).  Why didn't it download the current database? When I clicked the button to update, it said the site could not be found.  The product shut off all access to the network (Internet, email, LAN).  I disabled all the protection, still no access to the net.  Then I tried to remove the program; it wouldn't let me! Other programs on my computer ran, but KIS7 wouldn't let itself be removed (isn't that what a virus does?). Then I tried to restart. KIS wouldn't let me restart!  At the risk of really screwing things up, I had no alternative but to cut power! I crossed my fingers that my computer still ran. Low and behold, KIS7 was gone, and I had access to the net.  But now I don't have any anti-virus protection!  Apparently "customer service" is best found on K's forum. The "expert" said not to use the standard MS removal program, but to use K's special program (why didn't the download instructions say that?). Then he said to create a "GSI log" which requires a tool from...the internet. But wait...KIS7 prevents me from having internet access!!!  What a nightmare! A day later, I am far worse off than I was yesterday at this time.  I use my computer for work, not to troubleshoot someone's lousy software! I thought I was being proactive by renewing two weeks early. Not sure what to do now except find an AVS that works and try to get a refund from K or the credit card company.  Moral of the story: I should have read the Amazon reviews rather than rely on magazine reviews!  7/29/08 UPDATE:  "Customer Service" was unable to solve the problem. They finally offered a copy of KIS 2009 or a refund.  I wasn't about to shoot myself in the other foot and try 2009, and I needed antivirus protection, so after days of troubleshooting on my own I was able to install KIS7 (I'm not about to release the details - why should I help Kaspersky? They need to fix their product.).  It runs ok; startup is faster than Norton but slower than KAV6, but IE is MUCH slower. Even after a complete scan and 5 years of virus free operation, the "Proactive Defense" (which runs continuously) generated 650MB of reports in 4 hours!!! Besides eating up memory quickly, it definitly slow things down.  My computer ran fine (and faster) before using it (PD), what's the point now?  Obviously KIS7 has problems!  (Otherwise they wouldn't be pushing KIS2009 and offering rebates on Amazon).	-1
I had tried the DSL for the last year and I just dropped it and went to cable. The one drawback was I lost my free McAfee and Spy Sweeper that came with the MSN DSL. After looking at a lot of the internet security programs out there I decided to try the Kaspersky since it had the highest customer ratings of all of them. Was that ever a mistake!   I downloaded the 1 month free full version of Kaspersky internet security 7.0. Even after uninstalling my McAfee and the free version of AVG that I had it still took two days and several tries to get the Kaspersky to install.   It took another day for it to run its updates and two more days to run all the full scans. I know my computer is old but its not THAT slow! Its an old DELL Optiplex GX240 running Windows XP Pro  with a 1.7 Pentium 4, 30 gig hard drive (80% full) and a 160 gig Seagate external (20% full).   Now when first starting to boot up my computer in the morning it takes at least 20 to 30 minutes for Kaspersky to stop taking up 100% of the CPU. And every time I try to do something it gives these pop-up warnings that some file or program is trying to do something to some other file. It stops everything until I tell it to let it do what ever or stop it. And I don't have a clue what the heck its talking about!   It has done something to my Internet Explorer too. Now its almost useless and it takes for ever to load a web page. And it keeps stalling and locking up for several minutes at a time. I'm using Firefox now to write this since it would take all day to do it in IE.   Every time I open one of my programs its the same thing. And now one of my photo programs wants to run its update and Kaspersky has a pop-up calling it Riskware and wants to Quarantine it. It did that last week and yesterday said it was a mistake and replaced the file.   So if you are the average computer user like me and don't know all that much about the different types of files, what they do, and all that, DON'T GET THIS PROGRAM! It will drive you nuts!   Now if you are one of those that can write programs, Walk, Talk, and Dream in computer language, then this program is for you. But then you wouldn't need it because you could write your own thats even better.   To use this program I think you would at least need to of had some computer programing class's in school. I would NOT recommend this program to any one and as soon as I can find something else to replace it I'm getting rid of it.	-1
I bought a new Vista computer a little over a year ago. It came with a "Easy" Media Creator 9 teaser. I bought the upgrade to Creator 10 "because it was Vista-compatible". Yeah, sure.  After finding it to be trash, I set it aside for a year. Then I went back to get a software update. Would you believe a 1,500 MB download? The updated version does not do what I want it to do. I open the Video Converter and it takes quite a while to open. But if you wait it out you can click on Add Movies and a malformed screen opens with some text partially obscured. The hourglass cursor comes up and nothing happens again. No error message, just a sickening view of crapware.  I'll be uninstalling this garbage and replacing it with several small programs from companies that have software support in case I have problems.  I'm tired of small companies becoming large companies that lose track of what the customer wants. Selling a product may make the quarterly results look better but some of us remember what an awful experience it was with a particular brand and will never buy it again.  If you think I'm just a sourpuss, check my other reviews.	-1

I really wish this had worked...  I had great success with using previous versions of Roxio Creator in the past - but this version 10 is the exception. It's not like I should be surprised, I read all the negative reviews here, but there were a couple of positive ones as well - so based on my previous experiences I took a chance.  The software installed fine, but even from the start I could tell that it ran slow... and it also slowed down my machine with all the stuff it was running in the background. I think I could have lived with that, as it did do a lot of what it was suppose to do. But the thing that made me uninstall it completely, was that it had the effect of making the audio of any video that was played in any player (like the regular Windows Media Player) play at a greatly reduced level. Even with all the settings cranked up to 11, you could barely hear the audio. And even worse, it had the same effect on anything that I tried to record - no matter what program you used. Systems sounds work fine, just the playback / recorded audio was affected. I tried everything to fix this audio problem - updated everything, downloaded drivers and reinstalled. Nothing worked. Uninstalled the complete Creator 10 package and now everything works fine! Just like it did before I installed the software. Well, I'll keep the software on the shelf for now - maybe some day they will get around to releasing a patch to make it work.... Just in case someone wonders, I'm running XP, not Vista.	-1
I have nicknamed this software Bugmaster.  It lightened my wallet by $100 at Circuit City.  I needed a program to edit a DVD home movie on a crash basis.  I wasted an entire evening trying to get the software to work.  It does not work.  I tried it on two different late-model computers.  No dice.  I had owned a Roxio product 5 or 6 years ago, so I tried logging onto their website to see if there was a bug fix, but because I could not remember the ancient password, no luck there either, and although they said they had emailed me a new password, they had not.  Fact is, I am tired of software vendors that do this--they package a bug-ridden and downright inoperable software program hoping to sucker users into buying it, with the intention of putting their users through some god-awful time consuming patching process.  They have to know that their software does not work.  Avoid this product.  I would not want it even if it were free.  My time is not free.	-1
After repeated attempts at installation, I stopped trying. My computers are not old either. Hard to recommend, maybe you will have better luck	-1
Having used versions 4 through 7.5, I know that the features of the program could be useful.  However, since version 8 the program has been a nightmare and I have had to reinstall Windows XP more than once due to this program.  In addition, I have one hard drive unusable at all after using the Roxio zap tool as instructed by their 'techs.'  Truthfully tech support is all but non existent and useless to say the least.  In fact, I found their advice very harmful. Roxio is one of the most callus companies on the internet. STAY AWAY FROM SONIC/ROXIO AT ALL COSTS!	-1
Hello,In a word WEAK...Less than a week my laptop was infected with the dreaded synaptic virus knocking out the touch pad driver. Then when I logged in at home,I found that my laptop was infected with spyware. Live One didn't not deliver either time. Only thing that live one did that wasn't already built in to the OS was take my credit card for $49.99. Wait how about DUMB AS A ROCK...no that's three words.	-1
I've been using OneCare for a few months now.  Overall, not a bad solution for the price (but overy "controlling" as some reviewers have mentioned, like rebooting with no notice.)  But I just recently ran into an issue with backups that is a deal killer for me.  I have about 700GB of files on my PC that need backing up, and USB 2.0 was just taking WAY too long, so I purchased a new Seagate FreeAgent 750GB external hard drive with eSATA connection.  (For those of you unfamiliar with eSATA, it has become the new standard for high speed PC backups to external drives ... most benchmarks show 3-5x faster than USB on actual transfer speeds.) Anyhow, Microsoft is VERY misleading when they say OneCare will backup to any "external drive", because it will NOT back up to an eSATA drive.  This is because eSATA connects directly to the SATA ports on the computer motherboard, which means OneCare can't tell the difference between your normal internal drive and the eSATA drive.  So, it ignores them all!	-1
I've read some of the other reviews and I'm stunned.  Just stunned that there is ANY gold stars - let alone more than one.  Let's just say that I hold highly suspect anyone who writes a glowing review of this garbage-software.  They either are "lite" computer users or they are drinking the Microsoft cool-aid (or taking a mind altering drug).  I'm guessing that is was OneCare staff members looking for job security who filled out those posts speaking highly of this product.  The interface is horrible, simply bad, and you, as a user will have to spend added time "learning" it.  So if you're into spending those free hours of yours getting used to the way some incredibly poorly skilled user-interface designer at Microsoft has designed things - then great - everyone should have a hobby.  Yeah, when they say this is for 3 computers - it doesn't mean that if you buy two it is for 6 users (and so on)- like one might conclude.  Nope. Microsoft in a stellar moment of short-sightedness decided to cripple the software's ability to scale beyond 3 computers - no matter how many licenses you buy.  [actually you *can* use this on more than 3 machines; there are "work-arounds", but you will loose the "uber-control"- which is really what this is suppose to do.  So if you happen to be one of those folks who has more than 3 computers, or ever in your life expect you'll have more than 3 computers... then this is not for you (or anyone really).  -Just STUPID Microsoft, just stupid.  Like being reminded of stupid things OneCare wants you to do... well good because this is a high-maintenance bit of software.  Frequently the software wants you to do things it's way - or it will not allow for the "all clear signal." Flexible it is NOT.  Norton/Symantec offer a competing product which is wwwwwwaaaaaayyyyyy better (and faster) than this (*&^%$#@!).  I had to figure this out the hard way.  I hope you don't.  If you think I'm joking/kidding/exaggerating...  check out how hard they make it to find the "techical support phone number for OneCare" - google it on the web and you'll find tons of angry users complaining about the very fact that you have to spend over 4 minutes and click 36 times through a series of help-dialog boxes (I tested this) before you can be provided a telephone number.  Yes, that's right, the user-interface is literally designed to prevent you from finding out what the tech-support number is(!) - so bad is it that when I had the Microsoft trained OneCare tech support staff member go through all the 36 clicks and so-on he got lost and couldn't find where to go to get the number (which would be to call himself more-or-less)...  Don't buy this product.  That's really the kindest thing I can say about it to you.  I have to manage 7 computers for a home-office and this software has cost me more in added time using and trying to use it than I care to admit.  Definitely not worth the money.  Good luck	-1
Microsoft selling OneCare anti-virus? It has decided to make money off selling a fix to a problem in its original product (Windows). That's just offensive.	-1
I can't imagine a greater level of disappointment than this product has given me.  The basic framework is there: virus protection, routine maintenance, automated backup, updates and security.  But I suspect that it will perform as needed only for those people that install it when the stars correctly align.  For woe unto you who have a problem.  Support may be there, but you'll work yourself into a frazzle just trying to find the support or get an answer.  I'd like to think that I'm somewhere between the average computer user and the uber-geek that writes his/her own source code.  That said, I'm giving up on this product.  Let me tell you why.  First, OneCare offers to set up your wireless security for you.  In my case, it made my wireless access so secure that I couldn't use it.  The double whammy behind that is the fact that the bulk of OneCare's support is ONLINE!  It's tough to get a question about online access answered, when you have to go online to get it and can't.  I searched high and low in the program for something that even remotely resembled a technical support number, no... something that even remotely resembled a telephone number!  But success was not to be had.  Finally, I pushed the reset button on my wireless router, turned off the wireless security firewall in OneCare and was able to go online again.  Help was via a discussion board, and the tech that answered my initial question was out sick when I asked for some clarification.  That delayed response by 4 days!  By the way, Microsoft claims that my particular router is fully compatible with OneCare.  Okay, so the wireless security is no good, at least in my case.  But setting up an automated backup is a great idea right!  Sure, if... if... if you can find a storage device that OneCare is disposed to work with.  My thought (radical free thinker that I am) was that I would perform the initial backup by saving everything to a DVD, then using a lower storage USB stick for the incrementals.  OneCare saw the DVD drive but apparently didn't like it.  The USB stick didn't have enough space, so... can't use that.  But all is not bad.  OneCare did perform a tune-up for me that basically removed files that I removed manually from time to time.  And it's interface to control those programs that automatically load to memory on startup was nice.  But the bottom line is this.  It's a finicky product with no support for the panicky.  If you want to gamble on getting it right, go ahead.  If you prefer a little handholding, stay away.	-1
I thought I would try out Microsoft's solution for PC protection as it was offered as a freebie for Vine subscribers. I was shocked how much needed to be downloaded on initial installation. If you are on dial-up be prepared to spend "between 1 and 2 hours" for an a initial download while installing. "15-30 minutes" via broadband. Not sure why there is so much downloading for an initial software install. This bothered me, not a great way to start a relationship with software...  It took about 45 minutes to get this all installed, including a frustrating experience with the Microsoft servers, and online protection keys that were SO difficult to decipher that it took me FOUR tries to finally get through. I appreciate the need to protect from hacking, but a novice user may NEVER be able to get beyond this step...  Then enter a 25 character license key. Three tries at that. OH I guess they want upper case letters. This is not an obvious requirement because all letters in the key are upper case, thus giving no clue as to the importance of letter case in the key...  My goodness, all this time unprotected I am likely infected, (yes, you have to uninstall any other protection you might have installed, prior to installing this)...  Right now, I have a GREEN light, which means that I am supposedly fully protected. But I am running a full virus, spy ware scan, and it is very slow... I'll try it a few more days, but the verdict thus far is: DOG. Actually, that's not really being fair to dogs... Also the backup program is REALLY slow, but so then is Norton's Ghost. I like Acronis's True Image (e.g.&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Acronis-True-Image-11-Home/dp/B000VLZCEW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Acronis True Image 11 Home</a>) backup solutions.  Nothing about this initial experience inspires confidence, which is exactly what this kind of software SHOULD do...	-1
I was excited about providing my wife some security for her PC with the Windows Live OneCare 2.0.  But imagine my shock when I went to activate this program and was instructed to provide a credit card number for the annual fee.  HUH?!?!  What's this all about?  I just got this and I'm already having to pay MORE money to make it work?  No thanks Windows!  I'm keeping my money and chunking your piece of garbage software in the garbage can.  You should be more honest and forthright about what you are requiring people to do when they purchase your products.  This is highway robbery!	-1
I received this program through the Amazon Vine program. It came with a license to use it on three computers. My husband and I were both impressed with what the program said it could do. It sounded too good to be true. We installed it on two desktop PCs and one laptop.  All the computers were slowed down to a snail's pace. Starting up the computer took at least three minutes (and seemed like a lifetime). Opening each program took so long, minutes to open an application!  Opening my (popular) email application and waiting for the download to happen took forever. The process by which it scans each email for viruses apparently takes a lot of time. To cope I'd end up opening the program, walking away and returning later to read the email.  Even using the computer doing simple tasks like changing to view the email program to use a word processing program was very difficult. I'd click on the other application and it would pause and nothing would move, then a minute or two later the screen would finally react. Flipping from one Internet browser to another would have long pauses and it `wouldn't go'.  Before installing this program I could flip to different Internet browser windows with immediate results. Trying to open new programs such as a spreadsheet program took forever and the cursor didn't seem to react, so I'd click on the icon again. In the end sometimes I'd end up with three of the programs open and ready to run.  I had the worst experience with using a (popular) photo altering program. That program kept locking up.  The long time that it took to access different programs and to switch from viewing the Internet to the word processor made the most basic computer work painstaking and time consuming. It was ridiculous. I have not experienced a computer being this way since the early 1990s when I was accessing the Internet through dial-up! To cope with the computer being this way, I took to reading something on paper while I waited for the system to catch up so I could do whatever it was that I was trying to do.  Also when starting up the system each day I'd get an urgent message that there was a problem! Guess what `the problem'  was? I had new documents that needed backing up. Give me a break--that is no urgent or emergency situation.  We were so happy to uninstall this from all of our computers. Now are computers are back to normal.  We did spend quite a lot of time installing this program and then uninstalling it. What a waste of time this was. I can't believe how poor this program is, I'm really surprised.  If I had paid money for this I'd be irate about it! I got it free from the Amazon Vine program so all that was wasted was our time.	-1
I have been using Nero a long time.  Maybe from Version 2. X.  It started getting a little quirky with Version 7, but I finally got used to working around the limitations and could live with it.  Now I have upgraded to Version 8 Ultra-edition with latest patches and am very unhappy with it.  My DVD burner seems to go off into limbo.  I can burn one DVD successfully and then have to reboot.  Attempting to burn a second DVD without rebooting will result in an "error free burn" however no computer can read the DVD.  What a real pain to reboot after each DVD burn.  Using WinXP and Sony DVD.	-1
BEWARE.  This product is VERY buggy.  In addition the upgrades are impossible.  I purchased two months ago - and just this week did a software update.  The update to download is  185 MBs - the entire program - and required three Reboots for its normal install.  A full 90 minutes was required to upgrade with DSL (15 minutes to download - and 75 minutes for the incredibly slow installation and reboots).  Now - if I want to use it for HD video - I have to purchase an Add-on and reinstall again.  No way.  In my 10 years of using computers with dozens of programs - this is the worst upgrade process I have seen.	-1
I've used Nero for optical device recording/ripping needs since Version 5. I've tried other applications (Roxio and others), but for Windows users, previous versions of Nero have set the standard in this category of applications.  Version 8 shows some issues that Nero should *not* let continue:  (1) The package can only be described as "bloated". The current downloadable version is over 180 MB. While this is not an issue if you have broadband, Nero inexplicably doesn't include the product's help files in the download content.  So, in order to use Nero's "Help" functions, you then have to download and install them separately. This is quite silly when the help file download size are less than 3MB in size! With the application installer approaching 200 MB, what's 2 MB among friends!  Nero's web site says leaving out the help files is deliberate "in order to to keep the download file small". Note to Nero: the download file is already huge...so please just add the help files.  The bloat comes in many forms, from a CD cover designer to Nero InCD.  Note 2 to Nero: in these days of rewritable DVDs, 4GB flash drives and inexpensive hard drives, do you really think users would still choose a proprietary format CD/DVD packet writer for archiving or storage?), to Nero Home (which it claims can integrate your media streaming through multiple machines), the download, installation -and, ultimately, the overall experience of this product-- is compromised by a large volume of marginally useful applications that detract from what Nero does well: create and reformat data for optical media. Take the time to select the "custom" install option, and leave out those apps you don't plan to use.  (2) Lots of waiting time. Nero installation takes a *long* time. Not a real issue if you only have to go through the process once. But: on a clean Windows XP machine, I had to go through it twice (due to some errors that crept up, directly related to the bloat described above and the Windows resource issues described below).  (3) Slow to launch once installed. It takes a long time for Nero Version 8 applications to launch. Even if you have a fast processor and abundant memory: after you decide to launch the application, be prepared to wait before you start to rip and burn.  (4) Unexplained Windows resource drain. Nero Version 8 runs a background process called "NMIndexingService.exe"  This process runs whether whether you've launched Nero or not. When other applications do this, it's often called malware. While this can be disabled by advanced Windows users using the msconfig tool, there's no obvious utility to this service, and no excuse for it being hidden deep in Windows. Shame on Nero for this. Nero's email response to a question about this I submitted took two weeks to arrive. The recommended  a reinstall of Nero...but first you have to download a separate utility called "Nero Clean Tool" and then reinstall that. Just as with the help files: an effective uninstaller routine should be a given for modern Windows applications.  (5) For as widely used as Nero products are, their support website is remarkably uninformative.  -Once you get past all this, once installed and launched Nero 8 still is great program for authoring CD/DVDs and ripping MP3s. But the issues above are hugely distracting, and Nero should have more respect for its customers than to make them jump through these hurdles.  -Nero needs to get back to basics, trim the fat, and offer customers what  they really want, and what it does best: sound, fast CD/DVD writing. Nero  should include the help files, discard the less useful components, and respect users' Windows resources when they aren't engaged in its basic ripping and recording.  -If you have a stable version of an earlier version: Don't move to Version 8.	-1
Corels customer support absolutely blows. The software does not support the raw files for my Nikon and it is impossible to get an answer out of thier automated support.  If you buy Corel Software make sure you can get your money back. I am stuck with a pile of something warm.	-1
I got this because the backup that comes with Vista Home Premium is useless, and it is ESSENTIAL to have a backup (I know from painful experience).  I installed and used True Image 11 for several months, and now have uninstalled it because the size of the incremental backup I was having it do nightly was growing by 1 - 2 Gig per nightly backup, and had vastly exceeded the total size of what was being backed up.  I don't want to have to maintain that.  In addition, I don't like have the backup file in some proprietary format that I cannot easily use or verify.  I discovered a free tool from Microsoft called SyncToy that synchronizes a set of files between 2 locations.  It doesn't compress or store things in a proprietary format - you get a mirror copy of your file set, which is just what I wanted.  It can also be set to run from the Task Scheduler.  So I use this for my nightly backup which is primarily all of the documents, photos, music, etc which is stored under my user name.  Because the backup on my other computer is an exact copy, I can easily look at those files to verify their contents.  The size never grows, and I can also make a copy to take with me and use remotely.  It was perfect and cost nothing.  One other thing I didn't like about TrueImage is that it would sometime start a process running (trueimagemonitor.exe) that would run for a long time creating tremendous disk activity, slowing everything down.  Once I uninstalled TrueImage (which wasn't easy - I had to use a 3rd party program to find and launch the uninstaller), my computer booted MUCH faster than before.  Maybe these things been fixed in the new version - or maybe not - but I'm not using this anymore.	-1
If you have any problems you will not be able to get any tech support. In fact it is highly unlikely that you will ever be able to reach anyone at Acronis. I tried repeatedly using every method possible and nothing worked. Look for another product. Definitely not recommended. The product will not work with external drives.	-1
Acronis True Image simply does not work.  Mine freezes up with every backup.  At lockup it uses 100 percent of the CPU capacity and requires a reboot.  Many people have experienced similar problems.  There have not been any updates to this program for many months.  Some people in the forums claim that Acronis has abandoned this program and that there will be no updates.  Do Not Buy this Program.  Get one that really works.	-1
I have had Acronis installed on two different computers. Backup images were created by Acronis successfully  to secondary hard drives (pata) and external usb2(pata) hard drives and backups validated by Acronis software.  In both cases Acronis gave a E000101F4 error indicating it could not find a hard drive disk when attempting to 1)actually restore and 2)to just test a Acronis boot cd.  Error was given in both cases when using a Acronis bootable cd and trying to restore from Windows XP pro via Acronis program. Latest software update version was used from Acronis. Save your cash.	-1
I have been trying to use Acronis True Image 11 Home for several weeks. It is such a good idea that I really wanted it to work but the short commings are too great a barrier. I love that F11 can restore from boot up -- and that works great. However, the daily backups fill up the allocated backup space and then Acronis stops backing up. It's supposed to trim the earlier backups but does not.  There may even be a solution to this problem from Acronis but I may never know. Support is next to nonexistant. By that I mean that I have not heard back from them about this issue for 5 days and the last time I had a support issue I did not get my question answered over a period of three weeks and 5 emails back and forth. the reason: TS does not speak English as its native language and I never was able to get them to even understand the problem. They do send back a nice cheery "Have a good day!" though.  So the software is buggy and the bugs can not be taken care of without support. I give them 2 stars for the F11 idea. Any other backup software can do the rest of what Acronis does and do it better.	-1
Please find another solution. Acronis burned my system, made a Windows restore impossible and forced me to reformat my hard drive and reinstall everything.  It started with a download from their site of a trial version of Acronis True Image v 11. It did not install cleanly, never finishing. I tried running the partially installed product and it simply didn't perform to my expectations. Oh well, just uninstall it, right? Ooops, no uninstall module in the Acronis directory. Oooops, it doesn't show up as an installed product in the Control Panel Add/Remove software module.  Well, let's try Windows restore! Oh, bummer! I can't reboot my computer without getting a blue screen of death, over and over and over and over. Nothing worked, so I've had to reformat the hard drive, repartition it, reinstall every single application I had loaded and every data file. I'm only about half way through, 11 hours later, but lesson learned: the other reviews on this site, telling you that this program is a bust are correct. Avoid this P.O.C. software at all costs. Please don't even think about trying it.	-1
The software does a decent job of backing up data and imaging disks. However, in my case, I bought it for its advertised Startup Recovery Manager which is supposed to allow you to restore your PC's system state in the event its startup files get corrupted. Unfortunately, it did not work as advertised. When I contacted tech support about this issue by email, I received the following response:  "Please note that it's not possible to restore system state backup that way. In order to restore it, you need to run Acronis True Image 11 Home in Windows Environment, then choose this backup archive from Acronis Secure Zone and proceed with restoration."  If I could start my PC in a Windows environment, I wouldn't need to restore the system state, now would I? Acronis Tech support appears to be staffed by a bunch of leftover Soviet bureaucrats who just don't get the job done.  The Secure Zone and Startup Recovery Manager flat don't work on my PC - even though Acronis says the software is compatible with Windows 2000. I spent hours testing it today. The worst news is that in a couple of instances, Startup Recovery Manager says it completed restoration of test files, when in fact, it did not. So, if you're going to rely on this product to recover your data, you'd better test it thoroughly before you actually need it.  If you just need disk imaging and data backup, this software will probably be OK. If you're looking for a comprehensive PC data recovery solution, you'll be better off looking somewhere else!	-1
Acronis used to make some great software. I've shelled out a couple of hundred bucks for their Disk Director Suite and TrueImage Backup. My PC - like many of the ones made today - uses SATA drives. SATA is the new generation of ultra-fast, huge capacity drives. Nowhere on the package or website is this mentioned: Acronis software does not support SATA drives! As soon as the software installation is completed - not during, no pre-test - after - you receive a warning that the software "has detected unsupported hard drives" - it won't do anything. The program runs, but you'll just keep receiving an error that "No HDD detected" and that's it. Since the software has been opened you can't return it.  Acronis? Lousy tech support. When they answer support emails (about  the time) it's "this will be addressed in the next version" - yes, but I paid for this version! "sorry" OK, next versions come out - version 11. Guess what? SAME PROBLEM! No support if your PC only has SATA drives!	-1
I purchased this software to have a robust ability to restore my hard drive completely (not just user data) in the case of a drive failure.  This is what the "image backup" functionality is for, to allow you to re-create a fully-operational version of your system very quickly in the event of a drive failure.  (As opposed to just a data backup, which still requires you to reinstall the operating system, programs, and all your user settings again from scratch.)  So, here's my take: 1) First, any of the positive reviews that have not actually tried to use their backups to restore should really not be given much weight.  If you can backup fine, but can't restore, what's the point? 2) I am running Windows Vista with a 1 TB drive, and this program worked fine in creating the image backup. 3) When my drive started throwing off errors, and I replaced it with a new one, I went to my Acronis boot CD to restore from my backup image (on an external drive.)  Part way through the restore wizard, the restore program just froze, for no apparent reason.  And I have been completely unable to restore my system from my backup.  Here is the experience I had with the technical support: - You should know that by default, technical support is only available via email with a 48 hr response time.  While this seems reasonable for only paying $40 for a software product, a 48-hour response time makes the product fairly meaningless in the event of a failure, as I can easily restore the operating system and programs from scrtach in less time than this (and just use the free built-in windows backup for a data restore). - I went ahead and paid an extra $30 for a single-incident "premium support", which is real-time phone support.  However, after 3 separate phone calls, each on hold for 20-30 minutes and NEVER getting a live person (I had to leave a messages), I finally received some email communications which contained solutions that made no impact to my issue. - The Tech Support emails provided new "CD images" that they wanted me to use instead of my standard boot CD.  (I'm not sure, but I doubt most folks have an extra PC and CD burner sitting around to be abe to do this, when their main PC is dead.) - Then I received an email asking me to reformat a flash drive, plug it into my dead computer, and write a batch script that would execute numerous lines of Linux command line codes.  Ok, I'm a pretty technical guy, but I'm not familiar with Linux.  And if the solution to a restore problem requires "normal everyday users" who are buying this product for easy home backup/restore to program in Linux, I would suggest this product is not the right fit for most folks.	-1
Having bought version after version of Norton Systemworks, and having become frustrated and disappointed each time, I've finally kicked the habit.  If you want better security software, buy&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Trend-Micro-pc-Cillin-Internet-Security-2007-3-User/dp/B000NKKLX8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Trend Micro pc-Cillin Internet Security 2007 - 3 User</a>&nbsp;which has significantly more features. Unlike Symantec, which sells its security products separately (Search under "Symantec" to see how many different ones you would have to buy to fully protect your computer), Trend Micro includes all of them in one program.  If, like I, you are thinking about buying Norton to clean up your registry and keep your computer running cleanly and efficiently, forget it. After years of watching my PC clog up with all the garbage generated by Windows, only to have Systemworks leave it in place, I recently bought&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/PC-Tools-Registry-Mechanic-6-0/dp/B000TMFVIK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">PC Tools Registry Mechanic 6.0</a>. It does the job cleanly, efficiently and effectively, which Systemworks does not. Highly recommended.  A useful shareware program is Super Ad Blocker. Knocks out banner ads, pop-ups and (best of all) Flash player ads.  For day-to-day disk clean-up and compacting, use the disk cleaner and defragmenter that come with Windows.	-1
I am a loyal Norton user.  I've used Norton SystemWorks (NSW) for many years, and have been consistently happy.  I'm running Vista Ultimate on a great computer (Pentium D Processor 940 at 3.2 Ghz, 4 GB RAM).  I downloaded NSW from Symantec's web site, but it won't install.  After expasperting sessions with "English as a second language" tech support, I was finally able to install the software.  After running several of the "check/fix routines" on NSW, many other programs did not work.  I had to reinstall at least five different programs.  I'm back to normal, thanks to back-ups I made on an external hard drive before installing NSW.  But, I am afraid to run the "check/fix routines" on NSW again until (or if) they fix the glitches.	-1
There are so many things wrong with Norton System Works that it's very difficult to know where to begin. But here are three:  1) ACTIVATION: The most annoying. Companies resort to this because otherwise people would be handing disks out to all their friends and family. Norton's is particularly aggravating and chances are you'll end up talking to someone at Symantec. If you get the product, install it and don't think about upgrading your computer.  2) INSTABILITY: Decide you don't like it? Removing it requires a number of reboots and manual deletion of files and folders. You'll also have to go into the registry and remove the sloppy leftovers. Yuck.  3) RESOURCES: Taxes your system's resources. Instead of buying a suite, get a defragger, get a registry cleaner, and get them without the pesky activation. These things are designed by committee. My System Works didn't even recognize my Symantec anti-virus, and it's made by the same company. Imagine that!  If you MUST have a suite, System Mechanic is probably the best.	-1
The review that has 5 stars I really wonder that is real It doesn't stay connected the whole time I would not recommend the product	-1
All the reviews are not for the product listed. Amazon needs to straighten this mess out.	-1
So far, I am not impressed. It did arrive quickly, but it does not work for us. I followed the instructions to a "T" several times on several devices and it would not connect. I started skeptical because there is no product on Amazon that has 300 reviews and every one is 5 stars. This is literally the 2nd 1-star review (and I think the other person was wise for not purchasing).  I've grown even more skeptical and plan on returning this product unless someone from Opticover is willing to help out.	-1
I looked at purchasing this Router.  However, one has to wonder where these ratings are coming from since some of the reviews, along with the questions folks have asked about the product, do not seem to have anything to do with this product. What's-up Amazon.	-1
If ths following is your idea of good product support, then by all means, purchase Turbo Tax.  While using the software, I had no idea that this limitation to Turbo Tax existed.  As for me, my next purchase will be Tax Cut.  The only provision for claiming excess railroad retirement tax on Form 1040 is for tier 1 withholding. The excess can be derived from a combination of railroad employers or in connection with a railroad and non-railroad employer. The program does properly record the excess of the tier 1 tax on line 67 Form 1040 as a credit against income taxes. It does nothing with the tier 2 excess tax. This must claimed separately, as you noted in your email, on form 843 which is not supported by the Turbo Tax software.  The software's help does contain information regarding tier 1 and 2 railroad retirement withholding. The help clearly indicates that only tier 1 may be claimed as a credit against current year income taxes. It goes on to state, "You cannot claim a refund for excess tier 2 RRTA tax on Form 1040. Instead use Form 843."	-1
I have found that after using "Turbo-Tax"  That they really have a flaw in their calculations!  Let me say one more time!  "They screwed me up"!  They allowed me to change a iteration, Without a problem!  This caused me to pay a fine for for failure to pay the Damn-Tax!  I will be contacting "Intuit" for their total dis regard of support the customer!	-1
I've used Turbotax for years with excellent results. This is the first year I had a problem and it was a huge one.  When it first calculated my tax, it added my AMT to what would have been my regular tax rather than just using the AMT.  I wound up owing $27K rather than $3K.  I reran the calculations and the second time it got the actual tax I owed correct.  It was close to being a nightmare and the time between thinking I unexpectedly owed $27K and the time I reran the software was wrought with anxiety.  Next year I try TaxCut.	-1
I just bought a new computer that runs on Vista.  Installation of TurboTax was impossible.  I kept getting the UNHANDLED EXCEPTION 0x80040707 ERROR.  I went to the TurboTax support site for help.  The information they provided did not solve the problem and the only available next step was to submit my email address.  The Quicken reply message was not helpful and only stated that they will email me when they have a solution to the problem.  Cold comfort for someone who bought the product that is supposed to be Vista compatible.  Shame on you, Quicken!  FYI...I installed it on Windows XP without any problem eventhough it did take quite a long time for the installation.  So, if you have Vista, perhaps you should find another tax prep product.	-1
If you are smart enough to use a computer and you know English, you can get the PDF forms and instructions and do this yourself. You save nothing using these programs. You still have to supply all the data and read all the instructions. It doesn't cost anything for the forms and they are already written in simple language. If you don't want to read, just go to a tax preparer and let them read to you. Seriously folks. I've used these programs before and they are actually harder than getting the forms and filling them out yourself. Not only that but these programs are buggy and make mistakes a human would not make. And e-filing is a joke. A stamp is 41 cents. And if you are getting a refund just provide the check routing info and they will direct deposit for you.	-1
While I found the software easy to use, I was quite irritated to find (at the very end) that to e-file, I would need to pay $17.95...and an ADDITIONAL $17.95 to e-file my state return!  Why on earth did I pay $40 for this software??  I downloaded a free version from the company's website last year.  The purchased version doesn't include much extra.  Now I have to print out my return and mail it in, because I'm not willing to spend a total of nearly $80 to do my taxes MYSELF!  I notice now that this fee is buried in the description above, but it certainly is something you'd have to know to look for.  It should be in giant letters right below the price!  Irritating.	-1

TurboTax is a product I love to hate.  Of course Intuit is the monopoly and TurboTax is an Intuit product.  Why did all my other Mac Address book addresses blink in and out as I typed my registration name?  Even when I wasn't typing, the field kept on blinking.  It was as though Intuit was uploading all the names in the addressbook.  Then, when I looked for the use agreement, I couldn't find it to see if I had somehow agreed to give them my addressbook names???  Moving along, the TurboTax program's wording was better but still bad, leaving customers in the dark, even if we could read. The program crashed repeatedly while trying to copy my files to CD so it really can't do that.  Other than that, it was a little faster and easier, I suppose due to more interaction with the Feds and California.  Was my return right?  I doubt it. I think Intuit is still in a bit of a conspiracy to aid the governments in exchange for their networking.  The worse part was in the end when I saw the steep prices to file online.  There, true to Intuits form, I truly felt very RIPPED OFF!!!  I wondered if its lone large competitor, Taxcut, was the same way?	-1

I have been using turbo tax to file my returns for past 3 years.  This year, I went to turbo tax site to select the proper version.  The Basic version only does 1040EZ.  You own your home, then you are required to buy Deluxe version which is $44.95.  Deluxe version does not include investments, so if you are invested in stock market, now you are looking at Premier version for $74.95.  I used to get all my tax done with $20 basic version.  Now I am looking at spending $74.95.  I own my home, invested in stock market, and was able to do 2006 tax using Basic version last year. Be warned that the 2007 basic version turbo tax is useless, and you would need to get least 2007 Premier version this year if you want to itemize.	-1

Please read the UPDATE following the initial review.  1/28/08:  I'm using Turbo Tax "Premiere".  Or rather I'm trying to use it.  I figure they need to make it different year to year to justify the price, but they royally blew it this time.  Tabbing from one field to the next takes at least 30 seconds.  This is even when entering an address.  I even unplugged my internet connection as I thought Intuit was contacting the IRS or the CIA with every character I typed.  Trying to enter within the 30 second gap caused either the product or Vista to state that TurboTax was not responding only to wake up some time thereafter.  I'm guessing it's the product.  You don't know if the product has accepted your selection.  Maybe, maybe not.  I've used TT for years, gladly, but unless TurboTax (Intuit) comes out SOON with significant performance enhancements, I will not come back next year.  It is truly a painful experience.  UPDATE 1/31/08:  PLEASE READ  In my previous review, I stated that the performance of TurboTax Premier 2007 left a great deal to be desired, to say the least.  Since then, I have discovered that the root cause for the exceptionally poor performance was actually, once again, Microsoft.  The Machine Debug Manager, or MDM service, was running and is known to cause extremely poor performance.  It is some kind of debugger for Visual Studio, and runs automatically.  I went into the Task Manager, stopped the service, and disabled it.  Now, Turbo Tax performs as it always did.  I'd give it 4 stars, not 5, I'm still using it and haven't filed yet, and it still may tank (but I doubt it now).  Bill and Vista strike again.	-1
I'm mainly a Mac person. On my PC I don't own Office 2007 (I have the 2003 edition), and apparently without it many features of this software package don't work, such as background spell-checking and the thesaurus. Often I can't send e-mail, either. Frustrating!	-1
Very little change, less features (does not support animated gif's or stationary).   Outlook 2007 now uses Microsoft Word as its rendering engine for all incoming emails. In Outlook 2003 (and earlier), email with animated gif's would look great, because it uses Internet Explorer to render the emails, leaving the HTML alone. However, in Outlook 2007, Microsoft Word literally rewrites your beautiful HTML into Word-like HTML, leaving out the creative touches that used to be available until Outlook 2007.  So why buy Outlook 2007?	-1
I will be reinstalling Office 2003 after discovering that this was inferior. Kind of reminds me of another Microsoft product that has tanked recently.	-1

I have installed the Win Cleaner program on both XP and Vista.  When I tried to update them I was informed that I had used up my updates and that I should purchase another update.  Also, I was advised that if this was not actually true I could file for a "ticket" to fix the problem.  I went to the "WinCleaner" website, left a message, and wrote down the Ticket Number they assigned.  Then I did the One Click thing on the original program. It did improve the boot time.  So, without the update, I reduced boot time from five minutes to four minutes.  This is some improvement. Wow, 20% faster boot  time.  But it still would not update.  I used email aqain to voice my complaint.  The next day I received an email from "WinCleaner" with a hyperlink to download a new program.  I did this and rebooted my machine.  Then I ran the One Click program again.  Then, after installing the download on my three computers, it seemed to run as advertised.  ###-UPDATE-###  10/22/10  Okay, so I finally got the kinks worked out in July of 2009. But I was not quite satisfied.  I decided to install "DriveScrubber 3."  It removed much more  after running "WinCleaner."  Using the two programs together I felt reasonably well covered.  Then I made the mistake of running the program past the expiration date.  Rather than simply being cut off from further use until I renewed, it failed to notify me and instead destroyed my Registry.  Of course, "WinCleaner" no longer runs properly.  Now, each time I boot up my computer, I have to stop several programs that are all trying to run at the same time.  Of course, I could maybe fix this problem by simply buying another year of "WinClearner" use.  But I think I'll download that free program "Windows Registry Repair" before I decide.  With "DriveScrubber 3" and the free "Windows Registry Repair," I should be well enough covered.  Maybe I can get off this treadmill.  All this is sure a lot of time consuming trouble!	-1
As with most PCs, the time it takes for my computer to boot up has increased dramatically since I bought it.  Of course, I have more stuff on my desktop and more things to load into memory when the PC boots up than on a new PC.  However, the software advertises that it "accelerates slow system startups."  If anything, my system starts more slowly after I used this software than before.  Waste of money.  Don't count on it speeding up your startups if that is all you are buying it for.	-1
I FIND THIS SOFTWARE HARD TO USE.  IT IS MUCH FASTER TO DO IT BY HAND. EVERY YEAR I HAVE A ACCOUNTANT DO MY TAXES BUT I LIKE TO DO IT MY SELF FIRST. THIS PROGRAM ASK TOO MANY QUESTIONS AND REQUIRES TOO MUCH INFOMATION. THE PROGRAM ASK MANY MORE QUESTIONS THAN THE IRS	-1
Plus,  It is cheaper than Turbo Tax.  Minus,  It isn't worth as much as Turbo Tax.  Maybe if you have a very simple return it is worth the money;  but for my return (I sold some stock, and have one employer) it couldn't handle it.  After I filled every thing out, and e-filed,  I got an email the next day saying e-file wouldn't accept my tax return for an unknown reason, I had to manually check every single entry (I could have done that without a computer program).  After not finding any problems, I tried to efile again, and was told to print out and send by mail (I could have done that without a computer program too).  All-in-All, it wasted a day of my time, and was only useful for adding some of the numbers, (other numbers I had to add myself, since it didn't support one of the forms I needed, I had to down load the 500 page form from the IRS and do the calculations by hand).	-1
Okay, long time user, less and less happy last few years.  This year is the final straw.  They chagne all kinds of security settings that caused me hours of grief on things nothing to do with the actual software including installing stuff I don't need and didn't ask for.  So don't know about the others, but take a pass on this forever.  I do IT and can only imagine the hours people have burned AFTER installing this package and not realizing it was the cause of other issues.  Good luck.	-1
I generally like TaxCut and have used it before, but ... The TaxCut Federal + State has an error.  When I try to download the one state return which is included in the $34.99 price ... I'm prompted to provide my credit card information and pay *another* $29.99.  I contacted customer service and was told that they didn't have an answer and would get back to me in two business days ... which they haven't done.  So now I have a program that doesn't work, unless I pay twice.  Anyone have a similar problem?	-1
I agree with other comments about the significant price increase that H&R put forth this year. I've used TaxCut for several years now, ever since Intuit tried to put some copy protection on their similar tax product a few years back. My sense is that both TurboTax and TaxCut are neck and neck, and for most of us, neither has a significant advantage over the other. Both products, regrettably, require me to proceed through my tax return in a particular order and not jump around to partially complete different parts of my return as I retrieve information.  My return is really pretty simple and, based on the jump in prices this year, I'm thinking that it is time to revert to completing my return on the IRS forms this year and mailing them in. It's just not worth $60 for the privilege of completing my return in their step-by-step approach.	-1
If you do any programming or statistical analysis with Office, stay away from this ripoff!!!  VBA and the Analysis Toolpak are gone -- and of course, you won't find this out until AFTER you've wasted your money!!!!! Update:  Accidentally added arrows from Word 2008 to an existing Word 2004 document; now it can't be opened on any PC, and it won't print either.  Excel 2008 will not save any documents on the grounds that I don't have enough hard drive space; in fact, I have over 600 GB of space available.  ABSOLUTE GARBAGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	-1
Microsoft Office for Mac is the worst software I've ever wasted my money on. I paid like $400 for it and it barely operates. It even crashes my $3000 macbook pro almost every time I use it. And good luck ever trying to compain to Microsoft. DO NOT BUY IT! If you really want it, "aquire" it by other means.	-1
I am in the research sector, and we use Excel quite often for large volumes of data, so when this came out I was quite excited that I would finally be able to use my mac for doing some of my work...especially since there are extra cells in this version! Not the case. My files take forever to open (both large and small files). Typically the files take a good bit longer to open than the previous version (if they open at all that is)! It also gets hung-up when copying and pasting and I have had many occurrences of corruption of files. Sometimes I have no recourse but to do Ctrl-Alt-Del to restart the computer because it completely freezes. Do NOT buy this!	-1
Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac:  I previously reviewed the Home & Student Edition on my old G4 Mac Mini. I recently bought a new Intel based Mac Mini (2.0 GHz) with 4 GB of RAM, from Amazon. I also got the "full" copy of MS Office Mac. I had thought it would be a more fully featured version. But, it is NOT. For about three times the money you get MS Exchange compatibility and two LESS licenses. I really didn't fully understand this at first. Now I do. Unless you absolutely need Exchange in Entourage, there is no need to buy this version. Save the money and get the Home version.  I also need to correct some of my earlier review, which I will quote and amend below.  To start the installation process, even on the new Mini took forever. I am estimating an hour to no more updates needed. That was quite an ordeal! It really should have been one big update and reboot and done, it was not. It was over and over and over rebooting and updating. Phew!  "Entourage is the answer to Outlook. It's pretty good as a mail client and contact and appointment organizer. It also successfully synced to my Mobile Me account. It's much slicker than the Mac Mail client but you'd hope it was for a for sale product.  It is nice to have mail contacts and calendar in one program as it belongs. This is the best reason for Entourage, consolidation of the obvious. Apple insists they be separate."  Well that was earlier. Now I can't get Mobile Me (which Office continues to call .Mac, really Microsoft?) to properly sync the calendar. This is a major pain! It worked earlier and now it doesn't. I was working earlier on Tiger now I'm on Leopard, is that why? I don't know. I really wanted to use Entourage but now it's useless to me.  "Excel and Power Point are the more business oriented, apps included in Office. They function well and as expected but on a G4 a little slowly.  Excel provides spreadsheet capabilities and Powerpoint, does presentations. "  No real changes here these two operate juts fine and as they should.  "A bonus app is Microsoft Messenger. Readily available on the web, but included in this app for easy installation."  Still there and still works, but I wonder how many true Mac people will actually use this client.  Overall a very comprehensive package, but for around $300 it really is overpriced and not worth the extra cost unless you absolutely need Exchange and absolute Office compatibility.  It competes with the free open source office apps like "Open Office" and FREE is a compelling price!  It also is the standard by which other office apps are measured and keeps that lead in check. My only reservation is if you have an older Mac, PowerPC based, you will find it too slow.  Day to day operations are quite quick on the new Mini and assume even better on more powerful Macs.  I have to wonder if this version is even needed with Apple building Exchange right into the next OS??	-1
If you have used previous versions of this software suite on your Mac before, you will probably notice a lot of differences with this one. Some for the good, some for the bad.  Excel is the component most of us take issue with. Yes, you can make and open larger spreadsheets now, but in dropping the Visual Basic, our previous macros are worthless. It's still slow to open large spreadsheets as well.  It does look a bit spiffier, but I thought Microsoft had learned their lesson with Vista that making things bright and shiny with nothing really under the hood turns more people off than on.  At least you can run it on Intel Macs, and Word, Powerpoint and Entourage will get you where you need to be. Just be sure to have Word save in the good old .doc format, or you won't be able to share with older versions of Word, on PC's or Macs.  If you never have used Office for Mac before, then you probably won't miss the features they dropped, and if you just do basic stuff, not too advanced on any of the components, you'll be ok.	-1
The primary reason I switched to the mac about 8 months ago was because Microsoft produces incredibly buggy, terrible software. Unfortunately, I sometimes need to use Microsoft Office, so I got Office for the mac. Office not only sucks on the pc, it sucks on the mac too.  My primary problem today is that it does not play nice with Spaces. My Word document is constantly zooming around to difference Spaces, without my asking it to. So, about every 10 minutes, I save and close the document, then reopen it. And it's ok for a bit, then the zooming starts again. Just ridiculous.	-1
If you do any programming or statistical analysis with Office, stay away from this ripoff!!!  VBA and the Analysis Toolpak are gone -- and of course, you won't find this out until AFTER you've wasted your money!!!!!	-1
Using this program makes my iMac (core 2 duo, with default 1 gig memory) run REALLY slowly, usually making the program almost unusable. [Contrast this to iWork (a small fraction of the price, by the way) which opens much more quickly and runs super smoothly.] Office has also crashed on me a few times (I'm running Mac OS X Tiger 10.4.11. Maybe its more stable on Leopard?).  I also don't understand why people get this because they need Office compatibility. I opened a document from Word 2003, and in Pages it looked like the original, but in Word 2008 the margins were different and words showed up on different lines.  The program looks nice with its blue glass, but to tell you the truth, iWork looks more elegant and has its good looks without sacrificing intuitive use. I mean, in iWork you can have the text formatting toolbar always show, but in Office you always have to choose between one kind of toolbar set or another (in a side-window). For people used to using Office 2003 on Windows (like me), you'll actually feel less at home in Office 2008 than in other programs (like iWork or even the simple OpenOffice.org).  I have Office 2008 and iWork, and while I can highly recommend iWork, I keep the Office icons out of the Dock. I even find myself opening Word documents in Pages more often than in Word because its just more reliable and it loads the documents just fine. Save yourself the time and money, and don't get this program.	-1
Apparently Bill Gates thinks we haven't suffered enough.  Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) has been completely removed from the latest version of Office for the Mac.  Unfortunately, I found this out AFTER wasting my money on this useless new product.  DON'T BUY IT!!!!!!!	-1
Office 2008 for the Mac has been out over a year and it still is full of bugs and lacks the functionality of the version of Office for the PC!  In particular, EXCEL is far inferior as Microsoft eliminated any support for macros or Visual Basic in the Mac version.  For a home user with simple needs this is not a serious drawback.  For anyone who exchanges files in a business environment forget about this product.  It is not fully compatible and crashes often.  It will drive you crazy and let you down when you are in the middle of a project with a tight deadline.  WORD also crashes a lot and causes the loss of your work.  A message will come up saying "WORD has to close unexpectedly," and that's it.  All your work is gone.  Back in 1980 we accepted this from computers and saved our work religiously.  This is 2009 and this kind of incompetence is unacceptable.  It is nothing short of dishonesty to claim that Office for the Mac provides the same functionality as Office for the PC.  The latter is light-years ahead in terms of sophistication and stability. Don't believe any salesman who claims the two versions are equivalent.  The Mac version is primitive by comparison.  If you are thinking about using a Mac for business think again.  The only way to do that is to get the PC version of Office and run it under Boot Camp or Parallels.  Of course that means spending several hundred dollars more for the Windows OS plus Parallels.  And all this after you just paid a $1000 premium for a Mac with the same physical functionality as a top of the line PC (eg the Thinkpad).<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Microsoft-Office-2008-for-Mac/dp/B000WR2F2M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac</a>	-1
In reading the comments I find no mention of "Royalty Free".  This is down in the "You are not permitted To: " paragraph, second sentence of the first paragraph. Check the disk license.  The images on the delivered disk "Use any of the photos of clip art images for any COMMERCIAL PURPOSE".  These are not "Royalty Free". The subscription graphics are.  Most of the STUFF is  low resolution, unidentified and unidentifiable graphics. Due to this and the royalty restriction I am deleting all of the graphics on the delivered disk from my computer.  The one saving feature is the one year iClipart subscription. Lotsa good photo objects there most of which can be converted to true "photo objects" for use in home or commercial graphics (giving them an alpha channel).  I have looked at "Photos", food and drink and nature/scenic. F&D consist mostly of what appear to be cropped photos.  N/S- many are not suitable for tv graphic productions.  Loads of cartoons!! and not bad.	-1
Please note that this review refers to the 2008 Mac Home and Student Edition.  This edition is native MAC and is supposed to offer speed improvement.  However, it crashed frequently on my machine.  Not recommended.	-1

Word and Excel 2008 work reasonably well. PowerPoint 2008 has a longstanding bug that causes intolerable delays on text entry. It may be related to master slide or theme issues for presentations created on PowerPoint 2003. Performance is fine until the bug hits a presentation. There's no known way to resolve the issue.  The bug has been discussed in various settings since 2008. There has been no fix.  I don't think Microsoft is investing in this product.	-1
I have been terribly disappointed with Office for Mac 2008 since Day 1.  When I first installed it and found that the (controversial) ribbon from Office 2007 for PC wasn't there, I felt like I had been cheated somehow.  However, as I used Office for Mac more, I found that the ribbon was the least of my worries.  I have two primary criticisms...  First, Office 2008 is exceedingly slow.  I have a 3.06GHz C2D iMac with 4Gb RAM and this is, without doubt, the slowest launching program I have.  Even after multiple updates, it's still 2-3x slower than Pages on first launch.  Furthermore, while using the program, actions like autocorrection, etc take almost a full second to implement, during which time Office stops responding graphically (it's actually working, just not displaying anything until it churns through the autocorrect, after which it "speed types" in what was in the buffer).  Second, the Thesaurus is also particularly disapppointing, since it doesn't seem to be able to sense the forms of words.  Many "-ing" words show their root in the thesaurus, which you then use to find a synonym and, after inserting, you have to go back and manually change the form.  Ridiculous.  Third, there appears to be a bug (perhaps related to the autocorrect lag) where changes to a document sometimes cause a "visual corruption."  It's difficult to explain, but an example would be where a significant amount of text is changed from double-space to singe-space.  After doing so, it is entirely possible to have a "phantom" sentence on the page that disappears if you scroll up then back down.  It's almost as if Word correctly moved everything, but forgot to update the screen to show the changes.  There are several other problems that I just don't have the heart to detail here (some of them are personal frustrations with design decisions).  The bottom line, however, is that this is the first Office suite in 15 years that I have wished I could "unbuy."  There are too many "annoyances" here.  It could be that I use documents between Office 2007 on a PC and 2008 on a Mac, but shouldn't there be 100% compatibility. Perhaps the 2011 version will be better, but for the time being, this is the single most frustrating piece of software I currently have on my iMac, primarily because I know how well it works on the PC side.  I'm not one given to conspiracy theories, but I just can't help but shake the feeling that Microsoft didn't put their best and rightest on this "Mac" project. :(	-1
If Microsoft and Apple are going to force us to buy Word, can't they at least make the program work without being so damn buggy? Word's persistently bossy auto-formating and general kloodgy bugginess has been going on for years and years -- why is this still the case?? These people are making gazillions of dollars off this stuff, so why can't they get the basics right and stop driving customers batty?  Also, this version has too many bells and whistles. If you just want a simple word processing program, the rest of Word's shiny goo-gaws can be really irritating. It should be much easier for users to turn off any unwanted features -- software engineers may be in love with their own designs, but that doesn't mean the average user will be, too.	-1
I've used Office for years on PCs, but this was my first time to use  Office 2008 for Mac. I have an Intel-based iMac and this software product is slow. Compared with Apple's iWork suite of office-like programs, Office is simply snail-like. Although Office 2008 has a few more features than iWork it's not as tightly integrated among applications. Office still has the look and feel of a loose collection of programs acquired over the years by Microsoft and  called a "system." I much prefer the cheaper and more tightly integrated iWork over Office 2008 and wish I had saved my money and bought only iWork.	-1
These comments focus primarily on Word and Excel, which are the applications I use. I have a 2.2 Ghz Core Duo 2 MacBook Pro with 4 gigs of RAM, so this is a very fast computer by most measures. Keep this in mind while reading my comments.  Pros: 1. The toolbars are better integrated into the workspace. 2. The graphics look a lot better. 3. File sizes are smaller in the new native format.  Problems: 1. Resizing a window is incredibly slow and takes 100% of the available computer power. It feels like you're using a computer from years ago. edit: much better now, but still slower  2. The first launch of an office program after a restart takes a very, very long time - at least twice as long as a Office 2004 program. * edit: improved by a noticeable amount  3. You can't edit equations from the Windows document format of Office 2007. **edit this is fixed.  4. Any equations you make in Microsoft Word print fuzzy unless you reopen each one prior to printing. For a long document, this process sometimes takes me about 10 minutes just to print a document I created years ago and resaved in the new format. ** edit: this is fixed  5. Excel crashes about twice per day, even when working on new documents with just a few cells. **edit: this is fixed  6. Documents created in the new native format take much, much, much longer to open than the exact same documents in the old format. ** edit: better, but still true.  7. Compared to Office 2008, Office 2004 is amazingly fast and is much more stable. ** edit: Office 2004 is still better, but not by much  8. The overall program is buggy. Things like adjusting or removing tabs don't work correctly - generally, it only registers something after a long delay. ** edit: much improved  9. Every document I create double-spaces between paragraphs. I can turn this feature off for a given document, but I can't save a default. Every time I save the default document template, it ignores this setting for some reason. **edit this is STILL not fixed, although you can change it if you follow a very complicated procedure.  In short, this is stunningly poor software, with a new challenging annoyance around every corner I've turned. I'm continually surprised by how unresponsive and slow the software is, and compatibility with older versions of Office is fairly bad. I would recommend staying with Office 2004 or buying it instead of Office 2008.  March 24, 2008: I deleted Office 2008 from my system and reinstalled Office 2004. I'm much happier, and things work again!  March 31, 2009: I'm still not impressed with this software, but it's now acceptable.	-1
I like the nice glass look and some of the new features, but overall it is not a product I would use. I've used various versions of Office for Windows, OpenOffice.org, and Office 2004/2008 for Mac, as well as iWork 06 and iWork 08. I prefer iWork 08 the best, and while Office 2008 is pretty nice, there are some issues I have with it which keep it from being my product of choice.  *Performance: Office programs typically take a few seconds longer to open than iWork programs do. It takes up more ram and makes the whole computer run more slowly than an iWork program does.  *Cost: What is Microsoft thinking? Charging hundreds of dollars for productivity programs (depending on the version), when OpenOffice.org (however ugly-looking and special-feature-lacking it is) is free, and when iWork, a superior product, is well under a hundred dollars.  *Size: The size of all the programs and files in Office 2008 Home & Student is over 900 mb, bigger than it needs to be. iWork+iCal+Mail is less than 700 mb. And Office also has tons of visible files in the Office folder, all of which are executable and pose potential security risks.  *Compatibility: Here's a funny one. I opened a Word document I made in Office 2003 (for Windows, .doc format) in both Pages (from iWork) and Word (from Office). The formatting (paragraph size, margins, etc.) was nearly identical to the original when viewed in Pages, but when viewed in Word 2008, formatting was different! This isn't always the case, though. There was a document I made in Office 2007 (.docx) and formatting was closer to the original when viewed in Office 2008 than when viewed in Pages. But still, Microsoft made Office 2003 and Office 2008, and you'd think they would know how to keep formatting the same better than Apple.  *A bad copy. True to Microsoft's past, they just copied features found in iWork 08 and mushed them into Office 2008, only they didn't do a good job. Like 3D slide transitions really look 3D in Keynote, but they are almost a joke in Office. Or the thing in PowerPoint to help position graphics: it doesn't work with as many items as it does in Keynote. Or controlling PowerPoint with the Apple Remote doesn't work as well, and you can't start a presentation with the remote either.  *Not intuitive. Toolbars are a thing of the past, and you have to keep a side window open for formatting and such. However, if you're viewing the formatting for, say, a chart, you will have no access to basic font formatting at that time.	-1
If you do any programming or statistical analysis with Office, stay away from this ripoff!!!  VBA and the Analysis Toolpak are gone -- and of course, you won't find this out until AFTER you've wasted your money!!!!!  Here's another wonderful feature: any graphics that you created for Powerpoint slides won't work in Office 2008.  Who knows what other nightmares are hiding in this pile of crap?	-1

I just recently converted to this version from Office 2004 for Mac, and I wish I'd just kept my original software. This version is buggy, slow, and crashes likes someone's paying it to do so I can't tell you how many times Word has crashed in the middle of updating an important file and the supposed "AutoRecovery" file is from hours earlier. Yes, it's my own fault for not saving more often, but when you're in the groove, you're in the groove. That doesn't excuse this program's fault, and they've got some nerve charging this much for an update that's not worth the disk it's burned on. I won't even talk about how slow PowerPoint is. It takes a few minutes to open on my brand-new iMac as well as on my 2007 MacBook, so I know it's not processor speed that's causing the problem. In fact, the only program I can recommend on this disk is Excel, and that's bc it's pretty hard to screw that one up.  In this day and age, it's pretty much impossible to be a Mac user working across platforms without having Office, so if you must, take my advice and just stick to 2004. Hopefully they'll get rid of the bugs in the next update, but I'm not holding my breath.	-1
There is a widespread problem with EXTREMELY slow wireless networking on this release.  Download rates may not even reach 10 % of what other operating systems can provide.  Many users also report slow wired networking.  Canonical has basically blown this problem off, apparently you're supposed to go to the Ubuntu forums and dig through the huge mound of material there, and spend your free time solving their problems.  Unfortunately, this is just more proof that Ubuntu and Linux are just not ready for prime time.  When you have a MAJOR bug and you just blow it off, well, you don't deserve to stay in business.  (Maybe Microsoft can get away with this, but nobody else can.)  I'm going to reinstall an old copy of Win 2000, at least the networking is functional.  I really dislike Windows and Microsoft, and was hoping that Ubuntu really is the wave of the future.  But the fact that 7.10 was released despite months of reports of this exact problem, and their attitude towards the whole issue, says that it's just not a winner.  I have hobbies, and none of them are Linux.  If you don't want another hobby, I suggest that you look elsewhere.  UPDATE:  The wireless problem is fixed, and it now works quite well.  The latest release is even better.  Now highly recommended.	-1
It does do the basics well enough and plays well with the rest of Microsoft's products. However, save yourself a lot of stress and stay away from this. Installation is a pain, it's extremely difficult to share between computers and don't get me started on the constant need to reenter information.  Office Accounting Express is available from Microsoft as a free download. It has a lot of similar features and even it is more than my family (read: not buisnesses) needs.	-1
This program is a let down after Apple's much simpler program, iMovie. I've used Adobe Premier Pro and liked it, but I needed something akin to it, perhaps more like Premier Express, for the MAC. No way! This is one unwieldy program.  It seems like I spend half my time rendering and rendering before I can play the final result. Many of the tools are hard to use and somewhat unpredictable. It has a lot of advanced features, but I find that the learning curve is just too steep for the occasional user.	-1
This product removes inportant system settings, files, and information and causes your syetem to crash....it also picks up spyware parasite that only it can see and I found out why....iolo's SM is the parasite!!! That's right folks..it see's itself as a parasite invading your system that's why only SM picks up that one parasite every time you run a scan.  This software sucks and it nothing but a computer killer, I already lost a Compaq presario laptop to this useless software.  Use Windows Live One Care it's all you need.	-1

I have been using system mechanic at least 5 years. A few months ago I renewed on line and was offered version 11 free upgrade. After the download is when problems started to happen. IOLO top notch tech in India told me that Install Shield was a virus that was stopping the downloads and he could fix that for $200.00. I also us Norton Internet Security. When update definitions don't download, system mechanic really slows your computor down, I have XP,Vista and Windows 7 computors. Windows 7 is the only one that is working correctly and I have removed system mechanic from my XP and Vista systems . I suspect that version 11 is not compatibly with XP or Vista. And so far IOLO has not admitted it. Bottom line is I am looking for another software for my XP and Vista.	-1
Take this as a WARNING!. This software has been plagued with bugs causing shutdown errors and disabling Wanted startup processes. If that is not bad enough, Customer support is  Non existant. After 5 problem reports, Iolo doesn't even bother to respond.  How this product ever got Editors Coice Awards is suspect.	-1
I have several of their products. None work well for either a PC or a Mac - and for a Mac, forget it! They have no support. You have to go with a "live" chat to India. The person in the chat room doesn't know Mac and doesn't understand what you are saying. All they respond with is "Yes," then nothing. I was also billed on my credit card several times for the same thing. I tried to get it corrected, but decided it was easier to just pay the bills as I spent several days trying to get somebody to understand me. The wait time for phone or live chat is hours.	-1
I was happy to upgrade my corel version 12 to the new corel x4 and .to be honestly after 3 days of stragling with this new version I starting to give up ,it suck . the program crash many time for any change aplying affect's  to your work , or you  have to wait until 1 0r 2 minutes to screen set up and keep working with a proyect. complete dissaponted. better corel come up with a update solution to this problem and even adding up the memory  from 25 to 75 still pretty slow.	-1
Pages sucks, small hard-drive Macs suck.  Maybe I'll go home to Windows where I started.  It all started with  Pages...  I have to get a book out or hit Google every time I want to save a document.  Why did they change something that has worked great forever.	-1
My software package says it's version 21 on the front, but the disk installed as version 20, still that's not what made this unusable. The package notes the Parent's Choice award for version 20 on the back so we still thought we'd be okay.  It says it works for Windows 7 and it did install (although I needed to input my administrator password), but then we got a shock when we started the software.  Instead of getting the menu shown on the box to take a lesson, play games or whatever, our menu said only 'teacher' or 'student'.  Turns out the software was for a classroom.  The password required to set up the 'teacher' option, without which the 'student' option wouldn't work, was said to be in the administrative manual.  Unfortunately no such manual came with the software. I can only assume the wrong software was on the disk so we are left high and dry.  Since the package is opened, I can't take it back to the office supply store where it was purchased and will have to mail the software and receipt to the company (address in 1 pt font which requires a magnifying glass to read) and the refund will take 4 to 6 weeks.  I tried calling the number on the website and got a ridiculous phone menu run around.  After listening to the options and choosing the one that seemed to apply another recording said a representative couldn't help and to interface with the web instead.  Surely I'd just chosen the wrong option and called again choosing the other option, but got the same message.  Why would there even be a phone number to call if they aren't taking calls.  Very annoying.  I can't speak to the software we expected to receive because we didn't get it, but potential buyers should know that if you have a problem, there is no support.  I'm willing to accept a mistake, but having the package say version 21, the disk say version 20 and different and unusable software actually install tells me this company has very poor quality control.  That coupled with no support  is a disaster.  I do not recommend buying this software.  Update: The website does not list the version 21 software as a choice in the technical support area but I tried another type of search and found it.  I had to email to get the missing password and was rewarded with a list of instructions to follow to get the software to work, including the password.  I'll try it tomorrow.  Hopefully this will help, otherwise the software is still going back.	-1
I recently purchased a new PC from Dell, and I bought this software (from them) along with the computer.  Owch, what a mistake, I should have read the reviews here first.  I had pretty low expectations/requirements from this software actually.  Mainly I just wanted to move over my settings, email, and music.  How about 0 for 3!  Firstly, the software can only be used 1 time (owch!).  That is their ridiculous licensing agreement.  Second, you need to install it on both the machine you are moving from, and the machine your are moving to.  Alright, so I'm moving from a windows xp machine to a windows vista machine.  Surely that's got to be the most common configuration these days right?  Surely that's the one thing that would work right?  wrong.  Firstly, the installation crashed on *both* machines.  After downloading updates from the web, re-installing and uninstalling several times it finally seemed to install correctly.  Smooth sailing from there right?  Nope.  First, I tried to do the transfer over ethernet, since I have a home network and that is supposidly supported by this software.  That didn't work at all.  So then I grudgingly tried a transfer over the cable that they provided. The software had a lot of trouble recognizing the cable, but after fiddling with that until it worked, I finally set up a transfer.  Several hours later, my vista box had developed major problems, none of my email or bookmarks or anything had been transfered (only documents) and I was one cheesed off customer.  This software is completely (and I mean COMPLETELY) worthless.  It's a waste of your time, and a waste of your money.  Believe me, the way to go is just to get an external hard drive and drag the files over you want to keep, or do it over your home network if you have one.  You'll save yourself a lot of time and a lot of headaches doing it that way, believe me, I wish I had.	-1
PCMover is supposed to make moving your system from one computer to another as painless as possible. Unfortunately it doesn't work very well. First off the software is confusing to use, even for a tech savvy person. Second, each end of the transfer cable needs to be plugged in to a specific computer but THE CABLE IS NOT MARKED in a way that lets you know which end is which! I wasted an hour trouble shooting before realizing that I needed to swamp the cable around.  The transfer is a long, arduous process. Mine took nearly 10 hours. After the transfer completed, most of the programs that were moved failed to work correctly, including: QuickBooks, LightRoom V 1.3 and ACS Data Base among others.  I suggest avoiding this program unless you absolutely have to have it. It was a total waste of my time.	-1
Anyone as foolish as myself who bought Drive Idiot 1 will be glad to know that if you try to update it it will tell you you have to pay for Drive idiot 2 this is only 2 months after purchase of Drive idiot 1.  Drive idiot 1 sucks and doesen't do anything only mess up your MAC HD.  Use disk utility it has all the same options as this garnage software.	-1
There is a lot that this software simply won't or can't do.  I use it for some things but I won't ever buy it again.  Not even the upgrades are worth download time.  Get something else.	-1
Here is my beef.  The price dropped before shipping.  I asked Amazon.com to honor the price at shipment time.  I was told to take a hike and Amazon no longer honors its own prices.  I won't be shopping here again.	-1
I have PDF Converter Professional 4.0  I doubt if 5.0  is any more functional  or reliable than 4.0  Thus I would not recommend this program to anyone. Several features have never worked others work poorly. The interface is awkward.  The support knowledge base is very limited.  E mail tech support is $10.  This is a lot to fix a problem that never should happen.  I resent paying money for a program and then being asked to pay more money get the program to work.  I used to use Adobe Acrobat 6.0.  This worked every time.  My suggestion is that if youuse this program professionally and your time is important to you consider an Adobe program.  Certainly don't buy this one.  If you buy this program you will regret it.	-1
Update 3: 06-04-2010  My xp machine at work was having problems and before I did anything, I UN-installed PDF coverter pro 5. [as per Nuance instructions]  I ran a repair on windows and everything was running fine again.  I RE-installed pdf converter pro and crap!  When I went to activate, it said I had activated this copy of pdf converter pro 5 the maximum number of times....blah...blah....blah...  Here we go again.  Then it offered me a button to click on to BUY the program?????  I went over to ebay and picked up NITRO PDF 6, on a charity auction for like $40 (w/free S&H)  I tried a few pdf creations and a few pdf conversions with NITRO PDF 6 and so far it looks to work just as good, or better, than nuance's pdf product.  I'll contact Nuance about the problem by fax (can't seem to reach them any other way without PAYING for assistance. If their !#@!$$#@^%  product wasn't such a PITA, no one would have to contact them).  Needless to say, I downgraded this product's rating to a single star.  Update 2: 04-04-2010. Reinstallation of XP operating system CRIPPLED by nuance trying to revalidate license CONSTANTLY during the reinstall of XP.  My XP MCE 2005 operating system lost access to it's HAL.DLL file, requiring a reinstall of the OS.  This PITA pdf converter lost it's ability to validate it's license and CONSTANTLY preempted my XP reinstall attempts. Two attempts at removing the pdf converter still did not stop it from trying to validate it's license. Even used JVPOWERTOOLS 2009, to remove EVERY registry entry for pdf converter AND nuance; still invaded my reinstall of XP. It got so crippling that I simply used a new hard drive, initialized it and did a clean install of XP; then transferred data/user files afterward.  The validation process they use is a real PITA.  I'd gladly pay (...) or even (...) to just get a USB security dongle , so they can get rid of that USELESS license verification process, built into their product.  Nuisance (oops, nuance) has NO fallback for those times you must do a clean install on your OS, (AND are unable to access your OS in order to UNinstall their product "Prior to" the OS reinstall).  ------------------------------------------ Update 11-01-2009  Be forewarned about activation & loss of product usage.  ------------------------------------------ Attention !!!! WARNING !!!!  Nuance does things a lot different with their product's installation & activation. A couple re-installs of your windows operating system due to windows issues; and/or a couple hardware upgrades like new video card or new hard drive, and PDF converter 5 could cease to function.  My installation had this problem recently. At almost (...), you expect a program to function 24/7/365. When mine stopped working, it really interrupted my work production.  So, If you have this software installed and want to upgrade/changed ANY internal PC hardware, you MUST uninstall the pdf converter pro 5 software "BEFORE you make ANY hardware changes" !!!  NOTE: UNinstalling the program in effect "DE-activates" your pdf converter pro 5. Thus "releaseing" the license key and this doesn't count against your "5 license activations", before product QUITS working!  I work with pc hardware and do pc repairs/upgrades 40+ hours a week.  On my work PC, I have upgraded my mobo 3 times this year. My hard drive twice. (one of the perks of being the IT helpdesk guy) (last update was to an Intel i7 Core.)  Recently I had lost windows booting abilities, so I installed a newer, larger, hard drive. So I installed the brand new hard drive and did a clean XP Pro installation.  As soon as I loaded PDF Converter 5 Pro, it wanted to activate.  Then it went online a few seconds and then an error window popped up saying I had exceeded the 5 activation allowances that Nuance allows.  I emailed Nuance the details. I mentioned how I own 4 retail box copies of this s/w.  After going back and forth with support, they re-activated my license number.  But I could not make PDF files or about 2 days.  *****How to prevent this from happening again?****  If you are using PDF converter 5 on your PC, then ALWAYS, ALWAYS, ALWAYS do an UNinstall before changing ANY pc hardware.  The activation process takes serial numbers from the internal components and uses them for activation calculations. (probably the serial # of mobo and/or hard drives).  When a serial number changes due to new hardware, the s/w launches another activation attempt. Five activations are allowed before the s/w is disabled.  You MUST UNistall the software before doing hardware upgrades, to keep the activation counter from decrementing one of the 5 activation allowances.  This is the sort of thing that should be listed on a neon colored label, on the CD's paper sleeve or jewel case. And/or on the box it comes in. I told Nuance this, but I doubt they'll do anything about it.  Unforunately, it is not like there are a lot of choices for the combination software of PDF maker with a PDF converters.  You have: 1. Nuance pdf conveter pro 5 2. Nitro pdf. 3. PDF tools [by solid documents]  Adobe's acrobat pdf maker is pricey and has no conversion abilities. It only creates PDFss.  Other single function s/w conveters are:  Able2extract Docudesk PDF conveter elite  Oh, and as far as product functionality, this software does okay.  PDF to word conversions do okay with text; but sort of crappy with images. (But it seems to be this way with all pdf converter applications).  ------------------------------------------------------------ I'm on day 1 of using this software.  Creating a PDF is working fine.  Converting an existing PDF to MS Word is working fine, so far.  Converting an existing PDF with a table inside it; into MS excel is working OK, so far.  Annoyances/problems:  1. After installing software onto my PC, an annoying "activation" NAG screen keeps popping up everytime/anytime I launch the program and/or toggle between CREATING a PDF vs CONVERTING a PDF. Plus it decrements from 30 uses to none.  So off I went to ACTIVATE this whiner!  2. Activation:  a. I just went online, registered,  and then activated it, but apparently it requires further  MANUAL intervention by the enduser (lazy programmers at Nuance). Because I am still getting the pop-up about not being activated.  b. License key & activation problems: The setup/installation onto your PC works just fine with numbers and LOWER case letters . [For entering the alpha-numeric license code during installation of the software onto your PC].  But as soon as you get to Nuance's website and try to activate/register, by using their "Paste-serial-number-from-clipboard" button, you get an error! These boneheads keep kicking back your serial number as INCORRECT until you make it ONLY numbers and only "UPPER case" letters. (why doesn't Nuance spend  a couple bucks on a 5 minute programming "FIX"  and let the stinking webpage AUTO correct a small issue like these)  Next, trying to correct a serial number which was already "pasted" into the Nuance webform box [but contained lower-case letters]. Whenever I'd click my mouse next to a lower case letter and try to CHANGE it to an UPPERcase letter, a wretched pop-up window keeps WHINING about using "The PASTE button function only". For every 1 lower-case letter you try to change to upper-case; you have to answer 2 pop-up windows and make them go away. [Hey tightwads, fix your website's serial number entry form). [Go to Elance and hire a programmer for (...) an hour and FIX the problem with "YOUR" [NUANCE's] website]  I tried to be  nice  and contact Nuisance (whoops, I mean Nuance) about their problem. (Starting off an end-user experience like this is NOT going to endear me to rush out and buy any more NUANCE products; especially  if they can't make the registration & activation process easier, functional and more streamlined)  Here's a frustrating experience; Just try contacting these Tight-fisted pukes with a simple FYI, to tell them about a website issue of their's.  These pukes  expect you to shell out (...) per incident  just to contact them. Sorry dudes, I'm not paying to fix YOUR website problems.  SUMMARY:  Pros - products looks/acts OK so far.   - cheaper than Adobe  Cons - Just hope you NEVER need to contact NUANCE for ANYTHING. Or I should say; PLAN to NEVER contact them. [you can't even throw them a bone about how to improve their website without getting hit up for (...)]  -poor activation web setup  - Deceptive/hidden cost details about tech support :   - no mention on software box   - no mention inside box, nor in User manual  I bought this program for myself. Once I test-drove it awhile, I was going to make recommendations to a large client about maybe switching to Nuance (from Adobe). I really have my doubts now; especially regarding their "nickel & dime-ing" attitude toward their end-users.  09-24-2008 update:  I tried converting a bunch of pdf's to word, so i can work with the data within the pdf's.  The program goes fairly fast through the conversion process, until you reach 99%. Then it sits there for what seems like an eternity.  My core-2-duo is not pegged for CPU usage (only 25-50%), but the hard disk light is almost solid.  I found that this program really has a hard time with any text within a book's front cover. Mostly comes out as a mangled mess. The text pages are decent in the translation. But plan to run auto-format within Word, to get things cleaned up.	-1
This is my revised review of Norton 360 version 2.0.  I previously had given a positive review and my review was rated as "The most helpful favorable review".  However, after extended use of the product I have to remove my first review and mark this product as DEFECTIVE.  I believe that if the professional review sites that have given this product positive reviews were to run extended trials and followed a policy of revising their initial ratings that they also would drop their ratings after they find that the product starts failing after extended use.  I installed the Norton 360 version 2.0 trial edition downloaded from Norton's website and ran it for 13 days on my Windows Vista SP1 PC before activating it. During that time my system did not have any noticeable computer slowdowns and it ran in the background without any need for intervention.  It also ran just fine for another 7 days after purchasing a license and activating it.  Sounds great, right?  Well, in my second week of owning it, Norton 360 v2 suddenly started having "Service Framework" failures and told me I should reboot my PC to ensure stable operation.  I found that I better heed the warning and reboot, because my Quad core PC with 3 GB of RAM would turn into a brick that barely functioned. This is really, really annoying when you are in the middle of doing something and suddenly you have to interrupt your work to reboot the computer... oh and saving your work takes about 10 times as long since the computer suddenly doesn't want to function.  I went through tech support and they had me try a lot of different fixes, including doing a complete uninstall and reinstall of the product. Doing a reinstall actually seemed to make things better for a few days and then suddenly Norton 360 decided it was time to start failing at random intervals again.  I looked on message boards and found that some people claimed that there might be a corrupt file on your system that Norton was scanning and failing on.  The problem with that claim is that is 1) Reinstalling the product and doing a "comprehensive" scan didn't cause a failure so I don't think that is really the root cause and 2) even if that was the root cause, if a security product like Norton is going to crash when it finds a corrupt file, then exactly what value does the product provide?  Do you really want to go on a witch hunt for corrupt files on your computer every few days when Norton starts failing on you?  BOTTOM LINE: I wish I could recommend the product, but I CANNOT RECOMMEND.  It simply is DEFECTIVE.  When it works, it works great, but it is NOT STABLE and I believe that any installation of it WILL EVENTUALLY START CRASHING EVEN IF IT SEEMS TO WORK AT FIRST.  If you decide to buy anyway, here are a few notes:  - By default eavesdropping protection is turned off. You can enable it via the settings page. I saw in a professional review that they really recommended turning this feature on.  - You need to ensure that any other virus or firewall programs that you have installed are fully uninstalled before installing this product. Having multiple competing products installed can really mess up your system. I used the Norton removal tool from their web site to fully remove the trial version of Norton Internet Security that I was using prior to installing this software.  - If you are uncertain about this product, download the free trial from symantec first, but note that my problems with the product didn't show up until about day 20 of having it installed.  - If you choose to download the full version of the software from symantec, they place a copy of the full version under C:\ProgramData\Symantec Temporary Files on Windows Vista. Just grab a copy of the software and back it up. This way you don't have to pay to have an "extended download period". Or just keep a copy of the trial version around since it allows you to activate it using the product key that the symantec store gives you.  - If you are deciding between purchasing the shipped package from Amazon or Symantec, I would choose Amazon in a heart beat. Amazon customer service rocks. You also could probably download the trial version from symantec, buy the package from Amazon, and then just enter the product code from the Amazon package in the trial software once the Amazon package arrives.	-1
The list of things wrong with this POS is incredible...  This thing chokes trying to download its own updates.  The status bar freezes and I have no idea what is going on.  I click on the update option, and it says it is already running a scan.  1. No it isn't, and 2. that's not what I told it to do.  When I tell it to SCAN, it asks me to setup the backup program.  Which leads me to another complaint...  Norton 360 includes TONS of "features," and you don't get any option to choose what is installed.  You MUST install EVERYTHING, even though a lot of them are just low-quality versions of things you can get for free otherwise without being locked into a proprietary subscription.  Many of the "features" of Norton 360 are just reminders to use some of Windows included abilities.  Delete temporary files?  Defrag hard drive?  Thanks, I'd rather have bought the cheaper version.  I installed it, and Norton gleefully displays a green check to indicate that I am "protected" against viruses, even though it had not yet run an update.  WINDOWS had to tell me that my virus program did not have a recent update, and I had to manually tell Norton to update.  Apparently Norton thinks "protected" means that your virus program will be working TOMORROW, even though TODAY my virus database is over a year old.  COOKIES are listed as "unrepairable virus" in the scan results. Can we say "overkill?"  The backup utility cannot be disabled.  You can try, but it won't stop.  And it only includes 2 GB of backup space!  You have to "buy" more backup space, and 2GB is not enough for anyone's stuff.  For giggles, I checked the price of buying more storage from Norton.  It is literally 10 TIMES the cost of buying a hard drive.  Even more: Norton pops up a little window telling me I have a "threat" which is being "processed", and yet it won't tell me what kind of "threat" it is.  Apparently it could be anything from a tracking cookie to a virus/worm.  It doesn't show up in any of the history or logs.  I spent 30 minutes on the phone with tech support, and the final answer was "this product is not designed to provide that information" (pretty much word-for-word).  By the way, when I called, the first thing they tried to do was charge me $100 for a technician to "fix" my computer, even though I called for help using the software, not with any PC trouble.	-1
How bad is Norton 360? - I bought a copy and promptly uninstalled it the next day! It's extremely intrusive and prone to result in very slow operation on the PC it's installed on. Norton Anti-Virus 2009 is much, much better! I friend of mine had the same experience.  What an amazing screw-up of a product!	-1
I have been an avid Norton Symantec user for over 13 years.  This is the worst product EVER. It slows your system down so much that I had to disable most of the features, which an average user will not know how to do.  My biggest complaint is that once the "virus update" expires.. it renders the entire software useless. I couldn't even go in and make simple changes to the settings, nothing to do with the virus update feature. PLUS  A pop-up comes up everyday twice a day begging me to buy another year subscription. That is false. What they are really asking is that I buy the software again. Once a year is up .. you might as well throw it in the trash OR give it to someone else OR wipe your hard drive and install a fresh copy.  I am not happy with it at all! I will never buy any anti-virus or internet security software from this company again.  I have heard of complaints that it will crash your system the day it expires.  Uninstalling any Norton products are difficult and you should find a good article on the internet on how to do this.  NOTE: You must uninstall any anti-virus software if you are installing a different brand.	-1

WARNING to anyone thinking about buying this product! Please understand that you will not be buying this product only RENTING it. If you do not renew every year the product stops working....COMPLETELY! I'm not just talking about updates, etc. It actually tells you that it has stopped working and it won't work unless you renew. I have just wasted more than 2 hours with Norton's online tech support. This is the case with ALL Norton products and I am quoting the tech.	-1
I ordered this and tried to have a 15 day free trial installed to see if it worked and how well it worked. I wish I had tried the free install before I ordered it. I still haven't received the package yet but now know I want nothing to do with it or Norton. It would not install from the free download from Norton's site. It gave me an error after about 30 to 40 minutes of grinding. It took me to an error message with a link from Norton telling me to install a Microsoft package VISUAL C ++ 2005. I tried, it failed to install. I tried about three more times. searched the net for answers. none to be found. After about four or five hours of this, I contacted Norton support group for help. After a wait of about half an hour, I had someone start a conversation with me and he asked to be given a minute to "REVIEW" my problem. He left me for about another half an hour and the screen said he left the room. I waited, waited and another guy comes on and starts to troubleshoot with me. After about an hour, during which he is helping other people by asking me to excuse him for a moment, he gets the same error messages. He says "CONTACT MICROSOFT, It's their problem". If you have ever tried to contact Microsoft you realize how this came across to me. I have lost about 6 hours now and still have no solution except to cancel my order from Amazon. Norton just wants money, they could care less about people with problems. Stay away from all Norton products, there is no support.	-1
I've been a Norton user ever since the olden days of Apple: The Mac Performa was the first color computer I ever toyed with.  I had Norton 6 (I believe) and loved it.  It was small, simple, effective.  I used the full Norton software on later PCs and found them to be bloated and memory hogging.  Not worth the money I paid for them at all.  Enter Norton 360.  I do appreciate the more silent footprint of this new Norton, however, all they did was lessen the GUI's presence.  The bloat is still there, you just don't see it.  Take a simple virus scan for example: I have a dualcore Centrino laptop and just a virus scan brought the poor thing to its knees.  Unacceptable.  Also, the cleanup works TOO well, essentially making Firefox "forget" everything even when you tell it not to.  The straw: the heuristic virus protection.  It blocks websites that are in no way dangers to your computer, and deletes software programs that are just updates or patches (not warez).  It assumes something must be dangerous just because it opens a port to function - guess what?  A lot of software might need to do that, including some of Microsoft's own.  It's no big deal.  IT doesn't even prompt you first, it just takes action.  I don't recommend this.  If you need total protection look into McAfee instead.	-1
Just misses the mark. I suppose the software is good but it is a little difficult to get to do what I want it to do.	-1
Service Pack 0 was a disaster, now we have SP1. Still a disaster. I almost get the impression that microsoft is being run by FEMA. Vista is still slow, still buggy, and still crashes. Since it would not run properly on a new dual core Athlon, with 4 gigs of RAM, I installed it on my new MAC Pro with 2 quad cores and 4 gigs of RAM. And it actually works well with boot camp. However. OSX works much better. So, thank you ill Gates for pushing me to buy a Mac.	-1
This `upgrade' will not install on a `clean' hard drive, nor will it `upgrade' XP Pro. There is a work around, but it involves duplicate installs and other technical `workarounds' so if you are not technically savvy, don't get this `upgrade'.  If you do want to consider this `upgrade' be aware that Windows Vista Home Premium does not include FAX capability and needs the Office 2007 suite along with Outlook 2007 (which does not support animated gif's, among other things) for most eMail.  I would not consider Windows Vista Home Premium an `upgrade' as it requires more system memory, is a step backward in features, and more cumbersome to use.	-1
Installed about a year ago without any problem on Vista certified hardware.  It was running ok with one annoying problem - it was constantly loosing the video settings every time I reboot.  Then these wave of security patch start to roll in.  I only use the PC for watching blu-ray movies and after installing 100+ security patches, the system is so slow that I cannot finish 90 minutes movies without rebooting the operating system.  Microsoft eventually did fix the video resetting problem (one of those 100+ patch fixed it), but OS is pretty much useless for doing what it is design to do.  Now I have to make a decision to add additional memory to satisfy this memory starving OS (I am currently running with 2 GB) or wipe it clean and install Windows XP.	-1
I tried Windows Vista Home Premium SP1 to see if it was worth upgrading my home XP machine to Vista. I just can't find any compelling reason to upgrade to Vista. I have I gig of memory in my home machine and with XP it runs fine. With Vista I have to turn off the Aero graphics due to limited memory on my machine. Once the Aero graphics are turned off the system runs close to the speed of XP but you loose the major feature upgrade of Vista which is the improved graphics.  I have a MCSE so I'm very familiar with Microsoft OS's but I just don't find Vista to be very intuitive. Seems to me that they put pretty front ends on the same interfaces that are running once you get through the new front ends on system preferences and configuration. I find it harder to move around Vista and find things, and I have given it a good chance to become familiar with but still find it non intuitive.  I've had issues with the wireless on Vista. Easy to connect to my linksys but the connection keeps falling off and and then adds a new connection with a new name to the wireless list. I have had no issues with XP or my Mac 10.5 on my linksys router. Not sure why Vista is struggling but it has become a pain to deal with, especially when someone non technical is using the laptop and I'm not home and the connection drops.  So, if you are an XP user I wouldn't waist the money on the upgrade. Stay with XP unless you are looking to purchase a new PC or laptop and then you will be stuck with Vista whether you like it or not.	-1
What a mess! Vista was an ambitious undertaking by Microsoft, and sure it "looks" better than XP, but when it comes to what matters, Vista fails remarkably in nearly every aspect than it claims to excel at. If you've got XP and it works just fine for you, there is absolutely no way I can recommend that you put yourself through the nightmare of Vista. If you manage to get past the hassle of getting this properly registered and working, you're then forced to put up with the numerous upgrades of other programs which, if you're lucky, will function error-free. Problem is, you shouldn't have to count on luck. Many programs which are less than a year old won't even function on Vista, after you've already spent hours on end trying everything possible to make them work. So it's up to you individually. Some have found it to be a seemless transition with no problems at all. Others, like myself, have had nothing but issues and a pounding headache. I for one reverted back to XP, and I plan on keeping it that way for the forseeable future.	-1
If it were possible to give Vista a negative rating I would do so.  Vista is unlike every other Microsoft Operating System ever produced.  Every new Microsoft Operating System came with its annoying little bugs.  Those of us who liked Microsoft Windows myself among them usually got used to living with the MS bugs or "Features" as they are called by the company.  Vista was inflicted on PC users because somewhere Microsoft got the notion that a more complex difficult to use memory hogging buggy wizard filled operating system was more secure thus much better.  Vista is indeed far more secure than any earlier Microsoft product for one basic reason it never lets you do anything.  You can not be productive on Vista unless you jump through more operating system generated hoops than you will ever see during a lifetime at the circus.  Don't get me wrong.  I am not one of these geeky guys that wants everyone to switch to Linux or Apple.  I love my Microsoft Windows XP PC but, Microsoft Vista is a gigantic LEMMON no amount of Service Pack tweaking will ever fix.  I have XP systems and I will be keeping my XP computer.  If I buy a new computer with Pretty but way lame Vista pre-installed I will reformat my disk and install my trusty capable XP operating system workhorse.  To say Vista is super slow at start up, during regular use and at shut down is an understatement in its most profound incarnation.  If you buy a system with so much memory, new graphics, sound and other high priced, hogh powered hardware producing a system that costs a kings ransom Vista will speed up a little.  Vista is a money hog because many old XP devices do not work on Vista at all and others need lots of tweeking to get them to work.  Now Vista is so improved it will never crash, naw Vista just freezes up so completely you can not do anything productive.  Vista will make you more productive because all its freeze up's will have you doing the same work again and again and again and again hoping it won't freeze before you can save it!  Finally Vista is a big useless paranoid fat nag.  I mean at every turn Vista wants to reformat, check or otherwise make sure something you are doing is allowed.  Vista is the Fort Knox of Operating Systems but think about it who wants to live and work in Fort Knox.  Vista is an operating system as such it is an extention of your home or business.  Adding Vista to your computer is like stationing thousands of nagging police officers whose job it is to challenge your every move every time you become even the least bit productive.  Vista is an operating system with so many paranoid subsystems built in that it is effectively useless for its intended productive purpose.  For all the reasons I list herein I would strongly advise against purchasing Vista.  I feel Vista is the prettiest operating system Microsoft has ever produced but under that pretty surface is a code full of maggots that grow into extremely pretty productivity killing computer bugs.	-1
I build my own computers.  For my newest gaming computer I selected Vista as my O/S.... BIG MISTAKE.  A long list of problems and such.  It is gaming hostile, very slow, very buggy.  And the nvidea video driver for Vista is bad news.  It was soooo bad I just bought XP PRO SP2 and removed Vista from my system.  XP is wonderful in comparison.  Vista was soooo cruddy and slow. PASS on this one.  Not recommended.	-1
Why SP1??? Because SP-zero does not work. Do not let Mad Doctor FrankenGates experiment with you. Microjunk products do not work. Vista will crash, Vista will boot very slow. And you will pull your hair out. On top of that, you will get horrible customer service. If you are running XP, keep it. One star for this product is way too generous.	-1
This is just another, in a long line of horible experiments by Mad Doctor FrankenGates. Your system WILL crash, it WILL run slower, and you will be sorry for buying this boxocrap. If you buy an 8-core Mac Pro and use "boot camp", then and only then will this junk actually work. That's what I had to do. The only good thing about vista is, it got me into something much much better than microsoft. Mac OSX. What a pleasure.	-1
I had been running XP for some time, but I ended up getting a virus despite sophisticated internet security.  I figured I'd upgrade to Vista and do a fresh install.  The installation was easy.  After everything was up and running, I noticed it ran pretty well on my system.  I have a 2gig AMD 64 dual core processor.  After about a week, I noticed that my computer would progessively slow down day by day.  Which is funny since it hasn't gotten any more sophisticated.  It just takes more memory.  I have a gig of memory, but even with that, Vista was using around 68% at any given time...just to run the OS.  I could use a little extra memory for my system, but why would I want to spend money to upgrade my hardware just to run the same stupid tasks?  This OS takes 15 extra gigabytes of hard drive space too.  15 gigabytes can hold about 1000 mp3 files, and I'm basically subtracting it from my computer without question so I can have Vista hog it all.  Now I know why Macs have been selling so well.  I don't have $1500 for a new Mac, so I put a copy of Ubuntu Linux on my computer.  It took 10 minutes to install.  It's just as flashy, more intuitive, and it does everything Windows can do-and it's friggin' free.  It reads all my music files, it reads all my pictures and videos.  My printer works and I have Open Office.  From the time it takes to boot up Vista, I can log on, off, and back on again 10 times over.	-1
I have not had any application or driver install correctly on Vista, even programs certified for use with Vista.  This is the worst garbage I have ever seen and is occuring on more than one computer.  Don't move away from XP Pro at any cost.	-1
There is absolutely no reason to buy this product.  Stick with XP and wait and see how Windows 7 does when released this year.  Vista adds some eye candy that you can get for your xp system for free or a small fee.  It does add heaches, UAC (goggle that one and check the number of problems), terrific bloat, system slow down, driver issues, software issues,etc...  Also take a look at the people giving 4 and 5 stars and then listing a host of problems.	-1
I bought this to use with Xfer-ing my old VHS "How to" videos to DVD.  1st problem was that the 2nd, bonus CD's serial number was coming up as invalid.  2nd problem: Unable to capture any video.  I have 4 different video capture devices: 1. pinnacle (bought in 2008) 2. Dazzle 100 series (bought in 2008) 3. Dazzle 150b 4. ADS tech X2 (bought in 2007)  Despite trying with all 4 devices, I keep getting the error,"Cannot start Capture graph".  Amazingly the corel website does NOT even list this error in the search results!? Yet when googling for it, you'll find this user problem on probably a 100 + webpages.  (I guess if corel denies the problem exists, then they don't have to address/fix it)  This is the first FULL video editor package I have bought in years. Each of the 4 RCA to USB video capture devices came with either an SE "special edition" or LE "Light edition" of either pinnacle studio or Ulead videostudio. All the stripped down programs actually WORK. The full version of Videostudio 11.5 does NOT!!!  After numerous update attempts, repair attempts, remove & re-install attempts, I gave up. I never had a ulead[corel] program be so messed up.  I had a copy of videostudio plus X2 on order (it came up on amazon on sale for $39.99 last weekend). Today I saw that it had not be shipped, so I cancelled the X2 version.  The lack of knowledge base support for an application with serious issues, is criminal.  For crying out loud, just fix it with a patch and list the fix in the corel knowledgebase. To omit it from the corel website is the sign of a real craptastic company. I always liked ulead products until this one.  A huge disappointment.	-1
This looks like it would be a good product, with a useful suite of features. But the version Amazon sent me didn't include a registration code, so I couldn't install it on my computer. I tore the box apart looking for it, scrutinizing each scrap, but it just wasn't there. Very frustrating.	-1
The fifth time was a charm (!) when I tried to install this software on my Windows XP based system. I have a relatively new system and so I did not anticipate all the problems I had in installing this software. I've used&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Adobe-Premiere-Elements-4/dp/B000UK6OUK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Adobe Premiere Elements 4</a>&nbsp;before and even&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Nero-8-Ultra-Edition/dp/B000V9YXJ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Nero 8 Ultra Edition</a>&nbsp;for some light movie editing and never had a problem with the install or in burning the final DVD. With Ulead VideoStudio I am stumped.  The first 3 times I tried to install it the installation simply froze in the middle and I had to shut down my system to get it to work again. The 4th time I was able to load the software and then it asked me to insert the bonus CD which comes with WinDVD - the CD authoring software - and extra audio, video clips. The moment WinDVD started to install on my system it tried to delete some files which caused a fatal system error and I got blue screened. I began again the next day, I installed the software again and did not put in the bonus CD as suggested.  The software is easy to work with, it can convert your DV tapes to digital media or you can edit your digital media. It's easy to drop in your video clips, drag in audio and use transitions. You may not able to use your computer for much else while editing unless you have a very powerful system. However, once you're done editing, it can be very frustrating to go through the authoring process.  My system keeps freezing repeatedly and it becomes really difficult to create a DVD from this software most times. I am not sure if the hassle is worth my time, even though the software interface is intuitive and easy to use. If I get the system freeze one more time while trying to make a DVD, I am going to uninstall the software.	-1
About the only video I'm interested in working with is the video that I get from my cell phone.  I have Motorola RAZR so it isn't some obscure model no one ever heard of.  I was surprised to see that there was no support for the 3g2 file format in Ulead.  I contacted Corel to make sure that they did, in fact, not support this file format.  They don't--at least not yet.  They may support it in the future as patch update (no time line was given).	-1
This software has a nice interface and plenty of features for the home/consumer video enthusiast. There's also a great user support forum linked to the publisher's website.  Unfortunately, I found the program to be somewhat buggy and cannot recommend it. The most significant issue was that my PC's DVD drive wasn't recognized by the program when it was time to burn a disk. There were numerous, time consuming workarounds and fixes mentioned on the Video Studio forum. One user even solved his issue with the software by reinstalling his PC's operating system. But who wants to go through all that?  I downloaded the trial versions of Sony's Vegas Pro and DVD Architect Pro, as a previous reviewer suggested, and they worked just fine on the same PC. Those programs are definitely worth the extra money if you value your time.	-1
Most have pointed out the flaws already, I will simply state that every device I used this operating with except my MacBook was dead within a few weeks/months due to bad drivers and terrible instability.  Better than windows 8 or 10 but sucks compared to Xp, 7 or OSX.	-1
A lot of start up problems, a lot of shutdown problems, I ended up having to switch to linux and it starts up and shuts down like a charm. I suggest getting Windows Vista if you need to game in DirectX10, otherwise, stick to XP.	-1
This is possibly the worst operating system I've ever used. Every single time you open an application, download something, or do anything at all, the system asks you for your "permission" to proceed. What a stupid waste of time.  The system is also incredibly unreliable, almost demonically so. I had installed Vista on my MAC in order to take the New York Bar Exam on my computer. However, the day of the exam, when I opened Microsoft Vista, it locked me out of the operating system and asked me for my product registration key - even though I had entered it when I installed Vista earlier. I had no warning that the operating system was just going to lock me out randomly - I had even tested it the night before.  If you use your computer for anything important, I would highly recommend against using this piece of garbage.	-1
It is amazing that software this bad could be released.  If Microsoft had more competition--this would have died a quick death in the market place.  Slows your machine down to crawl.  Freezes and crashes.  Reboot if you must (and you will) and nothing improves.  Unstable and unreliable.  Stick with XP.	-1

This `upgrade' will not install on a `clean' hard drive, nor will it `upgrade' XP Pro. There is a work around, but it involves duplicate installs and other technical `workarounds' so if you are not technically savvy, don't get this `upgrade'.  If you do want to consider this `upgrade' be aware that Windows Vista Home Premium does not include FAX capability and needs the Office 2007 suite along with Outlook 2007 (which does not support animated gif's, among other things) for most eMail.  I would not consider Windows Vista Home Premium an `upgrade' as it requires more system memory, is a step backward in features, and more cumbersome to use than XP.	-1
Vista is like parents treating you like a 10 year old who doesn't have permission to do anything on the computer because you're too stupid to know what it is you want to do. I HATE IT. You no longer have access to your computer. If you try to see your temp folders to delete temp files, you can not do that. If you've uninstalled a program via add/remove programs and want to remove the files and folders that always get left behind, you can't. You are only allowed into the areas of your computer that MS deems you will not be able to do any damage. If you go to a web site that has special features you want to view, you can't and you can't change your setting to allow access to things you feel are safe that MS have decided you don't need to have. None of my USB devices work except one printer. There are no USB wireless 802.11 devices that work, unless you want to spend several hundred dollars on gaming devices for networking. After two years of working with MS, trying to get all my computers talking to each other, they were never able to help me get my Vista machine working this my XP machines. I spent more time letting people access my computer remotely than I was able to spend on my computer... I wonder how safe that it. I went back to XP and now EVERYTHING works, my wireless devices, printers and my network is working as it should. Vista my be prettier and have need glow and glass features, but as a working computer, it stinks. If you can't get a computer with XP, save yourself the frustration and agravation and get an APPLE!	-1
Generally speaking, to get the best performance from any operating system a clean install of a full version is recommended. The best choice is to choose a full version of the product and enjoy the benefits of not being left with artifacts and leftover's of your previous operating system which can lead to instability in certain cases. I would only buy this on a limited budget.	-1
Microsoft's latest OS is, indeed, more secure than Windows XP.  But I have installed it twice on two different machines, and subsequently uninstalled it and went back to XP a few weeks later both times.  Why?  - Stability is poor.  The system frequently blue screens (crashes) or, more commonly, hangs.  It's not a hardware problem, because both systems experienced these issues, and neither system has any issues running XP.  Vista Media Center slowly degrades over time (one of the computers is my living room DVR) until it is unusable without a hourly reboot (seriously!) - Speed - I play a lot of games, and Vista is consistently and significantly slower on every single game I've tried.  The difference is significant, even WITH the very latest "Vista Certified" video and sound drivers.  Then, there are games that crash on Vista, but have no issues on XP.  You can say "Well, they were tested to work with XP", and you'd be right, but I'd rather be running an OS that games were tested with.  And the DirectX 10 effects, which only Vista supports, are very ho-hum - they're not worth the performance hit, in my opinion.  For an example, check out the Crysis DirectX 9 vs. DirectX 10 comparisons on the net. - Hardware support - this really is not Microsoft's fault, but it is still an issue.  Many hardware manufacturers quietly refusing to release drivers for their existing hardware, in an effort to force people to buy new hardware for Vista support.  That's totally not Microsoft's fault - but make sure your devices are Vista compatible, BEFORE you buy Vista.  Microsoft has a  good compatibility guide on their website for this.  Scanners, printers, music players, phones, and wireless network gear are the gadgets with the worst Vista driver support, as are notebooks not specifically "designed for Vista".  I'm not saying you should NOT buy Vista, but if you do, be prepared for the problems you will encounter.  It might be better for a business user who is buying all new Vista compatible hardware.	-1
Windows Vista with SP1 is a pretty darned good operating system. Its main problem is that Windows XP is also a superb operating system, and most users will have difficulty understanding why we needed more than an incremental upgrade from XP. To the extent that the Vista interface deviates from the XP menus, I mostly have found this to be simply irritating.  The main flaw with Vista is that it deliberately did not have backwards compatibility with many earlier-version Window drivers.  Some printers and other devices flat out would not work with Vista.  This was an outrageous decision by Microsoft and it ultimately doomed the operating system with many users and businesses as word of this incompatibility got around.  Windows 7 essentially corrected this fatal mistake years later.  That having been said, Vista with SP1 is very solid and reliable. In my experience on my Notebook computer, however, be advised that it runs a LOT faster and better with plenty of DRAM. It seems to need more DRAM to run well. My new Intel dual-core Notebook came with 1GB DRAM, which was usually enough in Windows XP (except for most imaging software, which needed at least 2GB). However, I splurged and upgraded the computer to 4GB DRAM, and the difference was literally night-and-day. Vista could get doggy with 1GB. With 4 GB DRAM it literally screams on my Intel dual-core machine.  One unforgivable lapse on the part of Microsoft with Vista Home Premium is that it does not include Fax support. In this day and age, this is truly astounding. This represents a very obnoxious decision by someone.  The Vista interface is prettier. What more can I say?  One thing I think that Microsoft needs to watch is the security options. Security features are all well and good, but at the end of the day the beauty of a microcomputer is that it frees most of us, most of the time, from dependence on the IT crew in the white labcoats. XP and Vista have so many security protocols that in some instances it is rekindling this dependence.  Overall, I am satisfied with Vista, and I would not hesitate again to buy a computer that came pre-loaded with it. The upgrade learning curve from XP is really not all that great.	-1
I wouldn't normally suggest this but do not upgrade!  Vista takes the only good thing about Microsoft products - which is the advantage of an interface that you already know - and breaks it.  Vista really is different than any of the previous versions of windows but in the worst of ways.  Here's a typical example.  Want to do something simple like search for a file?  Too bad!  They have a much faster version of search with just one problem - no place to enter the search criteria.  Overall I think that the only people who have gained from Vista are Apple and Linux users since there should be more defections with the Vista fiasco.	-1
If it were possible to give Vista a negative rating I would do so. Vista is unlike every other Microsoft Operating System ever produced. Every new Microsoft Operating System came with its annoying little bugs. Those of us who liked Microsoft Windows myself among them usually got used to living with the MS bugs or "Features" as they are called by the company.  Vista was inflicted on PC users because somewhere Microsoft got the notion that a more complex difficult to use memory hogging buggy wizard filled operating system was more secure thus much better. Vista is indeed far more secure than any earlier Microsoft product for one basic reason it never lets you do anything. You can not be productive on Vista unless you jump through more operating system generated hoops than you will ever see during a lifetime at the circus.  Don't get me wrong. I am not one of these geeky guys that wants everyone to switch to Linux or Apple. I love my Microsoft Windows XP PC but, Microsoft Vista is a gigantic LEMMON no amount of Service Pack tweaking will ever fix. I have XP systems and I will be keeping my XP computer. If I buy a new computer with Pretty but way lame Vista pre-installed I will reformat my disk and install my trusty capable XP operating system workhorse.  To say Vista is super slow at start up, during regular use and at shut down is an understatement in its most profound incarnation. If you buy a system with so much memory, new graphics, sound and other high priced, hogh powered hardware producing a system that costs a kings ransom Vista will speed up a little. Vista is a money hog because many old XP devices do not work on Vista at all and others need lots of tweeking to get them to work. Now Vista is so improved it will never crash, naw Vista just freezes up so completely you can not do anything productive. Vista will make you more productive because all its freeze up's will have you doing the same work again and again and again and again hoping it won't freeze before you can save it!  Finally Vista is a big useless paranoid fat nag. I mean at every turn Vista wants to reformat, check or otherwise make sure something you are doing is allowed. Vista is the Fort Knox of Operating Systems but think about it who wants to live and work in Fort Knox. Vista is an operating system as such it is an extention of your home or business. Adding Vista to your computer is like stationing thousands of nagging police officers whose job it is to challenge your every move every time you become even the least bit productive. Vista is an operating system with so many paranoid subsystems built in that it is effectively useless for its intended productive purpose.  For all the reasons I list herein I would strongly advise against purchasing Vista. I feel Vista is the prettiest operating system Microsoft has ever produced.  Unfortunately under that pretty VISTA surface is a code filled of maggots that grow into extremely pretty productivity killing computer bugs.	-1
What a nightmare. If you've read the other reviews here, you probably already know how annoying Vista's access control messages are, and how it was incompatible with nearly everything, so I won't spend time railing about that. The one issue that I could not solve, or forgive, was one of the most fundamental issues for an operating system: file handling.  Vista didn't like copying files across a network. In fact, Vista took personal umbrage at being asked to transfer files across a network, and passive-agressively reduced the transfer rate down until it could be measured in bits per minute, instead of kB per second. I soon came to personify Vista as one of those toad-like elderly women behind the counter at the DMV who take perverse delight in watching people's impatience boil into homicidal rage. The kind of person/operating system that will let you get to almost the front of a two-hour line/95% complete file transfer and then wordlessly put up a "Next Window" sign/"File I/O error" message with just the hint of a malicious grin. The kind of person/operating system that justifies the "No Firearms in the DMV"/"Don't keep a hammer near your laptop with Vista installed on it" rule.  The problem wasn't just limited to network file copies, either. Copying photos from a USB flash drive to the hard drive took so long that I could have recreated them in MS Paint, pixel by pixel, more quickly and with less frustration. Where else but in Vista will you see a dialog box with the words "0.2 of 4 Mb copied, 240 hours remaining"?  My experience with Vista was so abominable that I swore never to give Microsoft another dime of my business, walked to the Apple store, and plunked down way to much money for a Macbook Pro. OSX has its issues, some of them serious, but OSX makes Vista look like Microsoft literally implemented the "1,000,000 monkeys with 1,000,000 copies of C++ will probably turn out a well-made operating system" rule, but decided to save money by giving about 200 monkeys 3 computers and one copy of Q-BASIC.	-1
I run Windows now via boot camp on my mac computers and it runs better if that's possible.  PC's are ok too but If you buy a computer with Vista basic make it a mac if you want any kind of stability.  Thus far from using Vista on various pc's it has been a disaster in every sense, it's slow, takes forever to boot up, gets stuck taking hours to shutdown sometimes, doesn't respond to "restart/shut-down" commands, screws up programs, games, apps and accessories that just work on OSX or any other version of windows.  I only use Windows for games anyhow, my boat has long sailed from using windows for common tasks and work, I use OSX for that now with much better results, hell if mac's got as many games released for it as windows or even just my fav one's I would deleted my windows partition today.  Even for games with windows it gets hokey when it tells you you cannot run two games at the one time yet you are only running one and program manager only shows one open, or it randomly crashes or minimizes your game mid game to install the endless useless updates Microsoft throws at you.  The security in in windows compared to OSX or Linux is a joke, when you upgrade to Vista all your licences will be void for anti-virus scanners or word or anything else that came with a cd key which sucks, in some cases you have to use another licence which is bull.  This OS running on a Dell inspirion just equals crash factory, same with the XPS, and hopefully it won't kill my gf's new HP touch smart even though I warned her to get an Imac and dual boot.  Anyhow Vista sucks, get Windows 7 it's a vast improvement and actually works.  The upgrade is flawless.  Vista is pure garbage.	-1
WARNING to anyone thinking about buying this product!  Please understand that you will not be buying this product only RENTING it.  If you do not renew every year the product stops working....COMPLETELY!  I'm not just talking about updates, etc. It actually tells you that it has stopped working and it won't work unless you renew. I have just wasted more than 2 hours with Norton's online tech support.  This is the case with ALL Norton products and I am quoting the tech.	-1
I have had 6 versions of Toast,  but dealing with this Canadian based company on their now famous rebate scam is not worth the trouble!  Looks like they are using their old ploy again for some unknown reason.  Good product, too bad they play the business game so poorly.  Save the problems by not buying!	-1
Navigon has left the GPS hardware business, and so far it looks like they will not be releasing maps for FreshMaps on the schedule they promised, if at all. You will also have no technical support, and many people who purchased FreshMaps and attempted to register their purchase after Navigon shut down their GPS business have not been able to do so. I highly recommend you do not purchase this product.	-1
I love my 2100 Navigon. (Read my review on the same). I loved it so much when it got destroyed I went and bought a 2nd. Navigon. You may buy a 2nd. navigon due to various reasons - like my case, just for upgrading to newer model, vandalism (more & more happening now), etc. So here I am, with just 2 downloads from possible 12 and I try to register my FreshMaps subscription service -- REPEAT NAVIGON SAYS IT'S A SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE for my new Navigon - 2200T. Nada,zilch, zero, null. Customer service: NO, YOU NEED TO BUY NOW A NEW SUBSCRIPTION, NEW FRESH MAPS, etc. etc. I tell them - where it's written in their terms & conditions - it's not transferable. No Sir - not written, it's ASSUMED. It's our Company policy, etc. That's PURE VANILLA DECEPTIVE MARKETING and also absolutely foolish strategy. Why? I returned back my 2200T, went to Craigslist.org ; bought myself a nice USED 2100 and I continue to happily and merrily use my FreshMaps subscription!! So, ALL YOU GOOD FOLKS - remember - if you buy this you're locking yourself into Navigon's product for the lifetime of the subscription. This includes TRAFFIC, ZAGAT, everthing. I just thought all should be made aware of this limitation.	-1
I've used Macs since 2005 and PCs since 1985. I have been a heavy spreadsheet user since '85 and have many spreadsheets from various versions of office. When I bought by MB Pro 3 months ago I was led to believe that iWork is compatible with Excel spreadsheets. The fact is it opens them, edits them, and saves them in such a messed up format they are essentially corrupted.  I have spent hours fixing Excel spreadsheets corrupted by this software. Compatible - NOT  I am used to poorly written Apple software (hello Quicktime and iTunes) running on excellent hardware and have put up with it until now. I am switching to Office for Mac.	-1
I made the foolish mistake of installing the free trial for 30 days, then bought the disk to install before the trial was over.  I tried installing the software (didn't uninstall the trial first) and now the software is asking me for a serial number (note that no serial number is provided on the disk or the box).  I contacted online chat that told me it should just install.  They advised me to call Applecare between 9am and 5pm (I work during the day - duh).  I guess the chat people don't have the authority to fix this sort of problem.  So basically now I own a disk that won't install for over $70.  Not sure if I should just return it or what.	-1
I was playing around in the demo version of iWork09, and it seemed ok and according to the glowing reviews I ordered it. Mistake. Once I got into the pages program I stated to notice being told in apple support that "No, Pages won't do that". And I will list just a few things that pages does not do that Word for Mac does. I want the program to display full screen, cant do that, you have to drag and re-size the window each time, I want to set up my own labels, can't do that. I want a document that has both then envelope and letter in the same documents, can't change sections within a document. I wanted to set up my own format to display the date in a document, can't do that, you can in a table but not in a letter. You can edit the date but it gives you the same four 00/00/0000 format, or you can change the date to the time or change the date to the same date format plus add the time, who does that in a letter. Can not mix landscape and portrait pages in the same document. [...]  This is all fine for a letter to grandma, but anything complex, or even a little complex, it is useless.  Numbers is not as bad, so far, but I have not spent much time on it. I don't like the way it displays spreadsheets, I want a full page display. Not little groups of spreadsheets scattered around the desktop.  One telling problem with both these programs is looking in the preferences controls. There are almost none when compared to Word or Excel. As much as I hate Mircosoft and would have liked to migrate to an Apple product, iWork09 is not that product.	-1
iPhoto has a long ways to go before becoming a great organizer. Events seemed like a great idea when they were released in iPhoto 08 but the trouble with them is that you can't put events inside of other events. The reason this is such a problem is that after you load so many thousands of photographs there becomes to many events and it becomes cumbersome to sludge through them all.  Their solution to this problem in 08 was the add the ability to merge events together. When this happens everything becomes one large event, it doesn't maintain the groups of the events you merge together. I guess I can forgive them not totally thinking this feature though in iPhoto 08 but nearly a year and a half later they should have got this right by now. Adding events inside of events is a lot more important than even features like faces and places.  Doing a search is also limiting from the search box. You can't set multiple search criteria at a time like in the Finder or Adobe Bridge. In other words I can't say show me the files with these keywords that were taken during this time period and have this rating. I can only do one at a time. Yes I can do this with a smart folder but I would like to have option not to since I don't always want to come back to the search later.  Posting to Facebook and Flickr only gives you access to some of the features on those sites. You can't enter in all the information about the pictures from directly with in iPhoto (captions for photos, who can see the pictures, what should be the key photograph for an album etc.) Also iPhoto doesn't pull the previous albums you created back in to iPhoto so you can only view some of your albums not all of them.  If you ever have to move your information to a new hard drive down the road all the work you did to put together slide shows won't come across with the rest of the photos. I found this out the hard way as a spent a lot of time setting up manual Ken Burns effects so that they would pan from one particular area of a photograph to another. Now the only way a can access them is to boot back and forth between my old hard drive. It is a good thing I happen to have two drives in my machine or I would have to recreate them. I imagine this is what you would have to do if you had a laptop.  The recent area on the sidebar only shows the last event you look at. This is ok but I would like to see a history of the last several events I viewed. The last 12 months area doesn't organize those photos by events so you just gets this massive number of photos which isn't very convenient.	-1
I bought this for one reason and one reason only: the hope that iMovie had been fixed from the 2008 version to be more like the 2006 version. Didn't happen. iMovie is now worse than ever. Editing audio files is probably the most frustrating thing I've tried in a while. The interface is not designed well, and I found myself looking for features that used to be there (fade out video effect in conjunction with audio fade out) thinking they've got got to be there somewhere, and then finding out that they simply don't exist.  IMPORTANT: If you install iMovie 09, it will make your existing install of iMovie HD UNUSABLE. You CANNOT keep your old installation of iMovie 06HD when you install iMovie 09! This is amazingly frustrating, especially sine iMovie 09 will not open iMovie 06 video files!  I honestly think they don't want to make iMovie 09 work the way it should to force people to buy the much more expensive Final Cut, even if you don't need all of the features of a full video editing software. Working with HD video in iMovie is a joke; it lags, stutters, and crashes for no apparent reason.  iPhoto is fine, but the new features are not that impressive. The face recognition would be awesome if it worked well, but it doesn't. It wanted to group my grandmother and my sister together (I guess there is a little family resemblance there). The GPS feature is awesome if you have a GPS enabled camera, but if you have a camera that nice you're probably using a proffesional image editing software. Eventually (next 2-3 years) as consumer cameras start to have built in GPS, this feature will be valuable, so I guess you could say iPhoto is ahead of its time.  Garage Band works like it should, but there aren't any improvements that make it worth upgrading. The much flaunted lessons must be bought and downloaded, they don't come with the software. It is useful certainly, but I just don't see anything that makes me believe upgrading is worth it.  Frankly, this is just another ho-hum release. You don't need to upgrade unless you just have to have GPS photo tracking or face recognition software. If you were hoping (like me) that iMovie would be more robust, think again. It would have been very easy for Apple to include two versions of iMovie: advanced and basic. Basic would be the default setting and advanced would include the features lost from the 06 version. It could be turned on or off for the best of both worlds. Instead I have iMovie HD installed on top of iLife 09. Waste of hard drive space.  iLife 09 doesn't offer any compelling reason to update if you have iLife 08. There aren't any improvement that are not relatively minor or obscure (face recognition for example). And there is one MASSIVE disadvatage, at least for those who prefer iMovie 06: installing iMovie 09 will cause iMovie 06 to become inoperable! You have no choice in the matter, and no prompt lets you know that you are losing iMovie HD by installing iLife 09. It just happens.  Why Apple doesn't allow the user to control how many or few features are available is beyond me. I'm not saying everyone should want all the features from iMovie 06, but for those of us that do, why not make them available? This sort of 'one size fits all' approach is really frustrating.	-1
iPhoto has a long ways to go before becoming a great organizer. Events seemed like a great idea when they were released in iPhoto 08 but the trouble with them is that you can't put events inside of other events. The reason this is such a problem is that after you load so many thousands of photographs there becomes to many events and it becomes cumbersome to sludge through them all.  Their solution to this problem in 08 was the add the ability to merge events together. When this happens everything becomes one large event, it doesn't maintain the groups of the events you merge together. I guess I can forgive them not totally thinking this feature though in iPhoto 08 but nearly a year and a half later they should have got this right by now. Adding events inside of events is a lot more important than even features like faces and places.  Doing a search is also limiting from the search box. You can't set multiple search criteria at a time like in the Finder or Adobe Bridge. In other words I can't say show me the files with these keywords that were taken during this time period and have this rating. I can only do one at a time. Yes I can do this with a smart folder but I would like to have option not to since I don't always want to come back to the search later.  Posting to Facebook and Flickr only gives you access to some of the features on those sites. You can't enter in all the information about the pictures from directly with in iPhoto (captions for photos, who can see the pictures, what should be the key photograph for an album etc.) Also iPhoto doesn't pull the previous albums you created back in to iPhoto so you can only view some of your albums not all of them.  If you ever have to move your information to a new hard drive down the road all the work you did to put together slide shows won't come across with the rest of the photos. I found this out the hard way as a spent a lot of time setting up manual Ken Burns effects so that they would pan from one particular area of a photograph to another. Now the only way a can access them is to boot back and forth between my old hard drive. It is a good thing I happen to have two drives in my machine or I would have to recreate them. I imagine this is what you would have to do if you had a laptop.  The recent area on the sidebar only shows the last event you look at. This is ok but I would like to see a history of the last several events I viewed. The last 12 months area doesn't organize those photos by events so you just gets this massive number of photos which isn't very convenient.	-1
This application is nothing more than a database of recipes, with little functionality found in other programs.  I purchased this to manage my own recipes from Mastercook, after having to re-image my computer and needing to buy new software anyway (can't find that old cookbook disc!).  I did some research, and the website convinced me to give this product a try.  I tried to use this to manage my OWN recipes, not surf through a collection already existing on the software.  CONS: * Though it can import recipes from "Mastercook," the recipes must be INDIVIDUALLY exported then imported.  If you have a backup of mastercook files, this will not work; you need the mastercook software to. * There is no automatic calculating of nutrition data; it has to be manually re-entered after entering ingredients * The interface looks crude and outdated; something reminiscent of cookbooks sold for $9.99 in the 1990s.  PROS: Um....none.  I thought by spending more I'd get more. Oops, good marketing by the vendor, bad judgement from me.  Don't be fooled by the website lauding this product.	-1
Garmin needs to realize that most GPS units no longer sell for $500+. I used to update my maps every year on my modest Street Pilot C330, but it no longer makes any sense. I can sell it on eBay and pick up a new unit, with new maps, for less than what Garmin sells their map updates. $50+ for a map update might have been reasonable a few years ago, but GPS prices are a fraction of what they once were. Map update prices have pretty much stayed the same though. Very little changes in these updates each year too. Until Garmin gets realistic with their update pricing, I'll just pick up a new $100 unit every year or two, and sell the old one.	-1
I've had four previous versions of this product before online mapping sites made the pre-trip-planning portion of this software mostly obsolete.  It has had a good run.  It still offers something to those who want to plan long road-trips in legs, I guess, but even that use is fading with more compact GPS systems.  The mapping system does what it says it does, so that's fine....  What bothers me is how poorly the GPS hardware works.  Upon first installation, I was right next to a window, and it could not pick up any satellites at all and asked if I had a clear view of the sky -- well, no, and unless you're driving in a convertible....  Finally, as a passenger in a mini-van, I was able to obtain "constant-intermittent" service.  "Huh?" you might well ask.  Well, at least every mile, the hardware would lose satellite tracking, reacquire it, and then squelch out in its chirpy/brittle voice (even my old GPS has 6 smooth voice-choices for English) that it was re-routing and tell me again and again and again what the next turn is.  That became extremely annoying after about 3 minutes, as it was impossible to have a conversation in the vehicle, even when the next turn is in 51 miles.  I tried the male-to-famale USB cord they included to enhance the signal.  It's 28" long (not including the connectors).  This is just long enough to be too long to rest the receiver on your lap(top) and too short to tape it to the windshield or a window, which might actually be useful.  Another loser component.  There's no traffic notification system designed into this system, which is something even my 2-year-old Garmin has.  That feature saves me a LOT of time sitting in traffic, and I can't see going backwards to this MS offering.  Also, you can't just type in a destination while driving.  You have to set up a complete "trip" before-hand.  This is just silly.  What you must do is create and plan a "trip" to your destination from some place you recently passed, while driving (disclaimer....), from whence it will re-route your "trip," just to make the unit function using the same approach it did years ago before the GPS component was introduced.  It's almost as if the MS designers knew this was a dying breed and didn't bother to fix such obvious flaws, such as the passenger (or driver) trying to manage a laptop while driving....	-1
I have tried over the years to learn Spanish, and have probably six complete Spanish lesson packages. One of them is a VCR tape learning program. I would rather have a DVD video learning program, which is what I thought this was. But actually this is a CD/DVD that you have to use with a computer. It requires interaction with a mouse after every question. There are three vehicle CD's that can be played while driving, but again, I was looking for something that I could just load into my DVD player and watch and learn on my TV in the bedroom. My fault, not theirs for the misunderstanding I guess. See, that's what happens when you are 67 and retired.	-1
I installed DragonSpeak (10) for some computer entry.  A few weeks later I purchased this software with the idea that if it did no work I was only out a few dollars.  After installing it, Dragon speak not only stopped functioning, but would not load and now after removing the Learn to Speak software, it still will not load.  I don't care which software is to blame, just a warning that if you buy this software and use another voice recognition software, they may not be compatible.	-1
I had very high hopes for this software, as I wanted to take advantage of it for real estate purposes.  Since I am also new to the product, I was also curious about the interface, in that I didn't have any expectations based on previous versions, unlike others that have posted here.  Suffice it to say that any hopes I had were destroyed almost instantly.  This is one of the worst user interfaces I've seen in quite a while, certainly in a major product from a major publisher (and I'm a software development exec).  Virtually everything is non-standard and few things work as expected: clicks and double clicks, right/left button functionality, drag & drop, highlighting & selecting, map navigation, context menus, zooming, export & import, etc.  The iconography is just awful, awful - reminiscent of the software of a decade or more ago.  I also found the functionality outside of routing and route planning (both of which are excellent) to be more restrictive than hoped, with particular disappointment in the territory functionality, territory definitions being too limited for my uses.  Finally, the map graphics themselves just don't make the grade.  While readable, they don't display any real quality until quite closely zoomed, looking quite sketchy to that point.  The high point of the software is the routing functionality, as mentioned above.  It is powerful, flexible, and has many options I have not seen elsewhere, and which are far beyond anything available in Google Maps, Mapquest, or other web-based mapping software.  If this is your primary interest or need, this software is for you, even with the issues mentioned above.  Still, had I to break it down, I'd give MapPoint 2009 5 stars for routing, 4 for Microsoft software integration (Outlook, Excel, Access, etc.), and 1 for everything else.  Couple that with its rather steep price and I really can't give it more than 2 stars overall.  Very disappointing.	-1
In two words.... Google Earth!!! This application is slow as hell and it's not pretty. The GUI sucks and it's a nightmare to import database to be mapped in the map. No one should pay to get this application.  You can do 90% of what it claims on Google Earth and more. I am so tired of Microsoft and it trying to do everything.  Just because you have money doesn't mean you can do thing better than other people with their original ideas.  I DO NOT recommend this application.	-1
Corels customer support absolutely blows. The software does not support the raw files for my Nikon and it is impossible to get an answer out of thier automated support.  If you buy Corel Software make sure you can get your money back. I am stuck with a pile of something warm.	-1
I got this because the backup that comes with Vista Home Premium is useless, and it is ESSENTIAL to have a backup (I know from painful experience).  I installed and used True Image 11 for several months, and now have uninstalled it because the size of the incremental backup I was having it do nightly was growing by 1 - 2 Gig per nightly backup, and had vastly exceeded the total size of what was being backed up.  I don't want to have to maintain that.  In addition, I don't like have the backup file in some proprietary format that I cannot easily use or verify.  I discovered a free tool from Microsoft called SyncToy that synchronizes a set of files between 2 locations.  It doesn't compress or store things in a proprietary format - you get a mirror copy of your file set, which is just what I wanted.  It can also be set to run from the Task Scheduler.  So I use this for my nightly backup which is primarily all of the documents, photos, music, etc which is stored under my user name.  Because the backup on my other computer is an exact copy, I can easily look at those files to verify their contents.  The size never grows, and I can also make a copy to take with me and use remotely.  It was perfect and cost nothing.  One other thing I didn't like about TrueImage is that it would sometime start a process running (trueimagemonitor.exe) that would run for a long time creating tremendous disk activity, slowing everything down.  Once I uninstalled TrueImage (which wasn't easy - I had to use a 3rd party program to find and launch the uninstaller), my computer booted MUCH faster than before.  Maybe these things been fixed in the new version - or maybe not - but I'm not using this anymore.	-1
If you have any problems you will not be able to get any tech support. In fact it is highly unlikely that you will ever be able to reach anyone at Acronis. I tried repeatedly using every method possible and nothing worked. Look for another product. Definitely not recommended. The product will not work with external drives.	-1
Acronis True Image simply does not work.  Mine freezes up with every backup.  At lockup it uses 100 percent of the CPU capacity and requires a reboot.  Many people have experienced similar problems.  There have not been any updates to this program for many months.  Some people in the forums claim that Acronis has abandoned this program and that there will be no updates.  Do Not Buy this Program.  Get one that really works.	-1
I have had Acronis installed on two different computers. Backup images were created by Acronis successfully  to secondary hard drives (pata) and external usb2(pata) hard drives and backups validated by Acronis software.  In both cases Acronis gave a E000101F4 error indicating it could not find a hard drive disk when attempting to 1)actually restore and 2)to just test a Acronis boot cd.  Error was given in both cases when using a Acronis bootable cd and trying to restore from Windows XP pro via Acronis program. Latest software update version was used from Acronis. Save your cash.	-1
I have been trying to use Acronis True Image 11 Home for several weeks. It is such a good idea that I really wanted it to work but the short commings are too great a barrier. I love that F11 can restore from boot up -- and that works great. However, the daily backups fill up the allocated backup space and then Acronis stops backing up. It's supposed to trim the earlier backups but does not.  There may even be a solution to this problem from Acronis but I may never know. Support is next to nonexistant. By that I mean that I have not heard back from them about this issue for 5 days and the last time I had a support issue I did not get my question answered over a period of three weeks and 5 emails back and forth. the reason: TS does not speak English as its native language and I never was able to get them to even understand the problem. They do send back a nice cheery "Have a good day!" though.  So the software is buggy and the bugs can not be taken care of without support. I give them 2 stars for the F11 idea. Any other backup software can do the rest of what Acronis does and do it better.	-1
Please find another solution. Acronis burned my system, made a Windows restore impossible and forced me to reformat my hard drive and reinstall everything.  It started with a download from their site of a trial version of Acronis True Image v 11. It did not install cleanly, never finishing. I tried running the partially installed product and it simply didn't perform to my expectations. Oh well, just uninstall it, right? Ooops, no uninstall module in the Acronis directory. Oooops, it doesn't show up as an installed product in the Control Panel Add/Remove software module.  Well, let's try Windows restore! Oh, bummer! I can't reboot my computer without getting a blue screen of death, over and over and over and over. Nothing worked, so I've had to reformat the hard drive, repartition it, reinstall every single application I had loaded and every data file. I'm only about half way through, 11 hours later, but lesson learned: the other reviews on this site, telling you that this program is a bust are correct. Avoid this P.O.C. software at all costs. Please don't even think about trying it.	-1
The software does a decent job of backing up data and imaging disks. However, in my case, I bought it for its advertised Startup Recovery Manager which is supposed to allow you to restore your PC's system state in the event its startup files get corrupted. Unfortunately, it did not work as advertised. When I contacted tech support about this issue by email, I received the following response:  "Please note that it's not possible to restore system state backup that way. In order to restore it, you need to run Acronis True Image 11 Home in Windows Environment, then choose this backup archive from Acronis Secure Zone and proceed with restoration."  If I could start my PC in a Windows environment, I wouldn't need to restore the system state, now would I? Acronis Tech support appears to be staffed by a bunch of leftover Soviet bureaucrats who just don't get the job done.  The Secure Zone and Startup Recovery Manager flat don't work on my PC - even though Acronis says the software is compatible with Windows 2000. I spent hours testing it today. The worst news is that in a couple of instances, Startup Recovery Manager says it completed restoration of test files, when in fact, it did not. So, if you're going to rely on this product to recover your data, you'd better test it thoroughly before you actually need it.  If you just need disk imaging and data backup, this software will probably be OK. If you're looking for a comprehensive PC data recovery solution, you'll be better off looking somewhere else!	-1
Acronis used to make some great software. I've shelled out a couple of hundred bucks for their Disk Director Suite and TrueImage Backup. My PC - like many of the ones made today - uses SATA drives. SATA is the new generation of ultra-fast, huge capacity drives. Nowhere on the package or website is this mentioned: Acronis software does not support SATA drives! As soon as the software installation is completed - not during, no pre-test - after - you receive a warning that the software "has detected unsupported hard drives" - it won't do anything. The program runs, but you'll just keep receiving an error that "No HDD detected" and that's it. Since the software has been opened you can't return it.  Acronis? Lousy tech support. When they answer support emails (about  the time) it's "this will be addressed in the next version" - yes, but I paid for this version! "sorry" OK, next versions come out - version 11. Guess what? SAME PROBLEM! No support if your PC only has SATA drives!	-1
I purchased this software to have a robust ability to restore my hard drive completely (not just user data) in the case of a drive failure.  This is what the "image backup" functionality is for, to allow you to re-create a fully-operational version of your system very quickly in the event of a drive failure.  (As opposed to just a data backup, which still requires you to reinstall the operating system, programs, and all your user settings again from scratch.)  So, here's my take: 1) First, any of the positive reviews that have not actually tried to use their backups to restore should really not be given much weight.  If you can backup fine, but can't restore, what's the point? 2) I am running Windows Vista with a 1 TB drive, and this program worked fine in creating the image backup. 3) When my drive started throwing off errors, and I replaced it with a new one, I went to my Acronis boot CD to restore from my backup image (on an external drive.)  Part way through the restore wizard, the restore program just froze, for no apparent reason.  And I have been completely unable to restore my system from my backup.  Here is the experience I had with the technical support: - You should know that by default, technical support is only available via email with a 48 hr response time.  While this seems reasonable for only paying $40 for a software product, a 48-hour response time makes the product fairly meaningless in the event of a failure, as I can easily restore the operating system and programs from scrtach in less time than this (and just use the free built-in windows backup for a data restore). - I went ahead and paid an extra $30 for a single-incident "premium support", which is real-time phone support.  However, after 3 separate phone calls, each on hold for 20-30 minutes and NEVER getting a live person (I had to leave a messages), I finally received some email communications which contained solutions that made no impact to my issue. - The Tech Support emails provided new "CD images" that they wanted me to use instead of my standard boot CD.  (I'm not sure, but I doubt most folks have an extra PC and CD burner sitting around to be abe to do this, when their main PC is dead.) - Then I received an email asking me to reformat a flash drive, plug it into my dead computer, and write a batch script that would execute numerous lines of Linux command line codes.  Ok, I'm a pretty technical guy, but I'm not familiar with Linux.  And if the solution to a restore problem requires "normal everyday users" who are buying this product for easy home backup/restore to program in Linux, I would suggest this product is not the right fit for most folks.	-1
Having bought version after version of Norton Systemworks, and having become frustrated and disappointed each time, I've finally kicked the habit.  If you want better security software, buy&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Trend-Micro-pc-Cillin-Internet-Security-2007-3-User/dp/B000NKKLX8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Trend Micro pc-Cillin Internet Security 2007 - 3 User</a>&nbsp;which has significantly more features. Unlike Symantec, which sells its security products separately (Search under "Symantec" to see how many different ones you would have to buy to fully protect your computer), Trend Micro includes all of them in one program.  If, like I, you are thinking about buying Norton to clean up your registry and keep your computer running cleanly and efficiently, forget it. After years of watching my PC clog up with all the garbage generated by Windows, only to have Systemworks leave it in place, I recently bought&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/PC-Tools-Registry-Mechanic-6-0/dp/B000TMFVIK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">PC Tools Registry Mechanic 6.0</a>. It does the job cleanly, efficiently and effectively, which Systemworks does not. Highly recommended.  A useful shareware program is Super Ad Blocker. Knocks out banner ads, pop-ups and (best of all) Flash player ads.  For day-to-day disk clean-up and compacting, use the disk cleaner and defragmenter that come with Windows.	-1
I am a loyal Norton user.  I've used Norton SystemWorks (NSW) for many years, and have been consistently happy.  I'm running Vista Ultimate on a great computer (Pentium D Processor 940 at 3.2 Ghz, 4 GB RAM).  I downloaded NSW from Symantec's web site, but it won't install.  After expasperting sessions with "English as a second language" tech support, I was finally able to install the software.  After running several of the "check/fix routines" on NSW, many other programs did not work.  I had to reinstall at least five different programs.  I'm back to normal, thanks to back-ups I made on an external hard drive before installing NSW.  But, I am afraid to run the "check/fix routines" on NSW again until (or if) they fix the glitches.	-1
There are so many things wrong with Norton System Works that it's very difficult to know where to begin. But here are three:  1) ACTIVATION: The most annoying. Companies resort to this because otherwise people would be handing disks out to all their friends and family. Norton's is particularly aggravating and chances are you'll end up talking to someone at Symantec. If you get the product, install it and don't think about upgrading your computer.  2) INSTABILITY: Decide you don't like it? Removing it requires a number of reboots and manual deletion of files and folders. You'll also have to go into the registry and remove the sloppy leftovers. Yuck.  3) RESOURCES: Taxes your system's resources. Instead of buying a suite, get a defragger, get a registry cleaner, and get them without the pesky activation. These things are designed by committee. My System Works didn't even recognize my Symantec anti-virus, and it's made by the same company. Imagine that!  If you MUST have a suite, System Mechanic is probably the best.	-1
The review that has 5 stars I really wonder that is real It doesn't stay connected the whole time I would not recommend the product	-1
All the reviews are not for the product listed. Amazon needs to straighten this mess out.	-1
So far, I am not impressed. It did arrive quickly, but it does not work for us. I followed the instructions to a "T" several times on several devices and it would not connect. I started skeptical because there is no product on Amazon that has 300 reviews and every one is 5 stars. This is literally the 2nd 1-star review (and I think the other person was wise for not purchasing).  I've grown even more skeptical and plan on returning this product unless someone from Opticover is willing to help out.	-1
I looked at purchasing this Router.  However, one has to wonder where these ratings are coming from since some of the reviews, along with the questions folks have asked about the product, do not seem to have anything to do with this product. What's-up Amazon.	-1
If ths following is your idea of good product support, then by all means, purchase Turbo Tax.  While using the software, I had no idea that this limitation to Turbo Tax existed.  As for me, my next purchase will be Tax Cut.  The only provision for claiming excess railroad retirement tax on Form 1040 is for tier 1 withholding. The excess can be derived from a combination of railroad employers or in connection with a railroad and non-railroad employer. The program does properly record the excess of the tier 1 tax on line 67 Form 1040 as a credit against income taxes. It does nothing with the tier 2 excess tax. This must claimed separately, as you noted in your email, on form 843 which is not supported by the Turbo Tax software.  The software's help does contain information regarding tier 1 and 2 railroad retirement withholding. The help clearly indicates that only tier 1 may be claimed as a credit against current year income taxes. It goes on to state, "You cannot claim a refund for excess tier 2 RRTA tax on Form 1040. Instead use Form 843."	-1
I have found that after using "Turbo-Tax"  That they really have a flaw in their calculations!  Let me say one more time!  "They screwed me up"!  They allowed me to change a iteration, Without a problem!  This caused me to pay a fine for for failure to pay the Damn-Tax!  I will be contacting "Intuit" for their total dis regard of support the customer!	-1
I've used Turbotax for years with excellent results. This is the first year I had a problem and it was a huge one.  When it first calculated my tax, it added my AMT to what would have been my regular tax rather than just using the AMT.  I wound up owing $27K rather than $3K.  I reran the calculations and the second time it got the actual tax I owed correct.  It was close to being a nightmare and the time between thinking I unexpectedly owed $27K and the time I reran the software was wrought with anxiety.  Next year I try TaxCut.	-1
I just bought a new computer that runs on Vista.  Installation of TurboTax was impossible.  I kept getting the UNHANDLED EXCEPTION 0x80040707 ERROR.  I went to the TurboTax support site for help.  The information they provided did not solve the problem and the only available next step was to submit my email address.  The Quicken reply message was not helpful and only stated that they will email me when they have a solution to the problem.  Cold comfort for someone who bought the product that is supposed to be Vista compatible.  Shame on you, Quicken!  FYI...I installed it on Windows XP without any problem eventhough it did take quite a long time for the installation.  So, if you have Vista, perhaps you should find another tax prep product.	-1
If you are smart enough to use a computer and you know English, you can get the PDF forms and instructions and do this yourself. You save nothing using these programs. You still have to supply all the data and read all the instructions. It doesn't cost anything for the forms and they are already written in simple language. If you don't want to read, just go to a tax preparer and let them read to you. Seriously folks. I've used these programs before and they are actually harder than getting the forms and filling them out yourself. Not only that but these programs are buggy and make mistakes a human would not make. And e-filing is a joke. A stamp is 41 cents. And if you are getting a refund just provide the check routing info and they will direct deposit for you.	-1
While I found the software easy to use, I was quite irritated to find (at the very end) that to e-file, I would need to pay $17.95...and an ADDITIONAL $17.95 to e-file my state return!  Why on earth did I pay $40 for this software??  I downloaded a free version from the company's website last year.  The purchased version doesn't include much extra.  Now I have to print out my return and mail it in, because I'm not willing to spend a total of nearly $80 to do my taxes MYSELF!  I notice now that this fee is buried in the description above, but it certainly is something you'd have to know to look for.  It should be in giant letters right below the price!  Irritating.	-1

TurboTax is a product I love to hate.  Of course Intuit is the monopoly and TurboTax is an Intuit product.  Why did all my other Mac Address book addresses blink in and out as I typed my registration name?  Even when I wasn't typing, the field kept on blinking.  It was as though Intuit was uploading all the names in the addressbook.  Then, when I looked for the use agreement, I couldn't find it to see if I had somehow agreed to give them my addressbook names???  Moving along, the TurboTax program's wording was better but still bad, leaving customers in the dark, even if we could read. The program crashed repeatedly while trying to copy my files to CD so it really can't do that.  Other than that, it was a little faster and easier, I suppose due to more interaction with the Feds and California.  Was my return right?  I doubt it. I think Intuit is still in a bit of a conspiracy to aid the governments in exchange for their networking.  The worse part was in the end when I saw the steep prices to file online.  There, true to Intuits form, I truly felt very RIPPED OFF!!!  I wondered if its lone large competitor, Taxcut, was the same way?	-1

The help clearly indicates that only tier 1 may be claimed as a credit against current year income taxes. It goes on to state, "You cannot claim a refund for excess tier 2 RRTA tax on Form 1040. Instead use Form 843."	-1
I have been using turbo tax to file my returns for past 3 years.  This year, I went to turbo tax site to select the proper version.  The Basic version only does 1040EZ.  You own your home, then you are required to buy Deluxe version which is $44.95.  Deluxe version does not include investments, so if you are invested in stock market, now you are looking at Premier version for $74.95.  I used to get all my tax done with $20 basic version.  Now I am looking at spending $74.95.  I own my home, invested in stock market, and was able to do 2006 tax using Basic version last year. Be warned that the 2007 basic version turbo tax is useless, and you would need to get least 2007 Premier version this year if you want to itemize.	-1
If ths following is your idea of good product support, then by all means, purchase Turbo Tax.  While using the software, I had no idea that this limitation to Turbo Tax existed.  As for me, my next purchase will be Tax Cut.  The only provision for claiming excess railroad retirement tax on Form 1040 is for tier 1 withholding. The excess can be derived from a combination of railroad employers or in connection with a railroad and non-railroad employer. The program does properly record the excess of the tier 1 tax on line 67 Form 1040 as a credit against income taxes. It does nothing with the tier 2 excess tax.

Please read the UPDATE following the initial review.  1/28/08:  I'm using Turbo Tax "Premiere".  Or rather I'm trying to use it.  I figure they need to make it different year to year to justify the price, but they royally blew it this time.  Tabbing from one field to the next takes at least 30 seconds.  This is even when entering an address.  I even unplugged my internet connection as I thought Intuit was contacting the IRS or the CIA with every character I typed.  Trying to enter within the 30 second gap caused either the product or Vista to state that TurboTax was not responding only to wake up some time thereafter.  I'm guessing it's the product.  You don't know if the product has accepted your selection.  Maybe, maybe not.  I've used TT for years, gladly, but unless TurboTax (Intuit) comes out SOON with significant performance enhancements, I will not come back next year.  It is truly a painful experience.  UPDATE 1/31/08:  PLEASE READ  In my previous review, I stated that the performance of TurboTax Premier 2007 left a great deal to be desired, to say the least.  Since then, I have discovered that the root cause for the exceptionally poor performance was actually, once again, Microsoft.  The Machine Debug Manager, or MDM service, was running and is known to cause extremely poor performance.  It is some kind of debugger for Visual Studio, and runs automatically.  I went into the Task Manager, stopped the service, and disabled it.  Now, Turbo Tax performs as it always did.  I'd give it 4 stars, not 5, I'm still using it and haven't filed yet, and it still may tank (but I doubt it now).  Bill and Vista strike again.	-1
I'm mainly a Mac person. On my PC I don't own Office 2007 (I have the 2003 edition), and apparently without it many features of this software package don't work, such as background spell-checking and the thesaurus. Often I can't send e-mail, either. Frustrating!	-1
Very little change, less features (does not support animated gif's or stationary).   Outlook 2007 now uses Microsoft Word as its rendering engine for all incoming emails. In Outlook 2003 (and earlier), email with animated gif's would look great, because it uses Internet Explorer to render the emails, leaving the HTML alone. However, in Outlook 2007, Microsoft Word literally rewrites your beautiful HTML into Word-like HTML, leaving out the creative touches that used to be available until Outlook 2007.  So why buy Outlook 2007?	-1
I will be reinstalling Office 2003 after discovering that this was inferior. Kind of reminds me of another Microsoft product that has tanked recently.	-1
I bought a new LaCie External Hard Drive, and this software came with it. Quite simply, it doesn't work. I had multiple crashes, out of memory messages etc. Steer clear. I now use Syncback SE, and it works just fine.	-1
This thing was purchased so long ago, I don't really remember it working that well.  Would NOT buy again!  It probably won't work on today's computers anyway.	-1
I got this to wipe out my hard drive on my pc, but it is instead to clean the registry.  The description was not clear enough. I didn't bother to return it, but got a Mac instead, and gave away the item	-1
I am afraid to install it on my system,I have a 64 bit window 7 OS...system requirements are vista 32 bit/xp	-1
I have installed the Win Cleaner program on both XP and Vista.  When I tried to update them I was informed that I had used up my updates and that I should purchase another update.  Also, I was advised that if this was not actually true I could file for a "ticket" to fix the problem.  I went to the "WinCleaner" website, left a message, and wrote down the Ticket Number they assigned.  Then I did the One Click thing on the original program. It did improve the boot time.  So, without the update, I reduced boot time from five minutes to four minutes.  This is some improvement. Wow, 20% faster boot  time.  But it still would not update.  I used email aqain to voice my complaint.  The next day I received an email from "WinCleaner" with a hyperlink to download a new program.  I did this and rebooted my machine.  Then I ran the One Click program again.  Then, after installing the download on my three computers, it seemed to run as advertised.  ###-UPDATE-###  10/22/10  Okay, so I finally got the kinks worked out in July of 2009. But I was not quite satisfied.  I decided to install "DriveScrubber 3."  It removed much more  after running "WinCleaner."  Using the two programs together I felt reasonably well covered.  Then I made the mistake of running the program past the expiration date.  Rather than simply being cut off from further use until I renewed, it failed to notify me and instead destroyed my Registry.  Of course, "WinCleaner" no longer runs properly.  Now, each time I boot up my computer, I have to stop several programs that are all trying to run at the same time.  Of course, I could maybe fix this problem by simply buying another year of "WinClearner" use.  But I think I'll download that free program "Windows Registry Repair" before I decide.  With "DriveScrubber 3" and the free "Windows Registry Repair," I should be well enough covered.  Maybe I can get off this treadmill.  All this is sure a lot of time consuming trouble!	-1
As with most PCs, the time it takes for my computer to boot up has increased dramatically since I bought it.  Of course, I have more stuff on my desktop and more things to load into memory when the PC boots up than on a new PC.  However, the software advertises that it "accelerates slow system startups."  If anything, my system starts more slowly after I used this software than before.  Waste of money.  Don't count on it speeding up your startups if that is all you are buying it for.	-1
I FIND THIS SOFTWARE HARD TO USE.  IT IS MUCH FASTER TO DO IT BY HAND. EVERY YEAR I HAVE A ACCOUNTANT DO MY TAXES BUT I LIKE TO DO IT MY SELF FIRST. THIS PROGRAM ASK TOO MANY QUESTIONS AND REQUIRES TOO MUCH INFOMATION. THE PROGRAM ASK MANY MORE QUESTIONS THAN THE IRS	-1
Plus,  It is cheaper than Turbo Tax.  Minus,  It isn't worth as much as Turbo Tax.  Maybe if you have a very simple return it is worth the money;  but for my return (I sold some stock, and have one employer) it couldn't handle it.  After I filled every thing out, and e-filed,  I got an email the next day saying e-file wouldn't accept my tax return for an unknown reason, I had to manually check every single entry (I could have done that without a computer program).  After not finding any problems, I tried to efile again, and was told to print out and send by mail (I could have done that without a computer program too).  All-in-All, it wasted a day of my time, and was only useful for adding some of the numbers, (other numbers I had to add myself, since it didn't support one of the forms I needed, I had to down load the 500 page form from the IRS and do the calculations by hand).	-1
Okay, long time user, less and less happy last few years.  This year is the final straw.  They chagne all kinds of security settings that caused me hours of grief on things nothing to do with the actual software including installing stuff I don't need and didn't ask for.  So don't know about the others, but take a pass on this forever.  I do IT and can only imagine the hours people have burned AFTER installing this package and not realizing it was the cause of other issues.  Good luck.	-1
I generally like TaxCut and have used it before, but ... The TaxCut Federal + State has an error.  When I try to download the one state return which is included in the $34.99 price ... I'm prompted to provide my credit card information and pay *another* $29.99.  I contacted customer service and was told that they didn't have an answer and would get back to me in two business days ... which they haven't done.  So now I have a program that doesn't work, unless I pay twice.  Anyone have a similar problem?	-1
I agree with other comments about the significant price increase that H&R put forth this year. I've used TaxCut for several years now, ever since Intuit tried to put some copy protection on their similar tax product a few years back. My sense is that both TurboTax and TaxCut are neck and neck, and for most of us, neither has a significant advantage over the other. Both products, regrettably, require me to proceed through my tax return in a particular order and not jump around to partially complete different parts of my return as I retrieve information.  My return is really pretty simple and, based on the jump in prices this year, I'm thinking that it is time to revert to completing my return on the IRS forms this year and mailing them in. It's just not worth $60 for the privilege of completing my return in their step-by-step approach.	-1
If you do any programming or statistical analysis with Office, stay away from this ripoff!!!  VBA and the Analysis Toolpak are gone -- and of course, you won't find this out until AFTER you've wasted your money!!!!! Update:  Accidentally added arrows from Word 2008 to an existing Word 2004 document; now it can't be opened on any PC, and it won't print either.  Excel 2008 will not save any documents on the grounds that I don't have enough hard drive space; in fact, I have over 600 GB of space available.  ABSOLUTE GARBAGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	-1
Microsoft Office for Mac is the worst software I've ever wasted my money on. I paid like $400 for it and it barely operates. It even crashes my $3000 macbook pro almost every time I use it. And good luck ever trying to compain to Microsoft. DO NOT BUY IT! If you really want it, "aquire" it by other means.	-1
I am in the research sector, and we use Excel quite often for large volumes of data, so when this came out I was quite excited that I would finally be able to use my mac for doing some of my work...especially since there are extra cells in this version! Not the case. My files take forever to open (both large and small files). Typically the files take a good bit longer to open than the previous version (if they open at all that is)! It also gets hung-up when copying and pasting and I have had many occurrences of corruption of files. Sometimes I have no recourse but to do Ctrl-Alt-Del to restart the computer because it completely freezes. Do NOT buy this!	-1
Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac:  I previously reviewed the Home & Student Edition on my old G4 Mac Mini. I recently bought a new Intel based Mac Mini (2.0 GHz) with 4 GB of RAM, from Amazon. I also got the "full" copy of MS Office Mac. I had thought it would be a more fully featured version. But, it is NOT. For about three times the money you get MS Exchange compatibility and two LESS licenses. I really didn't fully understand this at first. Now I do. Unless you absolutely need Exchange in Entourage, there is no need to buy this version. Save the money and get the Home version.  I also need to correct some of my earlier review, which I will quote and amend below.  To start the installation process, even on the new Mini took forever. I am estimating an hour to no more updates needed. That was quite an ordeal! It really should have been one big update and reboot and done, it was not. It was over and over and over rebooting and updating. Phew!  "Entourage is the answer to Outlook. It's pretty good as a mail client and contact and appointment organizer. It also successfully synced to my Mobile Me account. It's much slicker than the Mac Mail client but you'd hope it was for a for sale product.  It is nice to have mail contacts and calendar in one program as it belongs. This is the best reason for Entourage, consolidation of the obvious. Apple insists they be separate."  Well that was earlier. Now I can't get Mobile Me (which Office continues to call .Mac, really Microsoft?) to properly sync the calendar. This is a major pain! It worked earlier and now it doesn't. I was working earlier on Tiger now I'm on Leopard, is that why? I don't know. I really wanted to use Entourage but now it's useless to me.  "Excel and Power Point are the more business oriented, apps included in Office. They function well and as expected but on a G4 a little slowly.  Excel provides spreadsheet capabilities and Powerpoint, does presentations. "  No real changes here these two operate juts fine and as they should.  "A bonus app is Microsoft Messenger. Readily available on the web, but included in this app for easy installation."  Still there and still works, but I wonder how many true Mac people will actually use this client.  Overall a very comprehensive package, but for around $300 it really is overpriced and not worth the extra cost unless you absolutely need Exchange and absolute Office compatibility.  It competes with the free open source office apps like "Open Office" and FREE is a compelling price!  It also is the standard by which other office apps are measured and keeps that lead in check. My only reservation is if you have an older Mac, PowerPC based, you will find it too slow.  Day to day operations are quite quick on the new Mini and assume even better on more powerful Macs.  I have to wonder if this version is even needed with Apple building Exchange right into the next OS??	-1
If you have used previous versions of this software suite on your Mac before, you will probably notice a lot of differences with this one. Some for the good, some for the bad.  Excel is the component most of us take issue with. Yes, you can make and open larger spreadsheets now, but in dropping the Visual Basic, our previous macros are worthless. It's still slow to open large spreadsheets as well.  It does look a bit spiffier, but I thought Microsoft had learned their lesson with Vista that making things bright and shiny with nothing really under the hood turns more people off than on.  At least you can run it on Intel Macs, and Word, Powerpoint and Entourage will get you where you need to be. Just be sure to have Word save in the good old .doc format, or you won't be able to share with older versions of Word, on PC's or Macs.  If you never have used Office for Mac before, then you probably won't miss the features they dropped, and if you just do basic stuff, not too advanced on any of the components, you'll be ok.	-1
The primary reason I switched to the mac about 8 months ago was because Microsoft produces incredibly buggy, terrible software. Unfortunately, I sometimes need to use Microsoft Office, so I got Office for the mac. Office not only sucks on the pc, it sucks on the mac too.  My primary problem today is that it does not play nice with Spaces. My Word document is constantly zooming around to difference Spaces, without my asking it to. So, about every 10 minutes, I save and close the document, then reopen it. And it's ok for a bit, then the zooming starts again. Just ridiculous.	-1

Using this program makes my iMac (core 2 duo, with default 1 gig memory) run REALLY slowly, usually making the program almost unusable. [Contrast this to iWork (a small fraction of the price, by the way) which opens much more quickly and runs super smoothly.] Office has also crashed on me a few times (I'm running Mac OS X Tiger 10.4.11. Maybe its more stable on Leopard?).  I also don't understand why people get this because they need Office compatibility. I opened a document from Word 2003, and in Pages it looked like the original, but in Word 2008 the margins were different and words showed up on different lines.  The program looks nice with its blue glass, but to tell you the truth, iWork looks more elegant and has its good looks without sacrificing intuitive use. I mean, in iWork you can have the text formatting toolbar always show, but in Office you always have to choose between one kind of toolbar set or another (in a side-window). For people used to using Office 2003 on Windows (like me), you'll actually feel less at home in Office 2008 than in other programs (like iWork or even the simple OpenOffice.org).  I have Office 2008 and iWork, and while I can highly recommend iWork, I keep the Office icons out of the Dock. I even find myself opening Word documents in Pages more often than in Word because its just more reliable and it loads the documents just fine. Save yourself the time and money, and don't get this program.	-1
Apparently Bill Gates thinks we haven't suffered enough.  Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) has been completely removed from the latest version of Office for the Mac.  Unfortunately, I found this out AFTER wasting my money on this useless new product.  DON'T BUY IT!!!!!!!	-1
Office 2008 for the Mac has been out over a year and it still is full of bugs and lacks the functionality of the version of Office for the PC!  In particular, EXCEL is far inferior as Microsoft eliminated any support for macros or Visual Basic in the Mac version.  For a home user with simple needs this is not a serious drawback.  For anyone who exchanges files in a business environment forget about this product.  It is not fully compatible and crashes often.  It will drive you crazy and let you down when you are in the middle of a project with a tight deadline.  WORD also crashes a lot and causes the loss of your work.  A message will come up saying "WORD has to close unexpectedly," and that's it.  All your work is gone.  Back in 1980 we accepted this from computers and saved our work religiously.  This is 2009 and this kind of incompetence is unacceptable.  It is nothing short of dishonesty to claim that Office for the Mac provides the same functionality as Office for the PC.  The latter is light-years ahead in terms of sophistication and stability. Don't believe any salesman who claims the two versions are equivalent.  The Mac version is primitive by comparison.  If you are thinking about using a Mac for business think again.  The only way to do that is to get the PC version of Office and run it under Boot Camp or Parallels.  Of course that means spending several hundred dollars more for the Windows OS plus Parallels.  And all this after you just paid a $1000 premium for a Mac with the same physical functionality as a top of the line PC (eg the Thinkpad).<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Microsoft-Office-2008-for-Mac/dp/B000WR2F2M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac</a>	-1
In reading the comments I find no mention of "Royalty Free".  This is down in the "You are not permitted To: " paragraph, second sentence of the first paragraph. Check the disk license.  The images on the delivered disk "Use any of the photos of clip art images for any COMMERCIAL PURPOSE".  These are not "Royalty Free". The subscription graphics are.  Most of the STUFF is  low resolution, unidentified and unidentifiable graphics. Due to this and the royalty restriction I am deleting all of the graphics on the delivered disk from my computer.  The one saving feature is the one year iClipart subscription. Lotsa good photo objects there most of which can be converted to true "photo objects" for use in home or commercial graphics (giving them an alpha channel).  I have looked at "Photos", food and drink and nature/scenic. F&D consist mostly of what appear to be cropped photos.  N/S- many are not suitable for tv graphic productions.  Loads of cartoons!! and not bad.	-1
Please note that this review refers to the 2008 Mac Home and Student Edition.  This edition is native MAC and is supposed to offer speed improvement.  However, it crashed frequently on my machine.  Not recommended.	-1

Word and Excel 2008 work reasonably well. PowerPoint 2008 has a longstanding bug that causes intolerable delays on text entry. It may be related to master slide or theme issues for presentations created on PowerPoint 2003. Performance is fine until the bug hits a presentation. There's no known way to resolve the issue.  The bug has been discussed in various settings since 2008. There has been no fix.  I don't think Microsoft is investing in this product.	-1
I have been terribly disappointed with Office for Mac 2008 since Day 1.  When I first installed it and found that the (controversial) ribbon from Office 2007 for PC wasn't there, I felt like I had been cheated somehow.  However, as I used Office for Mac more, I found that the ribbon was the least of my worries.  I have two primary criticisms...  First, Office 2008 is exceedingly slow.  I have a 3.06GHz C2D iMac with 4Gb RAM and this is, without doubt, the slowest launching program I have.  Even after multiple updates, it's still 2-3x slower than Pages on first launch.  Furthermore, while using the program, actions like autocorrection, etc take almost a full second to implement, during which time Office stops responding graphically (it's actually working, just not displaying anything until it churns through the autocorrect, after which it "speed types" in what was in the buffer).  Second, the Thesaurus is also particularly disapppointing, since it doesn't seem to be able to sense the forms of words.  Many "-ing" words show their root in the thesaurus, which you then use to find a synonym and, after inserting, you have to go back and manually change the form.  Ridiculous.  Third, there appears to be a bug (perhaps related to the autocorrect lag) where changes to a document sometimes cause a "visual corruption."  It's difficult to explain, but an example would be where a significant amount of text is changed from double-space to singe-space.  After doing so, it is entirely possible to have a "phantom" sentence on the page that disappears if you scroll up then back down.  It's almost as if Word correctly moved everything, but forgot to update the screen to show the changes.  There are several other problems that I just don't have the heart to detail here (some of them are personal frustrations with design decisions).  The bottom line, however, is that this is the first Office suite in 15 years that I have wished I could "unbuy."  There are too many "annoyances" here.  It could be that I use documents between Office 2007 on a PC and 2008 on a Mac, but shouldn't there be 100% compatibility. Perhaps the 2011 version will be better, but for the time being, this is the single most frustrating piece of software I currently have on my iMac, primarily because I know how well it works on the PC side.  I'm not one given to conspiracy theories, but I just can't help but shake the feeling that Microsoft didn't put their best and rightest on this "Mac" project. :(	-1
If Microsoft and Apple are going to force us to buy Word, can't they at least make the program work without being so damn buggy? Word's persistently bossy auto-formating and general kloodgy bugginess has been going on for years and years -- why is this still the case?? These people are making gazillions of dollars off this stuff, so why can't they get the basics right and stop driving customers batty?  Also, this version has too many bells and whistles. If you just want a simple word processing program, the rest of Word's shiny goo-gaws can be really irritating. It should be much easier for users to turn off any unwanted features -- software engineers may be in love with their own designs, but that doesn't mean the average user will be, too.	-1
I've used Office for years on PCs, but this was my first time to use  Office 2008 for Mac. I have an Intel-based iMac and this software product is slow. Compared with Apple's iWork suite of office-like programs, Office is simply snail-like. Although Office 2008 has a few more features than iWork it's not as tightly integrated among applications. Office still has the look and feel of a loose collection of programs acquired over the years by Microsoft and  called a "system." I much prefer the cheaper and more tightly integrated iWork over Office 2008 and wish I had saved my money and bought only iWork.	-1
These comments focus primarily on Word and Excel, which are the applications I use. I have a 2.2 Ghz Core Duo 2 MacBook Pro with 4 gigs of RAM, so this is a very fast computer by most measures. Keep this in mind while reading my comments.  Pros: 1. The toolbars are better integrated into the workspace. 2. The graphics look a lot better. 3. File sizes are smaller in the new native format.  Problems: 1. Resizing a window is incredibly slow and takes 100% of the available computer power. It feels like you're using a computer from years ago. edit: much better now, but still slower  2. The first launch of an office program after a restart takes a very, very long time - at least twice as long as a Office 2004 program. * edit: improved by a noticeable amount  3. You can't edit equations from the Windows document format of Office 2007. **edit this is fixed.  4. Any equations you make in Microsoft Word print fuzzy unless you reopen each one prior to printing. For a long document, this process sometimes takes me about 10 minutes just to print a document I created years ago and resaved in the new format. ** edit: this is fixed  5. Excel crashes about twice per day, even when working on new documents with just a few cells. **edit: this is fixed  6. Documents created in the new native format take much, much, much longer to open than the exact same documents in the old format. ** edit: better, but still true.  7. Compared to Office 2008, Office 2004 is amazingly fast and is much more stable. ** edit: Office 2004 is still better, but not by much  8. The overall program is buggy. Things like adjusting or removing tabs don't work correctly - generally, it only registers something after a long delay. ** edit: much improved  9. Every document I create double-spaces between paragraphs. I can turn this feature off for a given document, but I can't save a default. Every time I save the default document template, it ignores this setting for some reason. **edit this is STILL not fixed, although you can change it if you follow a very complicated procedure.  In short, this is stunningly poor software, with a new challenging annoyance around every corner I've turned. I'm continually surprised by how unresponsive and slow the software is, and compatibility with older versions of Office is fairly bad. I would recommend staying with Office 2004 or buying it instead of Office 2008.  March 24, 2008: I deleted Office 2008 from my system and reinstalled Office 2004. I'm much happier, and things work again!  March 31, 2009: I'm still not impressed with this software, but it's now acceptable.	-1
I like the nice glass look and some of the new features, but overall it is not a product I would use. I've used various versions of Office for Windows, OpenOffice.org, and Office 2004/2008 for Mac, as well as iWork 06 and iWork 08. I prefer iWork 08 the best, and while Office 2008 is pretty nice, there are some issues I have with it which keep it from being my product of choice.  *Performance: Office programs typically take a few seconds longer to open than iWork programs do. It takes up more ram and makes the whole computer run more slowly than an iWork program does.  *Cost: What is Microsoft thinking? Charging hundreds of dollars for productivity programs (depending on the version), when OpenOffice.org (however ugly-looking and special-feature-lacking it is) is free, and when iWork, a superior product, is well under a hundred dollars.  *Size: The size of all the programs and files in Office 2008 Home & Student is over 900 mb, bigger than it needs to be. iWork+iCal+Mail is less than 700 mb. And Office also has tons of visible files in the Office folder, all of which are executable and pose potential security risks.  *Compatibility: Here's a funny one. I opened a Word document I made in Office 2003 (for Windows, .doc format) in both Pages (from iWork) and Word (from Office). The formatting (paragraph size, margins, etc.) was nearly identical to the original when viewed in Pages, but when viewed in Word 2008, formatting was different! This isn't always the case, though. There was a document I made in Office 2007 (.docx) and formatting was closer to the original when viewed in Office 2008 than when viewed in Pages. But still, Microsoft made Office 2003 and Office 2008, and you'd think they would know how to keep formatting the same better than Apple.  *A bad copy. True to Microsoft's past, they just copied features found in iWork 08 and mushed them into Office 2008, only they didn't do a good job. Like 3D slide transitions really look 3D in Keynote, but they are almost a joke in Office. Or the thing in PowerPoint to help position graphics: it doesn't work with as many items as it does in Keynote. Or controlling PowerPoint with the Apple Remote doesn't work as well, and you can't start a presentation with the remote either.  *Not intuitive. Toolbars are a thing of the past, and you have to keep a side window open for formatting and such. However, if you're viewing the formatting for, say, a chart, you will have no access to basic font formatting at that time.	-1
If you do any programming or statistical analysis with Office, stay away from this ripoff!!!  VBA and the Analysis Toolpak are gone -- and of course, you won't find this out until AFTER you've wasted your money!!!!!  Here's another wonderful feature: any graphics that you created for Powerpoint slides won't work in Office 2008.  Who knows what other nightmares are hiding in this pile of crap?	-1

Microsoft Office for Mac is the worst software I've ever wasted my money on. I paid like $400 for it and it barely operates. It even crashes my $3000 macbook pro almost every time I use it. And good luck ever trying to compain to Microsoft. DO NOT BUY IT! If you really want it, "aquire" it by other means.	-1
