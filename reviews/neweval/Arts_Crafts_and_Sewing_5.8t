These sheets worked great in the printer, exactly as advertised and never got stuck or smeared at all. Very pleased!	1
I liked it	1
This vellum works great for card making and die cutting, it is not super thin. It is a better price than in stores. I recommend it	1
I used this as an overlay on my wedding invitations and it looks fantastic. The paper is a bit difficult to print on. I have a Kodak ESPC310 printer. The weight of the paper is just thin enough to be transparent and still feels like a cards stock quality. I used a paper punch and paper slicer on this with no problem.	1
very nice for the price.	1
As stitch markers go, there are better.  They're made of kinda soft gel plastic stuff.  Not smooth so it gets caught on the yarn, it just doesn't glide through a stitch if that is where you want to place it.  It's small and the "catch/latch" is hard to secure because of the size and the flexibility of the plastic.  11/20/2013 - Ran short on the Clover Lock Ring markers and had to use these. They are worse than I remembered.  Almost impossible to close, takes forever trying to get that tiny knob into an even smaller hole.  Save your money and don't buy these get the Clover lock rings instead.  In the garbage they go.  Go and buy this one:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Clover-Lock-Ring-Markers/dp/B0019KAEEC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Clover Lock Ring Markers</a>	-1
Comes in a small sturdy plastic case.  Rings are easy to use.  I really like them.  Came in different colors.	1
I am enjoying these stitch markers.  The light flexible material means they do not snag other areas of my work.  There is a bit of learning to get them opened and closed, but it's just as well that they don't come open easily.	1
These are my favorite stitch markers because they are flexible, they're sturdy, and they open and lock shut.  I can use them on both knitting and crochet, I can place them even if I'm past the spot (because they open), they don't break if I step on them because they're soft.  These are truly the best stitch markers I have.	1
Too small for any finger!	-1
It's a good product if you have large hands.  I wear a size 5 on my ring finger and this is huge on my index finger.  If I wrap vet wrap around my finger so it fits properly then it works great for keeping two working yarns seperated.  I see lots of other reviews about people using it for tension which I'm sure can be gerry rigged but that's not what this is meant for.  Wish it came in a few sizes so I could get one that fit better.	1
I have arthritis and was disappointed that it s not adjustable. So it is if no use to me cause it won't fit over any of my fingers	-1
Does not fit well on a small finger	-1
works well to keep tension even and lets knitter speed up the process	1
It's hard to say what would give a paper a 5 star rating, but I would wager that it would need to be some bit of 'Wow!' factor in either the product, or the service related to getting the product.  That having been said I give this paper a 5 as I love it, shipping was what was fast, and it has a good tooth to it. It should be noted that while it is inkjet printer compatible you will want to verify that that you are using a dye based inkjet printer, rather than pigment. The paper will not take properly to pigment based inks, but dye based inks look beautiful on this medium, and very much professional.  Also check your printer compatibility, for use with translucent, heavy, or vellum, paper before purchasing. My HP Artisan 837 will not work properly, despite any amount of trying, with this paper. However my Canon Pixma iX6520 works flawlessly with it, and produces stunning results. It can also be trimmed in a Silhouette Cameo very well.  *I have not tested this on a laser printer, and it does not feel as though it has the coating necessary to properly work with a laser printer. I would recommend using caution when testing this in a laser printer, especially before using it in a critical project.	1
I haven't used this yet for my card crafting but look forward to using it on some Valentine cards.  I think that I would stick to the plain vellum though for card making.	1
Great Vellum. Nice quality. The weight is perfect for so many different kinds of projects. I will buy it again.	1
I used it to print photos on it. Lighter photo graphs work best. Interesting effects using different colored paper behind the Vellum can be had. It worked in my HP printer and I am happy with it. I just needed about ten sheets for my project. So I have plenty when the creative bug hits again.	1
Has loops which are on opposite sides, good not to tangle different yarns, but limits use to only on index finger or pinky where not as uncomfortable with fingers brushing together (ouch that leaves a mark). Use the in store version on any finger, but it can catch the yarn.	1
I bought several boxes of these, as I loom knit and sometimes work on multiple projects.  I like that the package contains a few colors - I use the colors to help me with alternating rows/stitches/patterns.  they're easy to put on and take off.  I've even used them as row counters when I need to make something symmetrical.	1
Very impressed with this product. I was not expecting them to be as sturdy for the price. These are my new favorite stitch markers. Also kid friendly bc there are no pointy edges for kids to hurt themselves on	1
These little guys really do the work they are intended for, they mark and hold the stitches you want to see while working on a knit project, making it easy to follow a pattern.	1
great	1
These plastic rings are soft and gummy, which makes it hard to insert them in the stitches and difficult to snap closed. Boye used to make them stiffer and snappier. Why the change?!	-1
I do a lot of crocheting and use these wonderful markers with all of my projects. They go on and off easy. Love the colors. I highly recommend them.	1
When you need to count rows, these do a great job.  A pack of 35 means I don't have to move markers every single row.  I use the different colors to distinguish my rows by 3 (or 4 or 5) so I can count quickly.	1
Love these, all needle sizes fit, they're difficult to lose and the case is a blessing.  Would highly recommend and I may even have to buy another!  You can't go wrong with these.	1
Just what I needed for a welcome sign for a Wedding Shower. I didn't find it at all hard to put together. Looked at the picture.	1
I took awhile to get used to it, but once I got the idea I love it. It lets the yarn slip through& easier to crochet .	1
Thank you	1
Great Product	1
Small, lightweight and user friendly. This little spiral of wire has relied the frustration I sometimes have when crocheting.  This ring goes on easy and stays in place.  The yarn is guided and held in place, making knitting and crocheting a breeze.  No more fighting with the yarn to stay in place.  I have neuropathy {nerve damage) in my hands which lessens my sense of touch.  This purchase, tiny and inexpensive purchase is truly one of my best finds this year.  I wish I had known about these years ago.  It gets used daily and never leaves my crocheting basket.	1
I'm glad I found these.  What an awesome tool to do two stranded knitting projects.  I do wish they came a little bit bigger since I have a little arthritis in my fingers which makes them a little tighter than I'd like.  But overall, they are a great aid and Amazon has them at a great price.	1
Very good quality thread.	1
Cebelia is the best tatting thread I have used!  Smooth tatting and the stitches slide like a dream.	1
this is good yarn will by again.	1
This is a good thread, well spun and strong. I prefer the DMC cordonett, but this is good second choice.	1
Very frustrating. I don't tat very tight. This brand is the only time I've had problems with the thread breaking very easily. Nothing close to the quality of Handy Hands.	-1
perfect for painting	1
I have yet to get started using this, but, it is exactly as pictured and will work great for stranded knitting. The way it is designed , it will keep the different strands of yarn from tangling.	1
Cool gadget. Designed for multiple strands but I find it useful just keeping the yarn running over my finger rather than travelling every where else.	1
I'm disappointed with this. I've wanted one for a long time thinking it would make it easier to knit with two colors. It didn't. The ring doesn't stay put on my finger and it's not adjustable.	-1
Wobbly, not stable.	-1
Arrived safely and product was as described and in safety seal. Completely satisfied with purchase, other than took longer than expected to deliver. Order in advance if you need it for a project.	1
Arrived safely and product was as described. Completely satisfied with purchase.	1
Perfect for crocheting on a small scale.  I use a 1mm hook with this but depending on your hook you can go up or down sizes to get the result you want.  It's a shame this isn't stocked more in local stores, but this is a great place to get it.  Watch the price though, it does fluctuate quite a bit.  You can normally get the white or beige colors as a cheap add-on for Amazon Prime if you wait.	1
Great Quality	1
great for making snowflakes	1
Works with practice, wish there was a little more tension.	1
I usually use size 10 so was a little nervous about using this smaller thread, but I'm really enjoying it.  Like other cebelia threads it is smooth and uniform.	1
Good crochet thread	1
The color and size of this thread was just great and what I needed for my project .	1
great	1
I have been using this weight of crochet cotton for years to crochet lace edges onto the outside of baby receiving blankets. I was given a gift that had this touch when my first child was born and I so loved it, I taught myself to crochet.  The whole purpose, at that time, for learning to crochet was to edge receiving blankets for all my friends and family. It has become a tradition for me to give one to expectant couples to use to bring their baby home from the hospital. I am now on to my second generation - giving a blanket to someone I made one for when they were a baby.  This cotton has done a fantastic job over the years. Back when, I had to figure out how to get the lace onto the blanket on my own but today there are all sorts of books that cover the subject and many types of edges. I love the color choices available in the cotton and it makes it fun to make the blankets (which I now make, too) and have them be part of the baby's nursery theme.  This particular color is great for baby's born near Christmas or St. Patrick's Day.  I edge many things now days, including sweaters, shirts, bookmarks, Christmas stockings, and more. I have all of the colors make sure to keep them easily at hand.	1

Great	1
Easy to build. Sturdy enough for a small wood board.	1
I like these because they are a lot less trouble to use than the ones you have to peel back the paper on.	1
I do mixed media and love how smooth these pencils glide over my collages and painted surfaces. Just don't add matte medium over top because it does smudge.	1
Helps keep an even tension.	1
Saves my finger from burn when I'm on a crocheting jag.  I tried it with lighter thread it didn't work, but  I didn't think it would. Great for everything else though.  The reviews were mixed on whether or not it could be used for crocheting.  I found it works well for me if I wear it on the underside of my index finger,  I suppose you just have to experiment.	1
Thank you very much.	1
okay	1
Thank you!	1

nice	1
great product	1
I love DMC products - the cotton is so shiny and uniform, easy to work with.	1
Love, love, love this string for crocheting.	1
This knitting thimble arrived very quickly.  Takes a bit to get used too, but assists with your tension!!  Yeah!!!	1
useless.	-1
As described	1
It doesn't adjust to fit different size fingers. Making it difficult to use. I will not be using it.  Looking for an adjustable one.	-1
piece of junk just order one for a little more and save the money	-1
crochets nicely.	1
Most of my crochet projects are made with yarn.  I had not used this finer thread for some time so switching from yarn to this smaller material was a challenge at first.  After adjusting to that, I have reordered several more balls and it worked up looking very dainty and nice.  Especially easy to work with and lovely to see when doing filet crochet.  I have started another project that will require ordering another half dozen or so balls and I will do so with no hesitation about the quality of thread I will receive.  Great product.	1
I used this to hand baste a quilt prior to machine quilting and it worked beautifully.  It was easy to knot, thread, and pull through the quilt and back out again prior to sewing.  It left no marks, discolorations or little fuzzies around the thread hole.	1
I used this to create applique flowers, it worked perfectly for that purpose. I would definitely recommend this to any crocheter.	1
I have trouble keeping the yarn over my finger and spend time readjusting the yarn.  For the first five minutes of using this I thought ono, this isn't working.  I got a ball of old yarn and sat down determined.  knit knit knit till that felt comfy and then tried ribbing.  I took a few sit downs with it, and could see myself improving.  I love this thimble.  My tension is more even,  there's economy of movement, and knitting is going faster.  I am thinking of getting another one [upstairs/downstairs] but I wouldn't purchase from the same vendor,  their delivery time was way too long, unacceptable	1
Cutest thing you've ever seen and it works beautifully just like the Youtube videos show.	1
Waste of money.  It won't fit on my index finger and does nothing but tangle the yarn.  Don't waste your money.	-1
Can't get it to work. Snags the yarn	-1
This is perfect.	1
I have small hands and I couldn't get this to stay on.  The yarn would just slip through the hole and pull it off my finger.  The edge of the spring is also sharp.	-1
Another great addition to knitting bag.  Very useful for controlling tension.	1
Used this to display a party entrance sign. Great for the price.	1
Too small for my finger	-1
I love to crochet but my index finger screams at me regularly for using it to keep tension on my yarn. This knitting thimble solved the problem. I followed the advice of another reviewer and put it on my pinky, turned in slightly toward my ring finger. That keeps the yarn from slipping out. Then i run the yarn over the back of my hand and now use the back of my index finger to guide the yarn. No more freezing up the joint! I've been using it for the past hour and love it! I'll probably order another just to have as a backup and maybe a few to give as gifts to the other crocheter/knitters in my family.	1
Sturdy product at a good price.. very fast shipping.	1
I bought this kit as a gift. My friend loves cross-stitch and also loves The Last Supper. When I gave it to her, she literally cried from happiness. I'll be excited to see it once she has finished it. The package had everything included with very nice charts and color photos to follow. (Now I want one for myself.)	1
Great	1
This is a very beautiful piece. Thankful it had everything in the package needed for the project. I am doing it for a Christmas present for a very special friend.	1
Vary nice stitch pattern this will be a good one to do if you like cross stitch patterns this is a good one to try good luck to all that try it	1
Takes some getting used to. It may be a matter of technique but my yarn keeps slipping out or getting hung up.	1
Handy tool	1
Very nice item and right on time.	1
happy	1
Useless!	-1
Very good works great for what I use it for	1
I receive it with missing items to put it together and I feel I was taken by this ( junk )	-1
This item is basically a spring with two loops on it. Currently I've only used it for crocheting. I'm in the middle of a large blanket project and it's come in handy. It is very simple to use. Simply place the yarn through the two loops, stick it on your finger and begin. It has reduced finger fatigue and allows for a more even tension.	1
good	1
Cut me twice.	-1
Great little doo dad.  I use it every day	1
Didn't fit me, and awkward.	-1
I'm not crazy about this knitting thimble, but I don't think it's because of the thimble.  It just didn't work for me.  I am a continental style knitter and I also crochet.  I'm very comfortable holding my yarn and keeping tension, so I wasn't purchasing it for those reasons.  I wanted it for learning how to knit colorwork.  I was having an awful time learning to manage two colors of yarn at the same time and someone told me that this might help me.  Unfortunately, although it keeps two strands of yarn from getting mixed up, it forced me to completely alter how I maintain my yarn tension and that just wasn't working out for me.  I purchased this thimble to avoid learning how to knit with both hands, but in the end that is what I had to do.  I keep it in my knitting tool kit just in case I ever meet someone who is learning to knit or crochet and is having trouble holding their yarn.  I think it could be really helpful to someone who holds their yarn differently than I do.	-1
Without this tool I wouldn't be able to continental knit.  My trick to keeping this thimble in place is....take a pair of needle nose pliers and strech the of the spiral out just a little so that it can hook over your knuckle and that way it doesn't budge. Love this tool so much, I bought a few extra to stash.	1
This didn't fit my finger and it seemed an awkward contrivance even if it had. Perhaps I didn't give it enough time but clear instructions might have helped me through to success. Oh well!	-1
the spacing of the rings made it hard to knit with one yarn strand or the other depending on how I placed it as the rings were too far apart and on one ring the opening is near the bottom so the yarn kept almost falling out. Trying to keep tension was near impossible. It's possible it's user error but as no tips or instructions came with it I have no idea.	-1
When I am working with yarn, I am always having to relace my fingers. It's annoying to me because I like to just roll with it. This item seems to be perfect for my endeavor. The only down side I have noticed is that I need toget used to having it on my finger. As much as I crochet, that shouldn't be long!	1
Going to look great for the painters prop at the pafty def would recommend	1
Filled up 6 custom pillows, and still had plenty left over	1
Fantastic product!	1
Almost too much product for my needs.  However it worked beautifully to stuff fabric blocks created for infants to match their baby quilts.  It's easy to use.	1
love this	1
You absolutely can use this for crochet, even if you crochet left handed like i do. It takes a bit if adjustment but its doable. I will try posting an example of how i use it later	1
No directions on how to use. A waste of money without the directions for use.	-1
still have to use them but with my next project for sure thanks	1
Doesn't stay in place (too loose) and irritates my finger.  Is awkward to use.	-1
I bought two of these one for me and one for my mother. Thought it would be a good easy way to avoid the yarn rubbing our fingers. It was ok and we used it for a while but it just wasn't very comfortable and didn't flow easily. For some it will work great just depends on  what you are expecting. It was a good value for the money and if i'm using two colors of yarn at once i will break it out and use it.	1
I THOUGHT THIS COULD BE FOR CROCHETERS ALSO  TO PREVENT SCRATCHES FROM THE YARN ON THE FINGERS BUT IS NOT.. MUST ONLY BE A GUIDE FOR KNITTERS. TOO BAD THAT INFO. DO NOT SHOW ON THE SITE OR PACKAGE.	-1
I've gotten yarn calluses on my fingers and I'm hoping this will help. I don't have a problem with my tension but just the rubbing from long periods of crocheting.	1
This did not work for me. I thought I'd try to make some dense throw pillows cushier. This just made them lumpy. I never was able to fold it the way some advised and fluffing it was a disaster, did I say lumpy. Ugh. I'm sure I'll find some other use for the two bags of it I bought based on the other good reviews. I'll most likely use it under a gauze cover for a foot stool before upholstering. Too bad my kids have outgrown their stuffed animals. This would have come in handy for refilling those.	-1
Well made, just the bare essentials at an economical price.  Will use to hold materials for the Ohio's primary election.  Will post having voter ID out and ready for recording as voters wait in line to register to vote at the precinct.  An inexpensive way to put signage in place to move the registration line along on voting day.	1
It constantly got twisted with my yarn.	-1
I'm learning to do stranded knitting on a sock, and I spent the morning knitting Continental Stranded style with both strands of color wrapped around my left hand pointer finger (one strand on each side of the finger), and I had trouble with the tension.  Then I remembered I had this up in my knitting box, so I ran to get it.  I have LOVED it since I put it on.  Now, it is not the most comfortable thing - it is very firm and is not really adjustable, but it slips on and is not uncomfortable.  The benefit of it holding both strands and being able to control tension easier and keep the strands from twisting is AWESOME!!  I highly recommend this for anyone learning to knit stranded.	1
A great buy.. great Seller, the product was better than I expected	1
Not sure how to use it...no directions included	-1
I really like these they're great at holding my yarn in place and easier to crochet with	1
The amount of polyfil in this bag is huge. It is tightly compressed. I'm using it to stuff crocheted toys, and it has the perfect bounce and cush I'm looking for. I can really pack it in tight to hold a stiff shape but even then it has spring to it. Or I can pack it loosely for a more squeezable toy but it still holds it shape. It pulls part easily and does not bunch up Into hard balls once the item is stuffed. It is very soft to the touch and has no smell to it. There is so much in this bag that I may try my hand at a few crocheted throw pillows.	1
This comes with SO MUCH STUFFING. I am super impressed.	1
Good quality	1
This stuff is horrible for trying to stuff cloth dolls/animals. Do not recommend!	-1
Works fine, meets my needs. Will buy again from this vendor. Thank you.	1
You get what you pay for. Not very sturdy. Only would be usable as an indoor lightweight display.	-1
It won't fit far enough on my finger to stay there. I'm sorry I wasted my money.	-1
Love it!	1
I liked the concept. Unfortunately, I have arthritis in my index finger and the ring didn't fit over my finger. I'm not giving up, though. Thought I'd try to stretch it out over a bigger rod. I'll update after that.	1
Fast shipping and great product!	1
I was so looking forward to this item. To my disappointment, it just doesn't work for me. On either forefinger.  I put it on, run the yarn through a loop and start to knit. The darned thing immediately falls off my finger! I tried to adjust it but it wouldn't budge. I even watched a video on how to use it on YouTube. It just doesn't fit my finger.  It's too big. I wish I could figure out a way to make it taper more. I'd need a flame like metal workers use, but I don't even know an artist of that kind.  Oh well. Those of you with small fingers, be warned.	-1
I bought this to make aquarium filters.  It's perfect.  You can save yourself a lot of money and discover a lot in the DIY world.  Google DIY aquarium filters if you are interested.	1
This is THE BEST fiberfill stuffing ever.  It is silky soft, consistent in texture, stays fluffy - even when hugged enthusiastically inside a stuffed toy.  It is possible to press it in firmly, as in amigurumi crochet toys, but still remains pleasantly cushy.  I've used this brand for years, and am delighted to see it in the 3 pound bag.  ....  It's too bad the negative reviewers mention that they got the wrong sized bag (which I'm sure was or could have been replaced with the proper size by Amazon.com) instead of reviewing the product itself. This is a wonderful product, and MADE IN THE USA.	1
Nice batting and came quickly. It actually a roll but I left it in the bag and pulled out as I would break it up anyway. Is nice medium weight and worked great for my chair cushion project.	1
there is alot of stuffing in this bag.  it is so compressed it is alittle hard for me to tear out what i need.  but it is definitely work the money.	1
I hated that we had to it all together.	1
Would not buy again.  Complicated to put together and doesn't really stay up.	-1
very good for tension	1
Just what I've been looking for. Sturdy, not at all flimsy, seems well made. I'd buy it again for sure.	1
A very useful product.  It is a little large for my finger, but I am a small person with small hands.  I wish they came in a smaller size.	1
Unusual tool aimed at tension control.  Takes some getting used to.	1
Great	1
We bought this to hold a 16x20" canvas at our wedding. It held it perfectly and was at the perfect level for our guests to easily read what we had on it.	1
Very compressed....a lot of stuffing packed into a small package. A little bit goes a long way, and the compression makes it easy to store in a smaller area.	1
Exactly as described.  Good price.  Have plenty of fiberloft to last me a while for small projects.  If you're making a pin-cushion make sure to put in a ton... my pins keep falling through! ;-)	1
I know some of the reviews are saying that this is not three pounds of stuffing, but it most decidedly IS 3 lbs of stuffing!  Stuffing is tightly packed and of a very nice quality.  I am very pleased with my purchase.	1
Tons of fluff in such a small package! PERFECT for what I needed!  I don't seem to need as much to stuff the animals I make when I use this versus the brand I bought from Joann's...	1
Being a person that has done sewing for over 40years these are the only needles I will use	1
Ball point needles are a must these days with all the knit fabrics that are so popular. Great value, fast shipping, and I didn't have to drive to the store.	1
These are always sold out in the stores, and the price is great!	1
Wow, how easy this makes with you are knitting with two colors. Love.	1
Great for knitting, hold the yarn well.	1
This makes stranding SO easy!	1
To small and does not really help.  Maybe I am doing something wrong but I can't get it to work for me.	-1
This fiber-fil has a nice loft and is easy to work with. At Amazon the price was right ! I use it to make stuffed toy animals and dolls. When the dolls are stuffed it makes them soft and cuddly,then I then donate to a charity in So. Africa, for children who are victims of AIDS...thru no fault of their own!	1
I've been using this for the stuffing for a bunch of cat beds I've been making for cats in rescues awaiting their forever homes. It has worked really well and has made for some very cozy kitty beds! I've also used this while making stuffed cat toys. I sew little fabric into shapes and pouches, then add the stuffing and a bit of catnip. Cats that love catnip LOVE these toys!	1
When you receive this, do not be deceived. The stuffing is super compacted in the bag and will expand as you pull it out. The bag has a ziploc type closure at the top so the stuffing stays fresh. Delighted !	1
great	1
i was looking for something to help keep my yarns separated when doing 3 stranded color knitting and this tool helped out tremendously!  it took me a minute to figure out how to thread the yarn through each hook but i eventually found my groove and off i went!	1
This product is made in one size for all. That size is giant finger size. I could not find anyone to even give it to who could use it.	-1
Great easel! The simple design is nice and it was easy to put together.	1
Lots of stuffing in the bag!  I used this bag to fill a custom dress form I made, it definitely satisfied my needs.	1
This is a on a roll and easy to use.  Great price and versatile use.  I used to fill a sofa cushion and it has great density.	1
I love this so much that I bought one for my cousin. There are some times when it's difficult to get the thimble to stay on my finger, but I would suggest this to ALL yarn crafters!	1
This thimble is not worth your money for several reasons! It is uncomfortable and has no adjustment for the wearer. The coil is tapered so it only fits on a finger one way. I have average sized fingers and the thimble would not hold in a steady place. I had a lot of issues with the yarn not staying in the guides as I knit as well as the thimble wanting to spin on my finger. I am an experienced knitter who bought this thimble thinking that it would help me maintain gauge better when knitting a fair isle sweater. It did not!  So don't make the mistake I did in purchasing this! Learn how to do stranded knitting by another method such as two handed knitting.	-1
this is a great help for when I want to knit or crochet with 2 colors or strands of thread/yarn	1
I needed an inexpensive easel to use in my classroom. My son put the easel together for me, and he just looked at the picture and was able to quickly put it together. No tools were needed. It is perfect to put charts on while teaching. It is not made to hold any heavy objects, but for my use it is perfect!	1
I know I'll misplace this item at some point, so I plan to order at least 2 more. This has really sped up my fair isle knitting.	1
My yarn kept slipping out of the loop and the ring would not stay on my finger. There is absolutely no way to adjust the size of this either. I was so excited when I saw it but it was a waste of money and I broke the ring in the process of trying to make it smaller to fit my finger	-1
I used this on my first multi-yarn project and love it.  It is so much easier to keep the tension correct and the yarns in proper order.  I recommend this especially for a new knitter.	1
LoRan Norwegian Knitting Thimble ..fast shipping ..packaged well ..I haven't used it yet but I think it will come in handy knitting toe up 2 at a time socks on one needle ...It's a little big on my finger but I can make it work ...some ppl must have big fingers ..mine are long and small, but if I cut a finger off an old glove and slip it over my finger before I use this just might work and keep it from sliding around on my finger ...	1
would be better if adjustable to finger size and yarn weight, but principle is very good. Cuts down on friction on fingers	1
Beautiful cloth for embroidery.	1
While I did not receive all the hardware I was able to make use of all the materials to make all easels work	1
I make felt quiet books for my granddaughter and these are super for cutting the felt> Probably the best scissors for fabric that I have ever used!	1
Great price for product quality.	1
Does what it should	1
they cut very well either thick material or thin and they are very comfortable to use	1
Nice weight and very sharp!	1
Easy to put together. Sturdy enough on level ground and on rug. No issues at all with this	1
very nice	1
very sharp.  and with Fiskars lifetime warranty you cant go wrong.	1
as expected for fiskar brand scissors	1
These are very sharp and cut wonderfully. I have been using them to cut denim and they go through it like butter.	1
These are the very best needlework frames I have ever used. The first reviewer said she had problems with the knobs (not knots)  loosening, which I've also had, but I just get used to straightening it out and giving them a little twist of the knobs. They're easy to adjust and with the Velcro type addition that they added some years ago they are considerably much easier to prepare the work, but even with the old style ones, they aren't difficult. I've tried several other types and they just don't come anywhere near the ease of use and the excellent hold they keep on the work.	1
Worked Great for displaying poster boards with pictures. Thank You!	1
used for wedding now i need to sell it becase i am all done with it	1
I did not like these. They didn't cut through the fabric very well. They weren't worth returning so I'm going to keep them for crafts or just to look nice. Lol.	-1
Very good	1
I bought these for myself after my husband ruined the pair I had. Great brand,  comfortable in my hand, & I'm sure they'll last many years to come.  I bought him Left Handed scissors, a different brand tho.  The price of the Fiskars were  much less than I'd expect to see at a local store.	1
Very low cost easels.  Worked great holding up 20" x 30" cardboard backed prints.  Takes about 10 to 15 minutes to assemble.  All parts included	1
worked like it should	1
The worst thing I never used before. It is impossible to demold even using the mold releaser I had to break the mold with scissors, I hurt my hand. Is a rigid material IT IS NOT REUSABLE. I lost my money and the resin of the figures that I never could to demold	-1
Great price and quality molds. I can't wait to use them.	1
WORKS GREAT	1
Nice size for jewelry (pendants, rings etc.)	1
I've made some nice little pendants with this. The sizes are perfect.	1
Just as expected.	1
Wonderful, sturdy, awesome product! Would recommend to anyone.	1
Very sturdy material. Although, I'm not sure if the mix I bought wasn't the right one for this.	1
just what i needed	1
It died with my first try. I am not quite sure I used it correctly.	-1
Works Great	1
My only quibble with this is that the pieces come out with just a little bit of texture on the surface, so they require a finish coat of resin or varnish to get that glassy clarity, but for the price it's worth that little extra work. Heed the warnings about NEVER using sharp objects on it! I scratched one of my big ovals and it's definitely visible on the castings, though the finish coating generally makes it disappear again. I've used it both with and without mold release and the results were the same.	1
I have had nothing but problems with this mold. I use release and the resin still is VERY hard to get out of the indents. I would not buy this again or recommend it to anyone. ~A.Young	-1
Very useful shapes but not mirror bright straight out of the mold like those from Little-Windows.	1
It was flimsy and difficult to assemble.  I took them to an outdoor arts and crafts sale and the wind blew them over and they broke.	-1
Have not been able to use it yet as have had other obligations to take care of.  I am eager to get started with my painting again.	1
I ordered this for my cousin who is working on a very special project for me. She had some similar but not exactly what we needed. These were also a great price. I am happy they are doing exactly what they are meant to do, & I can't wait to see her finished project! She hasn't had any issues so far with this product, so I would recommend these molds for resin use.	1
worked extremely well! I used it for resin casting and I did not have any problems at all.	1
Great mold no problems with resin sticking.	1
good	1
Nice heavy shears that cut a variety of fabric like butter. It's nice to have good scissors that are worth sharpening instead of having the cheap plasic ones that leave blisters	1
These work very well and cut fabric and thin leather very well.	1
LOVE THE PRODUCT.  WORKS REALLY WELL!	1
I experimented with this and another product as well as just plain liquid fabric starch. The cheap half gallon of starch was preferred in ease of use, no toxicity (no need to wear gloves-safe f or kids) and low cost.  The only difference seemed to be the addition of white glue in the stiffener products which can be detected by smell which of course could be added to the plain starch. The remaining test to be done is how it holds up in high humidity and moisture which has not been tested yet. So far I was not impressed especially since I was working on multiple projects and cost was a major consideration.	-1
It's stiffy stuff.  It makes fabric stiff.  I haven't used this one yet, but the old bottle I had I used it on an angel's skirt so it would be flared out.  It worked and has held up for years.	1
These are some heavy duty scissors for fabric and other materials any crafter could use. They cut a sharp clean line and just a little energy required. Some scissors I've used in the past , you needed almost two people to operate because of the amount of pressure you needed to cut. Then they would pull the material because they were dull and jagged, that's not a worry with these . I couldn't be happier and my craft projects turned out great because of them !!!! I'm getting another pair .	1
Great fabric scissors, just need to keep the kids and husband from using them on everything but fabric.	1
top quality scissors for everyday use	1
GREAT	1
As described. good mold for resin, but mold release is a necessity. Each well is deeper than I would like.	1
like	1
Good size for pendants. Using for resin. Cheaper than the craft store.	1
Nice	1
item was as stated and delivered quickly	1
l did not like because it is a process	-1
I consider myself to be pretty good at figuring out how to put items together, but can't figure out which pieces go where on this.  I assumed it would be easy- after all, how hard can an easel be to put together?  Turns out pretty hard when the instructions are poor.	-1
My favorite pair of sewing scissors!	1
Great scissors. Sharp!	1
sharp simple cutting	1
Wow, I love these scissors, they cut so smooth and easy that I have to be careful not to over-cut my material	1
Just like the one I had in the 70's!!!	1
Great product for the best price	1
Haven't used it yet but it's exactly what I wanted.	1
arrived on time just as described	1
:)	1
Works	1
good product, takes alot of practice	1
I bought this product and used the mold release and found this to be very difficult getting the acrylic pieces out.  When they did pop out they looked very dull.  I wouldn't recommend this as its just too difficult to work with and get the pieces to pop out.  I would recommend getting a silicone mold instead.  Your pieces will come out more easily and have a much better look to them.	-1
This easel was VERY easy to assemble.  Unlike others, who found the directions difficult to understand, I had no problem, and all the parts were included.  I did need to place small screws in the legs just under either end of the tray so that it would not slide down or tilt with the weight of the canvas.  I would recommend this to anyone who paints as a hobby, or to a student.	1
Bought this for grand daughter to try her hand at painting and it was perfect . very good price. easy to put together	1
It was a very pretty design and my grand-daughter was very happy with it after I had completed the handwork.	1
I bought them to help cut boxes and they did not hold up to the job as well add I was hoping.  I was  hoping these were some bad boys. They cut, just not hopping  I was hoping to use them.	1
So helpful for all my projects!	1
I ordered this project board to help me with the more complicated knots in micro macrame, and it has helped a lot.  BUT it is almost impossible for me to get the pins to stick in far enough to hold - I'm well over 60 and my hands aren't that strong anymore.  The directions say to leave the plastic wrap on the board, and I think that contributes to the problems I have.  If you are used to a using a backing board, you probably won't have the problems I have.  I had never used one before.  I have found it a huge help with learning how to do the more intricate knots and ALL the plaiting I've tried, but it would have been ideal if the pins moved easily.  I would recommend it for learning new stuff like I do, but I don't know enough about how to use it, to recommend it for anything else.  I have found it handy enough to order another one when needed.	1
Thanks!!. Arrived as promised.	1
I made so many pendants so far with this! You NEED to get mold release with this too so the pendants pop right out of the mold.	1
Great for jewelry making. It is not silicone but it has not cracked or broke at all. Works amazing, easy to take things out of the mold.	1
These weren't quite as good as the other molds I usually get. It was a bit harder to release the shapes but overall, it's not bad.	1
New to resin crafting and LOVE it. These will be perfect sizes for jewelry that I have planned!	1
no notches in sides of board, it is a map only with a hard board underneath	-1
I love this MOLD!  The semi-rigid design makes it easy to pop out finished pieces after they have cured properly; the plastic it is constructed makes clean a quick process - a few wipes with a soap rag and a quick rinse under some hot water and you are ready to put it away or use it again.  Initially i bought this mold for resin crafting - which it works beautifully for; however I have found that other mediums I have tried (soap and polymer clay) work pretty well with this mold too, producing finished pieces with decent ease.	1
Excellelent, product, I start working with this today.	1
good.	1
just as described and fast shipping, very please with product	1
Ice resin got stuck and had to throw out. Even with the release stuff.	-1
This is an unfinished wood that you have to build yourself. The instructions are not clear on how to put it together. The part that you sit the art on is held on only by one bolt in the middle so it will swivel side to side if too much pressure is put on it. Also the legs sit too close together so it isn't very sturdy or steady. You will need to add a longer chain to make it sit better. Overall, cheap and not very well made.	-1
What's not to love about fiskars. These scissors for me is a love hate relationship, I love them I love the quality, but I do not like and hate that they  have no rubber to help with rubbing. After long periods of use with these it can cause pain but I love the job they do. So I suggest if you have any type of arthritis, carpel tunnel, or sensitive skin issues then these are not for you. If that's the case then go with  Fiskars 8 Inch Softouch Spring Action Razor Edged Scissor, I also own those and they are so easy to use. Overall wonderful buy.	1
GREAT shears for the price. Like cutting silk every time. I was a little worried that these would be a touch short for my needs (cutting canvas mostly) but the size has turned out to be very advantageous for me.	1
perfect	1
Everything went fine	1
Exactly what I was looking for, have used these for ever so long. It works perfect for macram&eacute; jewelry projects.	1
Love the large Cover handle grips	1
This 28mm rotary cutter is easy to handle and can be used to make cutting around quilting templates accurate & less difficult.	1
I really like the way it handles  and easy to change the blade. It's great for hands that has issues. I have several of Clovers' rotary cutters and wanted to get all of the cuters clovers has.	1
This cutter is a replacement for my old Dritz 28mm, which I have used for at least 20 years.  This one is more ergo, but does not have the same safety feature of the blade only being exposed when you press down on it.  At least it is more comfortable to hold onto.  I'm still looking for the other kind.  I don't want to cut my palm open as I did on the Olfa.	1
Very easy to use and just pop the items out easy-peasy.	1
good	1
Pretty nice. Durable and works great with mold release. These make relatively small jewelry pieces and I would recommend getting some sandpaper or a dremel to finish your resin creations. You will have the (maybe unavoidable) rough edges. The shapes didn't have cloudy surfaces, but they weren't glass-smooth either. I am using a mold release, so that may be why?	1
Good options for casting forms.	1
really nice product..	1
The tray is of good quality with lots of fun shapes for resin. I used it with Easy Cast resin and without prepping it with a resin release. I washed and dried the tray first then let the resin sit for about 24 hours covered to prevent dust. The pieces popped out of the mold easily and looked great!	1
Works great!  Love the grid.	1
Excelent	1
Sturdy molds but no shine on pieces!	1
Great mold, thanks!	1
This leaves your pieces with a dull finish and unless you have the time to clear coat each piece I'd choose a different one. But. It isn't a bad mold at all and yes, you will need a release agent. I used baby wipes instead and they came out perfectly.	1
easy to use, just what I ordered	1
perfect condition	1
I really enjoy using this clay. I like how it is harder then other clays. You see I've used softer clays before that are harder to shape. Plus the softer clays are really easy to leave finger prints on by accident that can ruin you work. I like to use the red clay to  make cherries, strawberries, and to mix with white clay to make pink. God bless ya.	1
This came quickly in good condition though I felt it was a bit overpriced. That's why I only gave it four stars. Also, it doesn't hold the pins securely unless you really push them deeply into the board.	1
Just what I needed!	1
Enjoy this work board!	1
Works as advertised.  Be advised - do not remove plastic wrap.  I would imagine I will have to replace the wrapping sooner or later though.	1
Great cutter.  I keep one in three locations in my qulting room, always reachable!  Couldn't do without!  Ordered delivered very fast!	1
I had become used to using a 45mm rotary cutter, but once I tried this size it is my preferred option. I am a fan of Clover products and this rotary cutter does not disappoint.	1
Great rotary cutter especially for curves and small areas.  Good grip handle.	1
Handy!	1
was the producuto I wanted and arrive on time	1
It works great.  I bought it to use with the 8x8 circle cutter.	1
Sewing essential.	1
Excellent for tight places and small patterns.	1
I love the variety of shapes with this mold. I didn't use any prep for no stick & after allowing to cure the full 24 hours they resin forms popped out easily.	1
Exactly what I wanted.	1
nice	1
these are great molds, altho it still is hard to remove some of them , because of the shape, even when the proper release agent is used. very happy with them and have used them a lot. will buy agian	1
Love the assortment of shapes and that there are two of each one.	1
If I could resin right it would be even better! But it does work well for clay and stupidly shaped ice cubes	1
This was my first experience casting resin. I used Ice Resin and mixed it exactly, per directions. Waited a day before I popped them out of this mold. After reading obsessively about why all my pieces came out matte instead of shiny, I realized it was the MOLD that caused the problem. The backs (or the tops of the pieces) are glossy and shiny, but every surface that touches the mold has a matte finish. Every piece. There's no way I'm going to buff, polish or re-coat these - I'll just get a different mold.  I will say that the pieces popped out easily, even with no mold release used. But, the matte finish my pieces had makes this mold a no-go for me.	-1
Great & a must have for making macram&eacute; jewelry. It has all the markings & guides for making jewelry and saves you sooooo much time with completing your jewelry projects!	1
It has been years since I did macram&eacute; and I made the mistake of removing the plastic wrap on this board. It is still a nice board but I wish I hadnt made this error. It still works fine and I have used it to make a couple of items. Be careful with the pins because they can easily go through the board if not used properly.	1
These are real scissors.  They are very solid, a little heavy, and feel very sturdy.  They work great.  Can't beat 'em.	1
These appear to be built to last.  When you examine them closely the obvious built in quality one's looking for in a nice pair of scissors.  I really like them.	1
BEST SCISSORS OUT THERE I HAD BEEN USING THE FISKARS GRAY HANDLED ONES THAT ARE GREAT FOR OTHER STUFF BUT BOUND UP AND WOULDNT KEEP AN EVEN CUT ON FABRIC THESE ARE A WORK HORSE	1
Great product. Not price competitively.	1
Wonderful Thanks	1
Excellent color	1
Great product.	1
:)	1
not great but good. Probably won't use much.	1
love these molds! shipped quickly, just as described. price you can't beat. I make a ton of money selling these pendants. Great buy for me! Thank you so much!	1
Another great craft tool.	1
Works exactly as advertized. I only had one of the beads in my mold that won't come out and that's probably my fault because I think I mixed that batch wrong. One tip I found from reading other review's, even with the mold release (and you definitely need to get the mold release to use this with resin), it helps if you put the mold in the freezer for a few minutes before you try to take the pieces out.	1
Well made and have used it dozens of times. Lots of good shapes.	1
Nice variety of shapes and easy resin release makes me a fan of this mold.	1
Works well no need for mold release on this mold with the first several castings but after that it needs a small amount rubbed on. This can be expected with any mold. This is a very strong plastic and should last a long time. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good durable plastic mold.	1
Nice product.	1
this is beautiful wool using it for felting and it has a natural cream color. the bag was nice and large and for what I received it was very reasonably priced. Thanks	1
Great ! Wool  is better then described. Can't wait to felt with it. A sweet little bunny comes to mind. Buying with Prime is fantastic!	1
Great board for large project.  comes wrapped with cellophane.  Great grid and has instructions of various knots to use.  Recommend	1
To be completely honest, I did not purchase this project board. It was purchased for me by my husband, using his own Amazon.com account.  This cheaply mass-produced project board could have been better presented. The board comes with a piece of paper stapled to the board and then the whole thing is shrink-wrapped. About 5 or 6 T-Pins come with the board. The pins are packaged in a small plastic bag which is also stapled to the board (on the outside of the shrink-wrap.)  There are two main problems with this sloppy presentation.  First and foremost is the shrink-wrap.  My board came with the shrink-wrap torn a bit at the top.  For that reason alone, I'm certain the plastic would not hold up under heavy use. This isn't something most people could repair at home, so, contrary to the instructions printed on the top paper, I removed the already torn plastic.  I took another reviewer's advice and used Modpodge to glue the paper to the top of the board. I used a second coat of Modpodge to seal the paper's top side for some protection and hopefully to make it last longer. This could have been done at the factory, and probably done for less than it cost for me to do the job.  The second problem I encountered (and this is before I've had a chance to use the board) is that, without the plastic to shield the user, the board is very rough.  I have a plan to fix that problem, which will also allow me to use the board from either of the two sides, if I so desire.  I plan to use Modpodge again on the under side of the board in conjunction with a medium-weight piece of drawing paper to provide a smoother bottom surface.  This same product is offered by two affiliate vendors. Combining the three pages would make for a better site presentation of the product and all reviews for this product would thus be together.  The other two pages are here: B0033LXBLI and here: B000OVHWE2	1
Very nice for holding cord in place.  I used to have one like this, but lost it somehow when I moved.	1
Just what I needed! Bug fan!	1
Great clay.  My daughter made beautiful marbled clay bowls for family and friends for Christmas.  They turned out wonderful!	1
I find Sculpey to need less conditioning than other brands. And it does stay moist. its rarely hard.	1
NICE	1
Easy to use and mold. Better than Fimo.	1
Great clay for small tiles I use to decorate wooden boxes with.  Also great for jewelry.	1
I do many projects with cut paper, cloth and other craft items.  These scissors are just what I needed!  I tend to "abuse" scissors and these are standing up quite well!	1
These scissors are quality CLOTH cutting scissors. Don't let anyone else borrow them for anything you are not watching. Everyone in the family BUT they will dull or nick them, [not on purpose] because they are sharp. They will last your life time and many of your children's life times' if they are taken care of. :)	1
Lovely sharp, heavy scissors cut through fabric like a hot knife through butter. I am delighted with them and they were shipped very quickly.	1
I remember my mother having a pair of these scissors when I was just a little girl.  I'd always use them, feeling how heavy they were in my hands.  They always made the most satisfying sound when they were cutting my construction paper, or yarn.  I purchased them, hoping the same quality would be there that I recalled from my childhood.  Indeed, it is!  Nice, heavy construction, and that same satisfying sound when they cut.  Very clean cuts, straight, and perfect.  Definitely should keep these away from the little ones if they don't know how to handle them, though.  They are extremely sharp.	1
I absolutely love this product I use this to create resin and it works great .	1
Learning to used these I read reviews and got tips on how to use these. They are nice shapes but it takes some muscle to get the molds out and I got a very good tip to freeze them once they'd set and then take them out so they don't come out tack which worked for me. I try to lea a thin bit of resen on the mold as well to be able to pick them. I'd feel if these were slightly more pliable and stronger I'd give a 5 but I feel I may need to re order or repair after a couple uses. Cleanup can be a bit of a chore as well but that is the resin's nature not this product which I will likely get again if I can.	1
I love these shapes, there are so many things I can possibly make with them that it gets me excited to great something!  Can't wait to use them all :D	1
I love the shape of these molds, the possibilities are endless, and what you put in them can make a sentimental gift, or a fun and quirky steam punk piece of jewelry.	1
This mold is just right for making resin jewelry. I haven't actually used it yet, but am planning on using it soon.	1
The mold came out easily. I use water or mold release which helped my design pendants to pop out when I flex the mold. I like using this mold.	1
not only did this board come in handy for my macrame project but also jewelry making, and works as a great lap project board as well	1
i actually like this board, however, i removed the plastic cover when i received it. then i wondered why it was such a "scratchy" board in my lap. finally i found the writing on the board that says, do not remove plastic.  it was not very noticable and i am sure i am not the first to remove the plastic. PLEASE PUT A BIG STICKER ON THE FRONT THAT SAYS DO NOT REMOVE PLASTIC.	-1
As the previous reviewer stated, I left the plastic on (It states this on the board as well.) Good size and has all the measurement sizes noted. Good size for making necklaces and rings. Great buy! Glad I found it. :) Also, it does come with pins for tacking thread.	1
I have been working with a lot more fabric and strings in my jewelry so I went looking an alternative to using a clipboard.  I was drawn to this board because of the markings for measurement as well as the other handy guides that are on it such as various knots and bead sizes.  It is a good sturdy board and one that I am looking forward to using for a few years.	1
Must have for any macramer, good for assisting in bracelet and necklace making as well. Excellent product, I do recommend.	1
Made some polymer clay furnitures for my daughter's dollhouse. Does the job!	1
Exactly the color I needed.  Perfect for my crafts.	1
This clay is easy to work with and a gorgeous hue. It does not look the same as on the screen, however, that  is due to my screen settings. This can be worked to be softened or left to harden for a short while. When baked the color still looks amazing!	1
UPDATE 9/2016  I HATE THIS STUFF, BAKED AT ALL DIFFERENT TEMPS AND DIFFERENT TIMES AND STILL THEY CRACK AND BREAK.  TRIED TO MAKE NAME TAGS FOR MY HERB GARDEN.  Very cool, making name tags for an herb garden, but finicky to bake.  Have to figure out the exact time, it states 30 minutes per 1/4" but for my oven it had to be 38 minutes otherwise it bends.	-1
I got what i expected, good quality mold, shipped quick and easy for a good price, I haven't used it yet but I'm excited to	1
This mold is easy to remove the items once the resin has hardened. I've used it many times and the molds are still the same as the first use. :)	1
They are the size and shape I wanted so I am happy with my purchase.. I have not used them yet but I am sure they will work out for what I needed them for..	1
GREAT PRODUCT	1
Perfect color for what I needed.  Smooth paint with no clumping or dry paint.  Very fresh, sealed well and arrived with no leakage.	1
good color	1
I have to say I was pleasantly surprised that while using this white paint I only needed two coats to finish what I was painting.. and I was painting over a darker color! It was absolutely perfect for what I needed and I love how it turned out! Two thumbs up from me!	1
No problems. Seems Great.	1
Great product and works really well for layering different shades of white to achieve dimension	1
Purchased this and other colors of the same brand as add on items and am very pleased with the product, price, and shipping.	1
I ordered this as I needed more black polymer clay. I am very satisfied.	1
date on package is august 9 2015 but still soft	1
:)	1
Bought for my son and it works for what he needed it for. Which was just making characters. Arrived fast and on time.	1
I like how you get so many shapes in this mold. Now if I can just get the resin to work...	1
The charm space is alittle smaller then I expected, and the molds are hard to get the cast resin out of even though I used resin release because the mold is hard plastic.  Overall a good buy.	1
These are great shapes and great sizes for earrings and other pieces. I would reccomind this to clay jewelry makers.	1
Nice clay!  It is perfect for my project!	1
Received as promised	1
As described. It's polymer clay. I bought it as an add on, so the price was okay and I didn't have to go to the craft store.	1
Nice bright color	1
My son is doing his own stop motion claymation movie and this is working great for his needs.	1
Great clay for a good price.	1
I love using this for casting resin pieces. It's very easy to remove and I always get a flawless finish when the epoxy is cured. The material seems very sturdy and this will last me for many years to come.  I have tried candy molds from Michael's and those are a good ole pain in the keister.	1
is co cute and easy to use....(*^_^*)easy to handle, good size is very practical, and I really liked the transaction was quick, it's lovely and very cute ...	1
Works great.  Follow directions on the resin mix & truly wait the full 24 hrs.  They pop out without too much trouble at all.  Quite pleased!!!	1
Actually have not tried to create in this mold as of yet.  It is a pending project for my daughter, granddaughter and I for Memorial day weekend.  I think it will be great.	1
Fun	1
Fun!	1
Soft color with a Great Price.	1
great quality clay ! this is my most recomended brand . so 4 stars for quality and great packaging with bubble wrap! one star down for the size i thought it would be a little bigger then what i got its about 2 qaurters long. i spent 4.73 on a black and a green. overall its great!	1
Grandson loves working with this clay?	1
No problems with this clay. It didn't arrive hard and crumbly.	1
Love using Sculpey with my kids. The clays blend to make new shades and colors and swirl together to make beautiful patterns. You can make millefiori like patterns (think stained glass), jewelry beads, small action figures and pretty much anything you can think of using the clay. My son has made his favorite video game characters and loves making items for friends.  The clay can be baked hard (15 minutes in an oven) as long as the piece is not too thick. It can be glazed after that to really make the colors shine but we usually skip that step. It is fairly brittle once baked hard so is not good for making items that are thin and will see a lot of wear and tear. Otherwise, a marvelous craft resource and hours of fun!	1
great clay for my handles on my crochet hooks	1
Never a problem with these.	1
I quilt many hours a day and use this size needle for most projects.  Point holds us well and last for a long time.  Do not break easiliy.	1
they came exactly like in the picture!!! great! <3	1
This clay is pliable and blends well with other colors. This is great entertainment for the young, old, and professional sculptor. Make everything from little critters, large dolls, bezels for stones, or anything a mind can conjure up. Great prices can be found on Amazon if your local craft store is too far away.	1

I love Sculpey clay. Never have any complaints. Price was good, came fast. I have no complaints and will continue to stick with Sculpey.	1
Nice to work with, it bakes nice, it comes with the instructions in the package. Easy to use. It is a tiny little square, it was kind of pricey for the size but it was nice to work with it.	1
Love the color and the way it looks after taking out of the molds for the jewelry that I make with it. :)	1
This polymer clay is a very high quality. Don't worry about the look of the old packaging, I assure you it comes brand new. I was a little skeptical of buying it because I thought it would come with the old packaging, and be very old and crumbly. But it's actually very good, and high quality. Nice color, too! Though, it's a big smaller than what I expected, it's worth the price.	1
Great polymer clay color. If is soft and you can use it for many different things and works! I higly recommend this!	1
Fun chalk pencil.	1
Perfect for the sewing enthusiast.	1
This is great! The different colors of chalk is awesome!	1
I am giving this product 1 star not because of how it functions, but because it "contains lead and other chemicals known to the State of California to cause birth defects and reproductive harm". I won't even open the package because lead exposure is nothing to mess around with. I really love the idea of the chalk cartridge because I want to use a chalkboard calendar and don't like how thick chalk lines get, but it's not worth it to expose my family to lead. I hope the company chooses to use safer materials in the future. This isn't an isolated problem; most chalk not sold for children's use most likely contains lead and cadmium.	-1
I bought 2 sets because it was less expensive than buying 1 set and a refill.  Both sets arrived, everything is perfect.	1
the chalk sticks are broken in pieces and are unuseable	-1
GREAT	1
Thanks!	1
Love this. Easy to use and vibrent colored chalk.	1
So... When it came to me every piece of it was broken. The packaging was crinkled and cracked open in several places. It came with a sharpener but SERIOUSLY how are you supposed to use it if all your pieces are broken up and won't fit in there enough to sharpen?  The way the PEN is set up, the small pieces (For the most part) won't matter as it grips it near where it's coming out, so there's that, and it's still usable, just not with a sharp tip, which is kind of what I wanted. Not worth the time and effort to send it back, but definitely don't recommend dealing with the company who ships is such a crappy way, KNOWING it is a product that will break easily... I mean COME ON it's thin chalk pieces! WTF!  Also, watch out for those colored ones.. Those are not chalk. I don't know who they thought they were fooling with that one but you can tell immediately, they are not chalk. They look and feel more like a crayon.	-1
They work great but ship terribly. By the time u get them the chalk is all broken.	-1
I bought this to use embrodery paints. This quilt turned out amazing. The fabric was excellent quality and the stamping very clear.	1
Adorable! I don't cross stitch but I use ball paint tubes and fabric markers. This turned out awsome.	1
The sticks break easily.  Hard to get the color to transfer without the chalk stick breaking	-1
I absolutely love this chalk set! I use it for my kitchen chalkboard to write recipes and lists. It's very small and thin, much better than regular chalk. And it comes with the holder!	1
Some of the cartridges were broken when I received the product. The white cartridge inside the pen device was also broken. I paid the full amount for half of the product. This is a trial purchase for me so I am glad I did not pay too much for it. I will not be ordering materials with chalk online again.	-1
great	1
Picture needs to be updated!  Also, packaged better!  All the colored chalk broken.  I'm hoping it works ok?  I bought this for the colored chalk!  Also bought another (same pen) with all white, not one piece of that was broken, hard plastic case!  FYI it was broken upon arrival!  I didn't even have to try to remove packaging without breaking - it was already well broken! Updated 02/02/17  Even using the whole pieces of white - this is so NOT worth the money or frustration of trying to use it!	-1
If you sew, this is a must have! Oh and if you have a chalk board or anything, this is also a must have! Love this! The handle is comfortable and it even has a sharpener for the chalk! Wow! And I think there's almost enough chalk included to last a lifetime!	1
I use this for quilting as well as for notes on my blackboard contact paper inside my cupboards.	1
Perfect	1
works wonders. good for anyone sewing.	1
Some fabrics make using these hard (fleece for example but that's the fabrics fault not the chalk] but on fabrics you can mark this works like a charm. Gotta nice grip and is a solid product.  The only downside is the chalk is super brittle, Mine came with 2 broken and they're easy to break. But in its defense you wanna be light handed when marking anyway so just keep that in mind.	1
I actually have a few sets of these. I love this set because it's got all the sizes I use most often. I use the Es and Fs with worsted weight to make amigurumi. The G-H-I with worsted weight for scarves and hats, the K with bulkier weights for scarves and afghans and the D and sometimes E with light worsted or fashion yarns for accessories. A lot of people prefer inline heads like the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Susan-Bates-Silvalume-Crochet-Hook-Set-in-Pouch/dp/B000XZYISM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Susan Bates Silvalume Crochet Hook Set in Pouch</a>hooks have, but I prefer the classic hook/shaft of these. It's what I learned on. The size does run a little big compared to the Susan Bates hook sizes. The light aluminum can warp if you mistreat it or drop one so it gets stepped on, but with care, these lightweight hooks will last a lifetime. The reason I have a few sets is because I work on a few projects at a time. Very colorful and smooth and easy to work with.	1
I LOVE this mechanical chalk pencil set. The grip is very nice and it makes it so much easier to put more detail into my chalkboards. I think even if I were a teacher it would be a lot easier to use on a chalkboard than just holding the chalk itself - but for art purposes it works wonders!!!	1
Great product, but does not come with the black storage case for refills. Keep the packaging to protect them.	1
A+++++++	1
I love this yarn.  It is so soft and easy to knit with.  I'm making a baby blanket out of it.  I wish Caron made bigger skeins of the variegated yarns so I didn't have to join balls so often.  The "Baby Brights" colorway isn't too bright; it's soft pastels & very pretty.	1
I purchased this to make booties for a friends baby.  They were such a hit, I had to order 2 more skeins	1
Received as described. The pink is more neon than the photo so it makes a bit brighter baby blanket than I planned. But seems to be the modern trend with neon colors so hope they, thenew parents like it.yarn is nice weight & softness for baby blanket, hat, & toy.	1
I am enjoying using these hooks.  The are smooth and very light to use.	1
Very nice hooks. Would buy this kind again.	1
If you're looking to replace some Boye hooks you owned before, I would say be sure you know what you're getting with the D-K set on this page. When I bought this set previously, the D hook was measured and printed with the size of 3.25mm, like it is everywhere. Now, maybe Boye always sold D hooks at the size that is listed now--3 point ONE TWO FIVE mm--and they're just now letting the consumer know; or maybe they actually changed the size of their D hooks to 3.125mm. Either way, it was downright disconcerting to reorder the same set I ordered before, only to discover that three hook sizes have "changed": D - from 3.25mm to 3.125mm; I - from 5.5mm to 5.25mm; and J - from 6mm to 5.75mm. Are all D, I, and J hooks really this size and we just thought they were 3.25mm, 5.5mm, and 6mm respectively? I don't know. But I just thought I should give people a heads up in case others might be unpleasantly surprised and a little bit confused by this change. You'd still do the same things you always do to get gauge for a pattern you're working, the size "changes" are negligible, and the hooks work fine. So it's not a big deal, just a little odd, I think.	1
Not such a great bargain but free shipping.great brand	1
Product did not work ... listing states "Great for making labels marking and drawing on a large assortment of materials such as textiles wood paper plastic" The chalk did not in any way live up to its claim. I submitted a return for the product the same day that I received it in the mail.	-1
love these chalk pens! great for marking more than just cloth! Hide them from you family or you won't have them anymore!	1
like all of the different colors in the pack for marking the material	1
I bought this to make a baby blanket. This is perfect with the color transitions and the feel is so nice to the touch.	1
I haven't used the yarn yet but it is very pretty and appears to be a good quality yarn.  The colors are vibrant!  I can't wait to get started on a scarf.  It will be warm  this winter.  It is just as described and I am very happy with my purchase.	1
Perfect combination of colors for an Child's Blanket I am crocheting that I wanted a lot of basic colors in.  Child is a 3 year old!  I love Caron Yarn, it has a great soft feel for Babies and Children and crochet's up with a nice lay to it.  It also is easy care for Children and Babies who end up needing to have their things washed a little more usually!	1
Love them..they are just what they are suppose to be.	1
Good price. I prefer Boye hooks over other brands because of way the hook is formed. The neck is slimmer and the "hook" more pronounced than others, which makes it easier to grab the yarn and pull it through a loop. Just a good quality product.	1
same great quality as always, just bigger.	1
The packaging SUCKS!  When I tried to prize the chalk pack out of it, most of the chalk refills broke!  Otherwise, this is a great investment for crafting, sewing, construction, etc.	1
Just as I expected.	1
Great for marking sewing lines on fabric. Removes easily.	1
great	1
Fantastic	1
This was the perfect set of chalk for hand lettering on a chalk wall. We used basically all of them before a party to hand letter and wall and during the party to let party-goers write what they pleased. It was a ton of fun and was great that everyone didn't have to use the normal bulky chalk. We will definitely be buying these again since we had so many people we used ALL of them :)	1
Love the colors.	1
Nice selection of standard crochet hooks. Well made.	1
Boye is my favorite brand of crochet hooks.  This set has good range of sizes. If u like to crochet or want to learn how then this is for you!	1
Dont buy. Use chalk instead	-1
It makes sewing so easy	1
I have been learning chalkboard lettering, and enjoying it quite a bit, but finding that doing fine lines is pretty difficult. (The instructor in the book I've been using suggests sharpening your chalk, but perhaps I have the wrong chalk, because it just wouldn't stay sharp enough.) So I ordered one of these fine chalk holders. Problem solved! This chalk doesn't wear down as quickly, and it does a great job with fine lines. It also comes with its own sharpener! I've attached a photo that shows a sign I made using this. (The fine lines use this chalk; the broad lines use other chalk.)	1
As expected Great Delivery time	1
I bought this set to write on some chalkboard labels I received. I had bought a tailor's chalk pencil from Joanns but I could not get the chalk to show up on the black label. Using this chalk set I was able to make beautiful labels for the containers in my pantry. I have not used it on fabric yet but from I have read in other reviews, the colored cartridges are not meant to be used on fabric so be careful of that.	1
I use this when sewing or doing embroidery. So much easier than the disappearing pen....that often come back with temp change!  Just dust the chalk off when done, or lightly rub with damp rag.  My new go to marking device.	1
Using them already	1
This was exactly what I was looking for, because I was looking for a good crochet hook kit. This was perfect.	1
Boye, only the best!	1
Good bang for your buck	1
I always use John James needles for hand work.  They are quality needles and do not bend easily when hand sewing, especially for quilting and applique work.	1
nice product	1
Boye hooks are the best. Bates hooks suck.	1
Great buy for hard to find sizes.	1
Really good product	1
All the common sizes needed. Smooth making the crocheting quick and easy.	1
Will buy this again when I run low	1
The chalk works great and stands out on whatever surface you draw on. I tried the white chalk out by drawing with it on  scrap piece of cotton fabric. Then I drew with the other colors on the fabric scrap. I tried removing them with a little shake and only the white chalk lines disappeared. Then I tried to wash off the other colored lines with only water and they still left faint marks on the fabric. I'd recommend using the colorful chalk for art purposes  and the white chalk for sewing.	1
I love the versatility of the colors. I worried the chalk would end up breaking a lot, but that fear was unfounded. I'm happy with the quality of this product.	1
Already have one now I won't have to keep changing the chalk.	1
This composition (not real gold) leaf is designed for FLAT surfaces and is easier to apply to such areas since each leaf comes conveniently adhered with its own wax paper backing.  All you have to do is to lay it face down on the flat surface you want to gild (after you've applied the proper leaf adhesive on the area that you are gilding), then gently rub it gently to make sure it adheres properly, let it set for a few minutes, then lift the wax paper backing off.  If there are any spots missed, simply brush adhesive on these areas and apply the gold leaf in same manner.  Much easier than the loose leaf variety and less waste -- as long as you're applying it to predominantly flat and smooth areas only (like a table top for example). Just make sure you buy the leaf size (adhesive) along with it.  Also make sure to seal it afterwards (a sealer is also available) so it does not tarnish (imitation gold leaf will tarnish quickly if not sealed).  A thin coat of shellac varnish will also work as a sealer.  Although it won't replace or match genuine gold leaf in brilliance, luster and longevity, this product can be used for interior projects that require the "look" of metallic gold at a fraction of the price.  It is also infinitely easier to handle and apply than genuine gold leaf and thus can be tailored for children's projects (supervised, of course).	1
The chalk is too brittle even when inserted in the pencil, and it is difficult to make the chalk come down	-1
I do a lot of applique, but I never realized what a difference good applique needles could make. These are very, very fine (threading them is a bit of a challenge), and just a tiny bit flexible, so that it's easier to pick up just a couple threads at a time. Highly recommended.	1
I love these needles.  Use them regularly for my hand work.	1
The best applique needles - long, smooth, and strong.	1
Good purchase.	1
these needles are so thin that the first thing I used it on bent the needle	1
a needle that is fine enough for the most delicate work. great	1
I recently had a large hand embroidery?applique project that I decided to thread all of my various needles that I had on hand so I could work without stopping. These needles won hands down for gliding through the fabric. Seriously, hands down. I had some that were more expensive that I felt like I  had to "poke"  them through while these glided like butter....	1
I use these for Chalkboard art. This works well for precise or fine details. Its not completely opaque, but its also not a marker. I use it mostly for shadowing effects. It works better than a white charcoal pencil.	1
very handy.	1
So much easier to write with although the chalk is not as vibrant as a normal stick	1
Live this chalk . It marks easily and stays sharp. Can't  really ask for much more  than that	1
Marks well on fabric.	1
Love this.  Quilting sometimes requires a pattern and this means no sharpening the pencil when I need to use of.	1
I bought these because I was missing about half of the hooks. These are a great replacement/starter set.	1
Great deal for the price.	1
This arrived promptly and was exactly what I expected.	1
Love them.	1
Great large size hooks. Have been a blessing as I crochet too tight and need larger hooks.	1
I prefer Boye Crochet Hooks because they just feel right in my hand. These were as excellent as the others I already had.	1
Very happy nice crochet hooks at a good price . Pretty colors too.	1
Love it	1
Gorgeous! I always wanted to do some metal leafing, and finally got around to it this last week, turning a plain white plastic IKEA pendant lamp into something very different. (See the photo I uploaded. The inside of the shade is copper leaf, and the outside is Rustoleum spray paint in the color "Weathered Steel.") The wax paper made the leaf easy to work with, and there was no waste. And it's just so darned pretty! I'd buy it again -- in fact, I already did buy a second package to experiment with on other projects!	1
As advertised. Quick delivery.	1
This is surprisingly good stuff.  I've put it on my Red Rubber Stamps so I could use them with a Misti.  Very efficient and reusable	1
Perfect!	1
excelent	1
I love these hooks, great deal, quick shipping.	1
Boye makes my favorite crochet hooks; I've always used the aluminum hooks. I like to have more than one in each size in case my cat feels the need to borrow one or I leave one stuck in another project. Will be buying more to replace some I purchased in another brand to try.	1
Great set for me as a beginner. Good variety of sizes, clearly marked, convenient packaging. I've now used nearly every size.	1
Just as described.  Thank you.	1
works great!	1
Great for chalk board writing too	1
The chalk is great for sketching sencils on fabric. The only negative is getting a new piece working. The chalk is very hard which has both good (doesn't break easily) & negative ( hard & needs patience to get marking).	1
Had a hard time using it.  I should have returned the chalk.	-1
Great product I love  that it has extra chalk!	1
Great	1
Boye is my favorite maker of crochet hooks.....I don't crochet everyday, but when I do I know that my Boye hooks will get the job done....Yarn glides on the hook and they are light weight and for me does not cause fatigue....Would recommend them to anyone who crochets.....	1
These are easy to use, slide easily through your fingers and the yarn, hold up well, have letter size, number, fractional  measurements, and pretty colors.	1
Great hooks for thicker yarns and looser stitching. No issues with quality and have held up to plenty of 'abuse' from a frequent crocheter.	1
These hooks are perfect. I needed several of the sizes to complete my set and these work very well. They do not snag or seperate the yarn. I am very pleased with the pouch they came in.	1
Not really gold leaf. It is hidden in the description. Buddhist monk who is expert on golf leaf did not like the product/	-1
Just what I ordered, great product	1
Tried this for large gilded  lettering on Bristol paper and it was a lot easier to handle with the backing than the loose leaf, which requires a good bit of skill. There was no wrinkling or stretching or tearing of the leaf when you apply it. It goes down nice and smooth and flat, saving time. The enclosed booklet recommends using extra thick size that has been diluted, but I got pretty good results with regular size. It will tarnish over tine if it is not sealed, but the sealer is quick and easy to apply. This is a very good price also, cheaper than retail outlets.	1
I know it's not real gold.  The color is way off.  Looks like old brass - not gold.	-1
It sticks to glass just as expected. It will be great to color for crafts. I look forward to making things with it.	1
It is hard to find these larger sizes where I live.  I've tried the plastic ones and find I don't enjoy working with them as much as the aluminum ones.  Happy with my purchase	1
They have all the hooks I will use.  I love it!  What is next?  Keep the needles coming!  I love it!	1
I used this on my acrylic stamps. Works wonderfully! My loose stamps stick perfectly to the acrylic now.	1
I purchased the clear one - cheap solution for car window sticker :)	1
We used it to put notes on our car windows. I simply wrote in permanent marker on the front, left the cling on the back. The only time it has fallen in 50+ uses is when the window was a little moist from condensation. Now we make sure it is dry and it works perfectly.	1
These work perfect on my stamping blocks	1
I've been unsatisfied with my tailor's chalk for as long as I've been sewing. It seems like I always end up using a mechanical pencil in order to have a fine line on my projects. This chalk system is great (especially with the different color options), and you can actually sharpen the tips without breaking it off (which always happens when I use the colored tailors chalk pencils).  Wish I'd known about this device a long time ago!!	1
Exactly what I needed.  Nice, fine lined chalk.	1
I bought this since I couldn't find my chalk holder from our move. It looks the same but is not the same. The chalks are more flimsy than the ones in my local fabric store and the chalk holder is crap. The holder only allows the chalk to go so far, whereas the other one I owned accepted the whole stick.  The only thing I liked about this was the sharpener. That worked great.	-1
Awesome, sturdy, chalk works great.  Works well, exactly how it was described.  I bought it initially for sewing: garments, home decor.  Then I saw some people use it for home improvement projects, which I had never thought of.  It's awesome! Recommendation for the company (if you read these): Wish they would make one in a different body color, as I'd love to have 1 that I use only for white chalk and 1 for all other colors without having to look at which is which.	1
great buy	1
Gold leafing is nice	1
I wanted to start with something easy with gold leaf. This has worked out great for me. I would buy again.	1
I bought this gold leaf along with the silver leaf. Both leaves work well on my jewelry. I use the glue pen to paint on the object first. I applied the leaf on the glue using a small brush.	1
I have used this for years and continue to like it a lot. Very easy to apply and looks great once applied	1
These are cute and functional. Not much I can say about crochet hooks other than they do what they are supposed to, which is... crochet. haha I do like them though, they are well made and serve their purpose.	1
Just what I was looking for - looking at a new project that called for a hook larger than any that I already had.	1
This is a nice set of generally used crochet hooks.  It would make a good gift for a child or even an adult friend you want to teach how to crochet.	1
Ok so I love this chalk set, i like that it came with different color chalks and has a chalk holder that works really well.  I use this all the time when Im making my patterns and with all the color chalk i always have a color that will make it easy to see on any kind of cloth and on any color cloth.	1
These don't write on felt. Not a fault of the product, just pointing out they didn't fulfill my needs. The chalk is a bit more rigid and not so 'chalky' which would probably be great for fabrics.  I read a lot of reviews before making the purchase. Be sure not to use the colored ones unless you read the package first. There are some very upset customers down in the 'one star' range.	1
I had previously had a problem with refrigerator magnets causing rust under the magnet, so when I got a new refrigerator, I applied these to the textured front of the freezer section.  The magnets still hold securely, and I don't have to worry about the rust problem.  As these don't use any adhesive, there is no problem with residue.	1
This vinyl cling is just what I wanted to add to my clear blocks for stamping..it goes on smoothly and keeps the stamps on the block versus slipping.  This package size is perfect for my blocks with purchasing an access.	1
I was always searching for individual hooks in my sewing basket.  This set is great. Nice package of all the hooks so you can always find one for the next project.	1
Great price, great hooks.  What else can you say?  I've been using these for a few months now and have no issues.  They're smooth and glide nicely.	1
Not very clingy.	-1
I used it with my cricut and it cut well. I had to play with some of the settings to ensure it cut through the material but not the backing.	1
Great for crafting	1
I found that this does not cling to the crystal blocks I use for stamping cards. My workaround is to use two-way Tombo glue to make them sticky. Won't buy again.	-1
I was working on a blue and white quilt.  Most marking pens and pencils are either blue or white, so I was pleased to find this set that contained many colors.  However, alas, it did not live up to its promise.  I had two major issues with these pencils.  1.) The color does not consistently come out of fabric.  The first time I used these, I used green and was able to wash it out.  However, I subsequently used it on a second quilt, again using green, and despite repeated washing in hot water, I was unable to get the pencil out.  In fairness, the product description does not indicate that these chalks wash out, so perhaps they are intended to be permanent.  However, I DO NOT recommend this as a temporary chalk marking tool.  2.) The chalk did not stay extended out of the cartridge.  In the course of marking a quilt, the chalk would gradually be pushed into the cartridge.  I'd be unable to pull it out again (due to not being able to get a grip on it), and I'd have to get a second piece of chalk and push it all the way out the other end of the cartridge, then reinsert it.  This process quickly became annoying and had to be done 10 or 20 times in the course of marking a crib-size quilt.  Unfortunately, it looks like I am still in search of the perfect marking tool.  No luck yet!	-1
Works well.	1
I purchased the D-K set. They are made of a solid, sturdy metal, they do not snag my yarn, they are the correct size, and the variety makes this a great bargain! It is a very good starter set, or would complement any crocheter's collection.  Amazon isn't letting me include a customer image, so here's a link to one on imageshack. The packaging varies from that in the photo, so this will show you what I got in the mail in case it matters to you. [...]	1
I've been crocheting for years and have realized that Boye crochet hooks are easier to work with.  With arthritis in my hands they are more comfortable and the hook at the end is a big smaller so it's easier to crochet with thicker yarns.	1
I have been crocheting with Boye hooks since I was 12 years old which was a long time ago. So of course I like to keep on hand several hooks in each size. This set made a fresh infusion into my stash of hooks. I prefer aluminum hooks. I have used wooden hooks and luxite hooks and they are okay but aluminum is the way to go. The acrylic hooks are pretty but tend to snap into 2 peices after a while. I have aluminum hooks I inherited from my mother; you never see an aluminum crochet hook snap into 2 pieces.	1
Awesome product.	1
Ran it through my laser printer then used the Print & Cut feature of my Silhouette Cameo cutter - only down side was having to trim it down to 8.5x11 for my printer. (To get it to register to cut with the Silhouette I added one inch squares of self-adhesive label paper to the 3 corners  that get registration marks - worked perfectly.) (The ink from my Epson never dried.) Now, it worked with my laser but I did print with plain paper to pick up any toner that may have gotten stuck somewhere it shouldn't.) (In my photo - one cling is on Clear Film and the other is on white.)	1
good product	1
Great product! Fast delivery. Thank you.	1
I have tried just about all the crochet hooks out there and prefer these to all the rest. The smoothness and curve of the head make it easier to hook and hold yarn. I find these hooks are better for beginners, and the set gives you all the sizes you'll use the most. Plus, if you're learning, sometimes it's easier to start with a larger hook and adjust your hook size down as you learn and get your tension consistent. This set gives you that flexibility at a great savings over buying them individually.	1
Boye hooks are always top quality. I use them to create custom clay crochet hooks and I've never been disappointed with boye! Order arrived quickly and was correct. I would recommend these hooks to all my friends. :)	1
This pack has the sizes I use most often.  Fair price also.  My recliner seems to eat my crochet hooks, so I have to have a few back ups on hand.  They came quickly so I could continue my project with no hesitation.	1
I've been making more items that need different size hooks and this set fit the need.  I have had only 3 crochet hooks to work with for a long time and when a pattern asked for a larger hook I purchased this set.  It had the size I need and it never hurts to have a couple extra hooks for other projects.	1
Boye is always an excellent product.  This set adds perfectly to my collection of crochet hooks and will last a lifetime.	1
Meh.... it did not cling right	-1
I purchased these scissors because of their eye-appeal. I was highly disappointed. They wouldn't cut through 2 layers of knit fabric. I just couldn't believe how useless they were. I am much happier with my mundial scissors. Don't waste your money on these if you're planning on cutting fabric. They were comfortable, but what good is that when they won't cut properly?	-1
So far so good.  They did a nice job of marking both light and dark fabrics.	1
Great	1
Arrived quickly. Good product. I use this all the time. Excellent product!	1
I love the different color variety so I can use it on different fabrics.	1
good product	1
works great for holding stamps on the MISTI	1
So... I started crochet with the cheap plastic hooks several years ago and then took a break. A few months ago I started going amigurumi (small crochet animals) crazy and then all of a sudden my hooks start breaking. So I began to hunt for something better. I tried the  Boye Aluminum Crochet Hook Set (Sizes D-K). I took them home and tried them out on a current project - the one that had the broken hook, and I had such a difficult time finding a rhythm - these hooks were not polished enough and kept catching on the yarn. I then tried the Susan Bates Silvalume Crochet Hooks in the Pouch (Sizes F-K) - same thing - they kept catching on the yarn.  I spoke to a store employee and she said that I should try wood - bamboo - both wood and plastic hooks are warmer than the aluminum and glide better. She was correct. I did like the bamboo hooks.  At this time I also bought a Tulip Etimo Crochet Hook - which, though aluminum, glided so smoothly through my yarn I was EXTREMELY pleased by it. I also tried the Clover Takumi Getaway Soft Touch Crochet Hooks Gift Set - and it too was amazing. I believe this is because the quality of the aluminum and the craftsmanship is so much better than the Boye and Susan Bates ones.  Conclusion: If you're beyond the plastic beginner stage - invest in some quality hooks.	-1
The idea is there .. but the execution is not.  The pen broke the first time we used it, and the colored chalk does not show up on our chalk "wall" in our home at all.  The white works, but nothing else.  Would not buy this again.	-1
This is not the type of quilter's chalk I've purchased in the past. Unfortunately, I'll be returning this one.	-1
I've been crocheting since I was big enough to hold a crochet hook, but let me tell you- you wouldn't know it if you saw some of the work I've done with these needles. The rounded head makes it difficult to go through stitches as well as pick them up, and it splits all but the very best yarn. And if your stitches tend to be tight; forget about it! There is no way you will be able to fit the needle back through. I vastly prefer Bates; the flatter head is much easier to use!	-1
I had a tough time with these.  The yarn slips out constantly.  I defiantly prefer the square mouth hooks.	-1
Top blade is bent, scissors do not come together properly and so it doesn't cut straight.  I was unable to return this item to amazon, not sure why.	-1
Dulled out in one week, got refund.	-1
did not work out	-1
Thought this was all colors. When it came in they were all white. Not happy	-1
Never thought I would find a cling vinyl that  doesn't stick to windows, mirrors or anything, but it just doesn't stick!	-1
I wanted to use the chock marker to help me do some quilting, I got my pattern marked on the almost finished piece and found the chock marks DO NOT COME OFF, even with water.  I was smart enough to use a color that would not be to visible, I hoping when I finish the project, the chock won't show too much.  Why didn't I listen to the other reviews daaaa	-1
I used this to seal a seam in my costume and one wash and BAM! fell apart.  It's more like hot school glue.  I wouldn't recommend this specific type of glue from this company.	-1
I did not have good luck with this glue. It did not hold.	-1
These work somewhat but leave a residue that looks like paste film.  I prefer clear glue sticks.  My crafts looked like a mess with these glue sticks.  Plus it is very stringy.	-1
fair	-1
So I loved it and thought it was brilliant....until it jammed my sewing needle and my machine had to go in for a repair.  They recommended a different product,  Pellon fusible Midweight Nonwoven Interfacing instead.  Apparently the Steam-A-Seam2 is too sticky, thick and gums up machines.  My pricey babylock is worth me being more careful.  So sadly, this Steam-A-Seasm isn't going to be used by me again.	-1
This product is advertised as something to use for applique work.  It sticks to the fabric just fine, that's not the problem.  The problem is that it sticks to your needle as well and causes huge problems with thread breaks. I made the mistake of using it on a big project and this product turned it in to a nightmare.  I'm sure it may have it's uses, but applique embroidery work isn't one of them.	-1
I made baby bibs with this item.  First time washed the thermoweb came off.  I do not recommend this product.  I bought 4 rolls and used one right away.  Lost money.	-1
I ordered two of these (one as a replacement) and both of them work terribly. The wheel is oddly tight and emits a high-pitched squeak while cutting. Not only that, but it ripped my fabric half the time and didn't cut properly. I'm sorely disappointed in this product. I expect better from Clover products.	-1
Bottle extremely small and not worth the money, I returned it. Product package was damaged and stained. Think I stick with food coloring the bottle is really small. Service and seller were fine, product returned.	-1
Misleading.  I wanted permanent fabric glue.  This stuff is temporary and washes out.	-1
Very small.  Short.  Cant use them with arthritic hands.	-1
I was disappointed with the thickness of these hooks.  They are very flimsy and bend as you are trying to use them.  I would not recommend them and I definitely wouldn't order them again.	-1
DIDDO on the first review as being horrible stuff. Too thick and worse takes forever to dry. I finally broke down and used a wet paper towel to help thin it out after putting along the seams. However it was all I had...three full brandnew bottles and no REAL original Fray Check available to revert back to. This is a wedding gift and this is so annoying. I have been waiting three hours and it still has yet to dry even after using their directions of the wet cloth routine. I can't take a chance that it'll get on the main body of the item being a gift not even the inside just the seams. BAD yucky rubbery based JUNK. Real Fray Check is a clear liquid and dries clear and is easy to put on before or after sewing the seams together. I didn't think my lining fabric was going to fray until after it was sewn and sure enough it is worse than I could imagine. It's a fancy tote bag that will hold the gifts for the bride and groom and I need to finish it by tonight. Now wasted 3 hours looks like a few more or maybe all night to dry. I put some of this on a scrap of fabric and took it down to my blow dryer to see if the dryer could help move it to dry...did not help at all. I've run out of ideas on what to try next. I even tried scraping it down with a table knife to smooth an thin any globs which it globs too. Nope the thinned areas are still WET. Liner is a polyester so that's not the problem. I love when ever I needed the fray check but it's not available in our tiny mountain rural MT town. One hundred miles to the next town big enough with fabric stores. There was a small fabric area in a convience store 15 years ago when we moved here that carried Fray Check but they  went out of business. Small population in an area three times the size of the state of Rhode Island we have less than 20,000 people. Our town is the largest at under 3,000 the other two are approx 1,000 a bit less now. So when I ran across a special on this Aleenes stop fraying I bought the three in a package deal. BIG mistake. Fray check just works...on so many levels better. Do not be fooled by the size of bottle this stuff doesn't go as far as a tiny bottle of liquid not gummy gloppy Aleenes. Run don't walk away from this one sewers.	-1
For a product that advertises itself as being for fabric and trim, this stuff is awful. It is very thick, like thick white glue. You certainly can't just run a thin drizzle from the bottle to the fabric edge; that would be a mess. I squeezed out a blob on a scrap of paper then dipped my finger in it to wipe a very thin film on the edge of the cut fabric. As far as stopping fraying, this stuff DOES work. But it leaves a sticky, raised, ridge, even when applied in a thin film the way I did. For some purposed this may not matter, in which case this would be an acceptable product. But most people don't want that sticky edge on their projects! I've used this for tissue lame (very thin fabric) as well as the cut edges of grosgrain ribbon (fairly heavy fabric) and have had similar experiences with both types of fabric. I will go back to the Dritz Fray-Check which goes on clear, absorbs into fabric, leaves no sticky feel, and can be applied straight from the bottle.	-1
Not very sharp scissors.	-1
Nice and sharp but did not work well as appliqu scissors. The are very thick and could not lay across the fabric well. Also the scissors were very stiff when I first received them. They have now loosened up after a month.	-1
Again - not very high quality plastic.  The hooks don't slide very well and make a squeeking sound when you crochet.  I will stick to aluminum hooks going forward.	-1
Dull very quickly.  I really don't know how one will go about sharpening these.	-1
Disappointed in these. Remind of children's scissors. I don't use mine at all.	-1
No matter what material I attached it to, it would come loose again at the slightest tug. Maybe there are just a lot of bad rolls out there and I was one of the lucky people who got one, but the adhesive was way too weak. "Temporary" should mean at least a day, not twenty seconds. Also, the wax paper was extremely difficult to remove, especially when already attached to the fabric as instructed.	-1
Reading the reviews I'm certain no real seamstress owns these. It's impossible. These are by far the worst pair of scissors I own. Once you are used to a amazing brand like Gingher, there is clearly no going back. Don't get me wrong I have a few pairs of larger fiskars scissors. They are NOT great but they work. I use them for certain tasks I would never use my stainless steel ones for like cutting elastics and patter pieces. But these 4" are the dullest scissors I have ever seen. They are also flimsy and not of good weight or material. They are metal but feel like the weight of plastic. The blades are so dull you can almost hear them rubbing each other with every cut they make. They actually would not cut thread that's how bad they are. Scissors have one job and one job only and that's to cut. So when scissors cannot accomplish the one task they are created to do, they are junk. 1 star because I couldn't give them any less. This is totally my fault for wanting to save some money. I won't make that mistake again. Do yourself a favor. Don't second guess name brand sheers prices. Buy them and be for ever grateful you did. You will save yourself time and materials in the long run.	-1
it doesn't say anywhere on the description that the bonding is non-permanent as written on the packaging, that should be known before buying	-1
Rather annoyed they advertise that the picture is printed on the canvas itself it is not you have to go by the printed picture on paper this is not cheap. Unless you are very artistic and crafty I would advise you not to got this. I can do it but it's much more difficult because you have to do it by pattern on paper and not on the canvas. I bought this for my momI79 who has vision problems thinking that this is going to work and give her something to do she used to do this when she was younger but the picture was on the canvas itself this said it was it is not making it much more difficult.	-1
It didn't have any pattern to follow like there was supposed to be or i wouldnt have ordered it. It was not explained to me.	-1
Was returned, picture was not on the fabric.	-1
Totally disappointed in this product.  As I got 3/4 of the way finished, I realized I didn't have enough of FOUR colors to finish the project.  I used some extra yarn from another rug (different shades) but still didn't have enough.  So here it sits, unfinished.  So disappointed.	-1
This was a hot broken up mess when it arrived... all but 4 were broken. I do have to say the variety of color is nice a I just think tgey need better packaging of the product.	-1
While these are inexpensive andcomenwoth a large quantity, I won't purchase them again. Though there are many colors, most of them are strange and it lacks some of the most basic ones.  The reds and browns are particularly bad. I make miniatures out of polymer clay as a hobby to sell, I bought these thinking they were a great deal, but they're really not.  Might be good for kids, or someone who wants to experiment with random colors. But for me, for what I need them for, they sorely disappoint.	-1
Had to return it as it was way to complex for a 9 year old. Didn,t imprint the figure on the mat.	-1
Wasn't sure what to expect. Then I opened it up and was annoyed. 1) The colored thread was not attached to the card with correlating # or color name??? I guess the supplier wanted to test your color blindness. I attached a pic of how stupid this was packaged. Thread came all bundled up in a bag and the card it's supposed to be attached to was outside the thread bag and blank...WHAT?! Also they are missing one of the red colors in the bundle.  2) The felt backing instructions are clearly on the instructions so not sure what the other review was about. >firstly the instructions ask for you to add foam which is not included in the kit so it's incomplete. *Double check their outline is big enough for the pattern before you do anything.  3) Kit is cheap with the Aida fabric. I'm hoping it's enough. They don't provide room for mistakes.  4) They don't include any needles to use.  Don't buy this. So not worth it.	-1
As others have said, it's nearly impossible to tell the two blues apart. I can't. Some people are saying the paint on the canvass is chipping. Mine had NONE!! It is the worst kit I've ever bought.	-1
I expected a pre printed canvas. There was no information that this was not pre printed.	-1
Very disappointed.  This kit is meant for intermediate latch hookers, not beginners.  It does not specify in the description that it is not for beginners.  Therefore I was fooled and bought it, finding it way to hard for my eleven year old granddaughter	-1
No where in the description was it indicated this was an intermediate project.  Please beware if you are buying this for someone inexperienced in making a latch hook rug this is not the kit to boy.	-1
They need to update their picture - it is misleading and false advertising. These paints are of extremely poor quality. I wasn't expecting an extremely high quality paint as these are considered student grade and they are not expensive. But they are Loew Cornell which used to be a good trustworthy brand.  However these are not even student grade paints. When they started having them made in China it seems they did not care about the quality, or the content. I would not let a child use these as who knows what was used to make them. They are modeled, like whatever they made them with did not get thoroughly mixed or they just don't put enough pigment in them. The white is not white as it has flecks of other color in it and so it is all tinged dull off white - and the rest of the colors are rather dull and definitely not intense as the picture shows. How can I trust a company that obviously does not care about producing the same product that gave them their good name many years ago. Shame on you you Amazon, I am surprised - when I read through the comments (AFTER I purchased them - shame on me) you have been made well aware of this some time ago - yet you continue to mislead your shoppers. I own many different brands and qualities of paint - these should have been fine for a craft type project - they are not even ok for that. The case is a bit warped and very hard to open and close, it is scratched and has marks that will not come off by cleaning it. This seems like a lot to write for such an inexpensive set of paints but I really dislike it when I now have to quickly find a replacement because the seller and or Amazon was not truthful in their presentation. Bait and switch always ticks me off.	-1
The picture (or the product I received) is off.  What I received was simply an off white string/yarn - no color variation at all (unlike the picture).  Had I known that this is what I would get I would have ordered something else.	-1
Not much yarn with this product !!  Used to be you got so much for a couple dollars...........I would need 25 or more of these for just one blanket !	-1
Color is far more pink than this photo shows. Returned and the search continues for the right color	-1
Colors mix well but are VERY chalky. The mixing pots on the lid are nice. I don't recommend these if you are serious about painting (even if you're just starting out like me). The paint dries extremely chalky (will even flake off if too heavy) and just doesn't adhere to the paper well during the process of painting. Might be nice gift for a little kid... but I wouldn't spend more than $4 on it.	-1
This is more like a heavy string than yarn.	-1
Arrived in very poor condition. The plastic casing was damaged, and several of the little cakes of color were cracked, some cracked in 2 pieces, others completely shattered. I might have been able to accept this if the paints were at least decent quality, but they're not. The colors are very chalky. Not at all what I was hoping for, but I suppose you get what you pay for. My opinion: don't waste your time with this palette.	-1
yarn was a tangled mess, couldn't use it. I have worked with this before and not had a problem so I think it was just a bad skein.	-1
Got these as an experimental cheap substitute for gouaches. No go. Gave them to the kids	-1
Too expensive.	-1
Helpful little gadget	-1
I honestly thought when you stated kit.  It would be a kit of items, that is the only reason 2 was purchased.	-1
I think I have normal sized thumbs.....but these wouldn't fit by a long shot. However, they fit my 2.5 year old just fine.	-1
If I had to do it over, I would not have purchased this item.  It just is not an effective tool in my studio.  It is not big enough and the markings are not ones that I use.	-1
Very thin.	-1
This fabric marker did not pass the washing machine test. Upon getting the t-shirts I made with my preschool class out of the wash, the marker had seperated colors and the black line was surrounded by a yellow border on each shirt. Although it didn't ruin what we made, it did look weird and what not what I paid for. I probably won't order this brand again.	-1
I bought this item thinking it might help with hemming items.  It has too many rulers on it which makes it confusing to me and it is not my first choice when looking for a hemming ruler.  Other sewers might find it handy. . .not for me!  I will probably resell it at a garage sale.	-1
I love Sugar'n Cream Yarn but save yourself some money, get it at WalMart for $1.77	-1
These brushes are terrible for watercolor or any painting. They shed terribly and have no body to them at all! I purchased them at Joanns not Amazon but they are the same.	-1
I purchased this gadget primarily to take up the hem on dress pants.  And for that purpose it does not work because the tool is too wide to fit in the hem of most pants.  Too bad because it could have been a very useful tool.	-1
Lame.  Made in China.	-1
Powdery, dries like chalk, chips after it dries. All together disappointing.	-1
The good - there is a great variety of really beautiful colors. The bad - the paint is TERRIBLE quality. I got about halfway done painting the piece I was working on, and noticed powder on my paper - the paint, after drying, flaked off and crumbled into fine powder. This is not just one color, it's many. They also don't dissolve normally in the water - when rinsing my brushes large chunks of the paint were left floating. It's almost like it has a waxy residue. When it dries it's like you wet down a bunch of pastel chalks and tried to use them as paint. I'm quite disappointed. I seriously bought a set of water colors at Daiso a while back that are better quality than these. Check the photos to see what I mean.	-1
Very disappointed . Maybe good for knitters but I crochet and have no idea what and how to use this thread .  It is not yarn .	-1
I would not use this for anything other than a rag, and I would not go to the trouble to knit a rag.	-1
Pros: Nice case with cute bubbles over the paints making them look better than they are.  Lots of colors. Cons: I had high hopes but the quality really isn't very good.  They are indeed, as many have said, chalky.  VERY chalky.  I have gotten better quality from dollar store kids paints.  Sigh!	-1
This item was not what I expected. The cost was higher then if I bought it at was of Walmart. I was expecting maybe one of the larger balls of yarn at this price or at least 2 balls of yarn.	-1
From the picture, this looked much more of a finer yarn than it is. It turned out bulky and unuseable and was not soft at all. Disappointed.	-1
Terrible quality! Maybe I was expecting too much when I read the other reviews, but these do not perform well AT ALL. These would be good if you're getting them for a child but definitely not for a real artist. The paint is HARD and chalky so color is almost impossible to pick up. The colors look great in the pan, but are pretty dull on paper. No vibrancy, nothing special. Glad I only spent a few bucks on this	-1
Very chalky. Too much filler used with the pigment. If you are serious and care about quality, buy a better set.	-1
They show what is supposed to be 3 different Crochet hook packs.  The 12409 and the 82409 are EXACTLY the same!  Save your money, unless you are giving one set as a gift, even then, just choose 2 of the lesser price.  I gave this a 1 star due to duplicity.	-1
Not enough thread to complete project.  Missing thread	-1
The thread sticks to the needle with the friction, not my favorite :S	-1
These are not inline hooks. They are Boye hooks with Susan Bates stamped on them.  If I wanted Boye hooks, I'd buy Boye hooks.  I stupidly bought an entire set from Joann.com and will now be filing them to become inline hooks....like they should be made.	-1
Plastic just doesn't slide through yarn as smoothly and quickly as aluminum.	-1
I don't like the feel or the shape of the hook. It doesn't feel comfortable in the hand, and the hook notch is far too sharply pointed, with sharp edges, but manages to be too shallow to hold the yarn.	-1
First of all, it wasn't clear that this was a stamped, rather than counted, cross stitch.  I was looking at counted cross stitch kits, and it offered me a variety of pattern names to choose from, without making clear that I was selecting a totally different type of kit.  I wasn't very happy about it, but I figured it couldn't be TOO bad, so I soldiered on.  I started reading the instructions and discovered that the ink used for stamping doesn't wash out.  That was the deal breaker, as I knew that it would wind up showing somewhere or another.  However, the wedding was too close to allow time for returning the kit and selecting another, COUNTED this time.  Luckily, I keep (a lot of) cross stitch fabric around, and the chart was JUST good enough that I was able to work the design as counted, rather than stamped.  I managed to get it done in time, but the hassle of needing to draw a grid over the chart where none existed was a time-consuming irritation.  I consider this to be a fault of Amazon, for the way they handle their listing, rather than with Dimensions itself.  If they are going to lump designs together, that's fine.  However, they should not lump two entirely different crafts together in the same list.  P.S. - My nephew said that it was their favorite wedding present, so the annoyance was worth it.	-1
not crazy about these started using and put them back into a package to give away to someone...	-1
Very chalky and dry. More color can be pulled up from crayola water color cakes.	-1
I really don't like these. They make a chalky mess when dried. I prefer the Sakura watercolors.	-1
for kids... not pigmented! even if your a beginner don't even start with this! try faber castell	-1
I was disappointed in the lack of a workable area. They're not particularly useful for working a triple treble crochet as there is not enough space for all of the loops without leading into the grip area, which then overstretches the loop. Considering returning them.	-1
Perfectly sealed up with a needle missing!	-1
Pack only contained one needle	-1
These needles are poor quality. I broke 6 of them sewing one leather pouch. I'm actually surprised how bad they were since Tandy is usually a good brand.  I'm super disappointed.	-1
Tried sewing my leather sheath last night and 3 needles broke. I barely even put pressure on them and they snapped in half. Pieces of crap. I won't purchase these again.	-1
Not durable.	-1
Cheap broke all of them one after another garage	-1
I had high hopes for this product. Unfortunately all 3 broke when I was hemming 1 pair of pants.	-1
hard to get colors on the brush, no matter how much moisture you drip onto the color before using the brush.  Paint is grainy and  difficult to get any color saturation.  Many shades are so closely related in hue IRL that they are indistinguishable.	-1
Plastic just doesn't feel the same as the metal hooks. Good value though and if we ever travel at least these aren't weapons.	-1
I used the large P hook for a 1/2 hour to an hour every night for 2 weeks and got the biggest blister from it.  The plastic isn't contoured nicely like the aluminum are and the ridge rubs against your finger.  They're also off by .5 mm from other crochet hooks so keep this in mind when you decide to start using a different hook.  I finally finished the project and have another to begin.  I will be investing in another P size.  I can't hold a spoon without having it press painfully on the blister, I certainly can't crochet another blanket with these cheap things.	-1
I purchased these for a leather quiver that I am making for my daughter. For most of the sewing, I have been using a regular light-weight tapestry/doll needle (not meant for leather use) and it has held up wonderfully well but I needed a shorter needle for the inner curved areas. So, I purchased a package of these.  I am using 8 oz leather and have pre-punched all of the sewing holes so there is very little pressure on the needle when stitching. That being said, I have already had 3 of these needles snap right where the shaft meets the eye and I have a significant amount of stitching left to do (the needles do not last very long). Since the package contains 10 needles, I should make it but I will definitely be looking for a different brand next time.  In reading other reviews, I see that I am not the only one that has had this problem. Perhaps it is a quality control issue and I received a bad pack?  UPDATE: 9 of the 10 needles broke before I could complete 30" of seaming (stitches are 3/16" apart - I used a saddle stitch throughout). Another reviewer mentioned John James needles as a better alternative so I purchased a pack of size 3 midway through (<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/John-James-Glovers-Needles-Size-1/dp/B00HX1U0W2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">John James Glovers Needles, Size 1</a>). After trying the John James needles on 9 ounce veg tanned backed with thick goat hide (equivalent to 6-7 ounce leather for a total of 15-16 ounces / 1/4"!!), I must say that I will never purchase the Tandy needles again! I just wish that Amazon carried their line of saddle needles (blunt tip) rather than just the glover style.  The other defect that I noticed with Tandy's needles is that the eye is not smooth internally. Since it isn't finished properly, the burrs and rough edges cause tiger thread to shred as you sew.	-1
I bought a set of these when they first came out, thinking oh these are pretty. They'd be fun to use. WRONG! I broke three of them (the bigger ones) inside of ten minutes and threw the rest away. I much prefer the Quicksilver line. They're sleek and fast and don't break.	-1
Not pointed.	-1
This did not work for me as the needle tip is bluntly rounded, not a sharp point.  I ended up using my regular sewing needle to repair my daughter's UGG's	-1
There should be better needles out there, I just broke two.	-1
These needles are all bad, very blunt, some had no tips at all & all of them looked like carpet needles & I will be sending them back.	-1
I used these to pull sinew through leather and several broke as I pulled them through the tight holes.  Unbelievable!  They should stand up through a little pulling. I widened my holes and started again with a new needle but that one too broke at the eye as well.  Doesn't make sense to me.  I'm on my 4th needle just to go through 12 stitches -- ridiculous.	-1
I just received this crochet hook cushion, that SAYS that it fits a size K or smaller. I received the package and here is says it fits size G or smaller. If I knew this cushion would only fit size G or smaller (as I usually use a H hook to a J hook in most of my projects) I would not have purchased this. I am very dissatisfied with this and feel this is false advertisement. There is a definite discrepancy in this and I will be writing to Amazon and the third party vendor that shipped this. Not to mention, I had to wait until after 5pm to receive the package from UPS, but I will not fault Amazon or the vendor for that.	-1
Can't push a size F thru, never mind  a size K	-1
Don't waste your money!!! It states it fits up to K hook but I couldn't even put it on an I hook before it started to tear,..no way it would hold up to using it for multiple hooks. AND it read $6.77 yet I was charged $8.09.	-1
couldn't get the hook in it even with direction hole is to small  sorry I bought them	-1
These seem like they'd be great for your crochet hooks.  Unfortunately, although the hole needs to be small so they'll stay on the hooks, they're so small that I haven't been able to find one that I could get it on, so they're really useless to me.	-1
Almost gave these one star. Directions say to put a drop of dish liquid on the hook end, then insert it into the cushion. Put other end on a hard surface and push down on the cushion. My husband and I spent about 20 mins trying to put this on a J 6mm hook. It went on ok until I hit the flat part of the hook where the hook size is stamped. It split when it was almost on far enough. It ended up not being round, so makes hand position awkward. The package says 'great for arthritis sufferers' but if you have arthritis, I doubt you would be able to put these on.  My hands hurt afterwards and I don't have arthritis. For the 2nd hook, which is an H 5mm, I cut  the cushion almost in half and had better luck getting on. It looks like a cushion on a pen or pencil, instead of going further down. Don't know how well it will work. I don't use a hook size smaller than the H, but these might go on more smoothly with the smaller size hooks, which is why I gave them 2 stars. If these don't work, I'll probably just buy  H and J size hooks with the ergonomic handles. Those handles aren't just round in order to make the grip area larger in diameter, they are made to fit your grip when you're doing this particular task.	-1
Very hard to get onto the crocheting needle. I wasted some money on this. Threw them away.	-1
Does not fit up to size K as the package says. It will only fit very small hooks. The largest I can fit inside the tight cushion is a size d. The seller should change what size this cushion fits. Waste.	-1
No good	-1
Only fit the smallest hooks. Thought it would at least fit the H hook but I had to fight to get one on and only got it on halfway	-1
A BIT DIFFICULT TO PUT HOOKS INTO	-1
too hard to get onto the hook	-1
When I received this, I was expecting more than just one (1) in the package, as when I looked at the picture, there was more than just one (1) in the package.	-1
No what I was expecting, smaller than I thought they would be.	-1
not very absorbent. scott pad would be better.	-1
If you embroider frequently be warned that THIS IS NOT DMC FLOSS!!! Prism is some knockoff spamming DMC as a keyword. This is still cotton floss, but it is dull and rough compared to genuine DMC. (Bought some at a JOANN'S, never again!)	-1
Good enough for friendship bracelets - stinks for embroidery....	-1
Made in China not France. Terrible quality.	-1
Poor quality product, sorry to say. Okay for children's crafts or projects not requiring higher quality, floss, which I am used to. These had many problems for me. The thread itself is dull and not finely woven. It is very hard to work with as it tangles itself up, knots up easily and snags a lot. Then only two positive things I can say is that the bag of floss is inexpensive (as in cheap) and has a nice variety of colors, although some are duplicate colors. This floss is not suitable for a fine project, as I found out, but perfect for projects not requiring good quality thread/floss. The negative reviews are spot on.	-1
Folks, this product is mis-titled.  This thread is  >>NOT NOT NOT<<  DMC thread.  It doesn't even LOOK like DMC thread!  You can see the coarse quality right in the picture!  Also, the upper and lower wrappers are plainly not DMC, which are black with gold metallic lettering.  DMC is made in France.  This is made in China.  Look at the lower bands - a couple are clearly printed 'Made in 'China'.  I wrote about cheap thread for another multi-pack of thread that was "marked with DMC numbers" (Thread Nanny).  People thought (just as the marketing arm of the manufacturer planned) that in the eyes of buyers DMC numbers = DMC thread.  Not so.  Two other "fake-o" brand of "DMC" floss here on Amazon are Thread Nanny and Iris.  There may be others; I didn't take the time required to do a thorough survey.  Janlynn also markets embroidery floss on Amazon, but they are honest and do not claim it is DMC.  DMC does not make different qualities of thread.  Different types and diameters, yes, but not different qualities.  This is DMC thread: http://www.amazon.com/DMC-Embroidery-Floss-8-7-Yard-16-Pack/dp/B00FOXXDQ6/ref=sr_1_38?ie=UTF8&qid=1438766637&sr=8-38&keywords=embroidery+thread  Here's the detailed info on embroidery thread quality, if you care to read it here: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AGPXF6U?ref_=cm_cr-mr-title  If you're making friendship bracelets with the Scouts, this is fine.  If you're doing an embroidery project for kids in your Sunday School class or VBS, this is fine.  (Use a full 6 strands and felt.)  If you want inexpensive thread for some experiment, this is fine.  It might be fine for making twisted cord; the cord might turn out fuzzy - do a test.  If you're doing real embroidery, don't buy this stuff.  Buy decent thread (I prefer DMC, but there are other reputable brands such as Anchor and Sullivans.)  The time you're spending on a project is the same, whether you're using good floss or terrible quality stuff like this.  What are your time and effort worth? mb, national needlework teacher	-1
It's NOT DMC floss!  It's nice floss but it's NOT DMC.  No DMC numbers on the floss.  It's NOT DMC.	-1
This thread would be okay for friendship bracelets it fell apart for needle work.	-1
I RATED THIS PRODUCT AS A 2 BECAUSE I WAS DISAPPOINTED IN THE MULTI COLOR STRANDS.  I THOUGHT I HAD PURCHASED ONLY MULTI COLOR STANDS.  NOW I HAVE SEVERAL BOXES OF SOLID COLOR STRANDS WHICH I DO NOT NEED.  IF I HAD NOT OPEN THE PACKAGE I WOULD HAVE RETURNED IT. WOULD I RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT - BE SURE YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE ORDERING.	-1
The DMC in the title is very misleading. I am sorry that I purchased without carefully checking into it. Poor quality. Made in China and goes directly into the garbage bin.	-1
It isn't the typical 6 strand, glossy floss, but a thick single strand not suitable for normal embroidery.  While I'm sure there could be other craft uses, I threw mine away.	-1
If you are a person who wants your jewelry to really stand out don't purchase these.  They are broken, all different sizes and extremely poor quality.  Don't waist you money.	-1
While it is fun, and a huge selection of colors.. all of the beads are so inconsistent in size.. for good use.. they are about impossible to use without throwing everything off.	-1
These are terrible inconsistent in size	-1
Uneven sizes, break easily...  Pretty to behold - but absolutely lousy to bead with.	-1
Varied sizes due to sloppy work, couldn't use, gave beads to my grandchildren to make necklaces. I did find that the little plastic boxes made a good storage for my miyuki beads.	-1
I thought I could use these beads for learning, as I am a beginning beader. What I got from them was complete frustration. The sizes are completely inconsistent in all directions, with some being more like cylinders, others round, others deformed, too many unusable. The amount of each color is also inconsistent; so, for example, you cannot practice a crocheted rope if you want to keep the colors the same throughout.  Also, the colors you get look nothing like the picture on Amazon. That picture looks like a beautiful rainbow of colors - even two pinks; I got no pinks, no bright blue (just an ugly pale blue), no purple. And even though it says "silver-lined beads" in the title, only half of them are. The rest are opaque shiny or opaque matte. But if you love brown, you're in luck - lots of brown beads, both matte and shiny opaque, and probably 25 more matte than yellow and light blue, and 15 more than the icky aqua.  I was very disappointed in these and will send them back. Even if the cost had been $5 instead of almost $12 (though I see today that the price has dropped to $8.97), they wouldn't have been worth it for the time I wasted with them. The only thing I liked was the Tic-Tac-like individual storage containers (24 in all) and the box that holds them, but I think I can find that or something similar at Michael's and pay less (especially with their frequent 40 percent off coupon).  The variation in reviews makes me wonder if the product you get varies as much as the beads - i.e., some people get what's pictured, others get what I got.  P.S. Happily, when I just called Amazon about the return, the CS rep told me they would refund my money, don't bother with the return. So, I can toss the beads and use the containers.	-1

After a three weeks of purchase and use, on one project, it has died. The Cable came out and snapped.	-1
product came totally broken!!!!!	-1
Purchased this for my mother. She had ran out of floss at 30% into working on this picture. I contacted Amazon and the manufacturer. Amazon reps could not help me, I was directed to the Manufacturer from who I got email from saying basically, "ya we received your letter and issues will be solved". No one fixed anything or got back to us. If you are cool with going to Michaels or Jo Ann's and pick/matching floss colors then picture itself is wonderful. Kit has limited amount of floss!!!!!	-1
Don't think this is worth the money at all as it's flimsy paper and the colors are not very clear at all.  Don't recommend buying this!	-1
I think the price for one sheet of paper, though informative, just feels as if you're overpaying for an item.	-1
seriously not worth the money. the video is from 1980 or so and the build quality of the case is horrible. Not a good value product for what you get.	-1
only good for oil colors.....not acrylic colors mixes.	-1
I bought these because they look like round, faceted beads.  It must be a window reflection that gives that appearance, because they are round. , just like the product description says.  Don't let your eyes fool you.  I guess the only complaint would be that they don't look like the product description photo.  And, they are small, so being able to tell exactly which gemstone they are is hit or miss and there's no help included to identify them.	-1
These were alright, but didn't seem to be as pretty as the picture shows.  I probably would not purchase again.	-1
wish it explainded exactly how many you get a little better it came on a string with maybe 10-20 beads :(	-1
I am learning as I go but realise that if it is electrical, don't buy from Amazon as it is non compatible with our electrics.  Went to the trouble of buying an adaptor just for it to go red hot and burn.  Tossed in bin.	-1
I loved this stuff at first, because it turned all of my normal quilting cotton into wonderful laminated fabric.  Unfortunately I started receiving reports from customers that the coating cracked and peeled after only a few months of use.  Incredibly disappointing.	-1
I don't know if I got a dud but the first time using it the bent tip was like wet spaghetti. No matter how lightly I tried to use it, the tip just twisted all out of shape. Sent it back.	-1
Not worth the price, gets very hot and you need to stop.  I would recommend getting one that has a temperature control so that when you find the right heat setting to do the project you want you can set it and continue working.  I didn't realize when I ordered how much better that would be.  I was using it to cut the thick 10 mil mylar sheets.  It did an pretty well job, but had to take many breaks due to the hot handle.	-1
I have mixed feelings with this product.  I used this on a stencil fesket and was disappointed. It didn't give a clean cut but burned the stencil edges and it will refuse the material when it cooIs. So you have to work fast. I  went back to using  a knife instead.  Maybe with more practice I don't know.	-1
Non compatible with Australian power points.  This is not shown in any of the advertising for electrical goods so is unuseable.	-1
Used one time and the thing shorted out as it over heated. The tool was Perfect for what I was using it for. The tip was fine and made the Perfect hole so I bought a heavt duty tree engraving tool and used the tip from this tool and it fit perfectly.	-1
MADE in China - you get what you pay for - combined the brushes are not worth $0.01 - perhaps - perhaps for watercolor (As they are extremely soft but I bet the hairs come out in painting. NOT WORTH THE EFFORT, I tried and regretted big time!!	-1
not good	-1
I make candles and this is not a quality wax. Unpredictable and too many issues with sink holds.  The issue worsens with larger candles. Does not hold scent well, either.	-1
Thought the quantity of wax would have been much more than I received. Actually needed much more wax for candle making.	-1
It's cheaper to buy separately Small amount of products,	-1
I used it for making candles, but I had to use vybar to get the bubbles out, and make it hold its scent better. It did not hold the scent at all, and was full of bubbles. I will not be using this wax again, I recommend getting something better.	-1
The only good thing about this kit was the wax pot. Everything else arrived damaged.	-1
This is basically all you need candles at home, or should I say to burn your house? I purchased this kit and used it the same day to make candles using the included instructions and the plastic cups supplied with it. Next day I placed the 3 candles next to each other and lit them. 2 hours later my fire alarm went off and I found the 3 candle jars (plastic) melted and on fire. My counter top was ruined and I now have to pay the landlord for an entire kitchen counter top. Thankfully I was about 20 ft away from the candles when this happened. So, what would've happened if had been a bit farther away? If you decide to buy this kit, ditch the plastic candle cups. And to the seller, replace these cups with real glass, or just remove them from the kit before someone burns down their entire house.	-1
I was happy to find a set of markers with such a large selection of colors and was looking forward to working with these.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed right from the start.  When filling in larger spaces I found that the markers left behind streaks and mottled areas.  It was a little better after they dried...but then I discovered tiny white areas had appeared here and there. On some of the colors the tips began to fray almost immediately.  I've had none of these problems with either Sharpie or Bic, and they're considerably less expensive.  I won't be purchasing these again. Do yourself a favor - don't waste your money; stick with Sharpie or Bic. They may not offer as many colors (yet), but you'll get good coverage, the ink dries evenly and without streaks, and I've never had a problem with white spots.	-1
I was really looking forward to these pencils.  Stabilo generally makes good quality products...here, however, I was mighty disappointed.  On my first day of using them, I was happy and gung ho to get going on a large drawing.  I was sharpening them as I used each color, and I noticed that some of them were getting real short right away.  Some of the colors had leads that were all crumbly and broken inside, and they wouldn't sharpen.  They wouldn't hold a point at all, and really were a waste of time.  I got about an hour of drawing before I gave up in frustration.  I really wanted to like these, but just can't.  I am going to return them.	-1
I have a smaller set and loved it. So I wanted a larger set. The box was delivered with a dent on the top left hand corner.	-1
I don't understand how a product can be sold by Amazon that states:  WARNING:  THIS PRODUCT CONTAINS CHEMICALS KNOWN TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO CAUSE CANCER AND BIRTH DEFECTS OR OTHER REPRODUCTIVE HARM!  Now, why CA is the only state that is aware of the problems this chemical causes is alarming.  But, at the very least, this warning should be part of the description so a consumer could make a decision prior to going through the ordering process.  It really is too bad as the colors are vibrant and brilliant and the shades are many.  It looks like a fabulous set at a reasonable price.  I wonder if those who gave this set 5 stars have containers with the same statement that mine has and why hasn't it deterred your purchase and not mentioned in your description.  I am on the fence now.....don't know if I should keep them!!  And there is no way to speak with the vendor....just keep or return.	-1
it said it's washable, but it is not really. We washed the cover of  cushions with its stain on the same day, but it came out with little bit of , but very noticable stains after washing.  Very disappointing !	-1
It works really well, but the top gets very hot. I am going to look for a "cool" bulb to see if that helps.	-1
Not good for weeding vinyl.  There is no back on it and the light is exposed in the back.  You can burn yourself or any other item that comes in contact with the back.	-1
Came with a broken light bulb. It doesn't have a cover for the light and gets really really hot. Overall, not a great purchase.	-1
Awkward and difficult to use	-1
The light from these is so dim, I really couldn't use them for the purpose I intended (display lighting).  It's a very warm light, yellow-tinged, which may or may not be to your taste.  The bulb that lights them is one of those tiny Christmas candle-style ones, so you can imagine what quality of light you're getting.  The plastic of the "box" is also a fairly flimsy frosted piece that is easily whipped around and toppled by the cord, and as there's no backing to the box, you'll have to guard that bulb with your life.  Not particularly useful.	-1
These are often recommended a good starter student set of watercolors. Hense why I bought it. I've learned a little since then and now know that I could get better products for nearly the same price. If I was starting again I'd buy a Mission Gold 24 set of tube colors. They're affordable, very saturated pigments, and artist quality.  Regarding the Koi set, they have half pans (the cups holding the paint) which are annoying to get color into brushes because the pan is so small its hard to pickup with a brush thats longer than the pan. The pallet is not reusable, you cannot remove the pans so they're difficult to clean. Some of the colors have heaved and cracked from wetting and drying repeatedly (as watercolors do). The colors seem to not be vibrant although thats just what you get with student grade colors. I found the water brush cumbersome to use. Prefer real brushes.	-1
Smells of the filler/ binder koi uses. Much more than pans.	-1
This is great for first timers I guess but in general the quality isn't very good. The paints are really bad quality that I am scraping them out and filling the palette in with my own watercolors. Also, the water filled brush is extremely hard to use, renedering it useless. The only thing I was kind of happy with were the sponges because I thought that was pretty clever, although they do get dirty pretty quickly. Instead of these, I reccomend buying your own aluminum palette and filling it with some shinhan watercolors.	-1
I have been using watercolor brushes from various companies. This is by far the worst! I cannot unscrew the water chamber. It's too soft and I've already ruined it before I was even able to use it. So disappointed with this product and for this company. Is there a warranty on this?	-1
This palette is virtually not usable.  The paint amounts are tiny indeed, and poorly attached to the molded cups, causing the paints to fly loose and stick in places not intended when the box is closed and the painter is traveling.  I spend more time trying to reattach paint blocks than I do using the palette.  I should not have accepted it to begin with, but my travel plans precluded a return.  I made the purchase because I read a very positive review for Koi products in Watercolor Artist magazine.  I was mistaken and regret the purchase.	-1
Beautiful kit. The lid of the paint brush does not fit the body of it.	-1
The handle is too short on the waterbrush.	-1
Very poor quality! Colors separate on paper,  total waste of money!  DO NOT BUY!!	-1
Came without a paint brush tip so it was useless unless you went and bought another set of the paint pens (or used QA-Tips).	-1
Pros: - Vivid, nicely pigmented colors - The water brush is decent. The amount of water that comes out on it's own is perfect, but may be too much for someone who likes to work with a drier brush. My favorite part is how the little black cap gives your the ability to carry it full of water and still have it fit in the case. - The moveable palette is a really nice feature. Comes in really handy. - The sponges for cleaning are genius. I didn't know about them until I got it. It was a pleasant surprise and pretty much removes the need to carry paper towels.  Cons: - The paints are grainy. This is a "you get what you pay for" situation. I'd planned on buying the Koi watercolor tubes to refill, but know what after I've seen the quality of the paint. I'll probably go with Windsor and Newton now. - In the picture, the plastic holding the paint appears to be nice and sturdy like in most paint palettes, but it's actually a very flimsy, disposable grade of plastic. Makes me wonder how it will hold up to refill and reuse. - The water brush sometimes sucks paint into the water reservoir, causing color contamination. - The "small, sleek design that fits into shirt or jacket pockets" is an absolute lie. Unless you're a giant with giant pockets. -  Some of the color choices don't quite make sense. There are 4 greens and only one purple, and the one purple included is a rather warm purple. Also, the lemon yellow and aureoline hue are nearly identical. I would have also liked to have seen a more grassy colored green included.  Overall I'd say it's a good start for a student or someone who isn't looking to make professional-grade artwork, but if you're looking to get serious, don't have high hopes for the quality of this paint.  UPDATE: I really, really tried to like this set given the 5 star ratings from others, but the paints are so incredibly grainy and low quality that I could never recommend this set to someone, therefore I've bumped my rating down from 3 to 2.	-1
I returned this product as soon as I opened it. I thought it would add to my watercolor supplies; but was disappointed. When they describe mini-colors, they mean mini. Not even 1/2 pans. I decided I could better spend that same money on a set of  "Pentel Arts Aquash Water Brushes".	-1
Nice, light design, but leaks quite a bit.  One of the biggest annoyances I have with this brush is that it is reversed to tighten/loosen the brush from the reservoir. the barrel is circular, and doesnt prevent the brush from rolling.  I am considering the pentel version instead. Hope to have better luck with that.	-1
This has a left hand thread. The only other things that I know of with a left had thread are light bulbs and the bottom of blenders. I felt it would wear out the plastic quickly by trying to open it the normal way (right hand thread). Also the water tank was much smaller than my Pentel and hard to squeeze. On a positive side, there is a cap for the water tank, but it pops on rather than screws on. I have owned my Pentel for a while as a gift through Amazon and would buy another. This one does come apart for storage or travel, but I feel this is over kill as it is so small anyway. The Pentel also has a secure cap like this one which works fine for travel.	-1
try mix the pathalo blue and lemon yellow, or lots of other combinations, you will be surprise that mixing two colors will make some kind of precipitation, which I never found in my winsor & newtwon Cotman watercolor travel set...	-1
Great idea with water brush in kit.  Lots of colors, but not the same nor exact colors that I use from a tube. I tried it once.  I will have to try it again.  I got it for traveling.  I have several different travel palettes.  Two of my simple palettes with larger pans and only a few colors are my favor.  The pans are too close to each other.  I will have to work on smaller paintings with a smaller brush. I thought it was a good idea at the time.  I would recommend a different palette with large and fewer pans, about 6 to 8 colors.	-1
Only since 1 star is not an option. Awful markers for even a intermediate colorer to work with.	-1
I love that there were an array of colors and variations of colors. These are not for regular copy paper or even a high fiber paper unless you are looking for imperfect lines because these markers are heavy bleeders. I found the tips of the markers to be quite sharp; if you're not careful they raise the paper.	-1
OK...I love all things Crayola. That being stated I was disappointed when I opened the pack to find faded, thin and flimsy papers!!!!! NOOOOOO! What can I do with this now????!!!!!!????? I would not have given any stars excpet the only nice was the price... =(	-1
I just received the Crayola Construction Paper I ordered from Amazon.  It arrived in good shape and in good time, however, as a former teacher and long-time crafter, this paper is NOT construction paper in any sense of the word.  You cannot CONSTRUCT anything with it.  The paper has the weight of typing paper.  It has no body or strength for anything except for flat work.  If you are just drawing on it or using it to paste in areas that you want color, it might be sufficient, but it is in no way any kind of construction paper.  I have been misled.  As a long-time endorser of Crayola products, I'm extremely disappointed.	-1
I tried to use this both with wax based and oil based pencils and the result was the same: deep scratches on the paper no matter how light and colors muddled into a shade of brown. I got a higher gloss look from using my white oil pencil than the burnish pencil. I do not recommend this brand.	-1
The only Derwent products that I don't like. I have full sets of inktense and colorsoft pencils and I love those. These not so much they didn't really seem to do anything. I use the Prismacolor blender and expected these to perform similarly by pushing the pigment into the paper and smoothing it out but they don't. They don't seem to do much of anything really	-1
It might just be my opinion but these have no blending ability, just smears after you attempt to blend. Save your art!	-1
To rough and arrived late!	-1
I was not thrilled with this blender and I was surprised as I am a big fan of ALL things Derwent. This blender made the colors ''dirty'... and I used it on several colors but it was especially noticeable on the yellows and oranges...  and the burnisher was very hard and gritty.  The Prisma blender pencils is much better and the Caran D'ache blender is FAR superior	-1
I used the blender.  It crumbled and left a mess on my paper.  I used the burnisher.  It is supposed to give a glossy sort of look.  Nothing.  A waste of money.  I recommend "Finesse colored pencil blender pen".  It's a little pricey, but it works!	-1
This product is certainly NOT what I expected.  These leave a bit of shine,  I really wanted a blender.	-1
I don't care for these as much as Prismacolor's blender pencil (I ordered more). I have found no use for the burnisher pencil. The blender lead is really hard and leaves streaks in my picture. It ruins it.	-1
horrible	-1
I started using these on Tuesday 12/16 after getting them in the mail. The Burnisher has worked quite well so far, but the blender is not as soft as I would have hoped. I am using them along side prismacolor softcore colored pencils. It is quite hard and left some indented marks on the paper, as if i was using a hard pencil and pressing down. When I sharpened the blender, the wood was a bit splintery and I had to resharpened it down further to smooth it out so that the blender core would be steady. I will be experimenting with these further and will update if anything changes.	-1
They are just ok , was expecting more	-1
I have derwent pencils and like them, but am not impressed with their blenders - they are not soft and hard to blend	-1
Paint is thin had to go over several times, every thing else is good.	-1
I had to return because the face of the hammer had deep scratches that would have transferred to the metal.	-1
Cuts decently but wears extremely fast.	-1
these were packed in a bubble wrap envelope.  they were so bent that tips were 1/2 inch away from each other. they are completely unusable.	-1
Brutishly made, not fine at all. Difficult to use and whatever you pick up with them tends to fall out of the grip area. I bought them to use for sewing, like when I'm threading the loopers in the serger, but these are useless. They are not finely tooled enough to pick up anything really small.	-1
Terrible.  The ends don't come together tightly so you cant even hold onto a piece of thread.	-1
I ordered these tweezers because I thought they would be the same as what I used to use when I worked in a sewing factory. Boy was I wrong. They were bent like the picture shows, but also slightly sideways so they were literally unusable. I just thew them in the trash.	-1
Purchased to pull threads while quilting. Do not work at all. Barely able to grasp the thread let alone hold on to it. The ends are rounded and don't seem to really be able to grasp. May be another use they will work. just don't seem to be very well made.	-1
I bought these to use with my embroidery machine. The thread slips right, Will not grasp the thread.	-1
I wanted to use them with Perler beads,  they were to wide.	-1
Truly a waste of money!  These do not grip and are pretty much worthless	-1
I must have gotten a bum pair, given the rave reviews by everybody else. These tweezers are so awful I nearly chucked them. In three words ... they don't tweeze. I look at them, and the tips really do seem to close ... yet I cannot seem to grab a single stray thread from the sewingsmachine. I kept trying until my hands were hurting from gripping the tweezers. I thought it was just me, until I tried another pair of tweezers, and boom, it actually worked on the first try.	-1
Horrible!  The tweezers don't close flat unless you bend them. The grip teeth don't grip thread because they're stamped into the metal just barely -- more like scratches than teeth!  Don't buy. Total con job.	-1
I  bought these for use in machine embroidery....to cut away connecting threads across small gaps.  They don't work well for that purpose.	-1
This tweezer is very poor made. It doesn't  aline a well and is kind of hard to grab the thread with them but for the money I pay, I guess I deserve it.	-1
This is so disappointing.  I purchased several Lyra Rembrandt pencils out of open stock back in January.  All stores (Amazon, Blick, Jerry's Artarama, etc) were all out of the 72 set of these at the time.  I ended up getting another brand, but did like these and hoped to eventually add the 72 set to my collection.  My ORIGINAL Lyra pencils were smooth and just soft enough, gliding across the paper with ease.  They were easy to put down in really light layers, blended like a dream, and were all in all fun to use.  The only thing I didn't like about them is that the pencils were thinner and they don't hold a point extremely well, so they do have to be sharpened fairly often.  (That makes them run out sooner.)  I finally got around to ordering the 72 set.  They are NOTHING like my originals from less than a year ago!  These pencils are super scratchy and feel almost abrasive on paper.  I tried them on smooth cardstock, standard printer paper, slightly toothy/textured sketchbook paper, and a standard coloring book.  No matter what I did, they felt unpleasant to use and I had no desire to keep coloring with them.  I thought at first it might be some weird coating on the lead put on to protect them, since they come sharpened.  I sharpened one enough to remove the outer layer of lead, and it was still scratchy.  When I held them up side by side with my old pencils, the lead color from the exact same colors was slightly different and so was the color swatch on the end of the pencil.  I know they were out of stock/production for several months earlier in the year, so I can't help but wonder if manufacturing was changed or moved.  These are obviously not the same!  Mine were returned because as much as I love the few I already have, I would never use these.  If you can't afford Polychromos, buy Prismacolor!  Either of them will perform far superior to these.	-1
I bought these based on reviews I had seen both on here and by artists elsewhere on the internet. I should have gotten Prismacolor, but so many people had said oil-based pencils were much smoother and didn't break as easily, so I ordered a set. Unfortunately, they were not what I was hoping for. Unlike other wax-based colored pencils, these do not seem to blend very well with one another (even with a blender pencil I specifically bought to go with oil-based pencils) and they do not have good coverage. I should be able to sketch and fill in my drawings with normal pressure and achieve smooth, even color. However, I have to press way too hard with these to even keep the paper from showing through. They do not make my drawings look professional at all. I had better results with a $6 box of Target brand colored pencils than I did with these!  Here is an example of the difference between Lyra pencils (oil-based) and Target's brand (wax-based) so you can see why I'm giving the low rating. In the photos below, the sunflower was created using Lyra's pencils and the flamingo was created using the $6 pencils from Target. I did not use any blending tools for either drawing - all blending was done solely with the colored pencils themselves. Both drawings were also done on the same type of paper (Strathmore brand) - toned and without any tooth. See the splotchy look of the Lyra pencils? No smooth transition between colors and no matter how much I go over the area or how hard I press, I cannot get an even appearance. I went over that leaf a dozen times and I can still see spots where the paper is showing. With Target's pencils, my flamingo looks velvety. The colors blend and layer with ease. That is what you want from a colored pencil. That is how your finished drawing should look.  So why bother giving two stars if I dislike them so much? Well, for one, the colors are bright and rich. Despite not laying well on paper, the colors are gorgeous, so I can't complain about that. The pencils come packaged nicely in a metal tin and their overall appearance is pleasing - natural wood with only the back ends colored to differentiate between the options. They look like pencils made for an artist rather than for a school kid. Unfortunately, they do not live up to artist expectations.	-1
I rereceived different set of pencils, dewent	-1
I have heard such great things in various groups about Lyra pencils. I was excited to get this set.  I got it an while the pencils do an amazing job, I am disappointed in the color selection for the 36pc set.  There are no pinks or purples.	-1
I have to question if these are true Lyra brand pencils and not a knock off.  These were not much better than cheap colored pencils.  I got them as a gift and will never buy again.  I am shocked at the great reviews!  I own many artist brands and these are the worst I have gotten yet.	-1
These pencils were recently reformulated by LYRA.  The original pencils were also an oil based lead product which is quite nice in terms of excellent 'light-fastness.'  However, these pencils now require the use of a "Splenda" finishing and blending pencil after the original application.  The old formulation had the "Splenda" component in the oil based lead mix.  These do not and therefore require this extra step to get the proper sheen and quality of the pencils in the illustration, drawing or picture.  Thus, I have found that the Castell-Faber Polychromos pencils are a much better product than these reformulated LYRA Rembrandts.  This change is truly unfortunate, because the old formulation compared very well against any other oil based color pencil on the market.  They no longer are in that category and I would not ever buy them again.	-1
rips easily. Look for one with a higher thickness. The best thing I have found is the Cello Bags if you can make them work to wrap what you need. There are two quality levels for those as well, so beware!! Paying a little more for the higher quality is DEFINITELY worth the money so you don't have to keep taping the stuff back together with clear tape. Ugh.	-1
HARD TO CUT BUT TORE SUPER EASY - VERY UNCOOPERATIVE	-1
All the blades came apart and fell out.  Didn't last a week of very light use.	-1
I'd HAD IT with shredders breaking down and wearing out. These scissors provided a good alternative, and despite the constant annoyance of having to leaf through catalogs to make sure I've gotten every instance of my name and address removed, they are simple to use and quite sturdy. I won't be buying any more shredders!  Update after slightly more than a year of use: one handle on one pair of the two I purchased has split the plastic finger-frame. Fixed with a drop of superglue, and off we went. Have had no other problems, and continue to be pleased with the purchase. Lowered rating by one star.  Update after fifteen months of use: the handle has become irreparable, and I have had to discard the scissors. I expected more use from them, and thus have lowered my rating by a full three stars.	-1
I bought these thinking "Great, these will take up much less space than a paper shredder." The problem is that they can't cut through more than 2 sheets of paper at a time.  They are not that sharp, and, if you try to cut more than one sheet of paper at a time, the paper buckles, making it impossible to cut without straightening it out again. Furthermore, it did not occur to me that I would have to hold the paper with one hand while cutting it - it's impossible to cut both horizontally and vertically (to avoid merely creating paper strips which could still be pieced together).  I know people sometimes use these kinds of scissors to cut herbs too, but I would not recommend that. The herbs would get caught in between the blades and the scissors would be hard to clean to get the bits out of there.	-1
I don't like this color as much as I was hoping I would. It takes almost four costs to see the blue shine through, otherwise it almost looks white. Also, this paint was really chunky. Yuck.	-1
This is a bright neon pink! Definitely NOT the pink pictured here! So unhappy with this! Not at all the pink I was expecting so sad!	-1
Damaged. Packaging was perfect.	-1
Ok color but bottle label looks like trash!  Scratches & stains. Yuk!  Would not recommend to make a purchase here!	-1
Love this paint don't get me wrong! But almost 5 dollars for 2 oz?? No way! 50 cents a bottle at Walmart!	-1
If you are expecting a real true red, do NOT buy this paint because it honestly is way more of a pink color than a red.  Sometimes pictures can be deceptive and it's hard to tell so though it didn't look real red when I bought it, I was sure that since it claimed to be red, it would be but I was wrong.  I was really disappointed because red is really what I wanted and needed and also I would have NEVER spent that much $ on a small bottle of paint + the shipping, had I known it wasn't RED.	-1
If I had purchased this software at the original price, I would ask for a refund. The software doesn't work on several programs and locks up your computer. Provo craft did a terrible job with this software. Also, didn't try to enhance for all users but abandoned the whole project.	-1
I tried to download and would not let me. Too bad since it would be nice to have used it.	-1
I've had this for a year. I did realize that all cartridges would need to be purchased in order to cut images. So, I'm not jaded about the value in that respect. But, I did wrongly assume that this software would have basic editing that has been available for the past 20 years! It will not "group" objects which is downright needed when designing your own phases or images. Also, you cannot edit the images much beyond simply resizing them and welding. Oh, and it's really buggy too. You can't edit a copied and pasted image, it freezes at least once every 3 uses, and takes over 5 minutes to load up each time. It is nice for the paper-saving abilities (you can move images around on the virtual mat really close to save paper which I like.) But it is simply not good for anyone wanting to be creative and design things. Sooooo not worth the price... really it should be free with the Cricut machine puchase. If I'd known how primitive it was, I'd only have bought it for about five bucks.	-1
I downloaded the trial first and highly recommend that you take this software for a test run before you invest in it.  Personally, I found the software to be extremely buggy.  I had heard that many fixes had either been made or in the works but until they do a lot more upgrading to this product I wouldn't get it.	-1
Considering that a greater proportion of people involved in the creative arts prefer Macs, it's ridiculous that there is no Mac version of this software. Worse yet, this software is the only way to update the Cricut firmware.  Provo could at least release a small OSX driver-like software to perform such updates, or better yet do what the Slice does and put the updates on newer cartridges.  The FAQ on Provo's site claims that "several voices" have been asking about a Mac version and that they are seriously looking into it. But it has said that for months and months, probably even a year or two now.  There are 75 million users of OSX worldwide. If only one in three thousand of those users owns a Cricut, that means Provo Craft is ignoring 25,000 existing customers.  Not acceptable.	-1
I am thinking about buying one of these but by reading the reviews it sounds like this company is milking 1980's engraving technology. I imagine that if someone came out with a modern version of a machine like this it would cost $1000's. It's a shame this company is just milking old technology and doesn't have a machine that is versatile and uses a computers already available power. From what I see of this machine I would rather spend $1000 or more on a machine that allows you to do real design. For now I can't see spending a lot of money on an obsolete machine that is only marketed to suck money out of the buyer. This company has the technology in place but chooses to use 30 year old technology just to suck money out of buyers.	-1
Cricut design studio - I thought this was the way to go... haha! It looks good, it seems to do all the things it has promised...(it's not) the program isn't as easy to use as promised! It takes forever if you want to move something, the buttons won't work right away and then when it does.. you have trouble getting it where you want it. What a pain in the rear! I know how to work my way around a computer but this... not USER FRIENDLY! It really becomes very fustrating! Ok now let''s say you have the CUT you want try sending it to the CRICUT, the computer freezes up. WHAT WHAT IS THAT? So I up date the program then I update the Cricut, it wants you to do this over and over again (with no fixing the problem!) I turn off the computer over and over again. I even unplug everthing from the wall.. No fix! Just more agravation! EGADS I have been working on this for 2 days. Of course don't try and call Saturday or Sunday, they are closed. I tried to call before they closed on Friday and I was on hold forever and never did get anyone to answer! I e-mailed but according to the posts on the message board on "The web site" I better not hold my breath. So I will have to try and get someone when I can and I'm Not working! A good company has GOOD tech support... You figure it out... They sure can put on a GREAT TV ad they should spend the money for tech. that is where it will make or break me... I will not spend my money where they don't want to help me. I do love the Cricut I have the personal not the big one. Jukebox has been GREAT too, it is a good idea, wish the cord was a little longer but can't have it all I guess. May the company needs to use these products and then it would fix these things, but what do I know. Good luck to you first timers. Hope this helps. Sad in Cricut land	-1
I was hoping for something more flexible. This 'sticky patch' is a good size and nicely transparent but it is by far too rigid for my purposes.  I found it difficult to work with (knitting) and can not imagine it working well with other needle work. My tactile sense was also greatly diminished with it on. I pulled it off rather quickly. This one will settle into the bottom of my 'failed .products' bin quickly	-1
I wanted to like these. I've used the small mole-skin type thimbles and these seemed more economical and easy to use. The needle does poke through and thread easily catches on the edge. It does not conform to your finger as well as I'd hoped.	-1
Not flexible on your finger and won't stick very well.	-1
These are totally worthless with a needle.  They are plastic and the needle slides right off.  Save your money.	-1
these are slippery and so long - not sure whose fingers they would fit.  The needle just slips off of them if you try to use it to push a needle through a quilt.  Seller is great - product not so much.	-1
Have used other brands and loved them, these are stiff and large for smaller fingers.  Too stiff to manipulate needle.	-1
They are very stiff and slippery.  The ends keep popping off my fingers and catching on the thread.  The image shows it is for pushing needles through, but the needles have nothing to hold them in place and slip easily in the unprotected parts of the finger.	-1
I wanted to love the thimble-it pads because I have heard great things about them. But i have other stick on thimbles work better for me. These are a little too big for my fingers, not the as flexible as I would like and do not stick to my finger well. I prefer ThimblePads or the clover leather thimble. Bandaids also work better for me. If these were a little more flexible and stuck better to my finger, they seem like they would be super durable!	-1
These are NOT worth the money.  I now have 64 of these that I will NEVER use!	-1
I hate metal thimbles, but sometimes you need something to keep from getting holes in your fingers. I machine sew, embroider, smock, crochet, knit, tat, and bead, so I've used a bunch of needles in the last half century and I know whereof I speak.  I tried these and found that the plastic is slippery and not flexible enough for me. The pads are on the large side, and on my fingers they bend. My fingers are short not thin, so I tried trimming the pads to a smaller size in hopes they would fit better. Didn't work. And, no matter what size, I found that, unless I had the pad dead center behind the needle and was pushing very straight, the needle would slip.  What I like MUCH better is the small circular leather pads such as these&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Colonial-brand-leather-thimble-self-adhesive-fingertip-pads/dp/B001J5JN7G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Colonial brand leather thimble self-adhesive fingertip pads</a>. The brand I have is Sewing Notions and they are the same folks who make the Under Thimble, but the principle should be the same. I found the small size of the leather pads to be big enough; the leather is more flexible than the plastic; the needles don't slip off the suede finish of the leather; the leather is plenty thick enough that the needle never punched through; and the adhesive was good for using and reusing many times. I also found a set of replacement adhesive dots.	-1
these beads are too small to work with and if you drop any, good luck retrieving them	-1
You're not getting the color assortment shown. You only get the basic crayola 8. Actually, not even that - there is no purple and there is no brown. Red, orange, yellow, green, light blue, dark blue, white. That's it.	-1
There are more seed beads in this photo than you receive. I was VERY disappointed in the number of seeds for the cost. PASS UP this collection for more beads for you buck!	-1
Not uniform in size and for this reason, it is an inferior product for what I need them for, which is making high quality bracelets.	-1
First delivery package arrived super fast. However, I received a small ziplock Baggie with perhaps 10 different seed bead colors, but probably at least 1/3-1/2 were coral, followed by another 1/3ish as dark blue. So not the "explosions" I was hoping for in color.  I find myself to be a level headed human, but upon further investigation, I found the probably 100-150 of the beads package together for this particular item description are 6/0 needs. Had I needed larger breeds, I would have likely place an order for them. However, my needs were 11/0, and I DID order them (well, at least the product description indicates I did). Also, claims of approximately 3500 beads in this order is no more honest than sneaking a few larger (more dense) beads in with each zippie to increase the Gram weight. I oils guess these orders come with about 1/2 that quantity (feeling generous).  Brighter note, I immediately contacted the comp and had a very polite, empathetic boy on the other line. He was easy to work with and had the "customer will leave satisfied" attitude, and I value good customer service. I must say, however, the replacement beads that were sent arrived after a large time margin and turned out to be as disappointing as round one. Not my favorite experience. I would consider order through bead explosion again, but based simple on the exceptional and kind c.service.	-1
0vals were different sizes and colors which did not match	-1
I liked them..but wasn't expecting them to be so small..Too small for what I was using them for. But I can make it work.	-1
A lot smaller than I thought. They're pretty, like the picture, just small. I'll probably use them for earrings and bracelets.	-1
I received a very small bag of beads that should cost about $ 3.00 at the most.  don't bother with these,  not worth it.	-1
you will always get what you pay for	-1
25 beads - small pea to lima bean size	-1
small in portion and size	-1
didn't like or use them.	-1
Not the pretty striated beads in the packet, mostly solid colors.  VERY FEW BEADS at all and certainly not as pictured!  Per bead, extremely expensive.	-1
crappy colors, 6 clear green, 1 solid green, 2 black, 8 purple (all different purples, not any the same), 1 clear, 1 clear navy blue, 1 yellow and white, 1 clear red,  5 pink (all differnt pinks).	-1
They make it seem like you will be getting a lot of beads but really it's only about ten if that not worth the money	-1
I waited close to one month for these to arrive and when they did, I was disappointed because they are not drilled oval beads that I intended to use to string into necklaces, but rather they are cabachons.  Since returning them would be a hassle, I am faced with the only other possibility for their use to be having to buy cabachon settings and putting them into the settings.  Nowhere in the description did I see that what I was buying were going to be cabachons.  Not happy about this purchase.	-1
Look cheap and can't use in my jewelry.	-1
These were cheap but I at least expevted them to be the same size or for the holes drilled through them to go straight through, not crooked.	-1
I ordered these in April,2014.  I got a really great group of beads so I ordered 4 more sets.  The second batch were awful.  The colors were pastel and not at all like those pictured or what I had received before.  I'm really disappointed.	-1
package was smaller than I expected. but good quality. doubt I would order again though. sizes vary from very small to thumb nail.	-1
These arrived with many beads missing.  The envelope had no padding and the plastic pouch inside was torn and smaller beads missing.  Very disappointing. Color was NOT at all like photo.  Nothing vibrant about the colors.  Not recommended at all.	-1
Absolutely none of my beads looked like the ones pictured.  Those pictured looked so nice.  I had planned to use them in jewelry making but not sure exactly what I'll do with them.  I should have listened to the reviewer who stated similar disappointment.	-1
The same as for the Distress Paper, I feel like I was misled by the advertising on this binder.  I am a housebound person with a chronic illness and depend on Amazon a lot.  This ad said it was a 3-Ring binder, not a D binder.  Not being a regular scrapbooker, I wouldn't have known that this wasn't a real 3-Ring binder.  Plus it came bent, as well as the stickers with it.  With all the issues I had with this order, I wasn't able to complete my husband's 70th birthday scrapbook in time.  It was disappointing.  Thank you.	-1
I wanted the basic shapes and font on this cart, so paid a lot more than I normally would for one (I usually wait until I can find carts for 20-30 bucks or just go without). This was a huge disappointment. The end caps feature, even after viewing several tutorials online, just does not work right. I know how to do it, but it doesn't cut right. The ends don't line up with the rest of the tag--so dumb! Do they not even test these things?! I also wanted the squares and circles on this cart. There's not point--neither cut well. The squares' corners aren't square at all, and the circles and ovals are always wonky. I talked to Cricut customer service about it and they said the Expression 2 just doesn't cut those very well. What?! That is NOT okay! Now I'm considering getting the Explore just because it's supposed to cut well. I shouldn't have to spend more money on another machine to do what the machine I have and carts are supposed to do in the first place! SO irritating! This is an older cartridge, so hopefully they're improving them as they go, but seriously, I'm very irritated that I splurged on this cartridge that's not much more than basics, and it doesn't even work right. I'm also really irritated that I splurged on the E2 when it clearly wasn't built to do what it's designed for! Grrr.	-1
Metal too hard	-1
Do not like.  Does not cut well at all.  Even through one layer of fabric they don't work well	-1
1st cutter ordered,  looked like it was a used item. arrived in poor condition. returned and received 2nd cutter, no problems with the return or receiving the new order  this one arrived in a little better condition but still looked cheap. Used the cutter and it worked like a dream!  i thought YES!!! this is great, it can really really cut material ( I quilt and home sew) and the design is so very easy on my bad shoulder, AND  its made specifically for lefty's I thought fantastic!!!  until the 2 nd time i used it.  The guard that covers the blade when its not in use is so cheaply made that after 2-3 uses the little EXTREMELY thin and cheaply made spring that helps to hold guard in place has come off. Now if you don't have any little ones around and if you are extremely careful not to pick up the cutter by the blade than Yes you can STILL use it however I would NOT recommend it.  So I would like a refund however I don't have the package or envelop (me bad) . So now I don't know if I can send it back..  I am so VERY sad this is not made of better quality I would not think a little higher quality spring would cost that much because it can really really cut and the design is soooo easy on my shoulder when i used it.  I am going to think about this before trying to send back,. However I would not recommend this item to anyone until they fixed the problem with the guard.  Sorry.	-1
I was researching two part mold making and decided to try this.  From the tutorials I found this type of clay (plastiline) is used successfully to make two part molds. Upon arrival I noticed it was very soft which was fine but as another reviewer has stated it is very greasy. I tried to use this to "sculpt" around a form in order to get the perfect seam line for my master mold but this stuff stuck to me, the model, the box mold, the tools... it was a nightmare. Will be looking for something else.  *Update: Since I'm new at mold making I should have read more carefully and realized the sulphur would react prior to purchasing... Though my initial review may be a bit of a goof I have to add that if I had bought this for sculpting purposes (which is not farfetched being as I am an artist) I'd still hate it. The residue and smell of this clay is still stuck to my hands three days later.	-1
The soft version of this clay is VERY soft and oily. I really can't use it. Maybe it is for people working on a large scale. It seems unusable for small scale projects. I am going to stick with cleaner plasticine type clay.	-1
pulls the fabric. Not sharp. Not worth using.	-1
Didnt work as expected. Hard to punch through paper its not very sharp.	-1
First of all, the spring keeps popping out and secondly, the cutter does more pinching than cutting.  I continue to use it but am not pleased with it's performance.	-1
took it out of the package and the rod fell out.  I was able to put it back but every time you turn it side ways it falls out.  You get what you pay for....  That's all I can say!	-1
I'm not sure if it was opened or not but it just came in a plastic little bag and on top of that there is rusting at the tip and it's also a little discoloration on the top it's not shiny like I thought it was. Keep in mind when you look at the pictures I never used the product	-1
just so so.....it tends to hang on the cloth like it is dull or something, don't like it and it has been shoved to the back of the drawer in the sewing room	-1
I was very impressed when this notcher first arrived; It was inexpensive and performed its task well. 2 months of moderate use and I have to replace it already. I have to adjust the female portion of it after every few notches or it only cuts one half of the notch and I end up having to go back in with snips to remove the remaining paper (not a problem if your time is worth nothing). I should have spent a little more money and got a better product because as the saying goes- "Buy it nice, or buy it twice"	-1
I guess I was expecting more from this product. It's just a punch. I was expecting a V notch.	-1
It is not very sharp at all! To be a pattern notcher it has to be very sharp because of the nature of the pattern paper: super thin paper + a dull notcher is a nightmare! Look for something more substantial that would be made with sharper and better materials. I have to fold a scrap piece of paper several thicknesses and place it on top of the pattern for it to cut well. Also, its quite hard to press down. Definitely not my favorite to use, and if you're a fashion student planning on making this your career, INVEST IN SOME GOOD SH*T!	-1
This will not cleanly cut a single piece of cotton fabric.  This is junk and I will not waste a single penny more on this junk, I won't pay shipping back so will keep it.	-1
does not punch evenly on lighter weight pattern paper	-1
Doesn't work well. Notch hard to make and is too small.	-1
Nice idea but it isn't sharp enough to do the job and I expected it to notch a triangle like pattern symbols but it just makes the indentation of a triangle with a little punched out line in the middle.  I tried on fabric first in case it was like sheers---no good, so I've been using it on my hard copy patterns.  Not worth looking around for it really--easier to just use the scissors in my hand.  I rarely give less than 4 stars to anything because I try to research everything so well before I buy....but....sorry....didn't like this at all.	-1
I was bummed when I received this. From first use it was dull. It would only punch one side of my notches. I really don't like to leave bad reviews unless the product is truly deserving. This product was unsatisfactory. :[	-1
What I received was a DY (Dah Ying) made in Taiwan brand punch that produces a notch about 0.06 inches wide by about 0.3 inches long. Seems to work OK on heavier paper - but not well on thin pattern paper. I'll probably junk this one and look for something better.	-1
Not really good as a pattern notcher. I can't get it to go through the fabric. It's actually an ID card punch, not a pattern notcher. I've had it for about 2-3 months and I've tried to make it work, but it just didn't.	-1
Blades are not sharp.  Does not make a clean "clip".  Not recommended	-1
Won't punch anything... Fabric or paper.	-1
This tool sounded great, but I was so disappointed.  The "size" of the notch is extreme small and it will hardly cut through two layers of lightweight fabric.  It tends to stick or hang up on the threads.  Totally useless.	-1
Extremely waxy. Not rich. Hard to blend. Anemic. More like a crayon than a pencil.	-1
To cover what we had we needed a lot of this stuff. Later on it peeled up in strands as if it was just elmers glue. Wouldn't recommend on high traffic areas (dogs, party's).	-1
none of the patches matched my boot to repair it	-1
This did not work at all.  The color mixing did not come close to matching the product I needed to repair.  It was a waste of money.	-1
The glue is ok. But dries pretty hard	-1
These aren't worth it. It doesn't stick well. If you need something that really holds, you'll need to look elsewhere. It might not even be good for temporary tacking.	-1
Returned as some of my kit was hardened when opened.  Received refund.	-1
Looked good at first but wore off soon after. I was using it on my viynl couch and has better luck just using modge podge glue.	-1
Waste of money	-1
I couldn't make this thing work right.  It's supposed to lift paint, but it just doesn't do it --maybe it's made to scrape the paper???	-1
This was a waste of money, it broke the first time I used it.	-1
It's a chiseled piece of wood.  Buy something similar for fifty cents, and save your money.  The dry mastik does rub off of the applicator, though.	-1
So far not impressed, but using on textured/velvety kind of paper, it balls up and the applicators are crap, which you spend $8 for 2 empty bottles.  Think will stick to gum arabic, or you can use just plain old fashioned gum glue, it comes right off.  Trying trombo also, it comes out very bright blue with sparkles, letting it dry, my worry is that it will stain.  This is not for any kind of textured paper, just graphite pencil paper which is very smooth, so smooth paper where you can have a lit of details and I would apply with a fine tip brush.  If my opinion changes I will update this review.  I do pastel, carbon and coloured pencil, also watercolour paint.  Do semi abstracts and realism, or at least I try realism  lol	-1
I have to get this from Amazon because I couldn't find the color that I want from my local Jo-Ann Fabric Store.  At Jo-An, the 20g (0.7 oz) package is less than $4 (without coupon) and the wool is nice long and easy to work on.  This is not a good one.  The package is 2" X 4" and the wool is not good at all.  Very very short and broke easily.	-1
Not very good quality and not much for quantity.  I would not purchase this item again.  If looking for quality felting wool, keep looking.	-1
I purchased this item when looking for a source for good quality colored wool. I love the wool but was disappointed when I found the exact same thing at Michaels for about $4.50 (regular price). If you don't have a source near you, this would be a good option but if you have a craft store that actually carries wool felting supplies, I'd check there first.	-1
Color doesn't blend well together and the finished project just looks wrong - I ended up scrapping my projects because it just looked horrible.	-1
I think it was fixable, but it got very dirty easily and the fibers were rough.  My daughter decided to toss it rather than fix it.	-1
Very hard to open and close if you don't have nails or another tool it will be hard to open and close.	-1
I bought this to perforate cards for embroidery. It's not very sharp. I threw it away.	-1
It's already broken. Certainly not worth the money I paid for it. Better off buying the simple thin wire loops for 97 cents for three. WILL NEVER BUY IT AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!	-1
I love the other ones, but these do not fit my Makin's extruder. It took hours to file them and still cannot do the smallest one as it won't fit in the drill.  So disappointed!  I was looking forward to these with great anticipation, and they are supposed to fit. It says they will fit, but from the reviews I see, it's hit or miss. The size of the extruders must have changed somewhere along the line, and for some of us, these won't work!	-1
If you want to spend $6.00 for a for a straight pin have at it.  It is just a tip, what does it fit? Complete con job.	-1
Didnt get tip I ordered! Cannot use metal tip with nothing to screw it to!	-1
The hole was to small the glue would not come out.	-1
You don't need	-1
I purchased this to go on my glitter glue top and it wouldn't work	-1
do not waste your money..... I have yet to figure out just what I was expecting. but  the tip off of a lead pencil and a quilting needle which is stainless by the way was not what I was expecting. Please go to the model department at hobby Lobby and buy a bottle with a fine tip it costs less than $5 and you can use your coupon for 40% off.	-1
Ok	-1
What in the name of all that is living did I pay $12 for? I'll tell you.  An expensive sewing pin in a clear container.. I am not sure what I thought I saw in the picture but it's clear I need to stop late night internet shopping.  Unless I am not sure of what the real purpose of this sewing pin is in this clear container with the black top; I would advise that you don't waste your money on such a sinceless purchase.  (Go to a craft store or department store and purchase these stick pins or whatever they are called)...Art Institute, you got me!! Fool me once shame on you.. fool the readers, shame on me..	-1
Colors look a like faded and paper feels very cheap. However, it does its job and I use it with my students.	-1
unfortunate design, sheets are not connected. 500 sheets will be all over the place now:(	-1
thank you so much	-1
Very thin paper. It would be good with projects that are simple for children and everyday art... but not great with something that one wanted to keep.	-1
To expensive for construction paper	-1
I generally read the reviews and failed on this one.  Wish I had read them... As a former school teacher, I am accustomed to construction paper being a heavier weight - won't flop over when holding it in your hand.  While the colors are pretty, the weight of the paper is too lightweight for the projects I had purchased this for.  Plus, the white construction paper in the back is no heavier than computer copier paper!  Very disappointed. Would consider sending back, but the plastic wrap around the paper was totally off inside the shipping box!	-1
I was very disappointed with this product. This paper is so flimsy, I don't know how they can call it construction paper.	-1
This really should be titled "Watercolor Techniques for Papercrafters/Scrapbookers" because that seems to be the target audience: people who want to play around with watercolors to make cards or small paintings but who have no interest in approaching watercolor with mastering the medium in mind.  As an advanced watercolorist, I got nothing useful out of this DVD. Nor can I in good conscience pass it on to friends who are serious beginners because the presenter demonstrates consistently poor watercolor technique, including overworking wet passages and working with globs of paint on her brush due to failing to properly mix/mull her paints in the palette. Besides which, the constant plugging of the presenter's line of products was pretty irritating and as you might guess, there was no discussion of alternatives. If it wasn't for that, I might donate this to the library but as it is, I'll probably just toss it in the bin.  I gave it two stars instead of one because production values were reasonable and I think there IS an audience for this product. I just don't think that audience is me or any serious student of watercolor. There are much better DVDs out there for such learners, for example various DVDs by Birgit O'Connor, Gordon MacKenzie, Sterling Edwards, and Ian King.	-1
Broke into a million pieces in the field, and the light flickers.	-1
Serioulsy, they needed to advise their consumers that the Cricut did not take the 6x12 " mat.  Why in the world would they sell this thing if  you can't use it in the machine?  I was not happy and of course, it would cost me to return this so I didn't, I just kept it.  Not worth the money.	-1
The campaign for safe cosmetics published a study in 2009 on lead, nickel, cobalt and chromium in childrens' facepaint kits. You can easily google it and find it. They report Snazaroo's had the highest lead content of the 10 facepaint kits they tested, 0.56 parts per million (page 8 of their report). This is 5.6 times higher than the maximum amount of lead allowed in candy, 0.10 parts per million, and almost 40 times the maximum allowed in water, 0.015 ppm (pl. 13).	-1
At best, this product seems to only work on a temporary basis. I ordered it with the belief that it would hold permanently.	-1
This is not a good product at all.  Tried smoothing things applied with Modge Podge and it tore the paper.  Then, the Modge Podge wouldn't even wash off the rubber roller - Used this two times after which it became useless and am throwing it away.  Fortunately it is cheap, but not worth even the cost of the packaging.	-1
I bought this brayer quite a while back...and just recently began to use it again.  The quality does not stand up to a lot of use.  The inserts that keep the roller intact started getting loose.  And the handle opens when you apply pressure while rolling.  I was just starting to get supplies together for future use, so I wish I had tried this out sooner.  It would not be a repeat order.	-1
came with leakage through to package. Cannot return due to flammable content.	-1
On the up side - as an add-on item, this kit only costs $3.66 right now.  The quilling paper is worth that.  After doing the snowflakes (which were wonderful!), I wanted to try this.  The generic directions for the quilling shapes (which were the same directions in the snowflake package) were fine.  But the directions for the angels were not good at all.  Unlike the snowflakes, the diagrams of the angles DO NOT include the individual pieces of quilled work that make them up.  I made the one that is in the middle of the bottom row (although the directions said to use blue, not red), and I really struggled with the skirt.  The directions do not tell you how many pieces (in this case marquises) are to be used.  I just tried to fill in the skirt outline which was on the directions.  The directions should be organized better - listing each angle separately.  Detailed outlines of the quilled pieces should be included for the entirety of the sketch to provide direction.  If a piece uses marquises, then the number should be provided.  The directions are jumbled like someone was trying to save paper rather than trying to be clear.	-1
Definitely not the best stuff out there. For me it barely worked better than water. I had higher hopes for a Ranger product.	-1
Why on earth would anyone think an over-powering fake bubble gum scent would improve this product?  The first time I used Ranger stamp cleaner I came down with a migraine headache within one hour.  I threw out the bottle immediately and bought "Grandma's Secret Rubber Stamp Cleaner" instead.  Grandma's has absolutely NO scent, cleans my rubber and acrylic stamps like a dream and I have no worries about migraines.  Folks at Ranger: I'm not the only person with a scent allergy -- you might want to re-think your design.	-1
So cheaply made.	-1
I tried these scissors and didn't find anything special about them.  I'm used to the Gingher's brand so in comparison these were disappointing.  I don't understand why people get so excited about these scissors.	-1
Clearly, the worst scissors I have ever purchased.  I do not understand the fascination with Tim Holtz products.  These scissors are HORRIBLE!.  Terrible for detail cutting, leaving rough edges and little 'bits' attached to my cutouts.  Cutting through a single layer of cheap, clear packing tape left LOADS of residue on the blades, which I could not entirely remove (used GooGone).  The "Kushgrip" is anything but cushy - they hurt my hands after cutting images on just one layer of the lightest card stock.  A pair of children's rounded scissors would cut better than these!  Don't waste your time or money - these are total garbage!	-1
It's too thick for my intended uses in scrapbooking, so I rated it according to that purpose.  It appears to be of fine quality in general.	-1
I literally have over.sixty pairs of scissors. I sew,quilt,scrapbookt,tons of rubber stamping ,make cards,crochet,do counted cross stitch,embroidery, silk ribbon embroidery,sew clothes, make purses , and love quilling and other paper crafts,you name it I do it. I have sewing scissors that are expensive like my Gingher Scissors to 2 dollar scissors. This is the only pair of scissors labeled non stick that stick to everything. My first pair I tried cutting EZ Mount to mount a stamp. I barely started trimming and it was gumming  up my scissors immediately. By the end of it they were ruined. I tried cleaning them with gunk remover and still had horrible sticky residue. I've never been able to use them again. For a test I took a,cheap pair og regular scissors and a,pair of non stick scissors. Out came the EZ Mount again. Regular ones had small amount of residue that EASILY cleaned right up with gunk remover. Non stick pair,chf through lime butter with no residue at all. Save yourself a lot of moneg and get any pair of non,stick scissors but these. P.S. I am big Tim Holtz fan and own MANY od his products. Was so surprised I purchased a second pair I tried cutting out some items on sticker paper with the same results as EZ Mount. what a shame.	-1
First pair of scissors I rec'd has a chip on the tip of the pointy blade (pic included. kind of blurry) so i requested a replacement. Replacement came shortly and the tip on that one is still kind of dented. But the most noticeably damaged part is that the replacement is damaged on the handles (rubber is nibbed off, looks like it got poked by sharp object, and the other side, has a straight cut on the handle-pic included), then the handles on the other side is dirty. This dirt mark was not see on my original purchase. I sent Amazon another request for a replacement, pending to receive and see what's going on. Hope 3rd time is a charm.	-1
I was expecting real chipboard like what is used to make craft boxes or albums. This is nothing more than thick cardboard. Disappointed	-1
This did NOT work in my Silhouette Cameo. Guess I'll figure something to do with 25 square feet of boring-brown cardboard in my classroom.	-1
This is the perfect size and I thought the perfect weight.  HOWEVER if you love to collage your hand made book covers (like I do) this will NOT work.  It WARPS!  I now have to order heavy weight and re-do the book covers.  This may work for other uses but it's definitely not the right stuff for collage.	-1
This scissors look like it has a sharp tip, the pair that arrive to me was chipped even though the plastic protector was in place. I ordered them for the tips, to cut into the very narrow spaces.  I like the wide handle it makes the scissors fit nicely in your hand.	-1
This medium weight chipboard would not cut shapes with my dies and Cuttlebug. It fed through, in fact back and forth several times, but chipboard was just too thick for the thin dies. Will have to find something thinner.	-1
Just received this today.  I expected both sides to be white - but only one side is white, the other side is brown.  I needed white board on both sides.  I even paid for 1-day shipping on this. Very disappointed.	-1
I ordered Grafix and received Silhouette which is not going to work for my project. The Silhouette chipboard is fine for its applications and I kept it to possibly use on another project. I also paid the Grafix price for the Silhouette chipboard which is cheaper. Not happy. Caveat emptor, folks.	-1
I've been using these scissors on nearly a daily basis for five months. I loved them when I first got them but now it's clear to me that I've wasted my money. Starting in a fully opened position and slowly closing them as I turn the piece of paper I'm cutting and so far all is well. Once the blades are nearly closed they start to bind and if I finish the cut allowing blades to close completely, they resist opening again. I have to think about what I'm doing, and use all my strength to open them back up again. As long as I don't allow blades to close completely, I'm all set but who wants to cut for hours under those circumstances. I bought this brand because I thought Tim Holtz had top notch quality products. I wonder if Tim wants my five month old scissors.	-1
It seems I'm the only one that really dreads using these Tonic scissors. Yes, as expected they do cut well, as indeed scissors should, thank you,,,but for me they are getting harder and harder to use. The blades are so resistant and i wonder why. I cant loosen them, altho i tried.  My hands hurt after using the Tonic on any of my projects, including simple papers. So i ultimately end up putting them aside and picking up my, o so comfy, Cutter Bee...and yes they too cut well. I have these Tonic tim holtz scissors for about a year or more, and purchased them at a local NY artsy shop. I never would have bought them if i knew about this problem  up front...Well, unlike the rest of me !, maybe my hands are just getting old. ...If possible, I suggest people try them out before buying.	-1
This card stock is not very thick. Tears too easily. Same thickness as bond paper instead of card stock.	-1
A Waste of time -- took 9 days to et them -- and money. These were THIN, light weight , if fanned, they would flop. Thinner than the cardboard backing of my writing pad. Profoundly disappointed. They look and feel like CARDBOARD! I would have returned them but  as I waited so long to get them and my need is great, I'll use them. But will never again buy these or from this supplier.	-1
"chipboard" im thinking something more sturdy this is cardboard	-1
Seems a lot thicker than a Medium. Hard to score!	-1
Too light weight to use for books. A waste of money.	-1
I didn't know this was so thick i can't  cut it.  i should have returned it but will find a use somewhere.	-1
Not really white. One side of kraft chipboard has very thin layer of what almost looks like a whitewash - definitely not a solid white.	-1
I have been purchasing this for years and recently they have limited the purchase quantity to 1 which forces me to buy it every few days as I go through a lot of it for work. Well now they have blocked me from buying it at all.  The representive I spoke with said they were perplexed as to why it wouldn't allow me to purchase. I spent 40 mins on the phone only to be hung up on by the first person and having to call back trying to get to a resolution. If this is a new policy you may want to fill your employees in.  I spend several hundred dollars on a month through prime and will be rethinking my membership if I can't rely on you for my work supplies.  Also the last few batches I've purchased have had dirt on several pieces.	-1
Not practical for a papercrafter.  Guillotine blade is already cutting rough after one week.  Not able to measure cuts smaller than 1" - and 1" is difficult.  Papercrafters need easy cuts at 1/8".  Rotary mechanism is large - obstructing view....making it especially difficult to quickly make mats slightly larger than original.  Lots of blades - but not very useful blades - would like to see a deckle blade included.  The platform is covered with measurements for photos of all sizes - but normal rulers are not easy to use.  Rulers at top and bottom go backwards - assuming you will use guillotine only.  There is a ruler in the middle to measure from rotary blade....but not useful when cutting small pieces such as cards as it six inches up from paper rest.  There is a vertical ruler - but all rulers are difficult to read because of all the other photo measurements printed....all you see is lines and numbers.  On the plus side - do love the locking feature for making straight cuts....although one of my locks feels as it will break any minute.  I researched a lot of paper trimmers before deciding on this one - and completely disappointed...glad at least that I found a seller selling it for a reasonable price.	-1
very hard to use...markings are difficult.	-1
This is too thick to cut on Cricut explore. Returned item.	-1
Unfortunately, the six by six chripboard was smashed at two corners when I received it.  All the way through the package.	-1
Thicker than what I wanted. Will have to reorder a lighter weight.	-1
This is not what I envisioned from the description and reviews. Maybe I'm new to the world of crafting, but "chipboard" and that tannish color in the picture tells me that this should be the type of board used on cheapy clipboards, y'know, almost woodlike.  What I received was grey, unattractive, pressed cardboard.  I'll keep it because I'm sure I can find something to hide it behind in my crafts, but I won't be ordering it again.	-1
cracks like crazy. will not be ordering this again.	-1
This sewing machine is just awful.  As a recent college grad, I was excited to start using some free time to make nice gifts for my family and friends.  This machine was middle of the line (not too cheap, not too expensive) with some extra features and the Singer name.  I thought purchasing a Singer on sale was a steal but this machine has been the worst thing I've ever purchased.  It worked fine for the first project but then something inside must have come loose and the thread will get completely knotted and stuck in the presser foot and in the bobbin, bobbin case, and all over and around the inside parts.  When this happens, the material has to be cut out from the machine since the machine literally sews the material to itself.  I've taken the machine apart several times and re-aligned it, but this only helps for about 1 seam length.  Then the machine starts clunking and making weird noises and catching material again.  DO NOT BUY THIS MACHINE!!!  Spend the extra money and get a good machine.  It'll be worth all of the frustration, wasted time, wasted fabric, wasted thread, and rushing to purchase last minute gifts because the beautiful gift you were almost done making has been ruined by your machine.  I am not a complete novice, I've been sewing on my mom's machine since about 3rd grade so this is definately not operator error.  My mom has had the same machine since before I was born (almost 30 years) and it's never needed more than routine maintenance.  This machine is a load of junk not worth the price to fix it.  I am just going to disassemble and recycle.	-1
Can't believe I fell for this. When I received it, I realized that I was just paying for shredded construction paper.	-1
Works as expected.	-1
Stains everything!! Not for me!!!	-1
I tried Staz On because of the claims that it adheres to surfaces like a sharpie pen ink.  It doesn't.  I am an engineer and a chemist.  I received StazOn today and did a side-by side test of a black sharpie pen and my new StazOn ink pad.  The StazOn Ink smeared of onto my finger after 30 min of drying at room temp.  The sharpie ink was dry in about a second.  I need pad ink for a logo I am stamping.  StazOn  does not stay on compared with Sharpie.  I am still looking for ink that works exactly like Sharpie.	-1
I ordered from Amazon, a black StazOn inkpad, a bottle of stamp cleaner to use with it, and a refill bottle of the ink. I have a major project to do, and all I could find on this product indicated that it should work for stamping onto wood as I am going to do.  When I opened the product and read the labels, they say to use only in a well-ventilated area. Uh oh. I have severe respiratory problems, and no way will I be able to use this product. Since I could not find anything here that mentions it, I needed to wave the caution flag. If you have severe respiratory allergies and asthma like me, this product would be a no-no.	-1
This is a newer product created by Herma to follow the product of the same name with removable adhesive. Unfortunately when you put permanant adhesive in this dispenser it frequently gets gummed up and you waste lots of time and adhesive trying to fix it. If you want a permanant adhesive tape dispenser I would take a look a refillable mono dispenser or the Herma vario which dispenses white double sided sticky tabs.	-1
Disappointed - did not work - smeared and ruined instantly.	-1
Woukl be the ideal size art tote box for me right now but I was immediately disappointed to find it can't hold a simple pencil. Not graphite, not charcoal not colored pencils because its a half inch short. Pretty sad for a company that brand names the product Art Bin.	-1
Product does not deliver. Colors are muted and never dry. Would not waste my money. I tried to buff it as instructed and no matter how many times I did this the paste would never set.	-1
there are better kits out there for cheaper	-1
This came in a wrapped package and it looked new. However, upon opening, there are large brown stains on the outside of the case. It looks gross and like it got wet inside of the package. Just beware!	-1
Not my favorite. I already had a ColorBox Pigment Cat's Eye stack and was happy with them. I wanted some darker colors and ordered this one with is "Chalk" instead of "Pigment". It bleeds through the paper and the edges get mildly fuzzy. It also stains my stamps permanently. It does the job, but not to my satisfaction.	-1
Had to return immediately as the edges were so jagged.  Spend the money for better quality.  You truly get what u pay for.	-1
These have a Very Short Focal Length.  Won't do for the purpose I intended.	-1
I'm not really sure why this was so much money...and now that I look at the current price, it's good to know it's dropped since then.  My daughter (who is four) couldn't really use traditional kid scissors and I was looking for something that provided a little resistance.  She likes these scissors, but I don't really think the rubber "automatic opening" thing didn't really provide the traction I had hoped it would.  According to the info on Amazon, it should provide some sort of spring action when the green rubber tip is in place, but there isn't anything happening with these for me.  It seems almost ineffective.  Maybe I have a dud.  There aren't instructions to reference for me to see if maybe something is out of place, which makes me feel like a moron.  I mean seriously, it's a pair of kid scissors and I should be able to figure out why there's no resistance, right?! :) The Fiskars scissors I also bought (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002TMXAY?redirect=true&ref_=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_17) were cheaper and provided the resistance she needed.  Though she loves the cool design of these Koopy Spring scissors more and prefers to use them.  Who knew buying scissors would be worthy of this long review?!	-1
Thin, colos light, not good for projects, disappointing	-1
I ordered this in bulk with other items, but now that I looked through my order details I realize that this item cost me $82.00 including shipping, which is completely outrageous considering I do not live internationally- I live in Alaska. I was completely blown away by this company's shipping estimates and was never refunded for the additional cost. It completely caught me off gaurd. The kids love this paper, I would order it again had it not been such a rip-off with the hidden shipping cost. I am very frustrated that I paid so much for shipping and highly advise people to avoid this company, as they tend to hide the actual shipping cost and charge you additional fees later. This paper is not sold through Amazon.  As for the paper itself, the colors are vibrant, the texture is great, and the kids love it. This item would have been rated higher had the company not charged me so ridiculously for shipping costs. When I looked at the package the shipping was around $15.00, no where near what I originally paid.	-1
Not very user friendly. I purchased a larger stretcher that does the job.  This one is awkward and doesn't have enough increments.	-1
After using to streach a ring the metal prongs that do the streaching do not return to thier original place. I have to use a rubber hammer to bring it back to its original size so I can reuse it again. The metal rod that you hammer through is soft metal and thends to get distorted and hard to use after numerous uses.	-1
It stinks like a mechanic's tool and is slimy with grease oil.  Disgusting!  If I want to return this, I have to pay return shipping, which I don't think should be my expense.  Had the description shown that it was covered in grease, I would have never ordered it.	-1
Had to be returned because it was scuffed up and not truly smooth which makes a big difference for what u may use it for.	-1
Good product, but too expensive. After I got it, I found it at a local store half the price.	-1
Aweful. This thing came so covered in smelly grease I couldn't use it. I have since tried numerous things to remove the grease and it still gets all over whatever metal I'm trying to work.  Not cool.	-1
My husband uses this block. The metal isn't hardened the way it was explained in the advertisement. He has been disappointed in this one. If the metal was hardened more and it was a tad bigger, it would be great!	-1
ok	-1
Ordered and the carrier refused to deliver because the package was damaged.  When I attempted to reorder the price from the supplier (Five Star Savings) had gone up, and there was a  notice the item was under review and was not available at this time.  I would recommend ordering it elsewhere.	-1
I purchased FOUR  4x4x3/4" blocks  BUT  was sent FOUR  2.5x2.5x3/4" blocks  now i have to send these and reorder what I should have received to begin with.	-1
I purchased this in two pound increments less than five years ago and I just pulled it out to fabricate a prototype.  The part A is as hard as a rock.  Unless you plan to use this up in a year or two beware of buying it in large quantities.  It was kept sealed in the original container in a climate controlled space.  I am very dissappointed in this product.  The manufacturer needs to put an expiration date on it.  It makes me wonder if the part A also oxidizes in the final mix.	-1
I didn't get white, I got black.	-1
It says "WHITE" on the UPC label.  I peeled the UPC label off; and, under that label states: "NATURAL"; so, the product is a natural color that is labeled as white.  The natural color is grey.  Some people may like grey; so, why the mislabeling?  The attached photo says it all.	-1
Not as good as I expected.  This is nice if you use it just to carry your beading project but it is very hard to open when the top is on.  Using it as a beading platform is difficult since it is a hard surface, you still need to pack a mat.  I  would not recommend this product.	-1
the tray came broken so I can't use the sections on the upper right	-1
Um,really cheaply made and splits easily...I got two?The packages they came in are tougher..Sorry,but...I cannot tel a lie!	-1
I bought Cricut brand vinyl, thinking it would be superior to anything available.  I am very disappointed.  It is extremely difficult to separate from the paper when peeling it to apply.  I am new at using vinyl with my Cricut and maybe there is a technique for doing this, of which I am not aware.  I will look for further information, but as of now, I am disappointed. I have spent a lot of money buying a variety of colors and all that I have tried to use, have been the same amount of difficulty in the application.	-1
Not as described. Puncher doesn't fit inside of this case.  Waste of money. I am so disappointed	-1
hated it	-1
Just don't, it's so hard to deal with, I went out and bought a binder	-1
Really didn't like it, sorry	-1
Very disappointed! I didn't expect the lines in my work from the pad.  It is easier to use a sponge brush for blending with a better result. Returned item	-1
I got this to use with alcohol inks and gourd inks.  When using it I found that it left little fragments of felt on the surfaces I was trying to blend . The fragments were large and really noticeable and I had to completely wipe everything off and start over.	-1
hate it	-1
just cut your own felt	-1
The felt leaves threads on the artwork	-1
Came scratched up.  Id lose too much money trying to get a replacement.	-1
I bought 2 Red jumbo storage boxes. One was bright red and one was an ugly dark maroon color. Sorry I posted this under the green color accidentally.	-1
Pros: - 12x12 with perfect size sleeves to fit scrapbook decor paper - sturdy material and canvas fabric to withstand travel and multi handling - good size foto window in the front - adjustable to add or remove protective sleeves  Cons: - when you need to add or remove the protective sleeves, it is such a pain in the rear to get the screw to stay still while trying to unwind it on the side - once you managed to get the top screw out, it's an even bigger pain in the rear to get the one out since half the scrapbook is loose and slides all over the place - depending on how many extra sleeves you try to add it is nearly impossible to get the screws back in to fasten the scrapbook closed!  ...I finally said screw it, returned this for a full refund and bought a 3 ring binder Pioneer scrapbook. So bottom line, if you do not plan on adding or removing sleeves from this scrapbook then it's a good buy, otherwise BEWARE!  On a side note, the seller was prompt in returning my request to return this item, but I had to contact them after a couple months when they forgot to refund my money!	-1
thin cardboard box. that's it. Not stiff or sturdy. I was expecting something substantial for the price of it. I don't know if it's better than a shoe box. It's  in fact a lighter weight.	-1
I don't understand why people buy or make these albums. This is my first time to buy a post-bound album, and I should have done more research before buying. It is such a pain to add refill sheets... the post is not long enough to hold all the papers inside. For more refills you have to order post extensions, which is crazy. Just buy one of those D-ring binders. They are easy to use and pain free.	-1
This box arrived with glue smears on bottom and seaming is poor.  The quality on this is not very good; It is a disappointment and I would not recommend to others.	-1
This is a cheap box and NOT acid free.  The lining is black and when rubbed gently with a white kleenex, the black dye comes off on the kleenex.  Over and over again. I finally gave up trying to get the kleenex to stay white. It is obviously a cheap black paper dyed in China. How this CA company can call it an acid free box, I'll never know.  Horrible.	-1
