Nice yarn after it's washed. Great for hats and scarves. Camo is always scratchy until you wash it for some reason.	1
Not glow in the dark	-1
Always dependable & prompt on pkg/shp, super excellent quality of yarn. Highly recommended seller.	1
My mother was in need of another skein of this brand and color of yarn to finish an afghan that she had started but miscalculated amount needed. She couldn't find it anywhere but Amazon came through with the product!	1

Love Red Heart yarn	1
This yarn was crap. Frays super easy. I let my daughter use it for practicing her stitches as it was useless to me.	-1
excellent quality	1
Made afghan for a friend---worked up just fine	1
This was just what I was looking for.  It worked in the item I was knitting and I was able to use it to repair a patio chair.	1
Great buy	1
The yarn arrived on,time and the cost we're true to the pictures. I can't  wait to start my new project	1
great yarn good for any project. Red Heart is one of my "go to" brands.	1
Matched what I already had here to complete a project!	1
decided to do some stash busting this week, made a few hammocks and a house for my rats, since they don't seem to like chewing on acrilyc yarn ( last non redhart hammock they had lasted 3 hours before they shredded it) so far every color except shocking pink has been perfect and up to red heart standards, shocking pink how ever is very loose, it likes to split at the slightest provocation  i made some simple stripey Crochet hammocks - 1 in Spring Green, Real Teal, lined with Amethyst - 2 in Shocking Pink, Pumpkin, lined with cherry red - 1 in Blue Suede, Country Blue, and i don't know, not entirely done with it, maybe Coffee or something?  and the house was Spring green, Real Teal, Amethyst  the rest of this review is just a list of some projects i am working on with this yarn   i have a Knit rat nest that's been taking up my 4mm knitting needles for ever but i love it ( pumpkin, bright yellow, spring green, and some rando homespun yarn with all those colors in it   i'm crocheting  a circular base out of Caffe Latte for a cat bed, going to knit up the sides with some Tea Leaf, bend them down on themselves, sew them up, stuff them, to make a soft ridge around it  and i'm crocheting a blanket for my dog, log cabin-ish style with every color i have	1
We are using this yarn for a charity project. I was so happy that each skein was wrapped in plastic.  Thank you.  It was easier to distribute to the people who are working on this project.	1
Received as promised	1
Fresh clay, good price, fast shipping.	1
Going to make winter hats out of this.	1
I was thinking it was glow in the dark yarn. Very good quality though.	1
My daughter loves this color and I love this color as well as red heart products.	1
I love it!  It's beautiful.	1
Soft and easy to use yarn. color is rich.	1
This is a great color scheme.  I might not have called this "Camo", but perhaps "Neopolitan".  The colors are brown, white and pink, just like the ice cream.  The brown is not harsh, and the pink is not loud.	1
good yarn!	1
It was the color I needed to finish an afghan. Fast delivery.	1
Wonderful	1
easy to work with so far. haven't had the chance to bake it yet as cant do it in oven inside house for fear of smells. no garage to buy an oven and use don't want to use outside in freezing weather. have to wait til spring or summer to buy oven and cook my project.	1
needed	1
soft and easy to use! Now i can make a batman clay polymer charm lol	1
I haven't met a clay from this brand that I didn't like. This black is very dark and rich in color.... Wash  hands before changing color though	1
This was a great deal and just as expected. My daughter loves to work with clay so we got this one for skin tones.	1
This is a good price for this product.  I like making jewelry and this size lets me work more in the medium.	1
Just what I wanted.	1
As described. Excellent color!  Fast shipping!	1
MY 93 YEAR  OLD SISTER WAS VISITING ME FROM TAHLEQUAH, OKLA-- HER HOBBY IS MAKING LAP BLANKETS FOR PEOPLE IN THE NURSING HOMES-- I HAD  PURCHASED A QUANITY OF YARN AT MY CHURCH RUMMAGE SALE WHICH INCLUDED  THE ABOVE COLORS-- NOT ENOUGH TO FINISH THE TWO  BLANKETS SHE HAD STARTED--  I TOLD HER I  WOULD LOOK ON AMAZON PRIME FOR THIS YARN AND SURE ENOUGH I FOUND IT FOR HER--  IN TWO DAYS  THE PACKAGE WAS SITTING ON MY FRONT PORCH-- WE BOTH LOVE THE RED HEART YARN-- IT IS THE BEST-- I HAD TO GIVE UP  CROCHETING DUE TO MACULAR DEGENERATION  BUT MY SISTER  HAS THAT CROCHET HOOK IN HER HANDS EACH DAY. YES, WE ARE GREATLY SATISFIED  ABOUT THE YARN AND ALSO AMAZON.	1
I love it, received just what I wanted.  I highly recommend the Red Heart yarn!!	1
Great for crocheting and knitting! Found a couple knots in it, though.	1
Love this yarn.  It has all six rainbow colors in the right order and makes the neatest border on the baby blankets I make.  I hope they never stop making it!	1
I really love this yarn. The color is great.	1
I received this yarn yesterday and I'm  delighted with the color!! It's much brighter than I expected it to be.	1
Nice blend of pinks and purples.  The yarn tends to fray a bit at the end which I wasn't thrilled about but as long as you leave a longer tail when you cast on shouldn't be a problem.  Using this for a toddler blanket, like that its one the softer side and machine washable.  The price point was good and it arrived quickly and in a sealed bag so that it didn't snag on the other items in the order.	1
Great to work with	1
Item: Red Heart E300.4313 Super Saver Economy Yarn, Aran Fleck I used this yarn to crochet an infinity scarf, and to be honest it barely made one loop. The yarn also kept getting tangled for some reason and some of it came apart. The little specks on the yarn that gave it the oatmeal texture easily fell out. I was really careful with the yarn and the scarf turned out alright. I won't purchase this yarn from this user again because I saw it for cheaper at Michaels.	1
This is a beautiful blended yarn and worked out wonderfully for my arts and crafts. Just as described. I would purchased more in the future.	1
very beautiful colors!	1
Beautiful I crochet ornaments for Christmas, The snow flakes will be dazzling	1
I love red heart yarn	1
Ordered for my mom and had it sent there.  She seemed happy.	1
tks, ro	1
Love this color.	1
Love this color, great yarn.	1
I bought it for my sister to put yarn braids and it come out lovely. It was very soft and bigger than expected. I loved it!	1
Super	1
The Coats Crocket Aunt Lydia's threat was as advertised.	1
I had to have a size 30 white thread to make a bride doll dress for my Granddaughter's barbie.  I love Aunt Lydia's cotton thread, thank you for your quick service.	1
I was designing a major lace project, but having no luck at all finding size 30 white crochet thread. I finally found it here. I was able to order enough to complete the project (about 7 balls) and get all the same color white. The thread itself is excellent quality, and a nice clear white color. It worked fine and the project, an 1830's pelerine collar, came out gorgeous!	1
I really like this vareigated yarn called Woodsy! I'm making a ripple afghan for my nephew. I've added a few rows of Red Heart Buff yarn to compliment it. If you think the yarn is rough feeling, all you have to do is wash it with some fabric softener, and dry it in the dryer to break down the acrylic fibers. It then turns out very soft! He will be pleased with it.	1
A bit more orange than coral but I love ALL yarn.	1
I love Red Heart yarn!!	1
Love red heart!	1
great yarn, great color, great price and prompt delivery	1
good yarn, good color and good price with prompt delivery	1
Works up well. Very even.	1
There is no dye lot so you can order as you need it. I like crocheting blankets and order 15 at a time. The color is neutral and fits any decor.	1
I bought this as an add on purchase so the price was pretty good. The color was a perfect match to my other yarn.	1
excellent, thank you!!!	1
I love this yarn!	1
Very good quality.	1
Perfect for tiny snowflakes.	1
I can't find this size thread locally. It was a relief to find it here at a great price and by a trusted brand.	1
I LOVE Redheart yarn. It is so wonderful to order large quantities for a fair price!	1
Love Redheart yarn.	1
Good quality yarn. Washes well also.	1
Color too bright. Much brighter than advertised. Makes a good companion to to the advertised pumpkin color yarn. That is if you like screaming colors.	-1
I love this yarn , the color combo make the pink pop.  I plan on buying more in the future:)	1
Excellent value. Pleasing texture.	1
love it	1
Red Heart yarn is the only yarn I use	1
Making an afghan and needed one more ball of this color.	1
Gorgeous color!! This is a soft blue shade. I crocheted overalls for my Minions & it looks like their little denim overalls. The yarn is very soft & easy to work with. None of my local stores carry it for some reason & the price on Amazon is the same, so it's a good buy.	1
I am happy with the yarn and the price.	1
The sellers price is nearly double the suggested retail price. I believed this was a Super Size skein but it was only a regular 7 oz skein. I wouldn't pay this price again for cheap acrylic yarn.	-1
Good value.	1
Awesome Seahawks green color	1
Always a good quality yarn.	1
Yarn came with some fraying but it wan't too difficult to conceal in the project I was working on. Fun color but I doubt I'll purchase it again.	1
soft and easy to work with. I was able to make several smaller pieces out of this skine.	1
great yarn, however not 364 yards as in description (I bought the camo)  but is 236 yards.	1
Fun color. It's a little brighter than the photo but not a big deal. I appreciated that it came wrapped in plastic so it wouldn't get dirty.	1
nice product, exactly as described	1
A customer of mine ordered some custom made items with these colors.  Normally, I wouldn't have chosen this yarn but it is so pretty!	1
Springy and light.  Just a pretty color combination.	1
My new favorite variegated yarn!  I have made many different crochet things with it.	1
Great yarn	1
Real great yarn. I'm putting a royal blue yarn with it and making scarves.	1
I love red heart yarn.	1
red heart yarn is good quality easy to use yarn.	1
great yarn lovely color	1
Great deal arrived on time	1
Love the color. The quality of red heart is always good.	1
Beautiful	1
Good utility yarn for blankets and afghans, and anything that will be machine washed and dried a lot. This was a good match for the older skeins of RH baby prints I had that still used dye lots. Works up at the specified gauge, and while not the silkiest to knit with, it is reputed to soften up nicely when washed and dried.	1
Just what I needed to finish an afghan so happy that it was still avable.	1
Ok product.	1
Beautiful bright yellow color. This yarn works up wonderfully and blocks nicely when washed.	1
I have been using Red Heart wool for years and years.  I make blankets for Project Linus, and beanies and scarves for those who really need it and sometimes gifts for my friends.  Its easy to work with, awesome choice of colors so that I can get creative and it washes really well.  Love it	1
the cookbook is sensational.  The solar light for our flagpole is beautiful at night.  The yarn made a very colorful purse and have requests to make more.  Very pleased with everything I purchsed.	1
The yarn is as expected.  However I was unsure why the gray yarn (which is the same as all the other super saver yarns) cost about $3.00 more per skein than any of the other colors..	1
nice color good for knitting a neutral colored throw	1
Spring green : warning...the actual colour is a lot duller than it looks on the screen	-1
Nice yarn for needlepoint and other crafts.  Not soft enough for scarves, hats, etc.	1
Great product	1
fine item	1
I love this yarn. The color is great, truly better than I had expected. I would have loved to give it a 5 star review, but one of the skeins has been cut in multiple places. Now I just have to figure out how to piece it all together.	1
Great yarn	1
I used it to crochet part of a blanket and a hat and they turned out great!  Easy to use and produces a nice looking product.  Will definitely buy again.	1
I used it to crochet hats and scarves and they turned out great!  It's pretty soft in texture.  Will definitely buy again.	1
I have not started my project with this yarn yet. The colors are as shown. I've used red heart yarn for many years.	1
Just what I needed	1
Great yarn for making blankets.	1
Good quality	1
Good economic yarn for crocheted baby items.	1
A good all-purpose weight for both home and wearable projects.  Handles nicely and provides warmth without extreme weight.  LOVE the colorway.	1
Lovely 'hand' to the yarn, works up well without splitting and snagging.  Versatile for use on afghans, pillows, and home projects as well as wearables.  Nice weight, too.  The colors make a lovely neutral ground for blue-lovers.	1
Loved the color of this yarn	1
nice	1
Always dependable.	1
This color was needed to finish crocheting an afghan in my nephew's college colors for a high school graduation present for him..  I love Red Heart yarn and have used it for many years for 99% of my projects.  I will order again if needed.	1
I am just learning to crochet and selected this yarn because it had great reviews, the skein was large and the price was low. The color is as vibrant and wonderful as the picture would lead you to believe, and the skein really is huge given the low price. I figured this would be a great yarn to learn and practice on. However, I think this product is for those who have a lot more experience working with yarn than I do. The yarn kept splitting apart. Very often my hook would go through the yarn itself, instead of through the stitch, causing catches and knots in my work. I found this very frustrating and it slowed me down a lot. Finally I gave up and passed this yarn on to a friend who is a lot more experienced than I am. The yarn is beautiful, but a nightmare for beginners like me. (Plus, it's on the scratchy side; it squeaked pretty loudly against the needles.) I recommend Lion's Brand yarns instead. They are somewhat pricier (and the skeins are usually much smaller), but I found that yarn to be much easier to work with.  P.s. - If you go to a specialty site dedicated to yarn crafts, like Love Knitting, Red Heart is pretty low down on the list of "most loved" worsted weight yarns. Not a good sign.	-1
ABSOLUTELY GREAT	1
Great yarn for large projects! this is not the kind of yard you want to use for soft projects (like a baby blanket or a cozy sweater)  but i think it's suitable for large bedspreads/blankets like the one i made using this yard (see picture). I found it very easy to  work with and i'm not exactly what you would call an expert in crocheting. The bedspread shown is the most intricate project i've done so far, took 2 months to complete.  TIP: if you think the yarn is too rough or scratchy after you have finished your project, soak it in cold water, fabric softener and cheap hair conditioner (any brand will do)  and it will be a bit softer after rinsing it! i did this with my bedspread.	1
This yarn was beautiful in color but the quality was horrible....so bad I'm thinking of writing to red heart.  It separated into separate strands almost through the entire skein, and I used 9 skeins out of the 10 I bought.  I would not buy this again...which is too bad because the color was really pretty!	-1
Beautidul color!	1
Always happy with projects made using  Red Heart yarn. It is so easy to work with and looks great.	1
Haven't had a chance to use it yet, but I have used Red Heart before and it has always done well for me.  This particular skein had a beautiful tone to the color.  It looked great in the picture on the web, but looked even better when I saw it.  This was my first time ordering yarn.  I was a bit nervous about not being there to feel it and actually see the color.  This particular was crucial to my pattern. It needed to accent other colors in the piece.  I was worried it would be too dull or too bright, but it is gorgeous, feels good to the touch, and accents my other colors perfectly.	1
I just bought this as colored string.  It works fine for that purpose.	1
lovely color. had made a knitting needle case. currently making a ten-stitch- sweater one minus star for it knots easily.	1
love it.....was perfect for my project....	1
Terrific!	1
Great deal and free shipping on 35.00.	1
Super fast shipping perfect Clean product	1
Lovely color.  You can't go wrong with this yarn.	1
A little thin than worsted weight, the pattern of the yarn makes great patterns once is knitted. Good quliaty yarn and soft for my baby to use the finished product.	1
Really like this yarn.	1
I love super saver yarns^_^	1
Love	1
My customers really like the hats I make from this yarn. But beware, Red Heart Super Saver yarn is quite rough to the touch so it is not for babies or those with sensitive skin. It is however the best price for the most yarn on the market	1
My customers really like the hats I make from this yarn. Beware, Red Heart Super Saver yarn is quite rough so it is not for babies or those with sensitive skin. But it is the most yarn for the least price on the market.	1
Very happy	1
The heavier textured yarn I talked about above. I love it. Takes the abuse a beginner like me can give it, using it over and over again.	1
Good stuff. First time to use this yarn Beginning crocheter. Thin texture, but good. Finding out the hard way that it may be a challenge to use with heavier textures. Since I am a beginner, it may just take practice...	1
Red Heart Super Saver is great for amigurumi (toys) and afghans. Personally I prefer wool for wearable items, but I have used RHSS to make things for people that were allergic to wool on occasion. RHSS is my go-to yarn for acrylic. Amazon sells it at the same price as my local stores; so, considering gas, it saves me money to buy it using prime shipping.  Amazon also has a much better color selection.  Some things to keep in mind:  Yarn that is made at different times, will be slightly different colors. That's just the nature of yarn. To avoid having a visible place where you joined a new skein, you can alternate skeins when you join a new one - do a few rows with the first skein, then a few rows with the second, for awhile.  All monitors are different, so there's no way to show you a 100% accurate picture of the colors of yarn. Amazon's colors are quite accurate on my screen, though.  This is a worsted weight yarn, but it's on the thicker side of worsted weight, more like aran weight. This is what makes it great for amigurumi, in my opinion, since those need to be dense. But if you're making something that needs to be a specific size, check your gauge first. Some colors of RHSS are thinner than others, so again, check your gauge.  If it's splitting a lot, you may be pulling the yarn in the wrong direction. RHSS is wound to be pulled from the center. On the label, it has an "A" and a "B" with arrows. On the side labeled "A", make sure the outside strand of the yarn is out of the skein. Sometimes it's worked its way out before the yarn gets to you, but you may have to pull it out. On the side labeled "B", you need to find the other end of the yarn that's in the center of the skein. Pull that out, and knit/crochet from that side. If you did that and it's still splitting a lot, it's possible the label came off somewhere along the way and was put back on upside-down - try putting the center strand back in the middle, and pulling it out through the other end.  The multi colored skeins are smaller (in amount of yarn) than the solid colored skeins.  RHSS is a bit course/stiff at first, but it softens up nicely after a wash.  If you keep these things in mind, you'll have a great experience with Red Heart Super Saver!	1
No problems	1
Great colot	1
I am using this to make a Tunisian style throw.  The colors are really fabulous.  I know the quality of the yarn isn't the greatest as I have used this yarn for another blanket which pills a lot with washing.  Other than showing wear from washing though, the yarn is very warm and easy to work with.  Considering the price, it is still a good buy and like I said, the colors are really great!	1
Just what I wanted	1
This has to be one of my favorite color combinations I've worked with this year.  As I was making the scarf I knew that I had to give it to my good friend as the colors were her colors.  The first words out of her mouth were just that.  You know me so well these are my colors.	1
It's good quality I guess, but it wasn't soft enough for my taste. Also if you plan on using this for a brushed yarn project, I recommend Red Heart Soft Baby stuff instead.	1
Fast and easy. Thanks	1
Loved this product & will definitely order again	1
Excellent  color	1
Red Heart yarn is very affordable and works very well for making afghans and throws!	1
I have crocheted many Afghans using this brand of yarn. It is my favorite brand. Afghans look great after they have been washed year after year and yarn is easy to work with. Good price.	1
Great yarn for my C2C	1
A little stiff but still good.	1
After using different expensive and inexpensive yarns, this brand seems to be the best. It is not so rough, yet very durable and they make every color you can think of. I think this has become my new go to yarn. This is especially great for first time crocheters and knitters. The color is so nice!	1
Growing up in the 80's, I learned to crochet with Red Heart yarn. We didn't have access to all the luxury yarns available today. As an adult, once I picked up knitting and crocheting again, I dismissed acrylic yarns as somehow inferior to all those expensive luxury yarns. (I wasn't quite a yarn snob, but I didn't like the feel of acrylic while working with it.) But I've since used Red Heart to make several afghans and throws, and I have to say I've totally changed my mind. I now recognize it for the value it really is: it's inexpensive, widely available, and virtually indestructible. (I still have and use an afghan my mom made me with RHSS about thirty years ago.) I also think the yarn has a lot of body and a decent twist. And by far, its best characteristic has to be its easy washability. I love that I can toss this in a washer and dryer and not fret about it. In a house with pets and/or children, that's an absolute must for me. I've thrown exclusivity out the window in favor of function and practicality. I like knowing that when I gift a handmade blanket to a loved one that it's going to hold up and not accidentally be felted or destroyed in some way!  My favorite way to buy this yarn is to use 40% off coupons at Michaels. Because there are no dye lots, I just run in whenever I need a new skein. I love not having to worry about stocking up on all of my supplies at the beginning of the project or worrying I'll run out of yarn. And with the coupons, an already inexpensive blanket ends up being dirt cheap. Being on a tight budget, this makes me really happy; it means I get to make more projects than I would be able to make otherwise.  Currently I'm using hunter green and aran for the double-knit throw I'm making my husband for Christmas. I'm only a few rows in, but the afghan is looking beautiful so far! The hunter green is rich and deeply saturated, and the colors look beautiful together. Some of the SS colors can be somewhat drab, but some of them really pop. The pic above doesn't do the color justice; I find that the photos on the RH website more accurately reflect the true colors of the yarn. Edit: I have since finished the afghan and uploaded a photo of it. Sorry the lighting isn't that great, but the stitch definition still shows through nicely.  As for working with it: okay, so it's not cuddly soft like 100% merino, but I've noticed in the last few years that RHSS has become softer. Some colors feel softer than others. After a washing (or a few), the yarn does soften and even "fluffs" up a little bit. The only drawback I've noticed is on particularly humid days in the summer or before a thunderstorm, the yarn gets really squeaky on my needles or hook, and I have a hard time working with it. But other than that, it really doesn't deserve the bad reputation that it has among the knitters of today.	1
I used this to make squares for a mine creeper blanket.  I liked the multi-tone effect.  Much easier than making many different blocks with many different colors.  It works up fairly nice but is slightly thinner than the super saver black, which is why it only gets four stars.	1
as described, always worth every penny!  LOVE RH	1
it had black ashes on my white yarn no  one wants dirty yarn	-1
Love this yarn!  I have not used it yet but I will be very soon.  I can't wait.  The color changes very fast so it is going to work fabulous for my crochet.	1
Great Price for a GREAT product!!!	1
Awesome price!  Thank you Amazon!	1
I have used this band of yarn for several years and it has always worked out very well.  I will continue to order from Amazon.	1
Love this yarn! It Red heart is the yarn I crochet with the most!	1
Perfect for the project my sister was trying to complete.  Quick turnaround.	1
Just what I needed to complete an afghan.	1
As expected and on time	1
Nice yarn, great for blankets. Beautiful color.	1
Great colors!	1
This wool might work well for crochet but for knitting the wool comes off as threads.	-1
Just as pictured	1
Just as expected. Easy to work with. Color true.	1
Nice	1
Love this yarn and color, perfect for a little boy baby blanket.	1
Beautiful	1
Very economical, it is warm, without the feel of wool.	1
good yarn thank you	1
I have been looking everywhere for this color. Shipping was very fast. I am very grateful and satisfied!	1
So, it's been a while since I picked up a crochet hook and did anything.  On a recent weekend out of town, I ended up at Michael's and thought how great it would be to start again .. it's only been 25 years, what could go wrong?  Well, it turns out that three skeins of yarn do not an afghan make (how that afghan is looking right now based on my memory of crochet lessons 25 years ago is a different and slightly embarrassing story).  Fortunately, I found the same yarn on Amazon and at a lower price.  The yarn itself isn't for making sweaters, hats, baby clothes, or anything else where you want that pillow soft feel.  But for a blanket to add to your bed for warmth it's just fine.  The colors flow into each other better than I'd expected and it's pretty.  It's exactly what I needed for my first project.  My next project I may feel confident enough to upgrade the yarn a bit .. but that's way, way down the road right now.	1
GREAT  COLORING	1
Great yarn	1
The perfect amount of yarn and the green is vibrant and true to what's pictures.	1
Does not scratch like some Red Heart Yarns. Perfect color for a shawl made for a man.	1
Love the color	1
Love this color	1
I can't even fabricate a less than desirable review. EXCELLENT ratings in all categories!	1
Great color.	1
Will be good for the blanket I am going to make !!	1
Got so many different dye lots that it will have to go into different items.	1
It will be nice in a blanket or scarves with the rich color blends & dye lots all matching.	1
Colors are great. The big problem is the marrakesh color is advertised at 364 yards but is actually 236 yards according to the skein sleeve. False advertising? I do know that  no 2 skeins of red heart are the same length no matter how they are marked. But 128 yards falsely advertised is ridiculous. I bought 4 skeins so I got shorted 512 yards or about 2 1/2 skeins. Received 20 more skeins today, 4/20. All were advertised as 364 yards per skein but in actuality were 236 yards. In other words I was fraudulently shorted over 2500 yards more with this order. The total shortage for all ordets received so far is just over 3000 yards.	-1
Great quality, true to colour stated. I'm new at crocheting and I do think it will be great for beginners and those more advanced at crochet. Shipped really fast as well! Will definitely buy this brand again. Also, much cheaper than in-store prices!	1
Red Heart is an excellent brand ... have always used it.	1
it was perfect, have been looking for that particular color for a while	1
This is a very bright neon color of green.  The picture doesn't quite show how neon it is but if you are looking for a bright green, this is about the brightest one that I have seen.  It is a great yarn to use to make a hat for a little one if you are heading somewhere where you want to see your child at a glance.  Anything made from this color is sure to catch your attention.  Red Heart yarn is a worsted weight (4) which makes it easy to do a lot of different projects with it. It is not nearly as soft as Red Heart Soft Yarn but when I want a really durable yarn (like toys for children, Christmas stockings, etc.), I reach for this style of yarn. I've used it for years and the quality is high for the dollars paid.	1
Red Heart yarn, always the best!  Beautiful vibrant colors!  Can't wait to start making my afghan!  Perfect for knitting or to crochet!	1
The color is much nicer than it appears in picture.mworks up beautifully.	1
really colorful.  fun yarn!!	1
As a brand new knitter, I love this yarn. It's soft, thick, easy to see. Maybe it's because I'm new, but I think it's the yarn itself that's causing this one issue I have. When I go to make the stitch, I'll accidentally poke my needle through the yarn but only a little. Enough to make the stitch too tight if I don't fix it. I think it's because of all the things I love: soft, big, fluffy yarn. Either way, the color is beautiful (I got the coral color), vibrant, and the only problem is easy enough to fix and might be my fault anyway. Would definitely purchase again.	1
Love this yarn too.  I use it for the middle and end of my throws and blankets now	1
splits hard to use on my knitting loom	-1
beautiful colors	1
great yarn, fast delievery,	1
Love this yarn.	1
Nice.  The only problem I have with these wools is that the different colors of this brand have different textures.  Also, this color is a screaming safety orange, not the nice golden orange pictured.	1

Pro's: The best things about Red Heart Super Saver Yarn are that it's do dye lot status, it's pricing is reasonable, it's sold in a million locations and it's quality gives it a strength that leaves you worry free when you sell items made with it or give items away as gifts.  Having the status of No Dye Lot, really saves me when I'm making projects.  Just today, I ran out of a color and went to check my stash and happened to have a ball I'd purchased a few month ago.  No Dye Lot meant that I didn't have to think twice about if the color would match my current project!  As a stay at home mom, price is always something I take into consideration when making crocheted items with any brand of yarn.  With a $2.00-$3.00 price range in most retail stores, I do look for skeins when they are on sale, but even if I have to pay top dollar I know I'm not wasting the extra money on something that I won't like.  Yes, I do like to splurge a little on yarn, but most times I'm making blankets and hats and scarves that will get a lot of wear and tear and I don't have to charge a million dollars for each item if I've only paid a few dollars for my materials.  The availability of Red Heart Yarns is amazing.  From my experience, if I walk into a store that sells yarn then they have Red Heart Super Saver Yarn.  It makes my life so much easier!  I can't say that I have a 100% grade for finding the colors I need since they are so popular with crafters, but usually it only takes two stops for me to find what I need!  Why do I really use Red Heart Yarn?  Simply put, the quailty of the yarn is amazing.  I've only been crocheting since 2009, but there are items that I made when I first started crocheting that are still in excellent condition.  My favorite is my daughter's afghan.  She's had it since birth and has gotten numerous "things" on it, but they have washed out easily without destroying the yarn in the process.  Con's: I can only find one Con to say about Red Heart Super Saver Yarn:  Some of the skeins seem to be "scratcthy" and some seem to be "smooth".  I'm not sure if I've just missed the memo as to which are softer than others, but there is definitely a difference between some colors and others.  The good thing though to fix this is that most regular fabric softeners can soften the yarn, but if fabric softeners aren't used, you can definitely tell the difference.  Final Thoughts: All in all I give Red Heart Super Saver Yarn an A+++.  If someone is a new crocheter or knitter I would highly advise trying this yarn because of the Pro's I've brought up...and if you're a more experienced artist, do pass up a chance to use a great yarn!	1
Loved it! I made a hat for my daughter and the yarn was perfect.	1
Got two different dye lots.	1
Great Thanks	1
I love this yarn! I've made three clutch hand bags and five scarves.	1
Great price and beautiful color	1
great yarn for crafts.	1
Nice yarn.  Not quite the color posted but I like the color I got a lot better.  A lot of particles come out of the yarn while I am working with it.	1
Perfect condition	1
excellent Red Heart yarn & prices, delivery surpassed all expectations!!!	1
Great solid color. I bought this to use with plastic canvas so I could craft a TARDIS. I think it is the perfect color for it. Good quality yarn. I always use Red Heart yarn in my crafts.	1
Color was as expected. Arrived on time	1
iTS OK	-1
A little to thin but it's ok	1
Good quality beginner yarn.  I use it for testing stitches and filler for additional colors on scarves.	1
Came individually wrapped per skein.	1
Shipped super fast. Was great	1
I love the color of this yarn!	1
Great service and product!	1
I love, love, LOVE this bright orange color! I have checked at a couple craft stores in town but could not find anything even close to this brilliant, bright orange. The yarn is soft but not super-soft like yarn that is used for baby blankets. I have not had a chance to work with it yet since I am waiting on more yarn to begin a project but I have worked with Red Heart brand yarn before and have always been pleased with it. Also, I got my package fast so I appreciate the quick shipping :) I would def buy from this company again in the future.	1
great	1
Huge roll, wasn't paying attention and did not realize this was the big big roll. Love the shade as well.	1
what can I say about yarn?  it is nice and I like the color	1
love the quality of the product	1
It did not meet my expectations.  I was expecting a light shade of coral.  It was nice and soft though.	-1
Received my yarn today & was very pleased that the dye lot matched some I already had! I am a long time user of Red Heart yarns and threads so I can't come up with much more praise except to say that its a good product to work with when using synthetics and although it may have some knots connecting the skein, I don't find as many as some other brands.	1
Purchased as a gift for a teen learning to crochet and was a beautiful, vibrant color and softer than it used to be.	1
It is very rough feeling yarn...too bulky.	-1
love it	1
awesome	1
awesome	1
Such a great price and the quality is definitely up to Red Heart standards..... loved the speedy delivery A+ to the vendor !! Thanks	1
will purchase again.	1
THIS YARN IS SUPER AND I LOVE THE COLOR.	1
Great yarn.	1
This is worst yarn I've ever bought. Instead of the strands being together it's like working with four separate thin strands. This happened with two different colors. I'll never buy this yarn from Amazon again!  I'd give it zero stars if i could!!	-1
it's  turning out fine	1
I really love this Yarn, the texture is soft and it lays very well!!	1
If you a knitter, you can never go wrong using Red Heart yarn! They have been around for many years & I have never had any problems when I have used their products.	1
Great colors - love the yard	1
I lost count of the number of skeins of Red Heart yarn I have bought and used through the years. It is a wonderful product and I have been very lucky with this yarn and the quality. What is dis heartening is the discontinuation of  colors especially in the variegated colors. I make a fleece blanket out of two pieces of fleece and after creating holes in the fleece do a crocheted pattern around the fleece with a variegated yarn and a solid color yarn to compliment the fleece pattern. I have made hundreds of these blankets and both the fleece and the yarn can be washed and dried and remain in good shape. The vast majority of the time I have  relied on coats and Clark red heart yarn but am now finding with dis appointment  the colors are disappearing. There are other brands to chose from and reluctantly I am being forced to buy from these other companies. Be sure when doing a project to buy enough of those colors needed. I would have gladly given a 5 star review if the product was still available as it once was.  :-(	1
Great yarn, soft, easy to work with.  Quick delivery.	1
Making a great blanket that I saw on Pinterest.  Could not find this anywhere.  Quick delivery and the yarn is very soft.	1
Perfect!	1
Everything I expected......this yarn is beautiful I have people waiting in line for it	1
Perfect and fast shipping - thanks!	1
Very durable and more gray than in the pictures. It was the right color and the one we wanted, but the lighting for the photo is pretty bad and doesn't portray its true hue.	1
Fast shipping and great product!	1
Nice bright yellow.	1
Comes in as described.	1
bought at a great price	1
This shade of Jade is a beautiful greenish blue. I am using it in an afghan of crocheted shells in colors of water from light to dark.  It is really beautiful.  Super Saver is not the softest of the Red Heart yarns but it is extremely durable and washes very well I like it for projects such as afghans or amigurumi or stuffed toys for my grandchildren where I want a sturdy yarn.  I like to buy Super Saver at my local big craft store when they run specials or have coupons but often they don't have all the colors I want.  When that happens, the internet and Amazon are great for getting the yarn to my door without any waste of time or money on gas.	1
Great color & product. Love this brand	1
Saved my project	1
Have no issues with this item.	1
Absolutely perfect! Couldn't find this anywhere in Fairbanks!	1
happy with this yarn	1
good yarn god price	1
Love the color	1
will buy again	1
excelent	1
Exactly what I wanted! Perfect!	1
I have been using this brand for years now and it is still as excellent as ever, very durable smooth and does not break easily, plus it looks beautiful when you make things with it. My favorite things are the wide variety of colors textures and quality it is easy to work with doesn't fray or snap off like some yarns that aren't made well do. This is an afghan I am working on using this yarn	1
I got this yarn to make an afghan for a friend who lost everything in a house fire. I've used Red Heart for many years and it was exactly what I expected it to be. Shipped very quickly. Highly recommended.	1
You know what you are getting when you get Red Heart yarn. The quality never changes and it fairly good for how cheap it is. Bought this to make a santa stocking, and he looks great!	1
good product, good selection	1
Very nice yarn.	1
I use this yarn a lot since I 'self taught' myself to crochet. Red Heart does really well for the wobbly looking things I make. I am doing a little better though. I have used this yarn and made some pretty decent caps and pot holders. The yarn products that I have made wash well and make it through the dryer. That made me happy. The afghan I am attempting with Red Heart is going well. The colors are nice and the yarn feels good on my fingers as I diligently crochet. By the way, crocheting keeps you from eating while you watch television, too. I recommend Red Heart especially for beginners like me because it does well and it does not hurt your budget terribly. It is a very good product.	1
Red Heart yarn is always good.	1
its a pretty yarn but not what I ordered. I ordered purple tones and got the candy color.	-1
Perfect for my project.	1
This yarn is advertised as having 364 yards per skein.  It only has 236 yards.  I can buy it cheaper at somewhere else.	-1
Red Heart yarn is the only yarn I've ever used.  I'm sure some are softer, but Red Heart is easy to find with multiple colors.  I love this color--Real Teal--and had to order an extra from Amazon since Walmart had only three and don't seem to be restocking.  Overall, it can't be beat!	1
Too tough! Cannot wear on body, only for carpet.	-1
Favorite yarn	1
good quality.	1
soft	1
Item as described.  Shipping took 2 days longer than amazon promised.	1
good yarn	1
beautiful color. nice yarn.	1
My favorite brand of yarn. Currently knitting an amazing scarf. I love the non-solid color.	1
Exactly what I needed	1
I love Red Heart yarn for my crocheting projects. Yarn is good quality and color is consistent. I ordered this yarn from Amazon, as an add on item and got free shipping, which made it affordable to send as a gift.	1
it's only 236 yds and the other's are 364 yds. OK! I'll look for the 364 yds next time. Still a great price. Dark Orchud is a beautiful color. I had to wear a mask to crochet the first skein. It's so linty. Where is all this lint coming from?	1
Perfect!	1
great yarn	1
great quality and fantastic color	1
No Problems	1
Absolutely beautiful rich color.  Wish I had bought more.  I live in Costa Rica and it's difficult to get yarn shipped here affordably.  A friend brought me a suitcase full of yarn and this is one of my favorite colors.  One thing I do have to say concerning the Super Saver Economy Yarn in general, I was surprised and slightly disappointed that there was a noticeable variation in the thickness of the yarn, not within the same color, but between different colors.  I had an afghan pattern that called for two shades of green and two shades of purple.  The purples were a thick yarn almost bordering on chunky.  The greens were much thinner, almost like a baby yarn.  I'm making the pattern anyway, since I can't run down to the store and find something I like better but the different between the yarns is noticeable.  And maybe it was my error expecting consistency across all Super Saver yarns but that is what I expected.	1
Great buy, exactly what I wanted.	1
It's yarn and it's cheap! My mom likes it a lot. Worth the money!	1
The yarn is thick enough and soft to make sweater plus reasonable price.  Love it	1
Already used this up making hats and women I know keep asking for one so there you go.	1
With Red Heart yarn, I always feel like I know ahead of time what I am getting.  And once again this proved to be true.  Maybe not the fanciest yarn but it works for so many things and I'm most pleased with it.  This one helped me finish off a sweater.  Thank you	1
It made a beautiful infinity scarf and fingerless gloves.	1
Excellent service and the product was delivered to my door. Very happy customer.	1
Love this yarn. I have used it for  30 plus years now. It is always consistent and I have never had and issue with lot colors not being the same. I don't ever remember someone say this.  It is super easy to use. Washes and drys (on Low till slightly damp) Beautifully. I have never had to use delicate laundry soap with this. However I don't buy laundry soap with bleaches or additives. *Ie oxi, colorfast or other things). I do was it on gentle cycle. I would not dry clothing or toys as they might change shapes. But blankets scarves and afghans wash away.	1
Love the Red heart yarn	1
These colors are so adorable together. I made leg warmers for my little ballerina friend. One skein made a set of leg warmers for a middle schooler. The yarn didn't knot when it came out and was easy to work with. I will buy super savers any time over any other yarn.	1
Lots of fun--great colors	1
This is a very pretty variegated version of the Red Heart Super Saver yarn.  It creates little spots of color rather than long runs of color change.  I find it really nice for making hats and scarves.  I generally prefer longer runs of color or solid colors that I can decide when and where to change colors.  The super saver yarn is durable but not the softest of yarns available from Red Heart.	1
Very happy to find this at such a great price.	1
Quality of yarn is great - easy to work with and color is bright.	1
good quality, better than what you can get from Walmart	1
This wasn't as soft as I was looking for and I was disappointed at that, but I use this to make flowers to go on the hats that I loom for my family and friends kids and newborn babies.	1
I mistakenly thought this listing was for the Jumbo Super Saver skein. Otherwise I would not have purchased. I like this yarn, it's very basic and works in crocheted afghans very well! However this price is more than double what I would pay for the same size skein at a local craft store. Please please do not buy this yarn here. Michael's or Jo-Ann has it for far cheaper. I highly recommend this yarn for big projects that need to be durable (like blankets) I just can't recommend Amazon as the place to purchase it from.	1
Very pretty colors, but this yarn seems to come apart very easily.	1
I really like this yarn for projects where I want durability.  If I want softness, I spring for a little extra and go for Red Heart Soft Yarn.  The super saver yarn is great for projects for children, Christmas stockings, amigurumi, crocheted rugs, etc.  There is so much color choice and the price is great (especially if you look locally and find it on sale at craft stores.)  I like that there isn't a dye lot issue and once you've used this yarn, you will know exactly the quality you will be getting in the future.  I've crochet with this for more years than I care to remember and it is one yarn that I can always find where other types go in and out of style and get discontinued.	1
Love the color, however, the yarn gets stringier as you use it until it is very hard to use due to extreme stinginess. The yarn threads do not hold together, after project is finished I will not purchase again. Very disappointed in Red Heart Quality. Have used Red Heart for decades, maybe I got a bad one????	-1
Yarn has a beautiful color and it is soft, however it is pretty thin, compared to other Red Heart yarns.  In some areas has some knots that needed to be cut out.	-1
can on time this yarn is very soft.	1
Very good yarn makes a great hat.	1
Always use Red Heart yarn for my projects.  Another pretty variegated color too.	1
I'm making afghans for family members with this variegated color and the stores no longer were carrying it, so I went on Amazon and found it.  It is a nice blend of colors and, so far, everyone has raved over the colors in their afghan.  One was a wedding present.	1
That's all that really matters.	1
Really liked this yarn it made a very nice scarf for my granddaughter.	1
Bought as a gift for my wife.	1
great product	1
Love this yarn!	1
Great	1
Super huge fan of Red Heart yarn especially when it comes to making afghans.	1
turned it into a snake scarf. it turned into a diamond back snake! :) a little bit hard and itchy but hey thats what you get for buying a cheap yarn.	1
Item received quickly and was exactly what I expected.	1
k	1
worked perfect to make a scarf for my brother in law who is an outdoorsman.	1
Beautiful soft yarn in a great color combo!  Pattern works up so nice. never disappointed in Red Heart yarn.	1
Yarn!!!	1
I've long been a Red Heart fan.  I love the fact that more than half their products are made in the United States (my home economy).  I find that Red Heart has a consistent product, whether it was purchased in the 1950s or today.  I have some ancient Super Saver, and it has held up well.  I love the color on this, and I love the fact that it holds true to the quality expected from Red Heart	1
I have used Red Heart Yarn for 20 yrs or more. I don't crochet with anything else.	1
Had started a project 2 yrs ago, put it up - forgot about it, took it out to finish it, and found I need one  more skein of Petal Pink... what are the chances I could find the same lot # after 2 yrs............Amazon had it...fantastic.	1
This yarn is perfect for knitting hats, scarves, or anything to wear to support the Seattle Seahawks	1
Perfect color, I knit a LOT...and love the Super Saver size, and Red Heart Yarn.  Thank you.. Grammie Gail	1
Great yarn.  I was in a hurry to buy this I guess as Walmart had it for the same price or less within a week or two but I didn't want to take a chance on not having enough to finish the afghan for my grandson in progress. As it was...didn't need it.	1
I ordered five skeins of this yarn. Three in burgundy, two in buff. Buff was seriously ten times softer a than burgundy, but usually garments made out of this yarn should get a 10-20 minute soak in fabric softener,  rinsed,  then blocked. It's  half the price of other yarns, and the colors are pretty consistent.  But it is definetly easy to work with soft yarn with wooden needles, which are way more quiet than awful aluminum clanking.  For 1 cent a yard, I can deal	1
Made a beautiful hat and mlittens.	1
Almost used all of the yarn	1
Great yarn, great price and great service.	1
Again, I purchased this yarn to match some yarn I had previously purchased at a local store.  I was so excited to see that Amazon had it, and that this brand didn't have lot numbers.  It was a perfect match and I finished the project I was working on,	1
just what I needed	1
Very soft and lovely for both crochet and knitting.. glides well... a little it tanner than an oatmeal.	1
Love the colors and softness of yarn.	1
Great yarn, and cheaper than buying in the store.	1
I loved this color. made a sweater for my puppy and she loves it	1
I am very happy with the texture and color of the yarn and look forward to adding it to the afghan I am currently knitting for my husband!	1
Love Red Heart yarns	1
nice Yarn	1
I use Red Heart all the time.  It's a great yarn.	1
The yarn sort of starts to separate as you use it, but still holds together quite well with normal use. I th I k my projects should last long enough. This is definitely the perfect craft yarn, maybe not so much for garments.	1
Excellent yarn as usual from Red Heart!  Used it to complete a "Raiders" afghan for my son!	1
Missing a label on one but over all looks perfect. Can't wait to use it	1
It's yarn, what more can be said.	1
Received before delivery date.  Like it.	1
great pkg/shpr.	1
Beautiful colors but very thin. It's more like a size 2 baby yarn without the softness than a size 4 worsted weight. Also it cost too much. You can save almost $5 per skein by buying the same brand at Wal-Mart ($2.88 each).	-1
i was not too happy to get half way through the skein and find that that yarn was severed and knotted back together. but it a wonderful yarn to work with. the colors are soft and vivid, and it has been kitted into a beautiful vest. i have received many compliments on the color choice. if you or someone you know is a fan of purple. this Purple Tones red heart yarn is a must buy.	1
Cool colors	1
Cool color	1
good.	1
In the past, I've bought this yarn from Walmart and really liked it. However, it hasn't been available for a while, so I thought I'd just order it online. The packaging looks the same, but the quality of the yarn is not good. It's thinner than usual, and it's difficult to work with because it snags easily.	-1
It is just what it says ECONOMY yarn, cheap but poor quality in my opinion.	-1
nice color - quality was good.	1
good quality yarn! will use again	1
Great inexpensive craft yarn.  Good color, nice texture!	1
It's good beginner yarn.  Inexpensive and easy to work with.  It's not super thick, so it's a little slow for big projects, but the colors are nice and it is soft to the touch.	1
Coral yarn It was just what I was looking for. Thank you	1
Worked out wonderfully.....	1
Always dependable yarn!  Great color options	1
I love these and its cheaper on here than in the store!	1
I love these and its cheaper on here than in the store!	1
nice size, good color	1
this is nice yarn and the color is pretty	1
Gorgeous color!	1
Thanks!	1
I would like this wool to be a tad softer.  The color is great.	1
I use this for creating dolls that are washable and won't lose their shape over time. However, I wouldn't wear anything made with this yarn, purely for aesthetic reasons. For a wearable garment, I would go with something involving natural fiber; not something acrylic like this yarn. Color shown is very close to actual!	1
Thank you!	1
I love redheat yarn. Never any dye lots and it washes up great	1
I love this yarn and I will be shopping with this store again. Thank you	1
Lovely to work with & beautiful colours.	1
When my Mom couldn't find this yarn anywhere in Albuquerque, guess where I turned?  To Amazon and found the very same color.  I was able to ship it directly to her.  Once again, great job!	1
Excellent	1
Gooooood	1
Thank you very much!  Arrived in time and the color is beautiful!	1
very nice shades of color. Exactly what was promised. Thanks.	1
This was a great yarn. The color is right on!	1
I just received the 4 skeins yesterday, 12-6-14 & they are awesome colors to work with & can not wait til I start a blanket with them.  So glad I ordered & I really enjoy Red Heart yarns !!	1
Quick delivery and item just as described	1
Excellent product great color shade fast shipping	1
Perfect color for the project I was working on and ran out of yarn. Was able to finish project in time with this	1

It is exactly what I needed to finish my blanket!!!	1
LOVE GOLD YARN	1
Fast shipping! Not the highest quality yarn, but nice enough. I made a really cute afghan with this camo. Turned out great!	1
I was looking for yarn for an afghan, and this yarn is working out wonderfully.  It's not to "fuzzy" so the stitches are easy to see and I know it will wash well.  The variegated colors are making up beautifully!  Good all purpose, washable, pretty yarn!	1
this was everything I expected	1
excellent quality, still using the yarn	1
this yarn is such a lovely color. Very easy to work with.	1
What I expected	1
Just the right shade for my eagles blanket I am making?	1
Beautiful color, Great Price!	1
Perfect for school colors	1
Red Heart is my default yarn for crochet projects.  I highly recommend it.  What I cannot recommend is the price.  I bought a skein of Super Saver Economy Yarn, Grey Heather in early October of this year, from this page on Amazon, from Supermart, I believe.  It was under $3.00 then ($2.79, if I recall correctly).  Imagine my disappointment when I tried to order more less than a month later and the price had jumped to $7.03!  Just a few days ago, Joanne's was having a sale on the same yarn for $2.49.  As of this morning, Supermart's price had dropped to $6.58. Good.  When it drops back to under $3.00, I'll order again.  I understand the seller's right to set the price for the product.  I also understand my right (and budget responsibility) to take my custom elsewhere.	1
I'm a beginning knitter and I bought this yarn because its pretty. Upon getting it and working with it, I am very impressed by the beautiful colors. It ranges from the softest lavender to a deep jewel purple and it just really pretty. Its also easy to work with. However, the plies (is that the right word? strands?) easily separate and I'm constantly finding sections of the yarn untwisted and as many individual threads instead. Still, it seems nice enough for the cost, and like I said, the colors are gorgeous!	1
perfect	1
Perfect Halloween orange	1
Very nice .........	1
Very nice yarn. I was not expecting that the skeins would be so big! Yarn is a little scratchy, but I have read some tutorials for softening the finished product to the point that it could mimic some of the more expensive yarns.  I purchased ranch red (or burgundy), orchid, white, cornmeal, coffee, wildflower, and light blue. I have already started a scarf with the light blue, and I would say that the skein could make two scarves, depending on the stitch, with quite a lot of yarn left over. Not to mention, it came on time. Overall, I am very pleased with this purchase.	1
I love Red Heart super saver yarn. I purchased this item in Grey Heather, Mistle toe and Artist and they are all wonderful. They are soft and perfect for almost any classic project you may have. I have been crocheting tons of hats for all my relatives as the weather is getting colder and this particular yarn is great for such projects.	1
perfect color. I was not sure about order on linet and not see color. Was oerfect match for John Deere Greene	1
I loved the yarn and I finished my curtains and they look great. Thank you so much.	1
always like the winding dows not not	1
I could not find this color yarn anywhere around me! Saw that it was in stock on amazon, ordered two skeins, and it was delivered quickly. The color is exactly like the dark purple in the picture and the yarn is just what I needed.	1
I realize that ordering yarn online means there may be some color variation from what I see on the screen. I also realize a yarn called "pumpkin" should be on the orange side. This yarn appeared to have more of a yellow tint online and it is nothing short of neon orange! I ordered this along with another color that showed up as a very green color, nothing like what I expected, and now I have neon orange and green for a project I was really looking forward to...	-1
I did not get it yet however I am sure I will enjoy	1
THANK YOU	1
Color as described	1
I use this brand often..........	1
Very Cool Color, nice and solid for a heavy-duty afghan that will last years.  JUST BE CAREFUL when you order: some skeins have different yardages from others, up to 100  yds difference between one color and another.  Had to order more, having assumed all of the Super Saver skeins of this weight listed on the online page form were identical in size.  Not so.	1
Excellent color, hard to find. Glad it was Red Heart, an excellent yarn to work with.	1
perfect	1
pretty	1
I love this yarn, but the information on the product is misleading, it says that is has more yardage than it really does, This one has 244 yards, according to the label on the skein. I just ordered 2 because the information in the description says it has 300 something yards.	1

I love Red Heart yarn. The color wasn't quite what I needed,as its hard to match a color over the net. This yarn will definitely not go to waste, as I have a little neighbor who will be getting a lovely hat and scarf from this yarn!	1
this is as good as ever and i have been using yarn for crocheting for almost 50 years...i miss some of the old colors but the new choices are awesome	1
not as soft as hoped for. looks great knitted up	1
Great Product!	1
Awesomeness	1
Received the product quickly using my Amazon Prime account.  The yarn is as shown and described on the site - color is the same as well - nicer in person.  If you happen to get this yarn as an add-on for a couple bucks then its a good buy.  Thought the price point was fair at the time of purchase - but think using 30 - 40% coupons in Michael's you'll get a better deal.  In all, it is a good product, exactly as described and great for many craft projects!	1
This yard is awesome. It's not the softest yarn out there, but it's soft enough for an afghan to me (especially after a few washes) and the color holds up extremely well over time. Another big bonus is this yarn is the easiest to work with that I've found. Some brands are so difficult to hold onto, usually because of how soft they are, or it's the biggest pain to find the right end to work with/get the yarn to come out easily while working with it. No complaints at all from me about Red Heart Super Savor!  The red burgundy mixed with Medium Thyme was the perfect Christmas colors for this year's afghan.	1
just what I wanted	1
I am right at the end of a project and needed one more skein.... I am so thankful I found it on Amazon, none of the store within 200 miles of my home had any left of this color.	1
love it thanks! just the right coloring and so fast to be here. bridal shower is march 12,2017. thanks again!	1
Satisfied	1
I love Red Heart yarn...that`s the only brand yarn I use,and received it quickly....thankyou...Mona Wills	1
I will be ordering more products in the future.	1
Fabulous!  Thank you!	1
Was perfect Thanks	1
When it arrived, it was yarn, and it was indeed blue. It was everything I had hoped for, as what I had hoped for was blue yarn. If your hopes and dreams are limited to skeins of blue yarn, this might just be the product for you.	1
Does anyone know how many ounces is in this skein?  Pattern go by how many oz of yarn you need.  Is this a 5 oz skein or 7 oz skein?	-1
Worked up nicelyl.	1
Color is much nicer than the picture shows.	1
GREAT!!	1
Great yarn, works great, BUT in the photo it only shows brown, white, and pink.. just be aware that the light brown in the photo is actually light GREEN in person. I don't have a problem with it, but that is something that still would've been nice to know.	1
very nice yarn...came in excellent condition and promptly...i love the color of the yarn...no problem with anything...	1
The yarn arrived very quickly. It's color complements the afghan I am working on. It's very easy to work with, no tangling, etc.	1
very good	1
Beautiful color scheme!	1
this is a very cool yarn as you knit it really does make a camo pattern	1
everything about this purchase was great.	1
Great price always love red heart	1
great	1
A+	1
Great buy.	1
Love the colour	1
color is much lighter than it appears online and when order arrived the one skein was frayed and unusable	-1
great	1
This is really one of my absolute favorite yarns to work with. Aside from the flecks balling together, this yarn works up really easily and I love the color. The seller is brilliant as well. I received this yarn in only a couple days. Now I just have to finish that blanket I've been putting off.	1
nice color	1
I prefer red heart yarn to many of the others I have tried. It ties well and works well.	1
The color is perfect and was sent perfectly packaged . I work with yarn so I hope to make more purchases soon.	1
As always, it perfectly matched the skein of yarn I had bought a year ago.  Hats off to Red Heart for always making yarn that matches faithfully.	1
The wife got this and likes it. Same quality that she would get at the store, but a lot lower price!	1
Beautiful color	1
Nice yarn, I did have to double it up for a scarf (135cm) and there's still a good amount left. Very cheap and shipped fast.	1
excellent	1
It is wonderful to be able to order yarn over the internet and have it delivered to my home.  Red Heart Super Saver is one of my favorite choices for making the blankets I donate to the Linus Project.	1
Very happy with how fast it got here. So I could finish my project.	1
good yarn.  My mother needed it to finish a project	1
Just what I was looking for	1
Product arrived very quickly, was as described and great price A++++	1
Nice rich color.	1
Red Heart yarn is the best yarn as far as I am concerned. I love making baby blankets out of Red Heart, and they have so many colors choices. Finding Aran yarn just had me fall in love all over again. It is a soft yarn, and I think a neutral shade for either boy or girl baby, in place of pink or blue.	1
Very satisfied!	1
Love this yarn.....	1
I liked it.	1
As always...great Red Heart yarn.	1
Thank you exactly what I needed	1
Red Heart Super Saver is the brand I reach for most.  When crocheting or knitting with it, it isn't very soft but it softens up after you wash it.  I have been using this yarn for many years.	1
Pretty	1
Good price, Amazon. Its a great all purpose econcomy yarn	1
Thank you!	1
love it	1
great	1
excellent. i have never  had a problem with orders. arrival time,quality just great.	1
softer then i remember.  I think it was red heart team colors that scared me off the whole super savers line, but this doesn't feel sqeaky.	1
Very soft and easy to work with, not to mention the rich color.  This is my go-to yarn for baby blankets!	1
Perfect - and good competitive price!	1
I give the yarn 5 stars although I had 2 problems with my order. (1) The description says it is 364 yds but the label says 244 yds DIDN'T ORDER ENOUGH FOR MY PROJECT. (2) The lot numbers were the same on all but 3 skeins were a different lot number. I'm glad this is a variegated yarn or the color could have been off since I received yarn with 2 different lot numbers. The yarn is great, easy to work with and very soft. Very pretty colors - like autumn leaves.	1
Great! Easy to work with and really resembles camouflage as it works up.	1
USE THIS YARN ALL THE TIME WITH GREAT SUCCESS..	1
The yarn is great to work with, nice weight to it. I ran out of yarn and was able to complete an afghan that I started. Needed 13 skeins, only had 7 and I must say, the no dye lot worked for me!	1
I found out that this yarn is way over-priced when I finally took a trip into town (an hour away) and saw it for sale at Michaels for $3.19 instead of the $7.97 price this seller is asking. The yarn itself is dull and coarse and rough on the hands.  I decided not to use this yarn I was overcharged for and get better stuff at Hobby Lobby.	-1
The yarn seemed more of a vibrant color in the photo. But my main issue  with this yarn is that it was such a poor quality.  It was difficult holding the tension when I was crocheting because the yarn was so flimsy. I'm reteaching myself to crochet after having putting down my crochet needles over 10 years ago.  This yarn started to fray even before I had to pull it apart to redo a couple of rows. In my humble opinion this yarn was not worth the over six dollars I paid for it. I certainly would not use it to crochet gifts for family and friends.	-1
I ordered a few different yarns from red heart, since i loved using them before. Sadly this time when i used them, the package was stolen off my porch and they refused to give me a refund or to resend me the yarn I ordered. Very disappointing.	-1
I've been using Red Heart yarn for years and it's always been nice and soft and easy to work with.  However when I chose this variegated combination to use in my current project I noticed it's very scratchy and rough feeling and also hard to work with.  It doesn't slide off the crochet hook easily.  I love the colors they make in this combination yarn but there is something about the fabric content that makes it scratchy so I won't be using it again.  I compared the content to the plain colors and it's the same so they must be doing something in the color process that makes it rough.  Come on Red Heart I know you can do better, your yarn has always been so great to work with and such a bargain to buy.  Don't mess it up now!  I'll stick with the solids.	-1
This is not a super saver yarn. Super saver is a lot BIGGER size at the price I paid It should have been a pounder size. I'm going to return this order. It is way over priced.	-1
If this item had been available, it would have only been priced at $2.44 per skein. I needed the yarn to Complete a project that I was working on, or I wouldn't have ordered it at the price that it was sold. I checked stores In a 25 mile radius before I ordered online.	-1
This yarn is very coarse. It was not nice to work with. The colors are play, but I hated crocheting with this.	-1
Guess need to know the ounces on yard as I paid 7 for this and can get it at Walmart for 2.69 Not ever going to get yarn online again	-1
Working with this yarn on plastic canvas is not recommended as it broke apart to easily and shredded apart to easy	-1
Since when did Amazon become the yarn police? I was only allowed to buy four skeins when it says there are 19 available. Now as a long-term Prime member not only do I have to spend 25 $ , I am limited to how many I can buy. It's like saying you can only buy two cups of flour when you need four. While I am at it...Amazon use to always have the best prices but not anym ore. I doubt I will renew my Prime Membership	-1
I did not like this yarn.  It was a very scratchy yarn and the colors were much duller than the picture (think army green instead of grass/tree green).	-1
I was disappointed in my purchase.  The yarn was priced to imply that it was 14 oz skeins, but was really only 7 oz.  Also, the yarn has many knots in it, making it unusable at times.	-1
It really took a long time to get here. Found what we needed at a local store to complete the project.	-1
Wrong item description! It is stated that it is 364 yards and when received it the yarn is 244 yard. This is overpriced for the yardage. WalMart has 244 yards for $2.50	-1
This is another to good to believe. they give you  a great price on the product but pad the shipping cost pretty badly. and trying to get a proper refund is a laugh so buyers beware. I haven't been able to place a claim because the system is not working on this one.	-1
I triple checked the numbers before I ordered, and they didn't match what I had.  I made due, but was unhappy.	-1
The painted desert yarn  is very thin and texture is rough i have used red heart many years and haven't had this problem	-1
When I purchased these two skeins of yarn I was under the impression that the price stated was for the 14 oz size per skein not the 7 oz for the same price.  I was excited that there would be no fee for shipping and handling but upon receiving the product I was disappointed to get something that I could go to Wal-mart for a pay only $2.77/skein.	-1
I can't believe this is even made. It is the most unpleasant feeling yarn I've ever felt. A total waste.	-1
If you want a soft green color do not buy this! This is a bright green color, not at all like the picture shows!	-1
The pumpkin color is more tangerine then what is shown in the preview.  Would be nice if they had a more true to color picture.	-1
The yarn itself is great, and exactly what I use (I use about 20 skeins of Mexicana a year for lanyards), but the description for what I bought said 364 yards. The skeins I got were only 244 yards. I went back and looked at the image after my order came in, and the picture does show 244 yards, but I trusted the description when I ordered. I didn't mind paying 7.87 for 2 of the 364 yard skeins, but that is pretty high for 2 of the 244 yard ones.	-1
I have used a LOT of RED HEART yarn over the years but never have I used anything this stiff and unyielding. I bought this because I thought it was pretty. I knew I wanted to use it, but wasn't quite sure what I wanted to make. I ended up using it to crochet 5 squares of a 25 square blanket. This was the most difficult yarn I've ever worked with. On the bright side, my blanket is beautiful...	-1
I have been knitting for a long time and have always liked Red Heart yarn. My favorite source for yarn went out of business and I was delighted to find Red Heart on Amazon. Thank you.	-1
Amazon claims this measures 364 yards in length. When I got the yarn it said right on the package 244 yards. If I didn't need the yarn to complete a project I would return it. It is completely overpriced for what you get.	-1
The price for this product was much more than I would have paid in the store, but I needed it and could not find in any stores.  The color was slightly different although they were both light gray.  I will definitely make sure that I have enough of the necessary color before I start another project.	-1
The picture is totaly differant than what I received, will have to use it due have project to complete now. Love Red Heart products but the picture does not correspond with the actual product.	-1
The final product was very scratchy.  The yarn had several tie-on knots.  Two of them were only a few yards apart.	-1
I purchased this on line because it advertised the skein was 364 yards of yarn, not 244 yards. Had I known it was only 244 yards I could have purchased this at my local yarn shop for $2.99 each. Instead I paid over $6.00 each. Falsely advertised the skein was bigger than it actually is.	-1
Color is a Bright Pumpkin Orange NOT golden yellow as shown. The color recieved is a nice orange for pumpkins and pumpkin hats so I did not return.	-1
I only rated this 2 stars for the price. I just bought the same yarn. Same weight and length at Walmart for 2.77. That's half of the price they have it on here.	-1
Right color but not good to use when making stocking caps as product does not give. It also takes quite a bit more as this yarn is very thin!!!!!	-1
BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN WRITING ON LIGHT COLORS AS IT STICKS AND NOTHING, ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TAKES IT OFF.	-1
Doesn't really work very well.  Comes off to easy.	-1
Very messy to try to refill.	-1
Disappointed. Size not stated correctly. Misleading.	-1
too thin and flimsy	-1
I bought this product to use with stencils on T-shirts. Great ideat and great product, but it is very runny for spray paint. That means even if you hang the item you want to spray, you have to put paper down on the ground. It's not like regular spray-paint that doesn't drip. This stuff drips and I mean everywhere. I found that out the hard way put spraying down onto the T-shirt which had been placed flat on a table. Clean up was something else and needless to say the T-shirt was almost a right-off. Test it first! And remember to keep shaking!!!	-1
Not my favorite needles.	-1
Too small	-1
not what I thought they'd be ... was looking for buttons you could push through a pair of jeans to extend or shorten the waist ... these don't work without a tool to punch through the fabric you want to use them with	-1
I bought this machine about four years ago. I do regular but not daily sewing, mainly costumes for Renaissance faires. The timing went out after about a year, when I accidentally hit a pin. I had to pay about $100 to have it fixed. It went out again approximately a year later, due to a similar incident. Again I paid close to $100 for repairs. Just one month later, and it's out again. I won't be repairing it again. I read (and verified visually) that a lot of the gears are made of plastic, which eventually wears out causing timing problems. If you do a lot of sewing, do yourself a favor and get the Janome HD1000 for a little bit more. The initial cost is a bit more, but I ended up paying about $500 for this Singer. Do the math :)	-1
I had to return this twice.  The automatic threader broke within the first couple of days.  Thought it was a fluke, so exchanged it for another one.  The next one broke at 31 days...just past Amazon's return window.  Thanks to Amazon's wonderful customer service, they allowed me to return it for a refund anyway!  I exchanged it for the Brother 9500, which has way more features for just a little bit more money. I am VERY happy with the Brother.	-1
This machine was such a disappointment to me.  I had hardly used it when it began to skip stitches.  Took it to a shop to be fixed and they told me it couldn't be fixed, that every time he got the thing aligned it just flipped right back into skipping.  So I got two years of use out of it.  I would never buy a Singer machine again - they are just too cheaply made and NOT made to last.  Ok if you plan to replace your machine every other year.	-1
This machine had lots of great stitches, it sewed evenly and it was the most noisy machine I have EVER put fabric through.	-1
The machine showed up broken and I had to return it, as it would have been an additional $100 in repairs (at least, if not more than that)... it was a really disappointing experience all around. The only thing I *CAN* say is that Amazon's return process worked flawlessly, and that was much appreciated.	-1
I thought this machine was jam proof.  There are a lot nice features to this machine, but my thread keeps jamming up.  I'm thinking of returning it.  4/1/09 - I cleaned out the bobbin area, removed any threads, and rethreaded top and bottom and it now works like a charm.  I've had to do this twice so far, so I'm not sure if it is something that I am doing wrong.  It works great now.  I decided to keep it.  6/23/09 - I have sewn three quilts so far, and have only had one minor jamming problem.  The problem was putting the bobbin in upside down.  I flipped it right side up and that solved the problem.  I love all the different stitches, but wish the alphabet feature had different font sizes.  The size that comes with the machines is very small about 1/4 inch.  I have a problem adding thread to the bobbin.  The machine doesn't automatically add the thread very evenly, and I have to manually move the thread up and down the bobbin to keep the thread from bunching up in one area, otherwise I like this machine.  8/5/09 I was finally able to change the rating from two stars to four stars.  Just waiting for Amazon to update the change.  1/20/10  After reading the instructions correctly I learned how to thread the bobbin correctly, and I have not had a problem since.  I love the different stitches, very easy to use and my sewing buddies are jealous of my various stitches.  This is a good price for what you get.  I got mine for about $350 on amazon Dec08.	-1
They didn't stay sharp for any length of time at all. Used them for cutting jewelry wire and became dull very quick. Still need a good pair. Not happy.	-1
Item shown is not the item I received!.  Pictured/described is a 5.5" long plier, with 2-tone ergonomic handle, and rounded edges on the tool. What I got, was a 5" long plier, with solid black - Non-ergonomic handle, squared off edges, and just a generally inferior looking product. I would never have paid this much for this tool, as I can get this kind of quality cheaper, locally. I got this to give as a Christmas gift, and won't be giving it now. Not cool!	-1
not sharp at all so that leaves it kinda good for 3 uses at best.	-1
This item is a joke.  Of the 4 uses this items claims to offer, only one is worthwhile, and that is the round/wrapping portion.  The 'flush cutter' not only does NOT cut, but even if it did, it is positioned in such a place that it could not be used on a smaller piece (ex - to snip off a bale).  I am thoroughly disappointed and will now have to purchase flat nose pliers AND a flush cutter.  I should have done that in the first place.  Please do not buy this unless you want to throw your money away.	-1
Not the product shown - no Beadsmith name engraved on it, and it is clearly a cheap tool, which I am returning.  Also, the entire top was covered with some kind of oil, I tried wiping it off but couldn't get all, and would be afraid to touch anything of value with it.  Can't say if the tool actually works or not as I didn't even try.	-1
Worst quality ever	-1
they broke right at the crossover.  I just threw them away.  They return system for small items isn't worth the trouble.	-1
The pliers shown have "ergonomic" molded handles.  The ones I received have plain dipped handles.  The ones pictured have a nice finish, and look decent.  The ones I got have a horrible finish, and the tips are bent.  The action is horrible, draggy, and sticks both open and closed.  Worthless, awful.	-1
I go through a lot of round nose pliers because most of the multi-use sets don't close evenly and the tips tend to overlap when trying to make loops and eyepins. Being Beadsmith, I had high hopes for these, too, but after a few days of serious use making a dozen rosaries, once again I have a useless set of pliers for that purpose. I guess you have to sacrifice quality for convenience when using the multi-use pliers.	-1
Elmers regular and craft glue works better. Too thick to work with.	-1
Tried to "glue" a hole in a dog toy.  Even clamped ends together.  Did not work at all.	-1
I must be missing something. My friend gave me this glue to try.....she used it a lot for scrapbooking I presume. I'm not a scrapbooker, but do a lot of other crafts. This glue held absolutely nothing together for me.....NOTHING! I have tried it on several types of materials.....reindeer moss to objects, small polymer clay pieces, tiny tiny wood materials to eachother and even paper and so much more and I have to say I have never been so baffled as to how a product can be so popular and not even be able to hold 2 pieces of paper together.  The above experiment was a couple yrs ago. I was recently in walmart and saw turbo tacky glue and thought well maybe that will be better then my last experience.......mmmmm no.... same results.....I find these glues absolutely useless.	-1
Not worth gluing fabric and then washing.	-1
I don't seem to have any luck with glue.  Yet again, my initial expectations were too high.  This glue didn't even make construction paper stick to construction paper (no, that's not a typo).  I tried to use it for Christmas construction paper crafts and it failed miserably.  I'm switching back to TAPE!	-1
wrinkles scrapbook paper and cardstock	-1
Initially this worked good but after a few times of use over my slow months its just a backed up water bowl  face paint gets clogged easily so water doesn't drain and water bottle has to be turned just right or nothing comes out - thicker face paint will temporarily stain bowl and you will have a hard time getting red or blk face paint off (nothing new there) just fyi  Brush slot is useless - most brushes don't fit and you end up knocking it out because its in the way	-1
Didn't work for me	-1
Just use liquid starch and if you need it to be even more solid/stiff add Elmer's glue. Don't waste money on this. I got better results with cheap starch.	-1
I ca't use it because there is no lid to put on it after I use it!  There is no place to tell them I just want a lid for the Sparkle Mod Podge that I ordered.  I don't think anyone will read this either....Can't explain to a computer that I just want a lid.	-1
Unfortunately, I'm forced to say that this was a complete waste of money! I hate to leave a bad review but I use products like this for my business all the time and thought I can try to help someone else. I tried this one out as it was a cheaper alternative to my usual&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Aleene-s-Stiffen-Quick-Fabric-Stiffening-Spray-8oz/dp/B001145342/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Aleene's Stiffen-Quick Fabric Stiffening Spray 8oz</a>  To me, even when this product was heavily diluted, it was still just like pouring Elmer's PVA glue all over your fabric (most of which I use is silk, so a huge waste) and even when it's dry, ends up like a crunchy, smelly piece of card stock - Certainly not something I could use for work as I'm postive I'd receive complaints based on the stench alone! It also makes the color of the fabric darker when dried.  I'm sorry to say but I actually threw this out in the trash when we moved house and went straight back to Stiffen Quick.	-1
I used the fabric glue and it did not do the job!! It didn't hold the fring that I was putting on my shirt. So I am not sure if the other glue is going to hold. I would not buy this glue. I am going to find a better glue to use!	-1
I bought this to glue something to velvet ribbon and none of them would adhere	-1
I bought this because I am making a few cosplays and thought it would be a good idea to try out some fabric glues to see if they were something I could put in my kit for when i am at cons. Packing a hot glue gun is not always practical. Save your money. I followed the directions on the packaging for each one and none of them stick. It just makes the fabric hard where ever you apply it. What ever it is you are trying to make stay put... does not stick, not even for a moment. I even tried clothes pinning 2 pieces of fabric together over night to see if that would make a difference. It did not. I am very dissappointed.	-1
It doesn't stick that well	-1
I bought it to restick old Cricut mats. It did not work well. The paper stuck to the mat.	-1
Surprised, I have used this product line for years. Just didn't work for me	-1
I had big plans for this but it all got shot down when I used it.  It was messy and it left a residue and I was using cloth and it showed through where it did stick.  So unhappy this was not as good as I had hoped for.	-1
I bought this instead of Stiffen Quik because this is what the store had, and I was about 5 sprays in before I regretted it. It clogs the pump, drips all down your hand and on the fabric (creating big white globs of rock-hard fabric), and, once you've finally applied it to the fabric, leaves it feeling rough. I even tried transferring it to my empty Stiffen Quik bottle, to see if it was just the pump that was the problem, but had the same results. My cat doesn't even like to sit on the fabric that's been stiffened with Stiffen Stuff, and that's saying a lot because she will sit on anything. Plywood. Grocery bags. Overdue credit card bills. Fireman calendars.  Skip this stuff and use Aleen's Stiffen Quik. The name is more fun and your cat will approve.	-1
The nozzle is absolutely horrible at pumping out the stuff.  It comes out in uneven globs and even out between the plastic nozzle and the ring around it.  I tried cleaning it with soap and hot water a few times but it didn't help at all.  Just trying to take off the clear lid, both times the starch sprayed out between the apparatus. The starching chemical is probably fine but the dispenser makes it useless.  I ended up using "heavy starch" from Target instead. It cost $1 and the applicator had no problems.	-1
Not the best	-1
Too watery to work with.	-1
Not permanent. Stones came loose..	-1
This is so messy & when you use it, there are strings of glue everywhere.	-1
This product is too sticky, gets on my hands and I can hardly get it off had to use alcohol to remove the residue.	-1
Even though the bottle says the adhesive dries clear, mine did NOT and dried milky.  I ruined the vintage brooch AND the 4 newly purchased rare vintage teardrop crystals that I glued into the brooch!  Not very happy.	-1
Bought 2 and it didn't work for me. What a disappointment.	-1
Wherever this stuff is coming from, it's so thick, it doesn't even squeeze out of the tube.  I returned the first bottle because it was so dried up and the second bottle came the say way.  I've had the bottle I have now for a long time and the consistency was like Elmer's glue.  It always came out easily and wasn't thick like this...and never thickened up like this stuff.  I have no idea what's wrong with it, but I've given up and have to shop elsewhere for it.	-1
Glue arrived dried into a solid chunk in the bottle.  Completely useless.	-1
When I received this product it was solid and no good.  I ended up buying another one at Walmart and it was cheaper.	-1
When it arrived the bottle was leaking. I sent it back for refund.	-1
Did not work for my application. Bad product.	-1
I tried using this to attach rhinestones to different material and surfaces and didn't work at all, so not happy	-1
I had to throw the product away it was hard as a rock, I couldn't get it out of the bottle.	-1
I was looking for DG3 gel or triple glaze when I came upon this at a local craft store.  Looked like it would work, boy was I wrong it messed up my project.  I am just thankful that I did a 1 piece test run, before going full out.  It clouded over a picture I was using.  And didn't seem to harden at all just stayed Elmer's like.	-1
This stuff stinks. And I feel like it just makes a huge mess. Purchased it to attempt to get registration stickers off of our car after moving out of state and it didn't really help much. The scraper cap is a joke. Maybe this would work better for easier jobs, but due to the placement of our window stickers and whatever adhesive was used on them, this didn't help with removal at all.	-1
I did finally get a chance to use it. I'm allergic to it and it smells toxic. Not to mention for a glaze it does not work.	-1
Cheap enough to be worth a try--but on use this disappoints. First, smells oily--and is oily if you get some on your hands. And if you're trying to use in a tight spot, say the corner of your car windshield, good luck. The scraper is a challenge to use while attached to the bottle, and the little sponge gets grungy with any adhesive you're trying to remove. In a few tries, the duck got some of the old decal adhesive off but fluffed the rest, even after two applications . Had to use an old shave blade. Live and learn. If it's too cheap . . .	-1
This glue is useless as a glue of any kind let alone a fabric adhesive. Since it ididm't work on fabric i thought maybe it'll be an o.k. glue for paper projects....so I tried it on paper and it was useless there as well.  It was like using water to glue....waste of money and fabric as it stained the fabric I tried it on so money wasted there as well!!!  The company should be ashamed of themselves!	-1
Patches are peeling off of my daughter's Girl Scout vest after just a couple of months of gentle use. We haven't even washed it yet.	-1
This is entirely useless for Felt. So disappointed. I followed the instructions closely but got nothing. if it wasn't such a hassle I would have returned it.	-1
FYI...some genius has allowed all the Q&A's, reviews and ratings for 6 DIFFERENT products (all manufactured by the Aleene company) so if you are interested in a specific product, all the info is lumped into one mess, so good luck researching the specific product that you want info on....ALSO the star reviews are bollocks as they too are all combined, so they are useless. Idiots!	-1
Just recently i have used this though i have bought it long time ago. It is not holding :(	-1
This arrived running out of bottle	-1
this stuff does not work	-1
dries wrinkly and you can see it through the ribbons and also, comes off very easily. Not recommended for serious crafters or sewers.	-1
Ordered this to attempt to hem a dress that was made of slightly silky material. Did not adhere at all. I followed instructions, but the material did not stick. On top of it the little spot I tested (before doing the whole thing per instructions) bled the colors of the dress so now the bottom of the dress is ruined. This is a waste of money if you purchase with the thought of hemming anything.	-1
Glued on my kids taekwondo patches and they came off before the end of class. They also left a glue that will not come off of their uniforms. Don't buy this !	-1
The glue did not hold my cloth to my apron	-1
Doesn't work for me, no matter how long I let it dry.	-1
This takes WAAAAAY too long to dry.  I gave up on it and bought the stuff that you iron	-1
I was disappointed that it didn't work as well as expected.	-1
came all spilled out and unusable. I did not try to return.	-1
I couldn't find Fabri Tac at my Walmart so I bought this instead. Big mistake. It has been worthless for everything I have tried it on. Gave up and used my glue gun for some of the gluing and will use Elmer's for the rest. First time I have seen this brand. I won't buy it again.	-1
This fabric glue does the trick and would be great for thicker materials.  I used it on a cotton pullover in which the hem had come undone...wish I had sewed it.  The glue left a grease mark that showed through.  I would probably not recommend this product for use on anything aside from arts and crafts, tote bags, etc.	-1
didn't keep boy scout patches on the uniform, either poly or cotton shirts - had to take them to get them sewn on...	-1
This is craft wire and clearly says on the outside "Tarnish Resistant".  Item is misrepresented.  I could never sell jewelry made from this for fear it would turn. I should have known better than to switch from my regular wire, but another Beadsmith product I've used was very nice.  I am so disappointed.	-1
Terrible.  Stored it in my basement workshop for a few months.  Turned an awful yellow color.  Other brands of wire did not.	-1
This is a horrible tool.  Not only does the goo on the end of the plastic stick just fall off, but it's too sticky to use with crystals.  They never come off, even if you're trying to set them into glue.  Also, the goo leaves a horrible film on the jewels...it's an awful product.  I would never use it.  Just threw them away!	-1
While this item is usually very handy for wire-wrapping projects, I was extremely disappointed to receive a spool with 1/2 the outer layer completely unusable due to tarnish. I don't know if it was stored improperly or what, but I had to throw away what is essentially 25% of the spool. :( I expect better! I may start looking elsewhere for my wire.	-1
It was to clumsy and wide to pick up one small stone. Tried it a couple of times with the same results and will not use it again.	-1
Didn't work could not use them at all for my ss12 swarovski crystals	-1
When it arrived, I had to peel a sticky mess off of it. That, and my tarnish-resistant wire was tarnished when it got to me. Can't return it. I needed it last night. So boo.	-1
For me it did not work well.  I would pick up the crystal or metal rhinestud and go to put it down where I wanted it and had to unstick it with my hand.  That seemed to defeat the purpose of the reason I bought it in the first place.  Other people may find it useful.  I did not.	-1
When I got it, it's already rusted. Not "tarnish resistant' at all.	-1
Hoping the tips don't impact the quality of the carving. Bought brand new and these look worse than the ones that have been used for years in my classroom. Total bummer.	-1
I ordered quite a few of these since I letterpressed my wedding invitational suite and this brayer is just really inconsistent. There are subtle dips in the rubber that really make a difference when you are laying on the ink. I probably won't purchase these again.	-1
The roller is permanent, it does not come off for cleaning.  Brayer use depends on the ability to remove what is on the brayer.  Use instructions will not be included herein, suffice it to say it's difficult to keep clean.	-1
Very disappointed. One side the color is not smooth and also a little bit off compared to the picture, the other side is even worse, it shows two different tones of yellow. I thought made in US (processed in Mexico) would be more trustful. I had bought some other grosgrain ribbons that are made in Taiwan or China and they have far better quality--true to color and stiffer.  I wish I could get my money back but too bad I need this for my project now and have no time to return. Lesson learned, I will never buy Offray grosgrain ribbon again.  BTW, a year ago I bought Offray Single Face Satin ribbons sold by Amazon.com LLC and those have great quality.	-1
I was looking for a thin ribbon to hang brown and gold ornaments from on each side of my front door.  This was NOT it.  The color is misleading.  This is a really bland, boring, blah color of soft brown.  Not worth returning.	-1
tried to move the thumb from the position it started in, and it snapped off.  Didn't put much pressure on it.  I guess I'd only say to buy this if you want the thumb locked in a totally unnatural pose.	-1
will probably break as soon as I try to move the thumb from it's unnatural starting position as the other one did, haven't done it yet, but it came from the same maker, in the same stuck position.	-1
I wanted a gesso board, NOT a full, backed canvas!	-1
Poor quality boards that always arrive with the corners chipped off. If you buy these buy them in person so you can inspect prior to taking it home. I will never puchase again if it chips that easy.	-1
Perhaps this is a good product. If you buy it I recommend buying in store so you can see it first. Each time I've ordered it has arrived with the corner chipped off which to me makes it subpar quality.	-1
Ordered two, they both arrived damaged, one on one corner and the other on three corners, which made me realize how flimsy they are beneath the gesso. The frame around the panel seems sturdy. Will not use this product in the future.	-1
No stars. Item NOT as described. This is for one not a case of 10	-1
I ordered one of these and when it arrived the handle would not stay on every time I pulled the trigger the back of the handle would pop off. Then I returned it and exchanged it for another one. When the second one arrived I looked it over and the handle stayed on but the trigger kept sticking about every 3rd or 4th time I pulled it. Note I never put any paint in either brush. So I took it apart, oiled the moving parts and put it back together again it helped for a few tries but started sticking almost right away. I also noticed that the needle was way off center to the degree that it was always touching the inside edge of the nozzle. From what I read on the forums people that have gotten the Paasche Talon (which this is) in the past received good high quality airbrushes. I can only conclude that the newer quality standards at Paasche have slipped or they are having their airbrushes made somewhere else now.	-1
DO NOT WASTEI YOUR MONEY LIKE I DID!!!! Initially I thought it was good but it broke in the first week, I ordered another air brush from a different vendor who charged  half this price and it's working great. I really wanted it to work. I DEFINITELY DON'T RECOMMEND IT	-1
good looking  vegan leather alternative but it doesn't hold up well and deteriorates quickly like after couple months of wear; so if for necklaces or in contact with sweat and humidity, falls apart quick life span so it needs to be supported by other strong materials; other wise very nice;	-1
The score black one marks too wide of a strip. The orange one does not stay sharp very long.	-1
Cutter works as described.  I would not call the black one a "scorer" as it has no blade on it.  It's more of a paper creaser/bender, like if you make greeting cards and you need to crease the paper in the middle it would do a nice job for that, but I would have preferred something that actually scored paper.	-1
I bought these but they don't fit my cutter. I bought the wrong ones. I thought they all fit. Now they just sit. I'm sure they are great for the right one.	-1
Went through 2 blades in less than 15 hours of use.  Maybe I'm expecting too much, but I thought it would last longer than that.  I will be trying a different trimmer so I won't be buying these anymore.	-1
I do not have a problem with the seller, but the quality of this fiskars cutter is not very good. It barely cuts one piece of card stock and leaves a bent edge on everything you cut.	-1
I do not know how this product got so many great reviews! I was new to card making and was convinced by the reviews and price to buy this trimmer. I have not been able to get it to cut a straight line since I bought it. Also the fold out arm does not lay out straight so if you are cutting past 5inches it will never be precise because that arm is always crooked unless you hold it down the whole time which is impossible with only 2 hands. I have since resorted to scoring my paper before I cut because the guides on this trimmer are not accurate enough. I'm going to spend more to buy something more sturdy and we'll made. I guess you get what you pay for and if you are buying this you are paying for a poorly made piece of plastic.	-1
Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like my trimmer cuts straight. The edge of the trimmer that you place the paper against is at a slight angle, so I get angled cuts. Otherwise, it cuts great, it just doesn't give me straight cuts which is what I need. =(	-1
I do not like this paper trimmer.  The ruler at the top cuts off at the 5.5" mark, which is where I would be cutting/scoring much of my 11" paper at.  The guide piece that holds the paper down opens the wrong way.  The blade dulls pretty quickly.	-1
I would recommend a better paper cutter if you are going to get a pear cutter.  I don't feel this one is that great.  It is a bit flimsy and light weight.  Also, the size markings are not done in a very helpful way since they are set back from the cutter.	-1
I did not buy mine from Amazon, but I bought one just like this, at a local craft story. It cut straight lines at first, at least I thought it did, but after having to change out the first blade, I started to notice all my cards did not align when I folded them. The Friskar was NOT cutting a straight line!!! It was slightly off to the side which was noticable when trying to alight mat layers and closing/folding my cards. I have to actually score all my paper FIRST, on an envelope score board and then match that line up on my Friskar's lines, in order to get a straight cut. It's VERY frustrating and almost worthless. I'm am now looking for something better. I just wish I had noticed this right away, and if it was something that happened after use, I knew what caused this. But for now, I cannot recommend this :(.	-1
It was iffy on my watercolor paper one sheet at time (90 lb paper). I got it to speed up card making but afraid my Fiskar scissors do a better job. My paper edges got bent I saw a five star review with someone's picture of a card but I guess were doing different paper.  As far as working with normal paper (computer paper) it does okay. Sometimes it looked frayed if you look closely sometimes it's fine.  Since card stock usually ranges in 50 lb to 110 lb pressed paper I have to say it is not for card stock. Returning because it makes my cards look less professional.	-1
This trimmer was a waste of money. I hate the measurements. The blades dull quickly and it doesn't cut consistently straight.	-1
My main issue with this product is its blade. The blade pops out a lot if it is not laying flat (eg stored on its side on a shelf). Also the blade wears out very quickly!	-1
No wonder this comes with extra blades, you will need them! I was simply cutting coupons, very thin paper and the blade dulled after about 10 cuts. If it wasn't for the brand, I would have bought a different kind. However I assumed it would be a great item considering fiskars is a well know and established brand. Cheap design, the lines on the base, to help you cut a straight line, are off by a little. So not only was this item a waste of money but can't line up for a perfect edge.	-1
Peace of rubbish, it's not accurate and the orange cutter does not slide well, it pops out at the top, frustrating. From now on I'm going with Martha Stewart everything. I would love to return, but it's too late.	-1
I have bought two different 12 " Fiskars paper trimmers.  I love the extendable arm and it's easy to cut the paper precisely.  However the blades on these things are horrible.  It have to replace the blade after one or two days of scrapbooking.  After the first few days the paper leaves annoying paper fibers or tears the paper all together.  I have bought both types of blades...the "regular" and the titanium.  The titanium are supposed to be better and last longer and they do, but not near enough to justify the higher price.  In my opinion neither blade is worth buying when you have to buy soooo many of them.  I would caution against buying this trimmer, unless you have the resources to buy these blades by the cartful!	-1
I read all the reviews carefully before making my choice.  This trimmer is horrible.  I can only cut one way to get a reasonably good cut.  The other way looks like a shaggy dog.  I am going to have to get different one.  This one stinks.  If anyone has suggestions for another trimmer please let me know.	-1
I bought this paper cutter because most of the reviews were good, but, since then, my work has taken a turn for the worse.  After measuring very carefully on the cutter, the cuts that resulted were always different lengths.  I doubted myself; put on glasses, measured three times, etc.  Still wonky.  So I measured the paper in the paper cutter before I cut and discovered that it is 1--2 millimeters off.  When you're working with fine projects, as I do, that is a world of difference.  I own many good Fiskars cutting products, which is the other reason I bought this.  The price is good, another reason.  But I never would have bought it if it carried a warning that it was 1--2 mm off.  That's not worth it at any price.	-1
I have a lovely 15" guillotine paper cutter which I've happily used for many years... and, despite the over 20 years of cutting and cutting, it still has a decent cutting edge.  However, it is largish, heavy and awkward to drag out all the time for just a few sheets of paper (I don't have a dedicated spot for it to sit, unfortunately).  So I bought this very inexpensive and portable paper cutter by Fiskars thinking it would be perfect for trimming various smaller items...just take it out of the drawer and cut away.  Besides, Fiskars has been around for a long time, and has produced many excellent items.  You know the adage, You get what you pay for?  While in my experience, this has generally held to be true, there have also been several pleasant surprises where an inexpensive item has turned out to be quite good.  So I took a chance.  The reality of this very cheaply made piece of plastic is that I could cut paper better, straighter and more easily with a pair of old scissors in desperate need of sharpening.  The little plastic cutter won't stay put, and it is next to impossible to settle the paper in so that a good straight edge is achieved, and the cut edge is not reliably cut cleanly.  I generally read reviews before I purchase something with which I'm not familiar, and I glanced over the negative reviews for this item, but decided to go ahead and purchase because of the very large number of positive reviews. Definitely my mistake, but thankfully, Amazon has an excellent return policy, so I've returned it.  I'm now leery of any paper cutters with a similar cutting mechanism, and will probably go to a stationery supply store to see what is available, and if I find something suitable, then I can come back to Amazon.  In the meantime, back to the guillotine!	-1
I've used Fiskars punches for years so when my new craft required a bigger trimmer I felt safe getting a Fiskars brand one.  After using it for only 2 crafting sessions, I am disappointed that the blade does not stay in the track.  I rarely make it threw one swipe before the blade comes out somewhere along the plastic guide, not just at the blade changing section.  It has created the groove on the base to have cut marks on it's sides b/c it doesn't stay in the plastic flip up ruler guide so even if it does a full cut it isn't straight.  Sadly I would not buy this again and I recommend you don't spend your money on it either.  I'm chalking it up to a waste of money and am on the hunt for a new paper trimmer.  Does anyone have an suggestions on a good quality paper trimmer?	-1
When I ordered this, I looked at the bottom edge of the package in the picture to see the distribution of colours.  When it arrived, I was dismayed to find a much different selection.  The bundle is about 1 1/4" thick roughly divided as follows: 1/16" purple, 1/4" orange (my least favourite colour),  <1/8" dark blue,  3/16" red, 5/16" white,  3/16" green,  1/8" yellow, 1/16" black and the remaining 1/16" is a mix of pink and light blue.  I guess the small colour scale along the side of the top page shows this but it's too small to be of much use when ordering. I also failed to read; the 12" x 18" size is not what I wanted. I can't comment on the quality of the paper since I haven't opened the bundle. I'll be returning this because of the colour distribution.	-1
IT IS A DISGRACE THAT I PAID ALMOST 10.00 USA $'S FOR SO LITTLE PAPER. The product shows a lot of paper and I read somewhere 100 pages. THIS IS A RIP-OFF I WILL NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY EVER AGAIN. If you want to get an economy pack go to a craft store.	-1
While I love the Masterson system for acrylics, I ordered replacement acrylic paper for my smaller palette and got 3 sponges instead. The packaging clearly said acrylic paper, but as you can see from my photo, it came with yellow sponges.  I can still use the sponges, but now I will need to order more paper and hope it is correct.	-1
Too huge to do store anywhere.	-1
First, the bottle will not stay on - it needs some kind of screw or clasp.  It falls off and then spills the contents.  But that is minor compared the the fact that almost nothing comes out of the air brush, even at 50 psi.  Acts like it is clogged, but it is brand new.  Occassionally something will spray out for a second or two, then just stops.  Water will not even spray.  This is a very very poor product.	-1
I love the design and the idea of the case, I have many of the Della Q knitting cases. However, when I received this case the thread that is sewn to divide the pockets was missing on the left side and is coming unraveled from the right and will not hold needles as it's supposed to. I am really upset, because I Love these designs! I hope my other cases do not do the same thing, but to have it like this out of the packaging is a bit discouraging :(.	-1
the brush looking literally no thing like it is shown in the image, it is cheap looking and all together disappointing. if i knew this was the real quality of these brushes i would have saved my money and purchased cheaper priced and better quality brushes.	-1
same as other reviewer. blades and handles are pretty flimsy and don't hold too well. they do work, just not half as well as the x-acto brand product. they aren't too sharp so i will be using them for rough work, i'll leave the intricate cutting to my xacto set.	-1
Too small	-1
I was so excited to buy this. A friend gave me a $100 Amazon gift card for Christmas and I used it just for this. I didn't realize it was a third party though so shipping took longer than my Prime account and it came from UK. I tried reading instructions but that didn't work so well so I watched u-tube videos. Unfortunately, Prym is popular in Europe and most videos were in Italian or another language I didn't understand. I did find that there are other knitting machines that are very similar and the videos were in English so I watched about 10 of them. Still the machine kept dropping stitches and sticking occasionally as if it were starting to break. When I decided to return it I found out that shipping would be $280!! Thank goodness Amazon is such a great company and did stand behind me with their A toZ Guarantee. I would not recommend unless you are SURE you want this brand, from this manufacturer and that you live closer to the UK.	-1
Wouldn't order again	-1
too hard to use	-1
I guess the quality is in line with the price, but I would not recommend this wood grainer.  The handle did not stay in the hole at all; not for one minute.  I ended up tossing it and holding the "head" of the grainer and rocking it with my thumbs slightly as I used it.  The rubber "grain" looked fine once mastered, but overall it was a one-use, low-quality item.  If your project is anything more than simply for fun, purchase a better grainer so you don't have to fuss around with it to make it work correctly.	-1
These are not as firm as I expected for the application I am using them for. A Q-Tip would work better	-1
While these definitely won't cut clothing or hair they are hard to use even on paper.  You can cut through one piece as long as it's not a thick piece of paper.  The children don't like to use them	-1
All pans where broken to dust not happy returning	-1
These don't look like watercolors at all. Just your basic brush tip marker. They bleed though paper quite easily, The colors are not your standard range either. While they do look nice, and are easy to use, I was not really satisfied.	-1
Seem great until the run out in very few uses. there is a reason they seem like the best deal ever for tho style brush pen	-1
markers arrived dry	-1
It doesnt seem to want to stand up, tips over easy.	-1
pins for thread not long enough had to return it.	-1
Falls over often spilling the spools all over the floor. I wish there was a way for these people to put a little more effort in their design so that the spools could be secure if the rack were to lose it's balance and fall (like this one does often). Do more research for DIY options of storing your spools and you will have a head ache free solution.	-1
Threadart (seller): you really need to redo your measurements & fix the item description/photo. This review is for the 120 spool rack, now the listing is only showing the 60 spool rack. When it was the 120 spool rack, it also showed a photo of many 1100 yard spools on the rack, all fit nicely side by side, bottoms not overlapping. So I took a chance on ordering this. My review: minus one star for wrong measurements, minus one star because you say it will fit the 1100 yard mini king spools, minus one star for sloppy workmanship. The item stated "...15" x 24", with 1.5" between wood dowels". My rack is 15.5" by 26.25", with no more than 15.38" between dowels, most having only 1.25" between. Granted each thread manufacturer has small differences in the size of their plastic bottoms for the 1100 yard spools, but since I've tried 3 different brands & none of them can stand side by side on your thread rack... your rack is not made adequately spaced to hold these. The wood dowels are not all installed straight, & this rack cannot stand away from the wall due to one leg being a little shorter than the other. So it must lean against the wall. I'll add my voice to many other reviews: please remake this to incorporate a way to hang it, while I can figure out a way to do this it would be ever so much easier if you included a crossbar at the top from which to nail or screw this in. Even a set of triangular metal picture hangers on the back at the top of the vertical bracings would be an improvement. I am keeping this, see my photo on how to solve the thread storage problem: alternate the threads right side up & upside down. Not as pretty as all right side up, but it works.	-1
I don't need this item and don't like the idea of having to pay to have it returned. I will be careful NOT to purchase anything from this seller.	-1
My order arrived with some spool holders snapped off.  I kept it but wish I had gone with a hardier unit. My spools frequently jump off and the legs don't extend back quite enough for the unit to want to remain upright. This might be fine for regular sewing thread or bobbins but not at all for large spools or embroidery cones.	-1
It does the job.  I wish it was hangable.  I looked for ways to hang it, but I might need really big hooks for that.	-1
The pegs on this thread spool holder are too thick to allow spools to be put on it.  I returned them for credit.  I don't know what kind of thread this outfit that made this was anticipating using, but doesn't fit the normal of any thread spools that I use.	-1
I ordered this because it seemed like it would be helpful and allow me to organize thread. It does do that, BUT, it falls over very easily scattering spools of thread all over. There should be some way to keep it from doing this. I have tried string on both sides hoping this would help solve the problem but it isn't helping.	-1
Shipped quickly, which was nice, but a few spool ends were broken off which made it impossible to use for my 60 pack of spools I wanted to fill it with. Disappointed, but not worth the time and effort it would take to return it and get a different one.	-1
it like to forever to get it it was like a day or 2 past time,,an then when i opened the box the top shelf was on up side down an half broke off,,i don't think i will order things like this again from this place an no i would not reckamend it to anyone,,an if ya do hope you have better luck than i did	-1
I think I see the cause of the problem with this rack. I just noticed when I put this 66 Large Cone/ Spool Thread Rack into my Shopping Cart, what ends up in my cart is NOT this item, but a 60 Cone/ Spool Thread Rack that holds smaller cones (like the 1,000m to 2,000m cones). I have tried to put BOTH of these thread racks into my Cart during the same shopping session, but the only one that shows up is the "60 cone" one.  See below for the 60 Cone Rack that goes into the Cart when you WANT to buy the 66 Large Cone Rack:  http://www.amazon.com/60-Cone-Spool-Thread-Rack/dp/B000W6YMEW/ref=rsl_mainw_dpl?ie=UTF8&m=AL9OWV9BXEZKZ	-1
After one year and six pieces in figurative sculpture.  I have attempted to paint this in Latex and Acrylic . The paint does not adhere well. I can still push the well cured paint off with a firm finger. This does not meet professional standards for polychromed sculpture . The sanding method , detergent method ...none work. The paint does not stick well ..no matter how long it sits. The paint adherence is minimal. IMHE Coating the paint afterwards with a sealer makes no difference since the paint is still weak mechanically where it meets the epoxy. Water , handling and any light abrasion will ruin the paint finish. I am a professional sculptor and artist.  * Primers make no sense...it is an epoxy . Rough sanding makes no sense..it ruins the piece. Light sanding makes no sense , the epoxy polishes to a sheen with a rag.  I feel I cannot work this material anymore for polychrome ,  since once a complete piece goes to a buyer , if the paint fails , it reflects upon my work. * As a sculptor's clay it is very strong in general , proves to be brittle were thinly modeled and takes detail reasonably well. Fine detail must but cut once the clay is cured . I will use the white for sculptures , but no paint is planned , it mimics alabaster quite well. The natural mimics pot metal.  *  Prove me wrong , take one of your pieces and polish it , tell me which paint you use.	-1
I 100% thought that Tropical Glow meant that the floss would actually glow.  This is NOT the case.  Although the floss is brightly colored and quite pretty, it does not glow in the dark like I expected it to.  I wish it was reasonable enough for me to return this, but return shipping is nearly half the cost of the product itself.  VERY disappointed.  Only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because the colors are pretty.  DMC should really re-label this product so that people know it does NOT glow in the dark.	-1
I have purchased both normal and italic fonts. The size of italic fonts of Fiskar is perfect for stamping but this one is way too big. Good for poster work but not cards. Cant even return it. Shipping cost too high.	-1
Letters were larger than expected. They do not cling to my Fiskars Stamp Press.  If Amazon would give a full and complete description of the item I would have known in advance that this set didn't suit my needs. The capital letters are 3/4" high, and the small letters are approximately 2/8" high depending on the letter. I measured an "m".	-1
broke right away	-1
I am 21 and couldn't get it. NOT FOR CHILDREN	-1
the punch was faulty from the beginning but returning it is not worth the bother, money wasted. big disappointment because I thought Fiskars was the best in punches! hope I was the only one to receive a faulty tool...	-1
I used my Transfer Pen on canvas instead of regular material so I'm not sure how it would work on material. On canvas it was sort of splotchy. In some areas the ink was dark and in others it was lighter, but about half the image didn't come off at all no matter how hot I got the iron, or how long I left it on the image. I also had to use the whole pen for just one image (a large one). In the end I switched to regular iron-on pencils which I was able to purchase locally and got two pencils for half the price of the one pen and they worked much better on the canvas I was using. I would suggest trying the pens and pencils both and seeing which ones work best for the specific projects you're working on.	-1
Its too thick and it doesn't make nice thin lines. I wouldn't recommend it as I didn't like it..	-1
The ink dries out pretty quick and the transfer is too light.	-1
It makes a thick line and bleeds.  I'm not happy with it.  I prefer a finer pencil-like line.	-1
I just opened this seam ripper from its package and poked around in the seam I was trying to open, and the tip of this seam ripper broke off into the seam!  It was wedged in there, so I had some trouble pulling it out.  But in under a couple minutes from opening, it went in the trash.  Cheap!  Cheap!  Cheap!	-1
Very thick handle but sharp cutter	-1
I bought this seam ripper because of the ergonomic handle. It is a comfortable handle to grasp if you have arthritis in your hands as I do. However, the blade is not very sharp, and worse, the item does not come with a cap for for the blade. You can't carry it around in a sewing bag, and it is a hazard on your sewing table if you have little ones around. I'm sorry I bought it.	-1
Worst pipe cleaners I have ever used.  I bought three packages and used only 3 or 4 cleaners before throwing the rest in the trash.	-1
I have made many, many stockings and this one was the worst. The face is small and needs to be pre printed so that no embroidery is necessary on it. Very hard to get the mouth right. I will never make another one of these. I have always been very good at embroidery but this was difficult. I was so sick of it by the time I got it finished it wasn't even pretty. Hope you have better luck with it than I had.	-1
Very poor quality, not happy	-1
Thread kept breaking in my machine.  I thought it was made in USA but was wrong, it's made in China.  Oh well.	-1
It got torn as I was embroidering. Not as good as described.	-1
We've been buying this brand and product for several years and like the product. However, this order is a failure.  The product smells like dryer sheets or some perfume and there are many crinkled sheets.  Not happy with the strong odor and wadded sheets.  We'll be considering a different brand when ordering again.	-1
Thin and flimsy should be listed as light weight tear away.  Had to use two pieces for medium weight.	-1
way too thin, have to use double sheets making it not such a great buy.	-1
It was referred to me by a friend and since it was on sale, I went for it. I don't like it at all. I prefer Sulky brand. This brand leaves "poop" all over the back when you try to peel it off. Sulky brands pull off very clean. Uggghhh and there is such a huge amount of this to use.	-1
I thought there would be more to this.  It is just a piece of very light plastic that holds the strings down.  The rest is up to you.  It does come with some cheap string, a fair amount of plastic pony beads, and some plastic toggle ends.  The directions were not that easy to understand.  I had to do some trial and error to figure it out.  I thought this might be fun for my kids, ages 6 and 7, but they'd be reduced to screaming fits of frustration in no time.  I quietly got rid of it without them knowing I ever had it.  There's nothing here you couldn't buy more cheaply at the craft/fabric store, and with better quality.  I'm sure there are better instructions to be found online as well.	-1
I used this and it is suppose to be tearaway.  It is not easy to tear this material.  I had a problem with stitches ripping out.  To me it feels more like a heavy weight.	-1
This is the absolute worst cut away stabilizer I have EVER used. It is super thing and stretchy, almost like a WSS. It had caused my current project to wrinkle completely and now it has to be trashed. I am returning this product & caution you not to purchase!	-1
I was a little disappointed in this stabilizer as it did not seem to hold its shape very well when trying to hoop it.  It is suited for the small hoops seemed a little underweight for being advertised as regular weight.	-1
I bought the regular cutaway sheets from this listing & it is horrible, I will never purchase this brand again! It's advertised as regular, but it's way to thin! What it looks like after washing is trash & left a ton of "lint" all over my shirts! I'm so glad I only used this on my families personal shirts and not any of my paid orders! Added photos to show what it looked like after 1 wash (no dryer), of course my designs now I can't get the designs to stay flat either. What a waste of money! I'll stick with buying my sheets from World Weidner, they have quality stabilizer!	-1
I embroider for a living. I have always thought a tear away stabalizer was of the same quality. That is until this one. It is very poor quality. Normally, I can pull the paper away from my design with ease. This stabalizer requires alot more time and effort to successfully remove. I have an almost full roll of this that I cannot use.  Needless to say, I give this product one star.  If I could give it a negative rating I would. Very displeased with quality.	-1
It does not do a clean tear away..... Had too many edges after tearing.......	-1
This does not tear away. It leaves a residue. It adheres ok - not as well as other brands. Cannot recommend.	-1
seems a little thin for medium weight	-1
It did not fit my 4x 4 hoop. Thats my fault. I needed to go to larger 8 x 8. Not sure what I cam do with this one. Maybe save it when I buy the cap hoop??	-1
What a bad product. Thin as cheesecloth. I had read the reviews and so I ordered 15 yards. Can't use it for anything. No flannel to it. Seller takes returns, but the cost to ship 15 yards back is prohibitive so I'm stuck with it. I cannot recommend this product.	-1
As soon as I took this out of the packaging I noticed all the holes! I counted three, but they were near the bottom, and since I order more length than I needed, I trimmed them off. It wasn't until I went to attach the tulle to the comb that I noticed all the others! They were much deeper, about 20" from the side. Every hole was about the size of a nickle. I decided to trim the side to remove them, and see what the veil would look like. I wanted a 108' wide veil, but now it's only 80" due to all the flaws in the fabric. Luckily, the defects were on the same side, or else there is no way I would have kept it.  It doesn't wrap around me like I wanted, so I haven't decided if you should keep it or try again (with a different seller).	-1
I'm looking at it on the window right now. It is not even close to 100% light blocking.	-1
It was dirty!  I should have returned it but didn't.  But I have not used it due to poor condition.	-1
This wasn't what I was expecting. I was thinking the material would be more plush, and soft. This is very similar to terry cloth. It's actually quite thin, between the rows of chenille. This fabric is ok, I ordered 6 yards so I will definitely be using it on my burp cloths and bibs. But probably won't order again. And this material sheds like nothing I've ever seen!!!! See the photo I attached, that seriously came out of my dryer vent trap. It was like 2" thick!  Update-I'm pretty disappointed in this material. It is not soft at all!! I really don't want to use this for any type of baby product. Now I have a 6yd heap of this stuff	-1
Unfortunately the paint is old and dried out.  Returning.	-1
Unfortunately the paint is old and dried out.  Returning.	-1
ONLY for machine embroidery, I guess.	-1
Yuck.  Poorly wrapped and dirty Would not purchase  again	-1
These pens do not flow as smoothly or evenly as another brand. They give a nice fine glitter. I won't buy this brand again.	-1
v good i am sure but they did not say copic and they aren't that great for the price ..dissapointed .. but a great return ..poloicy	-1
Not much color.	-1
...Because I read the reviews before I purchased. I order about $200 in pens of all sorts a month. I try to keep the price down. So far my favorite for the money WERE SargentArt Glitter metallics. But they have been discontinued :{. Next are Fiskars. Always clear running ink. So when I saw these, I thought "Oh, these are a bit pricey, but hey! Maybe they are really impressive and I will treat myself. BIG NO!!!! These pens run dry VERY fast. As a matter of fact, they dried out afer about a square INCH of covered area. There are so many good reviews here, maybe the ones I bought have been on the shelf for a while (makes sense since they are twice the amount of fiskars and with fiskars you get 48 pens, this package was only 12 pens so they probably do not move as fast) So, truly, even if they ran great, and didn't run out, the colors are not so impressive that I would make the same mistake again.	-1
Thankfully, I bought only two of these overpriced pens (Gold and Clear) because both of them are awful. As opposed to Sakura Stardust glitter pens, the Copics are scratchy with bad ink flow. The Gold tone is a strange sort of 18K-type color, totally lacking in expected richness. The Clear one is truly clear because the mica concentration in it is very low. If you're looking for dazzle, these overhyped Copic pens won't deliver it. Normally, I use a combination of fine-nib markers: Copic Original, the excellent new Shinhan Touch Twin and Sakura Micron.  Sakura Microns beat pricey Copic Multiners as well.	-1
Sorry, but I wish I had better luck with these pens.  They are OK for the most part, but the Silver one is the worst of all because I barely get any glitter out of it at all.  The other pens I do get some color, but I was expecting some flow out of the pens.  I have to push really hard to get any glitter out of any of the pens.  All I can say is that I will not be buying these again. I really was expecting better for the price.	-1
Not sure if this is good chalk due to the fact that it arrived broken into little peices. I would advise you to buy at your local store is at all possible.	-1
Case	-1
This was a gift. Unable to comment.	-1
OK.	-1
Reviewed one that looked used and had a strong perfumey odor. Had to return it.	-1
This is the biggest piece of crap I have ever gotten off of here. I opened the package and 5 minutes later returned it. the handle doesnt look like this picture does it looked like it was inverted...I didn't see any singer branding on this either. I don't believe this is Singer product. Anyway, its pretty thin in the plastic department too....the bottom was beveled....I just wasn't going to pay for something that looked like that..	-1
I sent back three of these because it wasn't assembled properly and parts were missing. This could have resulted in dropping the machine on the floor.	-1
Took a month to ship it out and it didn't work.	-1
Not happy, this was faulty on receiving, it wasn't replaced, part refund was given, and I still lost a lot of money, sadly.	-1
I sent the product back when I learned that the only software for can't be used to create individual designs.	-1
I got the pink on instead of this green one I order, But that was not a big deal, wihat was it that i didn't come with the Cricut Cartridge it said it  come with  the pink one  was not happy with that and I try to contact them and still no Answers	-1
Yeah very bad company. I purchased the Silhouette Cameo and the eClips. Both are really good and alot better than the Cricut. I can design whatever I want cut. I can't imagine how anyone could buy and stay with the Cricut company. You CANNOT design your own cut....	-1
You cant print off of SVG images. Or ask it to print anything for that matter unless it is an image that is on a proprietary "Circut" cartridge.  The expense of this along is well over $3000 if you were to buy the cartridges at a DISCOUNTED price!  Next major issue is that it requires 'sticky' mats to cut.  which works great for the cutting... not so much for getting your project off of said mat.  Overall, there are better products that offer more options and cost less. Especially long term.	-1
I don't really scrapbook. I might start after this, but making artsy layouts of personal photos (half of which were taken against my will) is just not how I would like to spend my time. I collect dolls, mostly Barbie, and I like to make little dioramas and backgrounds for them with various props and scrapbooking elements. (Yes, I'm one of *those* people.) I mostly wanted this for the Disney classics images and decided to get this to see if I liked it before I jumped into a&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Silhouette-Cameo-Starter-Kit-Bundle-Cutter/dp/B007R83VKE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Silhouette Cameo Starter Kit Bundle Cutter</a>. Unless you are dead set on using specific licensed images, many of which are only available on the secondary market at inflated prices, you may just want to go straight to the Cameo instead.  Whoever tagged this as a throwback to printers and tech in the 1980s was spot on. The display and the cartridges make this thing look like some kind of dot matrix printer/Atari hybrid. A good systems analyst probably has all the parts to make one of these things stuffed somewhere up in his attic. They have a more advanced LCD touch screen on the Expression 2, but I read too many reviews citing screens spontaneously dying to risk it--especially with so many customer service horror stories.  I think this is meant for people who are not very computer-savvy. The promos and descriptions seem to emphasize its use as a stand-alone product. What gets me is that if you can keep track of what you've printed and where it's going to go on the mat, you should be able to figure out the Cricut Craft Room software. I suppose the up side of this is that if you're taking it with you, you wouldn't necessarily have to lug around your laptop as well. However I bet I could run the whole kit & caboodle on a tablet or a Dell Mini 9 with little or no hacking, maybe even wirelessly.  That said, the more they overtake the plumbing, the easier it is to stop up the drain. I tried using it without the computer, but it was slow and it still doesn't make efficient use of paper. I'm comfortable enough with computers and have no plans to start schlepping this machine all over the place for show and tell, so I'm using a Windows 7 PC. Craft Room software (available from the website) will be a breeze for most people to learn, even those not technically inclined. To me, having the layout in front of me on screen is much easier than trying to remember what I've input into the keypad, which shape is where, or what color I should load next.  Draconian DRM: I knew about this going in, and it's been discussed already in other reviews, but it bears mentioning again. Not only can you not unlink cartridges, but you can't import your own images. I see where this has already ticked off a lot of business owners who bought one of these to make their own logos and signs. When I've gotten tired of the same Disney images and generic shapes that everyone else has, and chasing after retired cartridges in the hundreds of dollars, a different machine and parting of ways seems inevitable.  The secondary market on some of the retired cartridges is kind of puzzling. I can understand this when there is absolutely no other way to get an image set you want, but Cricut sells digital versions of some of their retired cartridges at a fraction of what linked and non-linked physical cartridges go for on auction sites. When you buy a digital copy instead of a cartridge, you're tethered to a computer and you must have an internet connection. None of that bothers me, but I guess it bothers the people who want to use this computer-free, or who aren't comfortable with purchasing digital files. Even brand new, cartridges are heinously expensive. I expect to pay more for Disney, Hello Kitty and other licensed images, but for generic stuff they scanned out of a Dover catalog, they should not be gouging people like that.  Like other bugs, some Cricuts just need to be stomped. Just opening the box, it was easy to understand why some people hate this company so much. They included a power cord, and that was about it, besides a couple of cartridges that no one wants anyway. There are instructions too, but I don't know how they expect technically challenged people to be able to figure it out. They skimped on everything else, and I do mean everything. They didn't even include a cable for the computer, and that ought to come standard. I mean, I didn't expect wireless, but that's inexcusable whether they're pushing this on the computer-impaired or not.  If you already do a lot of scrapbooking and paper projects, chances are you already have extra tools to get started. If not, and if you get nothing else, get a paper cutter and a spatula. The spatula helps you get paper off the cutting mat. A paper cutter is useful for splitting sheets into halves so that you don't have to cut an entire sheet at once.  Because all I had was a pair of scissors, and because I saved so much by getting an Amazon Warehouse Deal, I got a&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Cricut-Essentials-Kit/dp/B000NTBNEA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Cricut Essentials Kit</a>. This kit is overpriced and should have been included with the Cricut. The box set of tools kind of resembles a medieval torture kit and I'm not sure how to use some of them. I have to wonder if they took them from a dentist's office. I didn't realize the 6x12 mats were not for use with the Expression, and the 6x12 paper included in the kit is lackluster to say the least. A lot of paper crafters will find it redundant and probably already have better quality stuff. I am going to take a thorough look at all of it, but I have a feeling that I may send it back in favor of buying better tools or just getting individual pieces. Get the machine with the starter tool kit bundle if you really want to make cuts the minute you de-box it.  A couple of extra 12x12 mats will come in handy for getting more paper ready to go while one sheet is cutting, but I don't think I would get any more than 2 spares. They try to DRM you with these mats, too. If you use spray adhesive on them to get more use out of them, it voids the warranty. (Apparently just owning the Cricut voids the warranty.) Well, according to a lot of what I've read here, they don't stand behind their warranty anyway, so what's stopping you? I say once you've passed the 30 day return window with Amazon, if you're loving it, get a can of spray adhesive and cut those shapes till the blues go away. You'll spend enough money on replacement blades without sending these mats to the landfill every single time.  I guess the big question is, does it cut? Yes it does, and it does it well. I got great shapes on my first try on scrap paper, and I was quickly making shapes to keep. This is the sharp, precise stuff you would expect to find in a package of cutouts at the store. I will probably have all the Disney classics shapes that I want and few resources to keep buying cartridges for other things. In a few days, I'm going to be bored, and it appears that Cricut likes it that way.  Through litigation with extreme prejudice, Cricut has managed to crush third party software that allows you to make your own images or use anything that you didn't buy from Cricut. They can forget about cottage industries that would have made crafters happy and ultimately contributed to their own bottom line. Rude responses, stupid answers and avoiding warranty obligations are all over the place, and there are too many of the same kinds of complaints for it not to have some basis in fact. They want you to use all of their products, but they take none of the responsibility when something goes wrong. I keep seeing rumors of imminent bankruptcy, and it's not hard to believe.  Finally, I bought this as an Amazon Warehouse deal. The description said that the outer package might have some damage. It looked to me like the original Cricut seal had been broken, but everything inside had remained untouched. It worked just fine and you can return it within 30 days. Amazon is a 5 star retailer-- it's such a shame that this product is not.  Overall, I am happy with what I set out to do, but it leaves me wanting too much more. I cannot recommend this machine in good conscience. Unless you have your heart set on images you can't get anywhere else, do not buy this machine. Check out the Cameo, and if you do buy this, know what you are getting into. They don't back the quality of their work and they have business practices that would make Bernie Madoff blush with shame. They should call this machine the Suck Cut, because it sucks as it cuts--- mostly from your wallet, but especially from your creative spirit.	-1
I was dissapointed that the company has made it impossible for you to use their product with anything other than their own overpriced cartridges.  I returned the one I purchase and bought a very similar item from another manufacturer with a less greedy business model.  I did use the machine once after I bought it and it did fine, So if you want to be restricted in your creativity by the availability and price of the cricut carts, buy this.  I have told cricut and now I am sharing with all of you that I would not support this company unless they change their policy.	-1
I had two duds before I got one that worked right. Customer support is a joke. :( But when you do get them, customer service has delays and runaround patter down to a T.  I only bought the machine to use it with Sure Cuts a Lot. Fortunately I bought my machine before the lawsuit, but... I can no longer update it for fear of it no longer working with my third party software.  Just not a good value, I gingerly use it for occasional projects, as it intermittently make weird noises now. When it dies I am getting something that works with third party software.  Oh, and they have the most ridiculously restrictive 'Angel Policy' in the world. Totally full of unenforceable bull crap. Why they would lie to us, their customers, on this stuff is unclear, but it lets you know they don't value us.	-1
UPDATE: I originally gave this machine 5 stars, but I no longer can recommend the Cricut Expression. They sued the Sure Cuts A Lot company (Craft Edge)and won, so now you can no longer get the program for your Cricut unless you already had it before the settlement. You are now forced to buy the expensive cartridges and their software which is in no way comparable to the Sure Cuts A Lot program. If you aren't computer savvy and prefer the cartridges, this is the machine for you, but if you are comfortable with computers, this is NOT the machine for you. I just ordered the Silhouette Cameo, which offers their own software for $50 that is very comparable to the Sure Cuts A Lot software AND it can cut 12" x 10ft! I will definitely do an extensive review on that machine once I receive it and play with it a little.  Original Review: This is a very nice machine and can cut 12x12(the mat it comes with)or 12x24, which is large enough for anything I need to make. I love that it has the flip feature on the machine. The personal electronic cutter does not. This is useful if you need to flip your words, when making stencils, etc. This one comes with the 2 basic cartridges. So, I think that this is the best deal on the Expression that you can find anywhere, so get it before it's gone. I also wanted to mention that I purchased the Sure Cuts Alot program to use with this machine. It allows you to use ANY image that you can find on the internet. The program costs just a little more than one cartridge and the possibilities are limitless. I hope this helps=)	-1
Do not purchase this product. There are many cutting machines available that allow flexibility in using computer software to be creative. Provo Craft does not... you're virtually strapped to using their cartridges only. And they constantly inflate the prices on those cartridges. Their customer service leaves a lot to be desired!	-1
I just bought a Cricut Expression yesterday at a local store.  It was marked down to $99, with a 20% coupon on all craft supplies.  I couldn't believe I scored it for $80!  My joy was short-lived though.  I had previously owned an Expression a few years ago, using it mostly to make lettering for my store's signs.  I had always planned to buy the Sure-Cuts-a-Lot software, as I could never afford to spend $60-90 for a cartridge that usually only has a few designs on it that I like.  But I had to close my store and I sold the Cricut for financial reasons.  Yesterday, I finally was able to get a Cricut!  But then I got home and did some research, and found out that Provo Craft, the company that makes Cricut, sued the companies that make Sure-Cuts-a-Lot and Make-the-Cut (a similar software)to prevent them from making their software Cricut-compatible.  This software makes it possible to use free fonts and dingbats off the internet to create your own designs to cut, for free.  Hey, Provo-Crap, think you're going to force me to buy your over-priced cartridges?  Think again!  I might have bought one occasionally, when I saw one I loved.  Now you won't get my business at all.  With more research, I found SEVERAL competing machines, most of which worked with at least one of those cutting design softwares.  Black Cat Cougar Cutter looked the best, but was expensive (it etches metal and glass, and embosses leather--cooooool). There are a couple of new versions of cutters coming out this fall (2011) that are better than the Cricut. I'm leaning toward the Sizzix Eclips or the Silhouette Cameo.  Some of these machines might be a little bit more expensive than Cricut, but far, far, FAR cheaper in the long run!  The Expression I just bought is going on craigslist.  I'm not the only pissed-off Cricut buyer.  I've heard of many others packing up their Cricut stuff and selling it on craigslist or ebay to buy another machine.  Count me as just one more, Provo Crap.  I bought my Cricut Expression for only $80, and it's STILL not worth it in the long run.  Even at that price, buying 3 cartridges in the future would put me right back up in the price range of the competing machines, which all allow you to use the money-saving design software, without restricting you to their proprietary cartridges.  Even at $80, the Cricut Expression just isn't worth it!!  Five years ago it would have been worth it, when Cricut was the only game in town...but now, with (superior) competition out there?  Forget it.  P.S. the fact that a store had it for sale at $99 and didn't exclude it from the 20% arts and crafts department sale should tell you something...the stores are having a hard time selling them, it seems.	-1
Cricut has decided that you are to be cartridged bound.  Personally,  I find this very limiting and expensive as it will require you to continue to buy new cartridges all the time.  Sadly this is what Provo Craft is wanting.  There was third party software companies that allowed you to create your own images and creations.  Provo Craft has begun suing these companies.  A machine with so much potential and options gets very limited very quickly when you are forced to to use only cartridges all the time.  For my money I will focus on a cutter that does not require cartridges and will allow me to make my own designs.  In my eyes Cricut has potential but the company is choosing to limit the product.	-1
I got this as a gift for Christmas.  I bought all the accessories, including the deeper blade.  I found that the machine does not cut chip board as the product claims.  It also does not cut quilting fabric.  Both of which are demonstrated on the DVD provided.  I spent another $40 attending a class at a local scrapbooking store using the Cricut Expressions.  I am glad I did this because it reassured me that I was not a slow learner.  The instructor also had problems trying to get the machine to perform, and the instructions provided were very vague and poorly written. When I have called the customer service at Provo Craft the "tech" did not know how to use the machine, and was not helpful. On the up side, I did buy the software package, on sale.  The software has been essential for me to be able to use the cartridges.  I agree that all the Cricut products are way over priced, especially when there is little or no customer support.  Save your money and buy ready made die cuts.	-1
I don't know why I didn't send this back.  It didn't really work for what I bought it for and it smelled so badly of smoke. I don't know how or why it smelled of smoke.  I don't think it came from someone's home...but it reeked.  If it didn't smell like smoke and it works for what you wanted it for then it would be a great product.	-1
I didn't realize the size. I was hoping for a case that would hold all my Tulip crochet hooks but this was a monster of a case, more for knitting needles.	-1
I loved this bag. However I have two small issues. One, I wish the top had a zipper so that if I use this while traveling I would not have to worry about anything flying out of it since it can't fold very flat with things in it. Second, one of the best things that I liked and made me order this bag is that it can stand freely. While the outside pockets have nice vinyl plastic,the bottom of the bag is canvas. I often knit and crochet on the beach, or decks/balconies or docks so I need something waterproof around damp sand or wood. To try and solve the issue I bought a sheet of craft foam, then measured and cut the piece to fit the bottom of the bag when open. I have yet to try it, but hopefully that works. If not, then this bag will not travel with me and stay at home. Update a few months later: I loved this bag so much that I ordered another. The first one was the natural color. I used it on vacation, it was so handy during a few days of use on the beach and in our hotel room that I decided to use that at home and bought a black one to use only travel,because it should stay cleaner. A few days ago at home the first bag completely broke. The metal screws in the rods that crisscross under the bag and on the sides, not only popped out on both sides, but BROKE right out of the holes. Bag would not stand up freely anymore, was unfixable and had to be tossed You can't still use the bag if the metal rods are flopping around because there is no way to get the bag off of the metal unless you cut it off. Now I am using the second bag at home, I don't trust it for vacations and expect this one to break sooner or later. I did not overstuff the bag. It was not even folded much. It did not get wet on the beach. After one use during traveling it was mostly on the floor all day by my knitting chair, sometimes I would pick it up and fold it to move it but not often. The metal is cheap and ruins an otherwise nice bag. Cannot recommend this bag now.	-1
I don't like it.  I found the cutter dull and did not cut very well at all.	-1
The needles are to long, I cant use them. The small metal anchors that hold the needles are to long,  Doing any kind of  knitting is not possible	-1
I waited for a few months to really try these out and am glad I did to let the public know. I can't stand these. The needle points are so dull, the stainless steel needle paint comes off easily and you're left with a rough needle. The cables that are included are really stiff and your delicate yarn gets stuck on the  connections. I'd ask for a refund but know I payed for these in November. Please take my advice fellow new knitters. :-(	-1
Best price you'll find online for these. Great that this comes with so many needles but the connector cables suck! They pretty much always want to stay twisted and this makes it hard to knit with. I got these because I needed circular knitting needles but I honestly don't use this kit at all because the connectors and cables constantly become untwisted from each other and the needles. I'd have to always stop every so often to check  them. Plus side is that this comes with a nice case and the needles are color coded. That's about it.	-1
This is an attractive set, the needles are a nice texture, I thought I liked it very much.  But I am 1 skein into the first sweater I am knitting with it, and the needle just separated from the cable.  I thought it had come unscrewed.  No. It broke, with the screw in the needle.  The needle is ruined, the cable is ruined.  Un-useable.  Incredibly cheap.  I want a replacement, but they say it's already past the point when I can return it. I don't recommend this!	-1
Cords are horrendous, gave the set away.	-1
Unfortunately my needles were not in the best of shape. The #2 tip were bent and I couldn't even get my #4's on the cable because they were bent. I was able to fix them well enough to use but I was very disappointed.	-1
It's really sad to see how poor the quality of Boye products has become. I bought this set because I wanted a large range of needle sizes in a small case to take with me when I knit away from home. The first set I bought, had 2 needles with deep gouges in them, was missing a cable, and the case didn't zip completely closed because of the way it was sewn in. I exchanged it for another set. That one had some weird sticky substance on several of the needles, and the size 2's were rough and had a few sharp bumps on them. There's no way sock yarn was going to slide down those things. They also had a kind of mottled, corroded look to them. I took that set back to the store as well, and apparent glutton for punishment that I am, I exchanged it again for ANOTHER one. Today, I unzipped the case and the zipper slider broke into 2 pieces and fell off in my hand, rendering the zipper useless. I have had the set for all of 2 weeks.  I don't think it's possible for them to use cheaper, chintzier, materials. From the case, to the needles, to the cables, it's all junk. The case is plastic, and all the tools inside are held down with loops and pockets made out of pieces of thin, clear vinyl (the kind my grandma used to put over her tablecloths to protect them). The cables are rock hard and stiff, and there are only 4 included in the set. I have an old set of (really nice) Boye needles with soft cables that came with 5. The needles themselves don't compare in quality to the old ones. I'm debating whether I should return this set or not. If I do, it'll be for a refund. I won't be wasting any more of my hard-earned cash on rubbish.  When Boye sold the company to Wilton, they should have not allowed them to keep using the "Boye" name unless they agreed to keep the quality up on their products. Now all they're producing is inferior, made-in-China crap.	-1
Totally disappointed! The item i received visibly had damaged needles so I did not open or use it yet. Maybe if simplicity would send me an undamaged item, I can make a better review...	-1
These needles are horrible. I'm very disappointed with boye company. I would be careful before getting these.	-1

Gave them away.  Join on three of the needles was turned up like a cuff which caught on everything.  Very cheap, not made for smooth knitting.	-1
Come unscrewed very very often and the cords are very rigid. I've had them about a year and I'm ready to pitch them and move on. If you don't knit often, or are new and not sure you want to spend the money for decent needles yet, these are passable and will work in a pinch. It will make the next needles you buy seem like a dream.	-1
A nice sized set with the full spectrum of tips from 1 to 13, and three cables that can be put together or used separately to create a variety of sizes.  The trouble with this set is that the joins are not clean, and come apart frequently and catch on the yarn.  When using this set, I usually have to tighten the joins after every round.  Not fun.  I invested in a higher quality set and now only use these when I need a size i can't find among my other needles.	-1
I had to tighten the tips onto the cables after every row.  I Gave up and bought an Addi set.	-1
I bought these because they are inexpensive.  You quickly learn fear because they unscrew very easily.  AND THEN, one attempt at tightening the out of fear, and the soft metal of the needles, lips when you screw the cable in - and you can't get the yarn over it without a fight.  Plus, the kit had one bad knitting cable connector, so in-between projects... I had to work around my lack of enough resources.  fine, for a first purchase, but one thing goes wrong in your projects and you are in trouble.  I expected more.  I would recommend investing in at least a $60-90 brand of needles.  It's a step up, but you won't waste cash.	-1
My daughter purchased these for me as a Christmas gift. I have used them maybe twice and have lost one size of a needle because of spuring of the aluminum. I use the tools properly to attach and tighten them to the cords, but the needles still come unscrewed. Reattaching them constantly is what causes the spurs. My husband had to actually sand down one of the needles so I could finish a project I was working on. The cables are VERY stiff and uncomfortable to work with. I won't be using these needles again unless I absolutely have to.  I would not recommend them at all.	-1
While this kit looked great the needles work themselves lose from the cord. I followed the sketchy directions on how to make sure they are tight but didn't help.  Also the joint between the needle and the cord is rough and the yarn gets stuck. Miserable waste of money. I ordered a couple individual needles from another supplier. Don't waste your time with these.	-1
the needles don't stay together no matter how tight you make them and yarn will not move freely on needle extensions	-1
Love the variety of sizes, but the needles keep unscrewing while I am knitting and the needles themselves don't say the size so if you place them in the wrong spot in the case, you can mistakingly use the wrong needle, especially the smaller ones.	-1
My first set of interchangeable knitting needles were the Denise brand.... plastic needles and plastic connecting parts.  They kept disconnecting while I worked with them... completely unacceptable.  So, I purchased these aluminum needles thinking they would be better and stronger.  One use, they also disconnected!  Second use, I used their included tools, a gripper and a key (similar to an unbent paperclip) to tighten them.  The female end of the needle fanned out of shape when I tightened it!  Size no. 8, now useless because the needle will snag the yarn!  Third use, size 2 for a pair of mittens, the blob of plastic on the wire connecting to the male screw piece is bigger than the needle.  So all the work must remain on the needle and cannot be moved down onto the wire!  Just very disappointed and now in the market for another set!  I cannot recommend these.	-1
I was knitting a blanket in the round, it didn't even get to lap size before the size 5 needle just snapped at the threading, lost a bunch of my stitches. I'm not an "aggressive" knitter and I've never broken interchangeable needles before. It was extremely frustrating, I don't trust the rest of the set now and the size 5 is my favorite anyway.	-1
The price reflects the quality, which is poor.  Knitters will quickly outgrow this kit as they move on to finer yarns and more demanding projects. If you are the sort of person to take up knitting just to make a dishtowel then this kit will suffice, however you would be better off just buying the set of needles you need for that individual product and saving your money. Boyle's Interchangeable Needlemaster System is very clunky and very clumsy and tends to ensnare the yarn. The needle tips themselves are ok but the wires quickly unscrew and are inflexible and can cause a lot of damage to your project.  If you intend to sit and knit for long hours or do any intermediate to advance projects these the Needlemaster kit will hold you back. A better buy at a similar price would be Knitpicks Harmony, Metal or Sunstruck options or better yet, Knitter's Pride as they have 16" circular options. The 16" circular option on the Needlemaster barely bends to make a full circle. If you knit Magic Loop style you will find yourself constantly laboring against the stiffness of the wires. The larger needles (US 10 and up) are hard to work even when placed on the 24" options. The smaller needles are even harder to control on any of the cables. Only 6-9 are really usable on the 24" cable and up.  Save your money, the strain on your hands and nerves and invest $10-20 more in another kit. The resale value of the Needlemaster is practically worthless due to the fact that both amateur and professional knitters quickly outgrow this kit and buy better quality ones.	-1
Didn't work that great!	-1
A clumsy little device for which I ultimately found no use.  It's stashed in my craft room awaiting a child who might like to tinker with it.	-1
I have a lot of circular needles, various materials & cord lengths. I wanted a neat, zipper case with interchangeable needle tips for travel. I had a 50% coupon from a big chain store,and was very happy with the set.....until halfway through my first project the tip unscrewed from the cord and I had to pick up lost stitches.  I retightened the tip to the connector with the included tool, and used the rubber grip pad to secure it, only to have the tip loosen time and time again. Then, I found that tightening the tip expands the bottom end of the aluminum tip and make a ridge that snags yarn. OK, I flattened the swedged end by rolling the base of the tip on a hard surface, snugged up the tip and continued my project. But I'm really unhappy with the tip connecting system!!  I thought I was saving a lot of money by getting the Boye set ( and on sale, too!), but I have since taken the expensive plunge to an Addi Click system.  I knit for relaxation, not to fight my tools. PROS; compact kit, neatly organized, nice sharp smooth tips, colorful, extra parts included. CONS; the connecting joint is horribly designed and loosens no matter how carefully you follow the tightening directions.  I have no idea how some of the reviewers here can put up with this flaw--it's a deal breaker. FYI; don't try using a temporary thread locking liquid like blue Locktite to keep the tip and cord screwed together. It works once, but is impossible to clean off the inner threads of the tip.	-1
I purchased this for making jewelry with wire. For that purpose it is not very good. It may be better with cord or thread but if you want to make wire jewelry stick to the spool knitters made for yarn. Might work ok if you are using elastic thread that has a lot of stretch,  As far as I am concerned it is a waste of money. It is also very small. Good size for kids but adults not so much. Would not recommend.	-1
Does not work well for soap felting. Takes forever to felt and even then it still won't felt well.  I waiting a long time for this to arrive too.	-1
I am giving this set two stars because it's at least somewhat usable.  But every single time I complete a round/row I end up re-tightening the cable.  There is no way to tighten the ends so they stay.  I have forgotten to tighten and had my cable come undone several times, which is very frustrating.  Plus, the cables themselves are not very flexible and twist all over the place.  The set really should come with 16" cables since they are used for hats.  I had to order this size separately.  I thought this would be a good entry level set because I'd have all the sizes, but I soon learned that it's not worth messing with.  Don't waste your money.  Invest in a better set or buy your needles as you need them.	-1
I started a hat using in super bulky yarn and the size 13 needles.  I did my cast on of 78 stitches and worked 8 rows of k2p2 ribbing when the cable broke off of the connector.  At first, I thought that I hadn't screwed the pieces together tight enough.  However, I discovered that the plastic cable had actually broken and there was no way to work with it.  My stitches fell off the needles and I had to restart the project on straight needles and seam the hat.  This was a waste of money and time.  I returned them and ordered a different brand of needles from another manufacturer.	-1
I received these needles as a Christmas present which I specifically asked for. How great to have every possible size circular needle I could ever want all in one place! I was extremely excited to try them. My hopes were soon dashed when I pulled the needles/cables out of the package.  The needles themselves are of great quality and pretty colors as others have noted. However, the cables are so incredibly STIFF it is nearly impossible to knit anything small on the smallest size. Also, the bend at the join is so terribly rigid it extends the "needle" making it very hard to knit anything small. I also had to keep re-screwing the needles to the cable which I found extremely frustrating. I am hoping they will possibly work better on larger scale products as they are unable to be returned to the store where they were purchased since it is now an open item. I say save your money and just buy the needles singly as you need them as this is NOT worth the hassle.  One other note for anyone else who is experiencing these issues: I did find this link which seems to provide a nice tutorial on how to make your own cables for this particular set. You can find it here: [...]	-1
Horrible needle set. interchangeable needles are useless because it dislodges frequently causing the yarn to unravel! save your money and instead buy "ADDI TURBO" needles which make knitting much faster and does not dislodge!!!!	-1
Not loving it,  I used as directed and it seems to take off more fabric then just the "pills".  Also noticed that it degraded the fabric. Will not be using this product at all	-1
Easily comes apart.  the strip that holds the hooks in keeps coming off more and more.  Not worth it the money.	-1
does not  work	-1
I can't say how disappointed I am with this machine.  I had wanted to knit blankets for a charity and needed a quick way to produce the blankets.  After I watched the DVD twice, set up the machine, watched a Youtube instruction and worked an entire afternoon, I was unable to produce even five stitches.  The yarn knotted and jammed; I'd unwind it very carefully (those needles look really fragile); then, I'd go back through the process.  After approximately five times of jamming, never once getting more than five stitches cast on, I gave up and returned the machine. This machine is flimsy, and the concept is poorly conceived.  I have knitted for over 40 years and decided that while I'm not a fast knitter, I might actually get a blanket finished by hand whereas with this machine--it ain't gonna happen.  My advice:  don't waste your money on this product.	-1
The Ultimate Sweater Machine does not work very well.  The concept is very good, but the execution is not. The DVD was very informative and made it look very easy.  I love the yarn that came with the machine. The carriage gets stuck about half way across the first row.  After several hours of trying, we finally knit about 1 1/2 rows.  If there isn't enough pressure on the carriage, the keyplate pops up and stops making stitches. If you exert a little more pressure, the carriage jams and will not move in either direction..  If you take the keyplate out or back up a little to get it unjammed, it drops your stitches. We tried re-waxing the keyplate, re-assembling a few times, and also using different tables to make sure it was flat. We made sure the hem was not in the way.  Still not much luck.  It made beautiful stitches when we cast on using the "e stitch" and then moving the needles by hand. If we wanted to knit by hand, I would not have purchased a knitting machine.  My son's words were, " It's the worst present I ever got!"  I am seriously thinking about sending it back.	-1
I know many people posted a positive comment on this product.  However, I found it quite rough on my pure cashmere sweater, even though I quite gently applied it to the surface and barely pulled it across the surface.  It may be better on blended cashmere/wool or some other ingredient combo of yarns.	-1
It was my fault that I ordered the wrong product as I thought this was crochet yarn.  But the colors were very pretty.	-1
This only fits one large hook and two standard size hooks.  The rest of the slots hold tiny thread hooks.  The material holding the hooks is stiff plastic that is very thin.  Use a hook twice and the whole thing rips out.  I've had it 2 days now.  It's just a zippered pouch now.  This item is junk.	-1
very cheaply made	-1
Don't waste your money! I have never worked so hard for so little - the most I ever got was 30 rows of knitting. I could have hand knitted 3 baby blankets in the time I've wasted on this piece of junk. If I had the option to give it zero stars, I would.  This machine is poorly designed. The yarn catches on the underside of the carriage causing countless jams and dropped stitches.  It usually starts to jam on the 3rd or 4th row.  By the time you fix the jam and pick up the dropped stitches, your work is horribly stretched out with uneven stitches. So you rip it out and start over.  The table the machine sits on cannot move or wobble a millimeter or the machine will drop stitches.  The table must also be absolutely level and plumb otherwise it drop stitches.  The clamps used to fasten the machine to the table are inadequate - there are only 2 of them (a third in the middle of the machine would help to stabilize it more) and they loosen frequently causing the machine to move when you're knitting a row and then, more dropped stitches.  The joints where the 2 halves of the bed join together are uneven and often snag the yarn causing jams and dropped stitches.  The instructions tell you to wax the plates but you must generously wax the whole machine to get it to work at all.  That includes the underside of the plates, the bed, the green strip that the carriage rides on, the spaces where the bed sections meet.  I'm done!  It goes back to the store tomorrow.	-1
Didn't like	-1
The plastic tabs in the inside tore immediately. I expected elastic tabs inside to hold the crochet hooks. Cannot recommend.	-1
I really love the idea of things that don't need batteries, but I did not like this stone. Initially I thought it was pretty cool, BUT I have learned that brushing fabric with something coarse like this upsets the fiber and creates more fuzz, more wear-and-tear, and eventually more pills. It was slow work using this on my sweaters, and often the stone would flip out of my hand. Yes it removes the pills, but it also removes other fibers from the surface of your knitted fabrics and creates the problem I mentioned above. And, the stone itself sheds tiny grains as you use it, making a little mess.  CUTTING (shaving, clipping) is the best way to remove pills without damaging the surrounding fabric.	-1
doesn't hold crochet hooks very well.. the space for the hooks is very tight. Smaller hooks are held great, but nothing over a 6mm I would say	-1
What a huge waste of money.  It leaves black pieces all over the place.  You can only use it outside unless you want to spend time cleaning up after yourself.	-1
Shredded the shirt as it crumbled apart. Absolutely terrible! Don't waste your money.	-1
I was excited to have a "knitter" that would be more compact than the current popular "round looms" which I have been using.  The instructions that come with this are very vague.  I do not know how to "knit" but have had lots of fun with my round looms but I cannot figure this one out at all.  Product is probably great if you have previous knitting knowledge.	-1
I was not happy with the stitch counter has the picture shows that it had a pendant with it and when i got it it did not have it so very unhappy with not having it .	-1
Followed the surprisingly extensive and detailed directions to perfection. I even used three different sized scissors to get everything just right. After opening the device, the Pom ended up looking like an odd sort of flattish poorly shaped standard Pom, let alone a heart shaped Pom. With the amount of shaping I had to do with my scissors afterward, I might as well use a standard clover Pom maker and shaped a heart on my own! I would have saved so much time. I purchased several clover standard Pom makers and those don't require nearly as much detail. This heart shaped Pom maker has teeth you need to wrap around just right and bring the yarn up to the exact height before moving to the next. Disappointed and I would return it if it weren't just a few bucks.	-1
needles broke after one push! returned for refund!	-1
Doesn't work as well as I had hoped.  My pom pom came out looking more like a regular round pom pom than a heart shape.  I will admit, the first time I did do it wrong, however even after watching the instructional video on Clover's website, and trying again, it still doesn't really look much like a heart.	-1
New order, hoping it cuts we'll! Price was good & hoping the quality is as well. Have no other issues.	-1
Too complicated for me to use.  I can knit, and I can crochet.  I should have stuck to the real thing.  Because this is complicated to me.  I tried making something and it looked terrible, not a nice tight weave, and had difficulty following the directions.  Just not for me.	-1
I was pretty disappointed with this spindle.  The varnish was a little rough, the notch on the shaft would not hold my yarn - no matter how lightweight and the whorl was too heavy - I wish I had noticed the shipping weight (although the seller having noted the weight of the spindle in the description would have been more helpful).  As it is, I'll make do by inserting a cup hook on the 'wrong' end of the shaft and use it as a top whorl drop spindle.	-1
This case might be useful for something, but not circular needles, unless they are very small.  Made well and has a good closure but my circulars will not fit in easily.  Needs larger pockets. But, I will use for something.  Price was right	-1
It's stiff not soft.  Over priced	-1
It seemed fine but in less than a month the metal legs, which seem thin for their use, simply separated at the connection.  Not what I would want to order again.	-1
It is ok to hold needles, but still too small to hold my 15 size bamboo set. Both covers of the top and the bottom are not very easy to open, it doesnt fit well, so it is not very handy if try to reach to something in the bottom compartment... especially small items, when try to open it hard and the stuffs inside just fall out....	-1
Hmmm, seemed like a good idea, and it does protect my bamboo knitting needles. But it's just too tall to store laying down in with my other knitting stuff. The accessory case on the bottom of it seems like a good idea, but I can't imagine I would ever be able to remove it without everything shooting out of the case. It's just too hard to remove the lids to be of much convenience.	-1
Returned as the ends were flattened due to size markings, making them useless for insertion into knit edges. These wires must be a welding product not altered for blocking use.	-1
Was pleased with the variety of lengths and widths, however, the ends were rough and will take some sanding to smooth them down.	-1
Ok...so I know the measurements are on the website.  But still this things is too small.  I tried using it for eye shadows...too small.  Then I tried to use it for my sewing stuff...one drawer only holds about 4 sewing threads and maybe two smaller sized ones.  Not enough drawers for my sewing stuff.  Then I attempted to just put it in my craft room but thought the drawers would open and spill to easy with any type of beads or anything like that.  So now, last resort, I'm storing small spools of assorted ribbons in it.  I still have more spools that can fit in the four drawers though.  This might end up in the workshop for nails and screws or something.  Which means my hubbie gets it and I got no use out of it.  Oh well.  I could send it back but I figure I'll find something eventually for it.	-1
this was not at all what I expected.  It is a stiff dial that you have to turn manually...but be careful not to turn it too far past the number (sometimes it doesn't even stop on a number).  Not useful at all.  There are times I am knitting and look down to see it has moved to in between 2 numbers.  Horrible product :(	-1
Did not work, too cheap to do anything with it or even send it back.	-1
Do not like these, and ended up putting them in the trash. There is no opening in order to put it through the yarn to mark the spot. Maybe I was using them wrong. Won't buy these again.	-1
This bleeds through many types of paper and I need ink that doesn't bleed. I am not going to buy Color box "Chalk" ever again. :(	-1
The blades do not cut the threads.	-1
Don't get this	-1
It is a wonderful idea in theory and I imagine perfect for sewing machines but for yarn, no so much.  I had to keep hacking at the yarn which frayed the edge.  Binding off was harder, since I had a hard time putting the end in the darning needle. But for thread it is great.  Also great for removing those plastic things that hold on price tags	-1
The idea is good, but the production is too fragile.  The stem snapped off from the counter before I finished the first project.  I'm back to the old fashioned design.	-1
Cheaply mades .	-1
I was thrilled when I first got this - I could use it on any size circular needles. Working in the round, I could treat it just like a stitch marker, and knit right past it.  Unfortunately, it has a design flaw: the stem with the needle loop is attached to an inner cylinder which ought to rotate freely, but it doesn't. It does turn, but very reluctantly. The result is that after I had used it for a few small projects, I had twisted it so often to get the numbers turned upward so I could advance them, the stem began to break away from the counter. It's now just barely hanging on, and I expect the next time I use it, it will snap off.  Another problem is that it absolutely requires two hands to advance it: one to hold the cylinder, and one to twist the end rings. Very awkward.  I'm going to order the Clover green Mini Kacha-Kacha next, so I can hang the counter around my neck and advance it with one hand.	-1
The idea is good however after a few months the plastic ring splits. A metal or rig might be slightly more expensive to manufacture but it would last longer.	-1
Not really "universal"... the loop is jus oversized so it fits on any needle, but because of this, it just continuously falls off of the needle if the needle is smaller than the hole, unless you have something holding it to the needle, which is very annoying!  The counter is really cheap plastic too so the numbers aren't even clearly printed either.	-1
I recieved BLACK row markers and it is way too much trouble to return them. I am not happy as I already had black and although I could always use more, I was thrilled to have the GREEN as shown in the picture. That was why I purchchased them	-1
I love these pens, but I am very unhappy with my order from Amazon.  Do not be confused by the "BULK" in the description!  It is only one pen. I don't know why they have the word bulk in the listing.  Two weeks ago I ordered this directly from Amazon for $5.94.  Before I bought I contacted them to find out how many was in the "bulk".  They couldn't tell me.  So, I decided to find out, so i could post a review and let everyone else know.  I figured there would be at least two pens, considering that you can get it from many other websites for around $3.00.  This does not reflect on 123Stitch.  I've ordered from them before and love them.  The item came directly from Amazon drop-ship is no longer in the main items, it has moved to the other new for sale box in the right hand margin.  So, I wasn't able to leave a comment on the specific item listing that I ordered from.  At the time, the only listing for this pen on Amazon was for their drop-ship.  If 123stitch's listing had been available I would have gone with them, or to Ritz Camera's scrapbooking site.  I've gotten good service from Amazon many times before, but this instance has left me very disappointed.  So, now I have to pay to ship it back to them, then I will order from a site with a reasonable price.	-1
Great idea and the nib is excellent.  However, mine appeared to have dried out after using it one time.  I pulled both nibs out and they're juicy inside, but the ink doesn't seem to flow to the nib.  Although the instructions say to store the pen horizontally, I'll start storing it so the ink drains to the nib and see if this helps the flow.  When it seems dry, I gently press the side of the nib on my versamark ink pad before writing with it.  And I'll have no problem putting a drop of reinker on the nibs when they actually do dry out.	-1
i like this but the brush tip is weak. i have used it only once and the brush side is already frayed. i am not rough with this as i own other felt-tip brush markers so i'm not sure why this is so bad. i wish there was an embossing marker made by tombow.	-1
I ordered this pen and have tried many times to use it. I even dipped it it liquid versamark to see if that had any effect. It did not. I will try one more time to get another....I think mine was completely dried out in the package.:( ...	-1
tried to iron on and it didn't work.  got only the outline of a letter instead of the letters themselves.	-1
Difficult to remove the white letters from the white sheet, causing them to tear, and there were only 2 of each letter.	-1
No good they don't stick.	-1
Sent back.	-1
Received With cracked & broken case, but i could live with that. Purchased because i needed a second one. The blue handled original works great! This one is terrible! Crushes all of the eyelets. Not with it. Bad purchase on my part !	-1
It is very small, but that really is not a problem. The problem is trying to open it. There is nowhere to grip it. You have to turn the box away from you to get it to open, and then it opens roughly. If you had loose beads or findings in it, they would pop out all over the place.  Really, really difficult to open.	-1
I paid almost eight dollars I believe then I saw them at Michael's for $1. I would have returned them but unfortunately, in a rush, I cut the tags off. They are very thin material and flimsy.	-1
In the picture this ink pad looks normal size (meaning large enough to hold and ink a stamp).  In reality, this ink pad is literally the size of a postage stamp. Very hard to handle. Definitely not worth the price.	-1
I ordered this kit in Lime with 400 eyelets. It was out of stock so I waited. Once in stock, a three week wait, shipping took 4 days, not the 2 day prime shipping it was advertised with, & that I pay yearly for. What I got after all that wait for it to come back in stock was a pink one with 100 eyelets in a smaller case. I was still charged for the higher priced Lime in the case with more compartments & 400 eyelet.  I will be sending this back & buying the one I ordered but from another store. Really annoyed since I've waited patiently for over three weeks for this & really needed it, now my project is on hold again while I search elsewhere for the one I wanted.	-1
Pitch black is very green. I actually did better with the "slate" and "pumice stone" for gray and black tinting of resin.	-1
Pretty powder.  Too bad the lid was on crooked and it spilled all over inside the box. What a mess.	-1
The embossing powder is excellent. However, I was very unhappy upon receiving the jar; the headline size is misleading. The product description clearly states it's a 1-ounce jar. Upon receipt, I noticed it's the same size as the one I purchased locally, .74 ounces. The cost is $3 more than my local Hobby Lobby for the same size jar. If you're happy paying $3 more, buy this. If not, stick to Hobby Lobby or Michael's and get it cheaper.	-1
It doesn't melt as a solid holographic finish, as I'd hoped.  What you get is a clear coating over little round pieces of colored glitter.  Disappointing.	-1
I had a very hard time getting this color to stick long enough for embossing. There was also glitter stuck in more places than where I was trying to emboss.	-1
Got here quick enough and I like the embossing powder but when it did get here the container was busted and a lot of embossing powder on the outside of the container but it's wrapped up in the wrapping.	-1
There is no where that I can see that it says it is powder.  I was hoping for liquid.  I have tried mixing it several times and maybe it is user error but I'm not coming up with the best mix, it continues to be gritty.  They need to mark it as POWDER and clearly have that on here.  The price for this tiny amount of powder is nuts. I can get a pound of the powder for $18.14.  which is about 6 times LESS per ounce than this is.  So, now I will take my 50% off coupon to MIchaels and go get the better brand (Winsor & Newton Gum Arabic) of 2.5 ounce liquid  for about $2 more than this 1 ounce of powder and not have to waste a bunch of powder praying for the perfect mixture.	-1
are worthless for syicking stars on the ceiling	-1
when i was reading comments, i was thinking: I'm lucky, I will get what i gonna order... Instead i got on time 2 round and 1 heart punches at least the heart punch doesn't cut well... that is not so big money but i prefer to help someone then just throw away any money. I'd turn back this special item, but unfortunatelly to pay x4 times more than the cost... so if you need only disapointings so buy it... or think twice before do it.	-1
I SPECIFICALLY bought THIS item because the description stated, "1-inch pre-measured strips with CLEAR [emphasis added], perforated liner for easy placement".  That is not what I received; the liner is opaque and non-perforated making it impossible to place the strips where I want them.	-1
The dots don't come off the roll in dots. I've had to pull on them to get them off and it distorts the shape. They do not come off your finger easily either. Maybe it's because they are so thin? I've donated the box and will not be purchasing them again. I do not reccomend this product.	-1
Not fond of the colors. They look dim on paper. I was really disappointed	-1
Roll was loose and the adhesive is really bad.	-1
not a clean cut.	-1
What i received were not the small glue docs I expected but these long gummy hard to use sticky things.  I am sure there is a skill to learning how and what to use them on but I have not had the time yet to experiment	-1
Dont expect this to be super adhesive like the packet indicates.  The strength is only strong enough for paper, at most cardboard.	-1
Glue dots do not stick. Save your money. You're better off picking your nose and using that--that's how ineffective these little buggers are.	-1
bent easily and didn't last long.	-1
I am not sure if I am doing something wrong, but I followed the tips on Tsukineko's website as well as youtube and others, and could not get anything to stick.  I was looking forward to stamping images and covering them with ultra fine glitter, but no matter what I did the glitter just fell off.	-1
Well, I really wanted the 3 shapes as advertised but got three circles in different sizes.	-1
I was disappointed by this product.  The glue is not very adhesive and it dries out very quickly,in Houston!  I can't imagine how it would be in a more arid region.  I got it specifically to use with some beautiful metallic flakes but it hardly worked at all.  Very disappointed.  Tsukineko is usually such a great company and they make other adhesives that are fantastic.	-1
I found these glue dots not only very difficult to see but also very difficult to use.  They were hard to get off the paper in the shape of the glue dot originally because by the time you get it off the paper, the glue dot has become a little glue ball,  then to use it you have to flatten the glue ball out so it can glue something.	-1
This ink is horrible! I had gotten some metallic inks in the past and hadn't had issues. I don't know if something is wrong with the pad that I got but it is illegible and uneven. I've tried it with a few stamps (that do well with other inks) and it still has no definition and is very uneven.	-1
Ok	-1
These are quite cheap quality. One of them does not even align the punch mechanism enough to work. They are rickety, stiff and not sharp. They stick and get stuck. Compared to others I've used,these require way too much pressure for even a couple sheets. They are frustrating to use. I kept them because I use them seldom. If my hobbies ever require frequent use of hole punches, I will give these away and buy a quality set. I would never give these to my kids, if I could afford better ones. These are the kind of tools that fail to provide the kinesthetic pleasure that makes working with our hands far more rewarding than staring at a screen.	-1
I bought this product at a craft store, not on Amazon.  I was disappointed to find that the ink was rather dry and does not create clear images.  Also, each ink pad is not removable, so it is difficult to use the middle color.  I am disappointed because I have read good things about color box.  I don't know if I am doing something wrong or if this particular product is just a dud.	-1
They don't work properly. I don't know if it was only my pack, or if they are all deffective, but it's incredibly hard to ounch holes with these punches, even in normal sheets of paper, and the forms don't really come out nicely. I had to get a refund on this...	-1
very stiff and hard to use ,don't buy if you have any sort of hand problems	-1
Broke after 2/3 uses!!! Had to get refund	-1
OK	-1
Broke after a couple uses? oh well.. still 1 left .. I would not bother.	-1
Doesn't seem to take off all sticky stuff.	-1
Wasn't too impressed with it, but thats just me, when it comes to crafts everyone is different on what they like to use	-1
Would not buy it again.  Worthless to me...but it may be me.	-1
A lot more porous than I expected. I was looking for more of a magic eraser effect but this is a stiff rubbery sponge with large pores. It seems a little clunky and not really for delicate detail work. It feels like something from the paint aisle at Home Depot as opposed to a detailing tool for specialty scrapbook papers/stock. I would be careful with it. Seems like it would be easy to tear or damage something. Probably would be great for removing labels but it's a square blocky chunk that is not so easy to manipulate around the edge of a project.	-1
These ere very cheap. I bought a few packs for an event. Non of them lasted the whole 4 days. They kept breaking and unhinging. It was a nightmare.	-1
I had the hardest time getting the stuff to unroll. Then I couldn't find the adhesive part.  I think it's dried out.  Not sure.  Just a waste for me.	-1
I thought it was just MY galaxy maker that dried out really quickly and was going to order another one because I need something just like this...until I saw the previous review that said their markers either arrived dried out or dried out soon after.  Bummer	-1
Firstly, I had problems with the order in general. It specified 8 dollars plus shipping for *five* markers. I was sent *one* marker. The marker was even totally dried out upon arrival! I contacted Amazon, who told me to keep the marker, and the correct order would be shipped out. Again, I was sent *one* marker. This marker wasn't dried out, but still dried out quickly soon thereafter with minimal usage (so I'm highly recommending against purchasing this product). I again contacted Amazon about the quantity issue. They stated that the listing should have been for a single marker, and that they would correct the error on the page. I noticed a couple of weeks later the page was flagged as having an error in the listing, but not actually corrected. These markers generally go for less than two dollars each at most arts and crafts stores, so no way should one marker have been 8 dollars PLUS shipping. I was instructed to return the marker in the package it came in (a single marker came in a box the size of a shoe box!), but I had to take it to a UPS drop off location (they wouldn't even give me a return pick up, just a return drop off). It would have cost me more in car fare to take it to the nearest drop off location than I paid originally, so I just gave up on this product altogether. I can't complain about Amazon's willingness to resolve the issue (although the UPS drop off thing ticked me off a bit), but I really can't recommend this product at all.	-1
FAKE! RECEIVED SOME CRAPPY MADE IN CHINA ITEMS INSIDE THE PACKAGE! DO NOT BUY!	-1
Good price but low quality product. Have to pull open after every punch. Handles fall off. If you are not doing a lot, OK for the price.	-1
This is not red, it's pink!  I've never seen a pink ruby.  I want the product, but I trusted that ruby red meant ruby red. I'm now having to buy another for the project in which I need red, not hot pink!	-1
This was disappointing. The glue didn't come out very well and I had to keep poking a straight pin down the opening every time to make the glue come out.	-1
It's pretty, I like the color and the shimmer, but it is really difficult--and seems to be entirely a matter of chance--to actually make a pearl shape out of this "liquid pearl" stuff. Maybe there's a trick to it I don't know about (please, by all means, leave a comment and let me know if there is!), but mostly I get misshapen peaks and little blobs. The smaller I try to make them, the worse they are, and that doesn't mean the larger ones are necessarily good either. I'm not sure what I'll use it for now, but hopefully I can find some way to use it. Oh, and by the way, if you put it over dye ink, the color from the ink will seep into the pearl liquid, but it will be a distorted color. This can be a cool effect, if you are expecting it. I came upon it by accident, but found that over the cocoa CTMH ink, it kind of looks like mother of pearl. I may do something with that, but it doesn't work well to make your own pearl-like accents.	-1
This thing stinks! Doesn't work AT ALL! Waste of money and time.	-1
Sad to say, did not work at all for the person intended. She had better luck rolling up some of the Xyron glue bits and using that to get up the rest of the glue. This just smears the glue over the photos or paper. (I tried it myself with the same results) Glad it works for others, but I thought I should let others know it doesn't work for everyone.	-1
It arrived in a timely manor but I found it doesn't work up to expectations.	-1
I love Xyron products, use many of their adhesives in my scrapbooking and crafting projects.  But these just don't work well for me personally, although many people rave about them, so they are working for many.	-1
I must be the hulk because the handles bent on the first use, rendering the circle punch completely useless.  I tried to bend them back and go figure they bent the other way.  I used the heart one instead and no dice with that one either.  I was only punching 3 sheets of normal flimsy paper... and yes I am sure it hadn't gone through hence the pressure I applied.	-1
I will try it, then give different rating.	-1
Was not the right refill for my machine even though it stated would fit my machine	-1
More than 3-5 pages of paper and this tiny wretch binds up immediately. When you do cut, it leaves a clear machining mark where the corner begins, so it looks sloppy unless you go back with a knife and clean it up.  It's small, maybe 3-4" small. This isn't bad, until you factor in that it's plastic and uses pressure to cut.  Needless to say, my top pink bit broke when I tested 7 pieces of paper.	-1
The whole machine doesn't work very well.  The "stickem" tends to get stuck to the plastic and then the whole thing is lost.  I have to take it out and do it by hand.	-1
The one I got did not work right and had to just throw it away,  Threw the original macine away too, cheaper that trying to send it back, and I had to open it to see if it was the right thing, it was but there was something wrong with it.  So I chuncked it.	-1
I don't think this refill cartridge correctly works in my Xyron 500	-1
I still have a shoe box full of tiny rolled strips paper that has not been seal as I have no idea what product to use. I was also teaching my 8 year old granddaughter this craft.	-1
I had seen the item with the "don't lose your cap again" style bottle and I avoided it because I disliked how the band would get in the way and how it did not come with a clearing pin. Once my glue bottle arrived I was disappointed to see that I received the one I had purposely avoided. Picture is now listed as well. Very annoyed. Contacted seller and have not heard back yet. Will update this review if an when they correct their mistake.	-1
I don't like them. They look weird!	-1
The bamboo is very nice and smooth, but the cable is so stiff that I can't do anything with them! I even tried soaking the cable in hot water and straightening it out to loosen it up but it immediately coiled right back up. Useless for magic loop knitting	-1
I have never left a review before, however, sitting here working on my granddaughter's blanket I am so frustrated with these needles I felt it would be a great disservice to those of you out there considering this product, the cord is so stiff and unmanageable, it keeps twisting and there is no smooth transition from where the cord and the needle meet (the join) plus one of the tips of the needle is already starting to split.  I feel like I am constantly wrestling with my work and cannot even concentrate on my pattern.  GRRRRRR!!  I am so relieved I only purchased one and not the whole set.  I also purchased one of the addi lace circular needles, unfortunately not in the size I need for this project, however these needles are so awesome I  purchased the Addi click Interchangeable set, and as soon as they arrive I will transfer my work onto the one I need.  They are a little pricey but you get more than your moneys worth.  For me I probably would have paid doubled, they are that pleasant to work with.  It's a little like driving a volkswagen then going to a cadillac.  It comes with 3 interchangeable cords that you can actually connect all 3 together to make one huge piece if need be.  The best part though is the cord and the join, the join is so smooth you can't even feel your work slide from the cord onto the needle, plus the cord is not that stiff straw like material, it's loose and wiggly, like butter.  Like I said earlier, I don't write reviews, as you can probably tell by my ramblings, I just hope you will take heed in my advice and save yourself some heartburn and frustration.  Happy knitting!	-1
Every knitter is different. Some prefer bamboo needles and some metal. After receiving these needles and trying to knit rows of 235 stitches I found that they are horrible! You really have to work to get the stitches to the end of the needles. It's very hard on the hands and you can only knit a couple rows before you have to stop because your hands hurt too much. Bamboo may be alright for very slippery yarn in smaller guages so the stitches don't slip off. The Addi turbo needles are the way to go for me. They are worth every penny extra you spend. Anyone who suffers from carpal tunnel's should stay away from bamboo needles. I hope this review helps any new knitters out there.	-1
The cable is much too short. I didn't like these at all because the cable is so short that the needles get in the way of each other. Very poor design. Buyer beware! Everything from this brand is measured from tip to tip and the lengths stated are the length of the whole product, not the cables. This is a very difficult product to use due to the extremely short cable length. I bought these to make socks and found myself struggling to make anything at all with them. I am an experienced knitter. I'm now very happily knitting with a set of needles that come with adjustable cable length. Those are worth the money.	-1
I wish I liked them, but I just don't like knitting with bamboo needles. They are just too soft and sticky for me.  I prefer the polished woods ones, like Norville and Dreamz.	-1
needle is to short	-1
Disappointed with this.  The bamboo separates from the needles and there is no way you can get it back on.,  I would never buy this type again.	-1
They work, but my yarn sticks at the joint of each needle. I find it easier to knit on metal tips with smoother joints so that the yarn moves smoothly and easily.	-1
The needle were fine.  One suggestion would be that if the points were sharper.  It would help with certain patterns	-1
I was under the impression that each needle was 16" long and attached at the end. However the needles were actually 4-5" long, with a total length of 16". Wasnt able to knit anything with these.	-1
The needles were about 3"long  and were extremely difficult to hold. I would need a longer needle to use the magic loop method. I cannot imagine a use for these needles.	-1
Last week I needed size one knitting needles in a longer size (in this case, 24 inches) -- and quick. So I ordered these bamboo needles even though I dislike the feel of the yarn on them. They were the only ones I could find that day. After knitting 4 rows of ribbing on the bottom of a sweater, they snapped. In the middle of a row yet. Even if I do manage to get my money back for these, I'll never order another pair of bamboo needles again.	-1
I use circular needles almost exclusively, the cords on this brand of needles is so stiff that it is irritating to work with.	-1
It does its job but I think I may switch to a piece of foam instead. Remnants of the roving kinda stay on the bristles and transfer sometimes to the next project which is annoying when it's a different color. Also when trying to finish one side the bristles kind of grab the other side creating a bit of fuzz.	-1
This is has too small a work area.  Tried it once and put it up.	-1
I was not expecting a high quality as they were inexpensive, but a friend really likes these brushes - kind of a disposable brush. The other set I received came well made. This set was not well made already looked really worn - and they new. I hope they will simply replace them without any hassle. I really want to try them.	-1
The brushes although stylish handles the brissles in the brush were all too soft for acrylic painting.luckily they were cheap enough.who knows maybe sometime I'll need a softer brush.	-1
Disappointed the picture is deceiving was expecting to get the product as shown expecially for the price was shocked when it arrived that it was just a square box no containers included.  Was a gift so I had to  either give it and be embarrassed and explain or have no gift. Of course when she recieved it and saw what it cost it was an immediate I want to return it. As normal with amazon it was a easy process to return it	-1
I loved these clear boxes SO much that I bought more, and more. Then I realized I could buy the wooden doc to house them in and I was thrilled. However as others have mentioned, the clips that close the boxes don't stay on at all. I have 20 boxes and I've lot about 15 clips. Ok, you think, not the end of the world. Except it is the end of the world. Because in order for the clear boxes to adhere to the rails inside the wooden box, they NEED TO BE LOCKED WITH THE CLIPS. If you don't have the clips, you can't slot the boxes into the cubby. The whole thing is useless.  I have emailed the company twice and gotten no reply at all. I noticed another customer asked a question about the clips also, and for some reason there is no way of answering it. I cannot believe the stupidity of this company. All we need to do is buy more clips. But it seems we can't. Waste of hundreds of dollars and a pissed of customer.	-1
has to be put together, just the box is all that is included, no plastics.  I did not catch that in the details, my mistake.	-1
Very deceptive description. I read this and assumed that the pegs referred to the rails. Instead this comes in pieces, requires assembly and the instructions indicate that in addition to screwdrivers, there's a need for a power drill.  This was far from the snap together set-up I expected. Moreover, the pieces are made of particle board, very heavy and not my favorite, and though they had seemingly smooth enamel-like finish, on closer inspection it proved to be less than uniform and wasn't particularly attractive. On the other hand, it was $46.  Notwithstanding, I thought I was buying a cube for storage boxes, not a construction project.  Fortunately, Amazon has a very forgiving return policy. The boxes are great by the way, but the storage cube leaves much to be desired.	-1
This art bin works but its far from the best. Upon receiving the item I was instantly disappointed in the quality. The plastic is VERY thin. I bought a $2 bin at Target  (with no dividers) that felt more sturdy than this. The dividers that came with it are slightly different sizes and will only work in their appointed sections (which is inconvenient ). The plastic tabs that keep the bin closed are so thin they fall off sometimes and am afraid this thing will break one day. With that being said, the design is practical. It will fit a good amount of things..and the customization feature is nice . If you don't care about quality, this will work for you. However, I do not believe this bin should cost more than $5	-1
How can something so simple be such a pain??? There was a wooden dowel piece missing....fortunately I had a dowel very close to the same size which I had to "rig" so it would fit properly.  The little covers (for the holes to give it a finished look) were also missing. Because the "wood" is particle board it's pretty heavy. Don't think I will buy any more of these all things considered. I really do prefer real/solid wood!	-1
This is cheaply made, parts made not fit properly. Not worth the money and looks cheap. Assembly is cumbersome. Try a different system. Also pricey for such a mediocre product.	-1
There are 2 different sizes of dividers in this bin, but the large dividers do not fit properly.  When I inserted the divider into the slot, it fit securely on one side but there was about a 1/4" gap on the opposing side allowing the divider to actually pop out of the divider groove.  Returned for refund.  Would not purchase again.	-1
Nice concept, however the clips fell off within 2 minutes. The dividers are nice, the box is sturdy, but the clips to keep everything secure are useless. If turned upside down, everything gets mixed up, the lid is not tight enough to keep everything in their compartments. Be better off buying a Stanley storage box.	-1
I have many  Brittany sets and I was very surprised on the first time I was using one of the needles snapped and broke just below the middle section	-1
Nice looking needles but they have no "polish".  They stick and really slows down the knitting.	-1
Disappointing.  Poor quality, including rough finish at the end with the hook. Not useable at all.  I will have to try to sand it smooth. It's not worth the hassle to return it.  Guess I learned my lesson.  You do get what you pay for.  Should have sprung for a quality brand.	-1
Not impressed.	-1
It felt great in my hand, but it's difficult to actually hook the yarn. My work is dramatically slower using this hook.	-1
Very pretty, not well made. These hooks simply don't work. They miss yarn overs, split the yarn and the throat is so narrow only the smallest thread will fit! I have had to carve and sand them extensively with a dremel just to try to salvage this purchase.	-1
Beautiful hook. Was so excited to get it. Couldn't wait to use it, but as soon as I opened the package I noticed that the mouth and neck slope are not condusive for crocheting. The opening of the hook is so tight/small it won't accept the worsted weight yarn I have much less a bulkier weight yarn. And the edges are rough, snag the yarn. This hook is beautiful but absolutely NOT FUNCTIONAL. This is more suited for a decorative item. Very disappointed. Calling to see if I can return it and get my money back.	-1
I bought this hook because I was enamored with it's detail - the sleek wood, the carved handle, the length. In this regard, it did not disappoint - it is truly a beautiful hook at a reasonable price. Using it was another story. It felt good in the hand, however it is almost impossible to hook yarn onto. Even after several separate attempts, the hook passes right past the yarn without hooking it and takes a far more tedious hand to achieve said goal. Another qualm I have with the hook is that it tends to snag at the yarn, fraying it during the crochetting process. In the end, I went back to my aluminum hook and never looked back.	-1
Really did not like this hook.  Very difficult to work with. The way the tip was designed made it hard to catch the yarn. The yarn did not glide easily. Dragged.	-1
Very brittle/fragile and much longer than I'm used to!	-1
Gave as a gift t o a young friend, was broken before she ever got to use it. Not very sturdy. I'm disappointed, I had bought one also so I gave her mine which wasn't broken. Hope it holds up for her but I'm not impressed.	-1
It was a lovely hook with a innovative shape however it's very prone to splintering right at the top of the neck, which snags the yarn constantly. This started happening after a couple days of use and no matter how I try to sand it away, it continues to happen :(	-1
Not impressed.	-1

Difficult to use done they are so small and often not completely punched out. Will use other methods	-1
Too difficult to pop out.	-1

This bag is very shallow and flimsy, not good for projects or holding things in.  It does not stand on it's own like in the picture and none of it is reinforced. Possible good for kids whose supplies are smaller, like small packs of crayons and small scissors.  I only paid a couple dollars for it, but I feel I wasted my money.	-1
This was almost a joke, it is practically made of paper. I bought mine thru Jo-ann fabrics for Clearance for under $3. and I still don't think it was worth the money.  It is so tiny ( I would say it would be fine for a child )something I would expect to see in the local dollar store.  The picture is so deceiving, it looks like tough burlap material and it is more like a heavy brown paper bag with a plastic coating on the inside.	-1
I didn't have good luck with this product.  I wanted to add gold and silver leaf to some complex cloth.  I may have been the problem, but this just seems more work than it should be.	-1
useless	-1
Not good at all. Very frustrating as the tape came apart from the tape runner and I had to throw it away. I had the same problem with the refills I purchased. I would not buy this again, ever.	-1
It's just ok. It's really inconsistent to work with. I'd have some that was perfectly pliable and easy to smooth, and some that would not mold or smooth out no matter what I did, and some that just fell apart. I like how light it is when dry and it seems to take pigment and paint okay, but overall the inconsistency is just disappointing.	-1
I was excited to get started on my projects today when this came in, but found I was terribly disappointed. It came in a massive box, -- completely unnecessary for the small size of the punch (could have saved a lot on shipping). The punch itself is small and light-weight, but the edges of the punched material are not clean. The metal that forms the circle is not well made and is fairly dull. Punching just regular paper the edges are a bit fuzzy. Card stock didn't punch well either, and it hardly made a mark in cardboard.	-1
Bought this for something that I was making. I needed to make precise circle. I liked that you can see exactly what you are cutting (what will be inside the circle). After a few times using it, though, I've noticed that sometimes it has trouble punching out a full circle. It doesn't fully cut one end and I have to struggle to get the paper out. Then I'm left with a snag on the circle that I have to cut off by hand.  Edit 12/12/13: I ended up buying a different hole punch. The snagging was too annoying for me and wasn't saving me any time.	-1
Too wide for my hand.	-1
After ruining several cutters trying to work with memory wire, I finally found this. It really cuts like I hoped it would. After writing the review, the cutter has not worked, only bends the wire instead of cutting.  I bought a piano wire cutter which works better.	-1
Maybe this is meant to be used immediately after adhesive is applied to the wrong area but I've not found it to be particularly effective.  I use it to remove chalk instead.	-1
The stencil IS the size mentioned but the picture is a lot smaller on it than I expected. I may still be able to use it but not for what I'd planned. Appears well made.	-1
Every one in the pack were knicked and dull. Will not buy again. Very disappointed. If I would give it 0 stars I would.	-1
Based on 20 years of using new blades from the store, I swear these blades are old blades that have been re-sharpened. They don't cut as crisp as new blades in the package from the store and they wear out MUCH more quickly. These are perfect for paper cutting or if you know you're going to be cutting just a little bit of fabric. But I had 60 yards of cotton to cut for charity quilts and it aggravated me, having to change the blades more often than before.	-1
