Got refund.	1
This was my last purchase of this brand. 2014 to pricey.	-1
I've used Turbotax since it first came out and find it an excellent buy. Most people using an accountant would save a bunch of money using it. It has an easy step process that walks you through the entire process and your state tax is automatically prepared as you prepare your federal tax. A friend tried it recreating his tax that had been prepared by his accountant and found Turbotax lowered his tax.	1
I do our taxes every year and it is a tedious job. If it wasn't for TurboTax I probably would have it done. This year's version is pretty much the same as past years and I am glad because I have used the software for as long as I can remember and I like following the same walk through routine that TurboTax makes you follow.  Using TurboTax is fast and easy and I like several features that I use every year:  * The ability to import last year's data automatically into this year's preparation. * The ability to E-file your taxes with the federal government which speeds up your refund, if you are getting one. * The itemized deductions for gifts to charity is very helpful as we donate quite a bit every year and it makes it easier to compile a list, keep it for your records and come up with a reasonable value to claim on your taxes. * I actually pre-calculate my next year's taxes and print out the forms to mail in quarterly payments for the next year's taxes to avoid a penalty. * The ability to keep a PDF copy of your tax return forms for your records as well as print out the forms it you need them. * I always save my tax computer files and I buy the disk version of TurboTax in case I have to reinstall the software and make an update or file an amended tax return later on.  The nice thing is that you can update the program and make sure that you have all of the latest updates to the tax laws and forms.  Having TurboTax walks me through the forms and helps me fill them out faster and easier than reading all of those tax pages written for lawyers.  I just use the combined federal and state version of TurboTax and file electronically.  This version includes the ability to file up to 5 Federal tax reports electronically. You can download the state version of TurboTax for one state for free.  If you want to file your state return electronically then you have to pay for the privilege.  I like the fact that I can quickly do my state taxes after finishing the federal forms.  I also always estimate my next year's taxes and print out the prepayment forms that I customize to fit what additional income I am expecting.  These are just a few of the main features that I like with TurboTax and I recommend the software to you as an easy tool to use. I do wait to find a good price on it as the price keeps going up and up every year.	1
Always good, easy, and accurate.	1

If you need to "do your taxes", this is what works. I didn't need to contact "support" because the software is designed to work and was very easy to complete my filing. I have Windows 7 (64-bit) and Turbo Tax installed and worked just fine.	1
I have been using Intuit's Turbo Tax Deluxe to do my taxes for many years. I like the way it defines what you need to enter, provides explanations on each and every item and provides recommendations based on the data you enter. I remember when I used to do my taxes using the 1040 form with explanations and I always dreaded doing that task, I still dread doing the taxes, but using Turbo Tax Deluxe, that anxiety is quickly alleviated.	1
"Git 'er done"!  Buy TurboTax and do it yourself.  As always, TurboTax prompts you for everything.  Been using it for so long that I can't remember ever NOT using it.	1
Filed without issue.	1
The best tax software	1
I have been using Turbo Tax for the past 5 or 6 years and especially like the way it walks you through each step.  The program is very user friendly!  I would definitely recommend Turbo Tax to a friend!	1
[This part of the review written in early Dec 2013]  So far so good.  I just downloaded Premier this past weekend, installed on my Win7x64 machine with no problems.  I imported last year's data, and then ran through an estimated calculation for Fed & State, saw only one problem (see below).  My situation is a bit unusual: no W2, but Sch C, Sch K, college costs, and investment income.  Not much change from last year in the program's look and feel and flow, but obviously quite a few changes in tax law.  I've been using TT for many years now (have also used competitors in the past), but I was mildly surprised by how quickly I was able to do everything.  The one flaw: when entering college costs in the "interview", the field for "Room and Board" didn't show up in the "Other School-Related Expenses".  I went directly to the form (which needed some finding, it's called Student Info Worksheet), entered the value directly, and after that the field popped up on the interview.  Overall, I'm happy with the product, but of course I'll be even happier when I'm finally done using it in April!  [Update Jan 31, 2014]  So far I've downloaded several updates, and the program has continued to work without any hitches.  I've been able to download 1099 data successfully from my financial firm, and the process of correcting the basis for "uncovered transactions" was simple (but you have to understand the basics here, of course).  On the downside, I'm finding that the guidance for business income & expenses is very poort, especially when you go to the state Sch C.  Based on the descriptions, I'm not convinced that Home & Business will be better in this area, but I'm going to take a look at that.	1
package arrived quickly and was perfectly packaged to arrive in excellent condition. I got this upgrade with my quicken Premier and was able to take advantage of some additional savings. I have been a turbo tax user for many years and the package is great and easy to use.	1
This Is a very good product, that is really easy to use. File on line, and done. Have used several years, and will continue to use.	1

Good product I use it every year and have done so since the 1990s	1
I have been using Turbotax for many years.  However, that will end with tax year 2014.  I just discovered that Turbotax Deluxe no longer supports Schedules C, D and E!  Intuit wants us to move up to their more expensive products.  Screw that.  Time to check out the H&R Block.	1
No issues with TurboTax in general.  The T-Men haven't come knocking on my door, so I look at it as a win-win.	1
Ok, I have been buying TurboTax since 1992.  I have NEVER used anything else.  I only buy on Amazon.  I actually got in on a sale day this year and got $10 off.  OK, that is good, but listen to this.  I have filed four returns on this TurboTax.  All have gotten refunds.  That means that I paid $30 for the TurboTax, and different family members, including me, have gotten back $80 added to an Amazon gift card.  Listen.......I spent $30.....and I got paid $80.  I don't think you can match that ANYWHERE.  If you don't buy it, too bad. I will be here at the end of the year.	1
The only way to do your taxes, I've used it for years.	1
Easy to follow and use. My taxes are simple since I don't have children, my own home or are in school. They walk you step by step through the process and its easy to follow so even if you have kids or a home it shouldn't be a problem.	1
As a longtime TurboTax user, I find this program continues to fit my needs.	1
Too costly,especially for filing and State add-ons, I am looking for an alternative.	-1
Been using this for years.  Several newer products out there but this works so I'm sticking to it.  No reason to try something else.	1
Easy to use and accurate, love the electronic filing.	1
As advertised.	1
Gets the job done. No complaints. Cheaper than bringing your taxes to someone else to do. This program is really straight forward.	1
Good product at a reasonable price.	1
I've been using TurboTax for many, many years and have never had a problem.  It is easy to use, with clear instructions.  Don't do taxes without it.  Depending on my situation, I have used several versions.  The basic or what they call the deluxe will do for most anyone who has fairly straight-forward tax situations.  They will still handle simple stock trades and capital gains situations, as well as simple business situations.  It just requires you to be more involved and knowledgeable instead of asking you all their questions and then doing the work for you.  In years where I have traded a lot of investments or stocks, and my business situation remains simple, I have upgraded to their Premier product.  It walks you through all the purchases and sales, to make sure you are not getting hosed on the taxes.  This year, my business got more complicated so I upgraded to the Home and Business product to handle it.  If you look at the TurboTax comparison sheet, you will see this is the normal transition decision.  Deluxe gives more detail and support about typical personal tax situations.  Premier has everything Deluxe has, but it adds detailed support for investments.  Home and Business has everything Premier does, but adds specific support for small business situations on Schedule C.  If you are totally confused by taxes and the whole process, but you have fairly straight-forward needs, you can turn to H&R Block or a similar company.  If you have investments, complex business situations, or major life events (deaths, inheritance) I would suggest using an accountant.  On the other hand, if you have a reasonable understanding of the tax process, business rules, and such, TurboTax can get the job done as well as an accountant at a much lower price.  I used an accountant for many years and a couple of years before I decided to drop him, I used TurboTax and compared the results.  They came out EXACTLY the same, so I dropped the accountant about 15 years ago.	1
Easy to install and upgrade.  Performed as expected.  No problems.	1
I have used TurboTax every year for what seems like forever, at least 15 years.  Not that I love it but it works and can carry over and import what I need.  Would be happy if they didn't play with the user interface each year but guess they have to keep the software engineers busy.  They have their bugs and you have to check the form level of the taxes to ensure no mistakes.	1
I wouldn't use anything else. Easy to use, free e file for multiple returns, accurate. As long as the tax system remains the complicated mess it is, I will continue to use Turbo Tax.	1
I have used TurboTax Deluxe for several years, but this is the first time I've had to buy this version. That was necessitated by Intuit's (the manufacturer) decision not to allow preparation of Schedule E (royalty & rental income) forms with the Deluxe version, like I could in the past. That coupled with the incessant push to make you file electronically through TurboTax (for an additional fee), made this version of TurboTax MUCH less pleasant or easy to use. Accessing and printing selected completed forms is much more difficult as well.  However, the primary problem I have with this version involves my preparation of tax returns for other family members. This is something I've done for years, as I have the time and have already purchased the TurboTax software.  After I completed our state and federal taxes this year, I started to prepare state and federal returns for a family member. I did not complete them in that same day and saved what I'd completed. When I got back to them the next day, I logged into my TurboTax on the desktop,and was informed that an update was available. After I downloaded the update, I tried to open the family member's tax return, but found it no longer existed. The only tax file that TurboTax had retained was mine.  The relative's returns were fairly straight forward, and I completed and printed them that day. I left the work I'd done saved on my computer, with backup copies. The next day, I logged into my TurboTax on the desktop,and again, was informed that an update was available. After I downloaded the "update", I again tried to open the family member's tax returns in TurboTax, but found it no longer existed.  I'm not saying that TurboTax Premier Fed, Efile and State 2013 with Refund Bonus Offer removed the family member's tax returns, but I've never encountered this problem before....	-1
I have been using Turbo Tax for years. It is so simple and easy to use, my kid can do it. Easy to follow forms with step by step instruction. Plus helpful side notes.	1

I bought the "TurboTax Deluxe Fed and Efile 2013 with Refund Bonus Offer" (CD version - PC/MAC) here at Amazon. - Arrived in 2 days, today!  Installed (on WinXP, SP3) and worked flawlessly.  Got all the way down to filing the return (tonite!) ...and even up to: "How do You Want Your Federal Refund" but WAS Very dismayed to Not see the option for the Amazon Gift Card purchase!  :-(  What I learned from intuit help forum:  Problem Scenario (just like mine): "I am currently on the File -> How would you like to get your federal refund? page and I do not see an option to receive part of the refund on Amazon Gift Cards. The only options that I see are Direct Deposit, Paper Check and Split into Multiple Accounts."  Resolution: "it is past that section. Enter that you want the refund to be deposited to your account, and enter bank info. The page will come up after that."  I did that, and sure enough, it worked! I see option: "I'll use all or some of my refund to purchase an e-gift card and get an extra 10%" And the Amazon logo is there, etc.  Cool!  :-)  Hope this helps somebody else to bypass a bad moment I had there.  Also note that, to get the Amazon Gift Card, you have to e-file and Not split your refund over multiple accounts (just one bank account). Some other restrictions are there, but don't apply to an average guy like me.  For about 10 years now, I have enjoyed the perfection of the Turbo Tax software.  Only one year did I have an install issue, and that was quickly resolved by Customer Support.  And as a bonus - the tip I got from the support rep has been used to resolve other software installs and shared with others over the years.  (Thanks *again* to "Rey" from Turbo Tax customer support!)  Love the way I can import last year's tax data and don't re-type squat!  This is HUGE to me!  W-2s are tedious!  -> Please note, I always go with the CD/ROM version exclusively.  (I note that the download version reviews aren't so hot this year)  You just can't beat the completeness, rapidity and perfection of the Turbo Tax experience as delivered on the CR/ROM version.  I was able to do the Schedule D (stocks) even tho the higher versions are recommended.  Again, in contrast .... the download Deluxe version does NOT do the Schedule D whatsoever (must go to Premiere or higher) -- so this is another reason to go with the CD/ROM.  On the CD/ROM Deluxe version you can enter your stock sales, and functionality is not broken whatsoever!  Also applies to CD/ROM Basic version too -- I used Basic for Sched D last year and prior years.  Went with Deluxe this year for the 10% gift card bonus -- In contrast, Basic CD/ROM version  is only 5% bonus on the gift card.  So the Deluxe version will be money well-spent, cuz  I'm gonna put a LOT on the Amazon Gift Card, whoa yea!  Also note that State Filing is Not included in this product (and I don't need it).  I will be back to give updates.  IE: the day my Amazon Gift Card arrives.  I'm sure many of you are eager to know if it is legit.  So far, so good.  UPDATE 2014.02.15 - You cannot apply ALL of your refund to the Amazon Gift card as advertised.  I've contacted Amazon already about the discrepancy. You can apply all of your refund except $200, per the intuit website ( https://ttlc(dot)intuit(dot)com/questions/1981054-amazon-e-gift-card-maximum  ).  Hence:  Max Gift Card = Your refund - $200  Minus one star until the description detail matches the product.  Product Detail change request submitted.  UPDATE 2014.02.25 -- The Gift Card deal is legit!  Email came and I redeemed today -- IRS refund + 10% as advertised. -  Still a tiny bit disappointed that the "some (or all)" in product details is not corrected yet (discussed in my previous update of 2014.02.15) This issue did not impact me, as I put some in the GC, some in the bank.  But somebody will.	1
Awesome, thank you very much!	1
The Step by Step Data Entry gives no warning that you will double entry any Sale of a PTP if you enter the Sale in the 1099-B Brokerage down load of sales and in the Sales area of the K-1 for the PTP; like it seem to be requesting by the way the questions are phrased. But if you switch to the Forms mode while entering the Sale data in the K-1 area; you will find TurboTax Instructions in BOLD LETTERS instructing you to enter ZERO for both the Sale and Basis on the K-1 entry form if the Sale was reported to the IRS by the Broker on a 1099-B. Please put that warning in the STEP BY Step instructions.  You also have to do some other steps as a work-around that can be found in the Community Forum (and even discuss by TT Employees) to make the return perfect  TT Business still needs to be able to import transactions from a Broker for investment sales.  Almost every Trust has investments so why isn't this a feature in this product.  Overall less buggy than last year.  I use both TT Premier for personal taxes and TT Business Form (1041)from two Trusts	1
Worked well.	1
It is tax software.	1
Hard to find special forms. Awkward to use.	-1
Well over priced since Turbo Tax has reduced the services provided in each of their packages.  Have used it since it was put on the market but changing to something else like H&R Block where you get what you pay.  In it's day it was a good program but they made several changes and did not let customers know.	-1
great tax program with no problems installing or using the software	1
Happy Happy Joy Joy! It was just as it was advertised, so it gets four stars, what else is there to say! They would get five stars if they went above and beyond what was advertised and expected.  Imagine if your grocery store was like Amazon, and you had to rate every product you purchased! How annoying would that be?	1
Awesome. A money and time saver.	1
Good product.  Have used it for several years.	1
I have been using Turbotax Deluxe to do my taxes every year since 1997 and really don't know how I could do it without them. It is fast, easy and very complete and it seems that they almost guarantee a refund every year. Hope they never let up!!!	1
This is the 4 year I have prepared my own taxes and Turbo tax makes it all possible.  Over the past 4 years, I have save hundreds of dollars in accountant fees! Bravo for making this program user friendly!	1
Best to use year after year. Brings forward year after year info for prior years. Gives good hints about what may be missing/needed.	1
I use Turbo Tax every year to do my taxes. The Tax chore is completed easily and quickly with a guarantee of no errors.	1
DO YOU NEED TO FILE STATE TAX? Make sure you get a state version if you do, or federal only if you don't.  This review is for TuboTax 2013 Deluxe for Federal Returns. Fortunately I live in Texas and there is no state income tax so I don't have to worry about the state portion.  TurboTax has had its share of issues but I came back to it because it does seem to be the best there is, but I'm knocking off a star because of the history of issues I've had with the program in previous years (like it not calculating tax correctly until I deleted some assets and then re-entered them). However, I was a little shocked to read that it requires 515MB of HD space PLUS up to 1.5GB more if Microsoft .NET 4 if not installed (Mac is only 360MB). Wow! That could be over 2GB of HD to do taxes. How inefficient we have become, bat at least HD space is cheap nowadays.  The system requirements specifically mention Windows XP, Vista, and Windows 7/8 but not Windows 8.1. When I installed it on my Windows 8.1 64-bit machine, installation (mid Jan 2014) seemed to go well without any problems. When it checked for updates, it found 4 updates and they all seemed to install properly... so no major install issues for me (unlike a few years ago).  NOTE: Deluxe will do a Schedule C just fine, but it may not provide as much help as the Home & Business version. If you have been doing taxes yourself for awhile then you might not need to pay the extra money for the additional help.  I will update this review as I continue to use the product.  Pros: * Price includes federal E-File * Overall, probably the best tax program there is * Does not say it works on Windows XP 64-bit (but does with 32-bit XP with SP 3+) (anyone even use XP 64-bit anyway?) * Works on 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Vista and Windows 7/8/8.1 * Deluxe version can do a Schedule C for the self-employed - but it doesn't provide as much guidance as the Home & Business edition * Claims that your return will be accurate, guaranteed* (with some fine print)  Cons: * Not perfect (but how can US taxes ever be perfect)? * Have encountered bugs in previous years that caused me to have to delete and re-enter assets * Might take over 2GB of HD space on Windows according to the system requirements * I'm not happy with the reports I've read indicating saying that Intuit lobbies Congress to keep taxes overly complicated, presumably so they can make more money from sales of their tax software.  WARNING ABOUT THE ONLINE VERSION (DOES NOT APPLY TO DESKTOP VERSION):  * Intuit has removed the ability to do Schedule D and E in TurboTax Online Deluxe (you need Premier) * Intuit has removed the ability to do Schedule C and F in TurboTax Online Deluxe (you need Home & Business)	1
This may be a good product, but buyer beware----IT DOES NOT CONTAIN A STATE RETURN---which is important for the vast majority of buyers. I obviously am disappointed in the product I received as well as disappointed in Amazon for not clearly stating that the State software is not included.	-1
I always recommend this product to my friends and relatives if they are doing their income tax personally without any help from Tax Attorneys.  Good recommendation.	1
Very easy to use!	1
MANDATORY ITEM.	1
I have used both HRBlock and TurboTax products.  While both may have their issues, which seem to change from year to year, using TT consistently makes the year-to-year data transfer and comparison easier than switching back and forth. Some special features may not be transparent enough for the user who wants to know exactly what is happening (e.g., dealing with self-employment tax and clergy housing allowance), but my returns seem to be in order!	1
I've been using TurboTax for many years and this year's is the easiest yet. The flow is pretty much the same as it has been for a while, with your choice of a series of questions or just going to the parts you know you need. One thing I have noticed over the past few years is that the option to import from Quicken seems to be downplayed - unlike in some earlier years, I was never asked about importing though I later found where I could do that. It did keep asking me about downloading data from financial institutions, but I liked that after three times saying "no", it gives me the option to say "don't ask again".  E-filing is a snap, though when I filed for my mother-in-law, who died last year, the program was indecisive as to whether or not I could E-File. (I couldn't, as it told me in one area.) The printed forms are great, though it tends to print an awful lot of stuff I find unnecessary (such as estimated tax forms even when I say I'm not doing that.)  The tax code is so complex I can't imagine doing a return without TurboTax. It has never made a mistake for me over 20 years.	1
I do the taxes for several members of my family.  I would never use any software other than Turbotax.  Here's why:  1.  It picks up all of your data from prior years returns, saving time and effort. 2.  It walks you through EVERY SINGLE thing (if you want) which every year seems to find me deductions or angle that I would never know on my own 3.  It makes it very easy to e-file 4.  It's great for keeping back-up PDFs of old tax returns- much better than having paper all over the place 5.  It keeps you up on the latest tax information, as new updates download automatically 6.  It easily handles tax returns for 1099 only "consultants" and if you own rentals  What's better this year is downloading the State is easy and doesn't require a credit card like it did in the past, which was a nuisance.  The ONLY way to do your taxes by yourself	1
but I haven't used this one yet.  Will be filing married, joint for the first time so I will look for lots of help.  Hope they're up to it.	1
I've used TurboTax for many, many years.  This price was the best I have seen this year.  The DVD arrived quickly and installed perfectly. It downloaded the updates and automatically filled in data from my 2012 filing, which means I have much less to add for this year.	1
Let me first start off by saying that I have been using this product for about 20 years now.  I started with their most involved set when I owned my own business and had stock investments and have been gradually working my way down as I have worked my way into retirement.  I now have a fairly simple tax return and so the Deluxe version works well for me now.  Since I live in a state with no income tax, this version which is a Federal return version only works great for me.  Here is what I liked:    1.  Loads quickly on a Windows 8 Pro machine.    2.  Found my prior years filings without issue and so preloaded in the appropriate information for me.    3.  Offers e-mail updates for when Federal forms will be available (due to various issues this year, the Federal forms are not yet complete.  This is not a Turbo Tax issue, it is a Federal Government issue.)    4.  Software is included to help you evaluate the appropriate values for donated goods.    5.  Allows you to either enter information on your own or to have guidance from TurboTax.  What I did not like so much:    1.  The constant pitch to upgrade the product to the next higher level.    2.  The lack of a program to provide discounted software to people who use their software year after year.  Why do I have to go to Amazon or Costco to obtain the software at a discount instead of being able to purchase it direct from the company at a discount?  I have been doing my own taxes for over 40 years and I trust TurboTax to do my taxes correctly and to provide me with all of the legal deductions that I am entitled to.  This is a solid product and is perfect for anyone, no matter what your experience is with filing your own taxes.  I highly recommend it for anyone wanting to do their own taxes.  Since I have never tried the version for a MAC, I cannot comment on that, but for current versions of Windows, this is a great product.	1
Our government is pretty intimidating and especially with the personal income tax system. Rather than hours of trying to figure out government instructions with their tax forms, I use TurboTax, and their e-filing for both FED and State, and their audit insurance program. I once worked my way through an IRS audit just after I liquidated a small business at a great loss. The IRS agent came to my home and offered her my PC which had Quicken and QuickBooks and she worked on it for a few days. Then I moved to California and continued with the IRS through ten rounds of mail and response. The IRS found my books clear and well-supported, but the time spent was considerable, and the tummy acid on my side even more so. So I pay for Turbotax plus add-ons. What we really need  is a serious tax reform where filing is on one sheet of paper.	1
I've been using TuboTax since the 1990s first as an individual and then as a business.  The carryovers and business related allowances and deductions make this a breeze to use.  I cannot imagine ever filing a tax return without it.	1
I've used TurboTax for over 20 years, have never been audited and wouldn't use any other tax software.  If you're wondering what to do, just buy it and you won't be sorry.  It's accurate and simple to use.	1
Turbo Tax 2013 worked really great this year, no problems whatsoever.  Easy to get around from forms to being guided through it.	1
The thing that I dread most every year is filing my tax return. I usually wait until the last minute, as the chore is definitely something that I don't look forward to doing.  Since I buy and sell stocks on a regular basis, I wanted a tax program that would be able to import the information from my online brokerage firm. Never in my wildest imagination, did I expect to find a software program that made the process so easy. When I filed my return for 2012, I spent the better part of a day manually inputting this information to my IRS 1040 form. This year was totally different. With the click of a button and signing into my online brokerage account, it literally took just a few seconds to import not only my stock purchases and sales, but also to import interest and dividends. Since I only want to spend 1 day a year doing my taxes, I actually spent more time manually writing my estimated tax checks and envelopes than I did using this software to file both my federal and state returns.  The bottom line is that this product is the best one that I've ever used for filing taxes. It makes it so easy and totally eliminates the frustration that usually comes with this task.	1
TurboTax is useful and reliable.  If one is going to do their own taxes, TurboTax does the job as well as any.  Very helpful the way it keeps the data so, as appropriate, it will fill out lots of blanks year after year.  Try to plan ahead so you can get other needed software at the same time as you get TurboTax.  Pricing is better that way.	1
I have been a TurboTax user since 1994 never had a serious problem and I have always trusted the software.	1
That's right buffalo bob, its tax time.  for those of you that remember Howdy Doody, you know that taxes can be a three ring circus.  Turbo tax helps to do a quick and speedy filing.  don't be like Clarabell the clown and mess it up.  after all, the IRS doesn't seem to have a sense of humor. (insert government/puppet joke of your choosing)  happy filing!	1
Been using "Turbo Tax Home and Business Fed, Efile and State" for a long while without encountering any problem. Downloads easily, and, the program takes you through personal & business related taxes thoroughly and accurately.  This years program (2013) is as intuitive as prior years and I've never experienced any difficulties. I've the PC version and it works perfectly on my 4 year old HP desktop.	1
worked great	1
We found this answered all of the questions we had last year about certain deductions. Much more straightforward and quite an improvement since last year's taxes with this same software. We have used TurboTax for years and found it's accurate and so much cheaper than an accountant.	1
I have used this version of TurboTax for at least 6 or 7 years,  It works great and is incredibly easy and intuitive.  I love it!	1
While TurboTax does indeed have the best interface, it can be glitchy and frustrating.  It has never been good about importing, and this year was no different. I use two big investment firms, and TurboTax could not successfully import either one. Since that's one of the reasons I purchase this particular software, I cannot recommend this product.  If you have a simple return, this software will work well--but you'll pay a lot. Anything slightly complicated seems to throw Intuit.	-1
First, if you have filed online at turbotax.com in previous years, then DON'T even think about purchasing this product since you can not transfer information between online and desktop (PC) platforms. Secondly, the Amazon gift certificate program was a complete scam. My federal refund was over $300, so you would think that I could get $300 in gift certificates, right? Wrong! It said "the maximum amount of your federal refund that you can apply to Amazon gift cards is $100. So a benefit of only $10, which doesn't come close to offsetting the money that I spent on this piece of crap software which isn't any better than the online version anyways. To make matters worse, if you file from the PC desktop version of Turbotax, the fee for filing a state return is $24.99, whereas it is only $17.99 for the same service from within the online Turbotax.com platform. Never, ever again will I purchase Turbotax software on a disk. Stick to the online version and don't be tempted by these Amazon gift card perks...	-1
I have used Turbo Tax for the last four years and have had no problems. I do not like the fact that they charge an extra $19.99 to E-file your state tax form, they should be more up front and include it in the price. This year they offered 10% more on your tax return if you bought Amazon gift cards. I did this and it worked out great! It was like getting Turbo tax and all sales taxes on all my purchases from Amazon for free!	1
Use it every year and amazon had the best price for the Turbo Tax and Quicken.  Our taxes are very straight forward and this software works great for us.  We also use Quicken to track investment so I get the combo pack for the combo price!  Highly recommend for the DIY'r, especially someone just beginning to do their own taxes and tracking their investments!  A good learning tool!	1
I have used TurboTax for years and years and it has served me well. I am self-employed and this Home and Business version is excellent for that. I am on a Macintosh computer, but several of my friends also use the Home & Business as well.	1
Turbo tax always meets my expectations. Especially Easy to import information fro a previous version. Would be nice if the price was more return customer friendly.	1
This TurboTax Deluxe edition for Tax Year 2013 offers the Federal and one state tax return, along with free Federal e-file. For a small fee, it will also e-file the state return. TurboTax seems to get a little easier to use each year, although there is definitely a learning curve with the program. You can upload or download the basics and updates; the questions are designed to walk you through your taxes in hours instead of days. Provided your taxes aren't especially complicated, this might be the way to get them done. Recommended.	1
Great product I have been using it for years, started when it was Parson's Tax Edge an watched it migrate and improve to the product it is today. On the down side I feel it is quite expensive.	1
Easy to use, reliable and accurate most of the time. Have been using it over 15 years and never had any major problems. A few minor glitches here and there with updates, but overall very good software.	1
Why pay a tax pro to do your taxes when TurboTax allows you to do it yourself.  My Home and Business tax prep and filing couldn't be any easier.	1
I've used TT since it was sold by the developers working from a nearby garage. Easy to use and enough source identification that issues can be resolved. The import prior year data feature makes tax prep much easier.	1
We have used TurboTax for the past twenty or so years and been extremely pleased with the ease of filing and the successful results. Each year the program seems to be better and easier to use. We highly recommend this software for a less stressful tax season and filing.	1
As always, works quite well.  Do not recommend the download, since there are many problems yet to be solved.  Always get the CD!	1
I have been a believer in Turbo tax as my primary way of filing for a few years now and this version is similar to the previous years software.  Even though I am a fan of TT, I do have a few gripes about the software.  One of my main gripes is that I think that there are too many versions of this software.  I really wish they would sell one turbo tax that allows you within the software to use the version you need and then charge you accordingly instead of having to figure out which version to purchase and get.  In my case, I have mutual funds, so do I get deluxe or premier?  I don't really handle the sales of the investments within the funds but I do know the fund management company does move things around from time to time.  So what do you do? I have used deluxe in the past with no issues but elected to go with premier because of its advertised extra help on investments.  How much this extra help is and whether it is worth it to go from deluxe to premier remains to be seen and I will update once I file.  I just personally think these multiple versions are confusing the for the average consumer who isn't familiar with the type of product that they would need for their tax filing.  The TT website helps some with this but still I still leaves too much confusion for some.  TurboTax has also increased the price a bit of this software (which can be pricey depending on the version you need) that is essentially the same (with some changes for the new tax year which occurs every year) as the previous years version.  I am just not sure what changes justify this increase.  In addition to the upfront cost of the software purchase, is one of my complaints that I have year after year is the additional cost that TT charges you for e-filing with the state.  This little detail is usually hidden away in the fine print and can cost you up to 36 bucks to e-file for each state.  Really??  It costs that much extra to electronically transfer data to the state for filing??  I think that this should be a little more reasonably priced especially considering you are paying what you are for the software or in this case, the yearly use of the software.  Another small complaint is the numerous updates that TT has throughout the tax season, I can understand and appreciate the state and federal tax form updates as sometimes states make last minute changes, but the one thing that I don't understand are the updates for bug fixes for the program interface, which like I said, has changed very little in the last few years.  You would think that TT would have that part of the program squared away for the given year without having changes in the program throughout the year even after the filing date expiration.  I mean how do you explain to the IRS that you have a miscalculation due to a bug in your software (although to be fair to TT, that has never happened to me).  For all my complaints though you would think I don't like this program but that is not true.  I like this program for my taxes and I think it is the best tax software out there.  It is quick, easy, and does a good job at helping you get your taxes done correctly with a pretty good and accurate return and I recommend it for those of you wanting to do your own taxes.  Even though the software is pricey, it is cheaper than going to a tax preparer, especially if you have to file for something other than the EZ form.  As far as pricing and the promotion here with Amazon, I am less than impressed.  I would prefer a better price and better promotion than having to subscribe to prime to get 10 bucks off or spend on a gift card.  I would have preferred last years deal with better pricing and a chance to get 30 bucks off Quicken.  If you shop around, there are places that have the premier version for $59 bucks and you don't have to subscribe to prime.	1
DO YOU NEED TO FILE STATE TAX? Make sure you get a state version if you do, or federal only if you don't.  This review is for TuboTax 2013 Deluxe for Federal Returns. Fortunately I live in Texas and there is no state income tax so I don't have to worry about the state portion.  TurboTax has had its share of issues but I came back to it because it does seem to be the best there is, but I'm knocking off a star because of the history of issues I've had with the program in previous years (like it not calculating tax correctly until I deleted some assets and then re-entered them). However, I was a little shocked to read that it requires 515MB of HD space PLUS up to 1.5GB more if Microsoft .NET 4 if not installed (Mac is only 360MB). Wow! That could be over 2GB of HD to do taxes. How inefficient we have become, bat at least HD space is cheap nowadays.  The system requirements specifically mention Windows XP, Vista, and Windows 7/8 but not Windows 8.1. When I installed it on my Windows 8.1 64-bit machine, installation (mid Jan 2014) seemed to go well without any problems. When it checked for updates, it found 4 updates and they all seemed to install properly... so no major install issues for me (unlike a few years ago).  NOTE: Deluxe will do a Schedule C just fine, but it may not provide as much help as the Home & Business version. If you have been doing taxes yourself for awhile then you might not need to pay the extra money for the additional help.  I will update this review as I continue to use the product.  Pros: * Price includes federal E-File * Overall, probably the best tax program there is * Does not say it works on Windows XP 64-bit (but does with 32-bit XP with SP 3+) (anyone even use XP 64-bit anyway?) * Works on 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Vista and Windows 7/8/8.1 * Deluxe version can do a Schedule C for the self-employed - but it doesn't provide as much guidance as the Home & Business edition * Claims that your return will be accurate, guaranteed* (with some fine print)  Cons: * Not perfect (but how can US taxes ever be perfect)? * Have encountered bugs in previous years that caused me to have to delete and re-enter assets * Might take over 2GB of HD space on Windows according to the system requirements * I'm not happy with the reports I've read indicating saying that Intuit lobbies Congress to keep taxes overly complicated, presumably so they can make more money from sales of their tax software.  WARNING ABOUT THE ONLINE VERSION (DOES NOT APPLY TO DESKTOP VERSION):  * Intuit has removed the ability to do Schedule D and E in TurboTax Online Deluxe (you need Premier) * Intuit has removed the ability to do Schedule C and F in TurboTax Online Deluxe (you need Home & Business)	1
I used TurboTax Deluxe 2013 to calculate my anticipated tax burden and potential refund the day after receiving my last paycheck of 2013 (of course I will re-evaluate it once we get our actual W2s). If you filed last year with TurboTax 2012, yes, it is basically the exact same program. But the behind-the-scenes stuff gets updated with new forms and tax laws, etc. I'm sure all of that costs plenty to keep up with, justifying having to re-buy what seems like the same program every year. Though it does beg the question, could we maybe just buy a single TurboTax and pay each year just for the updates and to e-file, instead of re-buying nearly identical software, and a new box and disc and updated marketing, etc. But I digress.  I file Married Filing Jointly and have a pretty simple tax situation (wife and I each have one job, no kids, standard deduction). And for this purpose it was EXTREMELY easy and simple to file. I've used TurboTax since 2011, and I really like how it imports the previous year and unless anything major has changed, you basically just swap some numbers around and you are DONE! I probably spent less than 10 minutes importing my 2012 return and updating it for 2013. Since I've used TurboTax for the last 3 years, it also shows you a tax history with your history of income and taxes. It's kind of fun to see a trendline over the years, especially if it is (hopefully) in the upward direction.  What I also like, is switching back and forth between the "hold my hand' version of the software and the raw tax forms. Some of the questions and situations TurboTax asks me about, I am curious what actual tax basis there is to the question. So after I fill it out, I switch to the forms and see exactly which fields on which forms are being populated based on my answers. It can help you understand tax filing much better to actually look at all the forms being submitted rather than relying solely on the user-friendly walkthrough version. But if that stuff doesn't interest you, it seems accurate and reliable enough to not really need to fret too much over it either.  Make sure you look at the difference between the TurboTax versions (Basic, Deluxe, Premier, Home & Business) so you don't leave tax deductions/credits on the table. Deluxe was what I needed, but depending on your situation it may benefit you to pay a little extra for the pricier ones. If you have a pretty simple tax situation and could file a 1040EZ, the cheapest basic one could be all you need. If you are self-employed, own a business, trade stocks, I would look into the Premier or Home & Business options.  If you are new to TurboTax and will not have anything to import from last year, it takes a little longer, but it is still pretty quick to enter everything in. I could maybe do mine from scratch in 20 minutes. Granted, many people have all kinds of deductions and credits or self-employment details (or if you bought/sold real estate or stocks etc.) that could drastically lengthen the time it takes to go through the process. But all I know, is for me personally, this product is simple, thorough, and exactly what I needed. I fully intend to purchase TurboTax again next tax year.  FYI: The IRS will not process returns in 2014 for tax year 2013 until after January 31st, so don't feel too rushed to buy this and file immediately, as you will still need to wait until *at least* February for any possible refund.	1
Easy to use and accurate. Used H&R Block one time and it was a mistake. The tax preparer they hired for 2 months new less than me about taxes. I bought TurboTax and went home and did my own.	1
Every year Turbo Tax for Home & Business makes the task of doing your taxes that much easier.  The program has the right questions so the form fills in really easily.  It reminds you about deductions that you might ordinarily forget and makes sure you don't make any mathmatical errors.  I swear by it year after year.	1
Though my refund shrunk quite a bit this year, it had nothing to do with the workings of this software. I have been using TurboTax for about a dozen years, now, and I still love how simple it makes things. Since I began using this software to do our family's taxes, the whole process has no longer been a chore. I would highly recommend it to anyone who is wary of public tax accountants and wants a more hands-on experience.	1
I can't even remember the first version of Turbo Tax that I used.  Suffice it to say that it was a long, long time ago.  This software never lets me down.  I do not have a terribly complicated tax filing process.  This software has never, NEVER let me down.  The very best thing is that whether through the software, or my own filing or personal situation, I have never been audited.  That alone has been worth the money.  This is not an option for me, it is an automatic "must do" at the end of every year.	1
I use it every year, and will continue to do so.  Just make sure you purchase the level of tax help you require - Basic, Deluxe, Premier, etc.	1

I:ve been using TurboTax for about 12 years now - switched from Taxcut.  In 2006 I tried turbotax - went back to taxcut and ended up using turbotax for my returns and never went back. All in all they are decent programs. Two times I had extensive tax situations and had a tax accountant do the taxes then ran turbotax anyway -> the results were within a very few dollars.   They have good and QUICK tech support and update the program quickly as IRS makes changes or they spot errors.   All in all this is an easy one to recommend	1
I've used TurboTax software (physical disc) for many years and have never been disappointed. One year I tried another well-known product and didn't like it. I decided I had to go back to TurboTax! Another year it was recommended that I use a professional tax person...and he made a major error on my return that required an amended form plus Social Security consequences a few years later! Never again. TurboTax is so good about asking all the right questions and not leaving any stone unturned, but it's extremely flexible, allowing as much user intervention as is needed, and it's very intuitive.  This year's version seems to be better than ever (I didn't think that was possible)!	1
as described	1
Awesome, thank you very much!	1
Filed without issue.	1
Did not import data as promised. Overcharged for state eFile by $5. Avoid if possible.	-1
Met expectations.  I have been using for years.	1
Great tax program.  Still at times, not intuitive as I'd like it to be.  I've used this twice now, in 2011 and 2013.  Made doing my business returns quite easy.  Also tried to use the community for support and received no response.  I think this year, I'm going to try and do it manually on my own as the 1065s, K-1s, etc are not that difficult for my 3 member entity.  If they included the state program, I'd probably still purchase it but you have to purchase the states separately and my business operates in 3 states.  This just reminded me that I have to do a business return for a new state that we did business in 2014 so I may end up purchasing this anyway.	1
every year use	1
Have used TurboTax for years and it is still a great product.  Will be ordering again this year as Amazon always has the best price for business software.  Highly recommend.	1
Made my biz taxes very easy. Will use again.	1
I've used Turbo Tax for years, because it is one of the best tax software on the market.  I will continue to use Turbo tax to do my personal as well as my business returns.	1
Too costly,especially for filing and State add-ons, I am looking for an alternative.	-1
This edition of Turbotax lacked several help screens. There was a message stating that help would be added at a later upgrade. Other than that, I think I did pretty well with my taxes. I filed them in late February.	1
the program is similar to prior year; is a comprehensive program, imports last year's file easily, handles partnership returns with ease.  I have been using this program for over 10 years and have been satisfied with the ease of use.	1
We always use Turbotax to do our refunds .  We  filed  our taxes online and in 7 days we had our refund from the Federal government.  .The state was a 20.00 fee  so we mailed it in not being in any hurry  to get it back.	1
Been using Turbo Tax for 5 years.  Seems liek this one isn't quite as user friendly as past years.  When I answer that I don't want to provide information on usage of the software I shouldn't have to tell it thtat every time  start it.	1
Review is about the PROGRAM, not Amazon. This is the Business(ONLY) version and does NOT come with a free State. (The other four types do...) It is NOT for personal income taxes. (1040, etc.) SPECIAL USE ONLY... My Mom died and it will cost (quoting inflated list prices) $200 to fill out a couple forms to say "she" made a little money after her death... I've heard other companies software products are less but are poor at this section...	1
Great product. Gets the job done right. There are guidelines for those with no experience, so with a little knowledge you will not be completely lost.	1
I've used this product for several years for a trust tax return. It is easy to use and does a good job. I have two complaints though:  1. It is expensive if you only want to do a trust return, as I do. I wish Intuit put the trust return processing on the less expensive Turbotax Home and Business.  2. This year, when I selected update to get the latest version after downloading the base version, I got a working window saying that the update would be complete in 3 minutes. After waiting overnight, the window had not changed. So I stopped the update (via the Windows task manager) and worked with what I had. At the end of the session, I got a message that the IRS had not yet released the forms for 2013. Now I don't know whether the forms are available but the update failed, or I really have to wait until the forms become available.	1
Every year we think this will make it easier to do our LLC taxes, and every year turns into a nightmare.  Since we use Quickbooks, we assume this edition will play nice with it and easily transfer over our data.  Unfortunately, there are always glitches. The explanations are sparse or nonsensical. We almost always end up looking things up on the Internet or consulting a CPA.  I wish there was a good competitor out there. Intuit is pretty much the only game in town, and they are expensive and incompetent.	-1
I was very disappointed in Turbo Tax for the 2013 tax year.  When entering deductions, where you used to be able to just enter a figure from my Quicken Summary; you now have to break it down into multiple lines for the program to accept it.  Is this Intuit's idea of a positive Turbo Tax Update or is this the IRS cracking down and telling software companies to make it more difficult to take earned deductions???	-1
We have been using this software for over a dozen years for its handling of our Partnership needs.  Handles everything a General or Tax-Matters Partner normally needs.  Our Partnership involves residential rental properties, so depreciation and handling of property expense is important. Softwaregenerates all needed K-1's and even the needed cover-letters to goto each Partner.	1
Have used this product for several years now.  Transfers of previous tax year date is accomplished.  The program is sophisticated enough to do corporate taxes w/o being difficult to use.  Tech support is also good.	1
Not worth the price! Once again this year, I found myself once again stuck with having to buy a copy of TT Business to do a simple 1120s, which has to be filed by March 15th, for a small S corporation.  Ouch, there goes $120!!  The only good news is that the software appeared to work fine (see "two bugs found" update below), with the exception that it updated itself at the very end of the entire interview process, rather than at the beginning, as was the case in the past.  Perhaps under the hood that makes no difference, but being a former software validation analyst, I suggest that the software UPDATE ITSELF at the beginning.  Not right before I e-File.  Other than that, I noticed no issues, but I only used it for a VERY simple 1120s filing, nothing as complex as my last 1065.  At the very end, while going through the steps to e-File, the software warns me that I need to file a STATE INCOME TAX RETURN.  I checked to be sure via Google, and Yes, I do need to file a corporate return with my state...  so I proceeded to do that, at which point TT Business asked me FOR ANOTHER $49.95 to download the state return for my state (FLORIDA).  What an INCREDIBLE RIPOFF!  I thought this was a complete package, (after all it is misleadingly described as "Includes everything needed to complete your business income taxes", and EVERYTHING to me means EVERYTHING!), plus I thought $120 was an outrageous amount to pay for software, and now at the last minute, they fleece you!  I DESPISE THIS KIND OF TACTIC and INTUIT should be ashamed! Frustrated that the listing says this software package "Includes everything needed to complete your business income taxes" when in fact, you have to pay $50 extra to do the state filing, which is not mentioned anywhere online that I can find (it does mention the extra $49.95 charge in tiny 5 point font on the back of the package if you buy it on CD, but not sure if you buy it online that you are made aware of this at all).  The good news is that my state has the short form I need online.  It's only about 4 pages of fill-in-the-blanks and can be mailed in.  It can even be e-Filed if you like.  Certainly not worth another $50, which I note is more than what the DELUXE software costs that does your entire personal return.  So, beware of the Trojan Horse on state returns, and do your own research online.  For my state, (FLORIDA), the form is called the F-1120A and can be found online for free...Be sure to check with your state to see what they require before you shell out even more bucks for state tax software THAT IMHO SHOULD BE INCLUDED WITH THE PACKAGE IN THE FIRST PLACE!	-1
I had no problems with the software itself installing, updating and doing my taxes. But when it came time to select part of my refund as an Amazon gift card with the 10% bonus, I am a little concerned with all of the fine print of the offer. Part of that fine print is that the bank that is handling the bonus offer can use your contact info pretty much any way they want to including "offers from third parties". I went ahead and did the offer anyway grabbing enough bonus to actually have the software more than pay for itself, but it will be interesting to see how many "offers" I get flooded with as this year goes on. Anyway, just be aware that the bonus offer comes with strings attached.	1
I have been a TurboTax user for more than a dozen years and found this to be more than adequate for my use.  My wife and I are retired with normal income, IRA wihdrawals, rental income and depreciation.  Once the software updates were complete (a factor of waiting for Congress to detail the changes in laws which they passed for the preceding year), the sotware operated well and accurately. This year, TurboTax (Intuit) divided the former Deluxe software into two parts: the one reviewed here plus an "upgraded" version to better handle depreciation and other rental expenses.  All of the forms are contained in this edition and can be completed by a knowledgable user.  It is my understanding that the upgrade (more $) has step-by-step instructions to lead one thru these operations, but I chose to do this function manually. Taxes filed and accepted by both Federal & CA; awaiting refund.	1
I've used Turbo tax for several years now and like it very much.  Of course, the more you use a product, the more familiar one becomes with it.  I particularly like the ease of transfer, the ability to quickly go to forms if the need arises.  Technical support has been very useful.	1
I've used TurboTax Deluxe for many years and like it a lot.  I'm self-employed and have to file Schedule C. That's included in the Deluxe version, so no need to pay more for the Home & Business version. This version also includes a download of your state income tax software and forms.	1
UPDATE: I imported data from 2012 TurboTax to 2013 but the software has a GLITCH - it altered the birth date of the primary taxpayer to 01/01/year.  When I filed electronically, both federal & state were REJECTED due to the birth date not matching the Social Security database.  Users will receive an email with the message Your federal return has been rejected.  Here's the problem with your return:  F1040-525-01 - You did not enter either a Date of Birth or Date of Death for the Primary Taxpayer.  I was on hold for sixty minutes with TurboTax while I was searching its site for questions and found a bunch of other users with the same problem.  While you can check your filing status by bringing up TurboTax and selecting check status, and can change the birth date and then refile, it is a problem that users should be aware of since it is a simple matter to check the birth dates, or any other data that has been imported from last year.  I was just so used to not encountering any issues that I failed to even look at the data.  Just passing this issue along....  I've used TurboTax for years without issue.  I tried Tax Cut (I think it was called that) many years ago and quickly returned to TurboTax.  The interview style is slightly tedious for me when there are no changes in my return except the amounts, but I truly appreciate it when I do have changes.  I like the old TurboTax better where I could just go to a page so easily and type my entry - it seems more difficult to do this now, or maybe my brain is just slower after all these years.  I also like the link with It's Deductible.  Highly recommended!	1
I've used TurboTax to file both Fed and State taxes for more than thirty years.  It has always been the most accurate when computing your refund, and the easiest to use.  Never had a problem with it.	1
It only took about five minutes to install, and it works like a charm, just like the last 5+ years I have been using TurboTax.  THANK GOODNESS!!  I held my breath the whole time, scared to death it was going to flop. I am still wondering why so many other folks are having problems. So sorry for them ~ I wish I was more computer-literate and able to discuss that side of it.  Upon reading all those other troubled reviews, I was just about convinced I needed a new computer, just to do my taxes! I guess come April/May I will 'for real' when the support for XP goes away, but for now, I am happy with my old fashioned XP and my smoothly operating TTS (trusty tax software!)  I started not to get TurboTax this year, based on all those negative reviews, but thanks to 'gut instinct', all is good.  Oh, for the Software itself, yeah the Important part of the review, I really can't say much ... I hate math and I hate doing taxes.  That's why I choose TurboTax ... They do it all for me :)  Even though our taxes are really pretty simple/straightforward, all I have to do is fill in the blanks. Easy-peasy overall, free e-file and the State form is what does it for me.  What more could a girl want ?? ;-)	1
I've been using Turbo Tax for a decade-plus and continue to find it to be the best of the bunch when it comes to preparing my personal and small business returns.  Simple to use (well, as simple as anything that is based on the US Tax Code can be), reliable and straightforward.  Zero problem importing my past year return, which is a huge time saver.  I like how I can opt to stay within a menu-driven interface or, when needed, jump right into the actual tax form. Their "for your records" printouts are also very helpful, although very lengthy (recommend saving it to a PDF unless you want to have your printer chew through a lot of paper).  Wish my tax prep was easier, but Turbo Tax is the best tool I've found to help minimize the trouble and pain of filing tax returns.	1
What can you say, been using it for years and it is a good product. Good support and updates. Will buy it next year too.	1
I am very delighted about this software.  I kept on buying Turbo Tax since 2000.  It helps me a lot in knowing all the aspects of filing my Income Tax Return.	1
You cannot go wrong using the TurboTax Deluxe Fed Efile and State 2013 tax program. I have used Turbo Tax for many years and I have found that it is an excellent tax preparation program. The program takes you step by step in preparing your taxes and although it may not be painless, it is easy to follow the directions. I was really pleased with the Amazon special offer price.	1
DO YOU NEED TO FILE STATE TAX? Make sure you get a state version if you do, or federal only if you don't.  This review is for TuboTax 2013 Deluxe for Federal Returns. Fortunately I live in Texas and there is no state income tax so I don't have to worry about the state portion.  TurboTax has had its share of issues but I came back to it because it does seem to be the best there is, but I'm knocking off a star because of the history of issues I've had with the program in previous years (like it not calculating tax correctly until I deleted some assets and then re-entered them). However, I was a little shocked to read that it requires 515MB of HD space PLUS up to 1.5GB more if Microsoft .NET 4 if not installed (Mac is only 360MB). Wow! That could be over 2GB of HD to do taxes. How inefficient we have become, bat at least HD space is cheap nowadays.  The system requirements specifically mention Windows XP, Vista, and Windows 7/8 but not Windows 8.1. When I installed it on my Windows 8.1 64-bit machine, installation (mid Jan 2014) seemed to go well without any problems. When it checked for updates, it found 4 updates and they all seemed to install properly... so no major install issues for me (unlike a few years ago).  NOTE: Deluxe will do a Schedule C just fine, but it may not provide as much help as the Home & Business version. If you have been doing taxes yourself for awhile then you might not need to pay the extra money for the additional help.  I will update this review as I continue to use the product.  Pros: * Price includes federal E-File * Overall, probably the best tax program there is * Does not say it works on Windows XP 64-bit (but does with 32-bit XP with SP 3+) (anyone even use XP 64-bit anyway?) * Works on 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Vista and Windows 7/8/8.1 * Deluxe version can do a Schedule C for the self-employed - but it doesn't provide as much guidance as the Home & Business edition * Claims that your return will be accurate, guaranteed* (with some fine print)  Cons: * Not perfect (but how can US taxes ever be perfect)? * Have encountered bugs in previous years that caused me to have to delete and re-enter assets * Might take over 2GB of HD space on Windows according to the system requirements * I'm not happy with the reports I've read indicating saying that Intuit lobbies Congress to keep taxes overly complicated, presumably so they can make more money from sales of their tax software.  WARNING ABOUT THE ONLINE VERSION (DOES NOT APPLY TO DESKTOP VERSION):  * Intuit has removed the ability to do Schedule D and E in TurboTax Online Deluxe (you need Premier) * Intuit has removed the ability to do Schedule C and F in TurboTax Online Deluxe (you need Home & Business)	1
TurboTax has been my tax software choice for 15 years running. During that time, Intuit has offered better and weake versions. The 2013 edition is as good as any I've used to date.  If asked to identify those chores that personal computing and online services have helped take the pain out of, I wouldn't hesitate to place income tax preparation at the top of the list. Before software, tax time was a three-day long parade of headache-inducing calculations, trips to the library for the correct forms, and the pain of the calculations from worksheets and schedules. While my tax situation has been relatively stable from year to year, TurboTax has compressed three days of extended misery over the correctness of my math to a much shorter period of compressed misery over the extent of my tax burden and interpreting IRS instructions. Intuit had a rough period in the early 2000s with both privacy and functionality in TurboTax (and a STINGY approach to how many users could prepare taxes from a single copy). Those days are happily in the past  This version allows you to prepare and E-File up to five federal returns. Installation was issue free and took less than 10 minutes in a Windows 7 machine (64-bit, Intel i7-3770 CPU @ 3.4 GHZ and 16 GB RAM). Updates since installation have also been painless. Because I had return data from last year's edition on my computer already, our personal data was already filled in, and the program smartly queried about the same sources of income and interest and deductions/credits as last year.  With all of my tax documents at hand, and a moderately complex 1040 filing scenario, I was finished in less than an hour. Other than the fundamental pain that comes with tax time: what's not to like about that?	1
Product arrived in a timely manner, securely packaged. I have used this product for  approximately 14 years and am thoroughly satisfied with its operation. Easy to complete, transfers data from previous year, prompts for possible deductions and error checks the return, when completed. It highlights areas likely to be audited to be sure that you have the proper documentation.	1
What can I say.  I've been using TurboTax for years and it has always proven itself to me.  It is very easy to use and it even does my state taxes too.	1
I have been using TurboTax for years and I always find it extremely easy to use and very accurate. When I have had questions I have gotten prompt replies using their forum from tax preparation professionals. You get what you pay for when it comes to tax preparation software and even though this is a bit pricey it is the best out there in my view.  This product is what I call "idiot proof" It asks you very direct simple questions in preparing your tax returns so you don't have to be knowledgeable about tax codes .  I would highly recommend this product. By the way, I have never been audited using this software for over 10 years. Only downside wasn't  a product  issue but a shipping issue. My product arrived three days after expected delivery date. It turned out Amazon didn't ship it in a timely manner. Amazon offered me a promotional credit of $10 dollars which I could use on another purchase. Also, it seems FedEx Smartpost delayed it even more. Most likely due to weather issues. I feel Amazon made a reasonable solution to the shipping issue.	1
I love Turbotax, have used it for years.  But this years version is causing me huge installation issues.  Installed and computer starting crashing (BSD).  Uninstalled, everything ran fine for a day.  Re installed, again BSD.  Uninstalled, no BSD.  During this time I changed nothing else on my computer other than dealing with Turbotax. Tried chat,  guy told me it was my machine and I should contact a tech.  I find it strange that my machine runs fine without TurboTax and keeps crashing with it.  Running Windows 7 Home Premium, 64 bit.  I looked on their website and found that others are having issues too.	-1
I find paying for this software each year to be entirely worth the money. I don't find working with taxes easy, and this makes the best out of a bad job. Being a Brit living in the States, I do find that the way it deals with assets in another country can be a bit clunky and not intuitive, but the support online usually gets me through it. I find this is an good tool to help me get through a necessary evil. Nobody is ever going to say 'Yay, time to do my taxes, I get to buy Turbotax', but this is worth it.	1
I used TurboTax Deluxe 2013 to calculate my anticipated tax burden and potential refund the day after receiving my last paycheck of 2013 (of course I will re-evaluate it once we get our actual W2s). If you filed last year with TurboTax 2012, yes, it is basically the exact same program. But the behind-the-scenes stuff gets updated with new forms and tax laws, etc. I'm sure all of that costs plenty to keep up with, justifying having to re-buy what seems like the same program every year. Though it does beg the question, could we maybe just buy a single TurboTax and pay each year just for the updates and to e-file, instead of re-buying nearly identical software, and a new box and disc and updated marketing, etc. But I digress.  I file Married Filing Jointly and have a pretty simple tax situation (wife and I each have one job, no kids, standard deduction). And for this purpose it was EXTREMELY easy and simple to file. I've used TurboTax since 2011, and I really like how it imports the previous year and unless anything major has changed, you basically just swap some numbers around and you are DONE! I probably spent less than 10 minutes importing my 2012 return and updating it for 2013. Since I've used TurboTax for the last 3 years, it also shows you a tax history with your history of income and taxes. It's kind of fun to see a trendline over the years, especially if it is (hopefully) in the upward direction.  What I also like, is switching back and forth between the "hold my hand' version of the software and the raw tax forms. Some of the questions and situations TurboTax asks me about, I am curious what actual tax basis there is to the question. So after I fill it out, I switch to the forms and see exactly which fields on which forms are being populated based on my answers. It can help you understand tax filing much better to actually look at all the forms being submitted rather than relying solely on the user-friendly walkthrough version. But if that stuff doesn't interest you, it seems accurate and reliable enough to not really need to fret too much over it either.  Make sure you look at the difference between the TurboTax versions (Basic, Deluxe, Premier, Home & Business) so you don't leave tax deductions/credits on the table. Deluxe was what I needed, but depending on your situation it may benefit you to pay a little extra for the pricier ones. Or, if you have a pretty simple tax situation and could file a 1040EZ, maybe the cheapest basic one is all you need!  If you are new to TurboTax and will not have anything to import from last year, it takes a little longer, but it is still pretty quick to enter everything in. I could maybe do mine from scratch in 20 minutes. Granted, many people have all kinds of deductions and credits or self-employment details (or if you bought/sold real estate or stocks etc.) that could drastically lengthen the time it takes to go through the process. But all I know, is for me personally, this product is simple, thorough, and exactly what I needed. I fully intend to purchase TurboTax again next tax year.  FYI: The IRS will not process returns in 2014 for tax year 2013 until after January 31st, so don't feel too rushed to buy this and file immediately, as you will still need to wait until *at least* February for any possible refund.	1
I love turbo Tax.  I have used it for many years.  It always meets my needs and asks the right questions to maximize my refund or minimize my tax owed.  I have never found an error in all the years I have used it.  I highly recommend Turbo Tax to everyone.	1
TTax2013 is solid and fast as were the prior tax-year versions.  Thankfully you can usually pick it up at a discounted price ($50 -vs- $60) at Amazon earlier than from other sellers (Intuit is usually the LAST one to offer a price-break),  I have only bought TTax on CD over the years (not digital download) so that I have the disc just in case I might need to re-install at some future (like IF the TaxMan were to come a'knockin', God forbid).  Point being I can't comment on the Download approach. My only gripe with Intuit (not this package, per se) is the $40 gouge price for an additional State.  At thathigh price, it's got to be a super-high margin item for Intuit's bottom line.  Off-topic slightly, I *do* wish that Intuit would:  - Make TTax available for Linux operating systems  (likely won't happen though, given that TTax & Quicken both rely on Microsoft Windows' .Net framework;  - Make a TurboTax- style program for preparing and filing Federal Estate, Gift, and Trust returns.  (Maybe they will. should considering the aging Baby Boomer demographics).	1
Do NOT buy this product!  You can go to the Turbotax site and look up "1603 Errors" to see what kind of problems people like me ar having!  This will NOT install, and a refund request has been totally ignored, as have help requests.  They ask you to sign up to be contacted IF a fix is found, but have heard nothing to date.  Many suggestions have been made, but none work.	-1
I create and produce hundreds of small info videos each year, and I have searched for the *perfect* easy to use video editing software. I'll save you the suspense... in my opinion it does not exist. Roxio Creator is an interesting suite of software since it does a couple of things that does not come with standard video editing software - i.e. photo editing and file conversion. While I don't use these features every day - they do come in handy  Notes-  - Photo Editing - I am sure a professional photographer would need a more powerful photo editor, but for me it is more than adequate. Roxio let's me modify and adjust the photo - while being pretty straight forward in use. While I prefer Ultimate Director and Adobe Elements for videos - the Roxio photo editor is helpful.  - File Conversion - lots of options for changing and modifying flles. I especially like that it allows you to modify the file size (although I wish it showed you the file size when completed). Conversion rates are a bit slow (I have a 24G or Ram and NVIDA 770X video card) so slower computers may bog down a bit.  - Lots of ways to burn DVD's, audio CD's and data files.... although I haven't used these features yet.  A few notes on comparing video editing software (which I am borrowing from my review of Ultimate Director)  iMovie HD  The king of the easy to use software. I stuck with iMove for several years because you could produce decent videos without investing much time in learning the software. This was a big mistake on my part. iMove HD is very slow and lacks features  once you use (and learn) a few of the other video suites on the market you realize that iMovie HD is unacceptable.  Final Cut  A HUGE jump from iMovie  in terms of price, features and performance. It is such a quantum leap that unless you are a very serious videographer it may be beyond your needs. Final Cut requires a large investment in time, money (for the software and a high end computer) so be prepared.  Adobe Elements  Not as easy to use as iMovie HD, but still rather easy to use. Adobe Elements provides most of the features that basic to intermediate users will need. It gives you the ability to use multiple cameras and PIP. It also has a wide variety of features for saving your videos - again, it is very straight forward. Adobe Elements is not quite perfect - it is a bit of a processor hog when rendering HD videos, and unless you have a beefy computer (at least 8gig or ram and a decent video card) it will take you up to 45 minutes to render a 300meg file. Another annoyance is that (for some reason) it only recognizes the audio portion of an .avi format (at least for me). Having said that  - it is still my favorite video processing software.  Ultimate Director  More features than Adobe Elements - but it is not quite as intuitive to use. Surprisingly, Ultimate Direct is quicker rendering files than Adobe Elements. Ultimate Director has more options and features, but it is not as easy to save a specific type of file. i.e. if you want to save a file optimized for YouTube in HD Ultimate Director tries to post the video directly onto YouTube instead of writing to a file.  Roxio - Not quite as straight forward as Adobe Elements and not as powerful Ultimate Director. I have used it a couple of times, but I never really saw an advantage. While I may be wrong (due to inexperience) I was never able to do PIP or use multiple videos source. However, for a one stop-shop the Roxio Creator is more than passable, and certainly better than iMovie HD. Although it does seem to have the edge for anyone who wants to create Video Slide Shows.  Final Verdict - Roxio Creator is certainly a handy program to have - while it does not excel in any one area it does provide capability across several functions different functions. it provides decent video editing for photographers or it provides decent photo editing to videographers...and it provides file conversion for both.  4 Stars	1
I had this on a Vista system.  Moved it to my Windows 7 system and lost many features including CD ripping.  NO SUPPORT. Avoid Roxio products.  I use freeware now to rip and burn stuff.  Roxio is crud.	-1
This is one of those temperamental software packages that you wonder why something that looks so easy can make your life so difficult. I recently had to reformat my hard drive and lost the previous Roxio program I had. Since I quickly needed to copy several DVDs, I had to buy something I could download and get to work on right away. The downloading through Amazon went very well and smoothly (you just have to remember to first download and run the Amazon downloader, then the program itself and install them in that order).  The interface of the program is simple enough, very similar in appearance to the 2010 program I used before, which I found comforting. Except that it freezes constantly, doesn't proceed to the next screen, and just plain refuses to cooperate. In the end, I was never able to use the "copy"  function at all. The program either stopped dead, or found something to object about regarding either the source or the destination disk, or it failed to recognize one of the drives or disks, or just played dead. I couldn't even close the program, and had to reboot several times.  I ended up having to copy all the DVDs to my computer and then burn the files from the hard drive to the DVD's. Considering that this was a project requiring 6 DVD's, it was no small inconvenience. I am very disappointed.	-1
I have tried so many photo and video software editing packages.  There was nothing terribly special about this one, and I found the video editing clunky and difficult to use.  You can find better photo editing package, too, in Microsoft or Adobe products.  All in all, this one was a clunker.	-1
I have used Roxio's products for years, starting with Easy CD Creator 15 or so years ago.  They had a really good product back in the day, as well as a pretty good video editing component for home movies to DVD, but over the years each new upgrade brought more and more problems and their technical support unit never would help you unless you paid them a fee.  While not directly relevant to the review of this specific version of the software, it does set the stage for this version as I was apprehensive about trying it in the first place.  To put it in a nutshell, it had a heck of a time trying to install on a Windows 7 machine - it wouldn't install at all and the software aborted the installation after about an hour of trying (no kidding).  I did go to Roxio's online support board because they won't answer a phone, and I saw a list of similar issues / complaints from other customers.  I was unable to resolve the issue and am no longer trying to install the software.  At least Roxio is consistent with their software product and lack of customer support.  I'm very glad I received a review copy vs. paying the recommended retail price of $99 or even one dollar for it.  I would give this one a wide berth.	-1
I have always had a soft spot for Roxio products and have used them for about 15 years now. They continue to be easy to use and very effective. This suite offers a lot of basic media editing features that many beginners will find useful. It does not offer as much as I would have liked in the media playback area but I suppose this is a fairly basic program so I can't expect it to do everything. Bottom line, this is a very easy to use and fun program for basic media file editing.	1
I cannot stand this program I was so aggravated from the the start and ending with their not so stellar customer service that I actually took my frustration out by throwing the whole thing against the wall. First let me begin by telling you I have an older laptop with the Windows Vista The Roxio Creator could not be installed on my computer. I then called their customer support and spoke to "Bob" who could not speak a word of English. Heads up Roxio , please make sure when you hire people to help your customers they can speak the language. I hung up on "Bob" and called again. I got a girl named" Katie" whose accent was so thick I could hardly understand what she was saying to me. So very slowly we tried to communicate with each other. She was a very nice girl but the language barrier and thick accent had me extremely aggravated. I just wanted the program to work. She told me that Ii had to remove a firewall on my computer and install their program. I did not feel comfortable doing this and being stuck with a computer that would either freeze or not work properly after I followed her directions because quite frankly good luck finding the same person to help you again if you have an issue. She could not stay on the phone to walk me through the process because she had other callers. She did tell me I could call back after the removal of firewall and installation of their program with any questions. I wish I could have installed Roxio Creator so I could write a more in depth review but unfortunately it could not be done I hope for those of you that do purchase this item have better luck then I did	-1
I'm not hugely experienced using Roxio Creator.  I've almost always had one version or another of Roxio Creator, and find that I mostly use it for converting my cd's to different audio formats for use on different devices, or for making fun cd's for the car of favorites.  I also tend to use it when making data cds as I can't find the software my laptop came with for doing that.  I can find this one every time and it is pretty easy to use.  As for use, it is fairly easy to use - you select what you want to do, then follow the steps.  I like that Roxio has made it so easy this way.  I didn't realize I could convert video specifically for my Kindle Fire, but Roxio makes that possible too - that is on my to-do list, but I haven't tested that section yet.  This is my go-to software for converting music and burning discs.	1
I have used Roxio products in the past and found them to be user friendly and feature rich. I have not used their products for some time but have relied on iTunes and Windows Movie Maker to take care of my media needs. I have not spent a lot of time with Roxio Creator NXT 2 so far but what I have seen I really like. I played around with the slideshow creator long enough to learn how easy it is to create a slideshow with your photos. A large selection of background music is included to enhance the slideshow and I didn't find any of it to be too cheesy. The user also has a choice of using music from his own computer. The finished quality was very good and I liked the options to export the completed video. Also included are many templates for creating calendars, greeting cards, etc. with your photos. I have not tried it yet but I like the feature that allows the user to capture online video and/or internet radio. I am looking forward to spending more time learning how to use all the included features.  The only negative I could mention is the amount of time this software takes to install but I suppose that is to be expected with a program that has so many features and included media files.	1
It's ok. It burns data disks. But windows burns data disks. It burns images. Just google "iso recorder powertoy" and you'll find a great free iso burner (works in 8 great even though it only mentions through windows 7). It lets you copy disks (which you can do with the free iso recorder). It lets you burn music cds--doesn't media player do that as part of windows? So the first half of the program does stuff with disks, but who needs more than free to do this? It does fine doing all these things, but it's not amazing. It's kinda clunky.  Then it lets you edit movies and edit movie dvds. It is easier than Premier Elements, but I prefer Premier still because I have more options. It does this ok, but you can't burn Bluray disks in this version. To be honest, again there isn't much more that this does than the free Windows Movie Maker does... And if you really need more than Movie Maker, you probably need Premier Elements for the real next step up.  And I guess the biggest problem is that the whole program is a relic from the past. I burn probably 10 disks a year. I don't remember the last time I made a music CD. I do make a dvd a year for grandma, but I already have Adobe Premier Elements for that. And most people just upload to youtube! There has to be a smaller and smaller market for this. I mean most ultrabooks don't even come with disk drives! I'm sure there's not enough money to make a better and better program here--just enough money to churn out a new version every year with slight improvements.  And it definitely is a better program than the version I used a few years back and crashed all the time. But now that Creator has arrived to the party in good condition, the party's winding down...  Additional info 1/24/2014: So I needed to burn a .img disk image that I downloaded from the Microsoft Office site. It's a disk download of Microsoft Office for my friend with really slow internet. I've seen .img files before so I know that extension is not unheard of, and I assume that since Microsoft is using it that it's a normal image type. Well, Roxio doesn't recognize it as a disk image format. But the free iso recorder powertoy does. Since Roxio fails me the one time I actually needed it, I'm reducing the rating to one star and uninstalling the software.	-1
I haven't used Roxio in quite a while, in fact it's been at least one laptop ago and it had come preinstalled. I liked it at the time but began using other products after that old laptop croaked and the new one did not come with the program installed. When I was using it years ago, it was essentially a cd/dvd creator. It seems it's gone through many upgrades over the past several years. With the current version, Roxio offers digital photo editing, movie making, video editing, music, storage, etc. In other words, it really is a "suite" now.  I installed this on Windows 7 (64 bit) and had no issues that required support from Roxio. I see that a number of reviewers with installation issues had some unpleasant experiences dealing with tech support which is unfortunate but also very believable.  As far as the "suite" of products included here, I'd say this is a good, moderately priced program for the home user because it's pretty straightforward and relatively simple to learn. Most of it is intuitive if you've ever used any time of digital media software in the past. If you've used Roxio products in the past, the upgrades are relatively simple to get used to.  Overall, I really like this for its ease of use and the nice creative touches/additions to previous versions. I use this mostly for video editing but will probably branch out with it a bit more than I have in the past.  Recommend.	1
Roxio's Creator NXT 2 is a program that is relatively easy to learn and use, and it performs a LOT of common tasks. And it performs most tasks very well. I have been quite pleased with it. And while single task programs would likely give you more individual task options, and be able to perform its specific job a little better, this multi-task program does and will perform all of its duties to a satisfactory level for the average user.  However, with that said, if you are in fact a power user and/or a perfectionist, you may want to instead get single task programs for best results. But, of course, this will come at a much, much higher overall price. But again, for most users, this program will definitely yield satisfactory results. And without being really difficult to learn, as is frequently the case with individual task programs.  Overall I have been very happy with this software suite, and cannot find any significant flaws with it. And in fact, I have only been able to find minor shortcomings. But they're shortcomings I can live with given the very reasonable price for the number of tasks it performs. If you're an average/casual user, do give this software suite a try. I am reasonably confident that you'll be happy with it.	1
In accordance with Mr. Callahan's wisdom, Roxio Creator is a good fit for most of my objectives in creation and editing of digital media, and once I get over myself, actually all I need. It's been years since I have investigated any Roxio products as in satiation of my arrogance I possess more talent than the evidence would support I had migrated to specialized packages for photo editing, video editing, CD/DVD burning/ripping and copying, including Photoshop Elements, Corel Painter, WinDVD, Pinnacle Studio and some other packages for even more esoteric activities.   While the stand alone products I have used all contain more robust complements of utilities to manipulate the subject media, more often than not after dabbling for a while in the attempt to understand the capabilities of the application I ended up using a pretty typical core group of features and forgetting how to quickly and efficiently employ the more sophisticated features, finding myself often frustrated with the need to reacquaint myself with the software in order to reach some crest of achievement I really didn't need to take on but only attempted because I had the software at hand.  I intend to update my review as I spend more time with the separate modules of the suite. Right now I have only engaged in minimal use of the photo editing and video conversion sections, where I know my primary interests will continue to focus.  For my present objective of touching up a host of recent photos I found the photo module easy to understand and use with resorting to a visit to the online learning center, although I did take a cursory look at the accessible PDFs to make sure the links were active (they were). The editing module has an assortment of options like red eye correction, dust, scratch, blemish and wrinkle removal, cropping and reshaping, color saturation, contrast and sharpness to let me feel like I'm a better hobbyist photographer than I should admit I am. Those tools can be manually employed or system detected flaws can be approached via implementation of the autocorrect choice, which should also be sufficient for most users.  I wasn't as satisfied with Video conversion to a format readable on my iOS mobile as it appeared grainier than the original however I accept I will have to spend more time with the app to tweak the aspects I found less than acceptable. As anyone who has previously worked with Video editing software is aware, this module consumed a high amount of system resources but absent direct monitoring I didn't feel it was any more oppressive than what I have encountered with competitive products like WinDVD and ImageBurn and in my opinion easier to understand out of the box.	1
This software covers almost all media related tasks with a consistent and straightforward interface.  I can think of more powerful versions of most of the tasks, but they each are more expensive and more difficult to learn than this software, and this software produces great results.  For most media tasks, a user just wants a task completed without hassle, for example when burning a CD or converting a video.  For other tasks, such a generating a playlist or editing a digital image, a user will want some balance of options vs ease of use.  I am impressed with the result in basically all cases for this software.  I even caught myself using Roxio instead of GIMP (a powerful imaging program I've used for many years) because I just wanted results quickly.  For a solid 90% of my image tasks relating to photographs (cropping or red eye or minor editing), this would be a quick way to get the job done, but if you're interested in something like photoshop, well, this isn't that.  However, a free program like GIMP can handle advanced tasks despite being user unfriendly for most, which would be an easy supplement for Roxio's general ease and functionality.  The video editor is simple and effective for adding captions or making minor manipulations to improve video quality or silly effects.  The real help is that this program will simplify putting your videos on your many different devices and media sharing services.  This was dead simple and well organized.  If you share a lot of video, this software is worth your consideration.  If you like to make montages or otherwise combine or sort a lot of video, this software is worth your consideration.  It's quite a lot of fun to do with Roxio.  I enjoyed the calendar and greeting card publishing software.  The final product looked professional enough that all you would need to start a business is some good photography and a good printer.  I never ran into any problems with installation or glitches.  Converting video takes time, but it seemed about the same as with handbrake or other normal conversion or ripping software.  In all honesty, this software is probably best for someone who likes modern technology and isn't afraid to use it, but isn't a power user.  For the functionality, it's a good value.	1
I like the way Roxio packaged features into this version.  It gives the novice media junkie a good platform to work from when detailing specific video information.  You can edit photos, video, audio and then turn around drop it to a DVD, or flash drive.  It's a great starter package for the beginner, those more advanced will probably find the platform a bit mundane and repetitive.  If you want to test the editing waters then wade in my friend, this is certainly the package deal for you.  It's not complicated or hard to understand, be sure to follow directions when installing and have tech support on speed dial if you run into issues.  You get a really good basic video and photo editor all rolled up in one!	1
Extremely easy installation and setup which took about 12 minutes.  I did not have any of the issues others have complained about and I have Windows7.  I have spent hours on this program trying out the different functions and all but one (video) are very easy to figure out, the data/copy, music/audio, photo, and copy/convert.  On the Burn Data Disc function I like that you can easily remove single or multiple files from the burn window and also rename if desired.  I have gotten stuck on the very comprehensive video section.  I want to organize and string together my hundreds of video clips taken over the years and you can do many different things to enhance the final video.  I experimented with just three video clips totaling 5 minutes and burned it onto a re-writable DVD and it actually played on my PS3 without being closed/finalized.  Then I tried about 50 clips of different formats that would fill up the DVD and there was a problem with the encoding so I am now in the process of using the copy/convert function to make them all the same, MPEG-2, hoping it will solve the problem.  I'm not very experienced with these types of programs so it's understandable that I will have a more time consuming learning curve.  So far though I am very impressed; this software offers everything I have wanted to do with my pictures, music and video. I will update this review as I discover/learn/solve functions and issues.  Update:  I could not figure out the reason I could not burn a movie disc containing multiple movie clips I had put together and saved to a file and found that it will error out if you try to burn it from within the software.  If you close the software and access the file from wherever you saved it, it will burn the DVD with no problem.	1
Buy it and immediately an advertisement come up to buy the pro version. It does not really work that well at all. If possible try to find another program that can do more for the same price. I will.	-1
Nice software to copy disks.  Easy to use	1
This is a great program for burning CDs or DVDs. This program is the best value for the money.	1
it works for me.	1
Does a good job in burning data to cd or dvd. Have not tried it on Blue Ray but should work for that to.	1
I have tried everything I can. I can NOT drag and drop files to this program. I can NOT burn to a flash drive, It will NOT convert to MP3. Other than that it is a great program. NERO has let me down yet again.	-1
Very useful and excellent article.	1
I haven't had some of the installation or bugginess/crashing problems that others have reported.  Overall, the software seems to work pretty well.  I was surprised by the omission of sound editing software, although freeware for sound editing is readily available and highly functional.	1
The last media create/editor/organizer package I used was Roxio Creator 2009 but I got tired of it not really being supported on Windows 7 so seeing this package and it also having blu-ray support and Windows Media Center TV file support I jumped on it.  Here are the specs for the system I am using it on (DIY system) Intel Core i5-3570K CPU Intel 180GB SSD HIS 512MB HD5670 GPU 8GB DDR3-1600 RAM (2 x 4GB) Lite-On IHBS112 blu-ray burner  The first thing that attracted me to this package was the claim of WMC TV file support. I've used the very excellent VideoRedo in the past but it's twice as much as this whole package. I knew this didn't have automatic commercial detection but if I could at least trim the beginning and end and convert the files to MKVs, I'd be happy. So, the first thing I tried was to load a WTV file and I was able to do that, even a big 11GB file. It took a while to get used to the video editor but I was able to trim the beginning and end of a video. Converting it to MKV however was a different story. While the Video app supports WTV, for some reason the Recode app does not. I was able to get it to load a DVR-MS file (the old kind). Like MKV, DVR-MS is just a container. In this case the stream is MPEG2. I wanted to write out a MKV with MPEG2 so I would not have to convert it but for some reason the option to change the stream from H.264 to MPEG2 is grayed out so it required conversion to change the container.  The next thing I tried was the Blu-ray player. The whole package is half the price of most commercial software blu-ray players so if this worked, it's worth it alone even if nothing else does. I was able to watch a Blu-ray the first time but the second time when I went to play the Blu-ray the move just hung. I had to reboot to get it to work again.  That's about as far as I've gotten. There are three other things I'll want to do at some point I used to always do with Roxio Creator that'll come up as needed:  Crop an MP3 file for using as a ringtone Burn a DVD with menus and the new one I want to try is burning videos to a Blu-ray.  I won't be using all the library and organization tools (Nero MediaHome) since I already use Windows Media Center and MediaBrowser 3 for those (if you haven't checked out MediaBrowser3 it's amazing).  So far, I am pretty happy with it. We'll see how it goes with a big movie project. I have quite the backlog of home movies but it's so hard to find the time to edit them and put them onto a disc. New ringtones will probably be first since that's quick. I don't expect any issues there since MP3s are so lightweight.  [Update] The Blu-ray support in this package is really a hidden gem. Given the price compared to WinDVD, TMT, etc. I wouldn't hesitate to get this if you want a software Blu-ray player. Even recent titles like Gravity and Enders Game worked.  After quite a bit of searching through each of the Nero modules, I was surprised to find the package actually does not include any sound editing tools. It turns out there's a free download from the Nero website for Nero WaveEditor. So, if you're looking for something to edit MP3s, this package doesn't have it. I am surprised.	1
I got this version of Nero 2014 because I have owned Nero since version 1.  I had read a review that said that their were certain add-ins that installed and couldn't be uninstalled.  I read every popup that has been displayed and have had so such problems.  As for the product.  There are a number of new features one being video editing.  I worked with it for over an hour and found it to be mediocre at best.  This version is good but it basically does what the last versions have done.  I like Nero and use it but the older version was just as good with few add ins.  For the first time buyer I would say this is a really good program for making DVDs and BlueRay and the company has been around for awhile.  As far as customer service goes I can't say since I have never had to use it.  I use Windows 8.1 and had no problems with the way it acts using this operating system.	1
Nero 2014 Platinum is the company's flagship product, and one look at the back of the box at the feature list shows why.  If there is something that you want to do with physical media, and even some electronic media needs, this software will help you get it done.  With such an extensive software package, it's very difficult to thoroughly test every feature at one time. Therefore, as I test each component, I will update this review with my findings and adjust my overall rating if necessary.  Overall Impressions ------------------- The umbrella software runs full-screen, looking very Windows 8 Metro/Modern inspired. While some people like to run their software full-screen, I consider it a waste of screen real estate. If I want to run it full-screen, Windows provides for that capability, as long as the software doesn't disable it, like this does. While not a major issue, I find that this speaks to the target audience that Nero is aiming for. Fortunately, this is a minor issue, and each application can be run separately, which avoids the full-screen launch screen altogether.  Blu-ray Player -------------- I compared the Blu-ray player application against Corel WinDVD Pro 11, which was already installed. My test disc was&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/The-Hobbit-An-Unexpected-Journey-Extended-Edition-HD/dp/B00GGEVKYO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey  (Extended Edition) [HD</a>], playing the 2D version of the movie.  Using the defaults in the Nero Blu-ray player, I found the playback in full-screen mode to be a little choppy, like the PC couldn't quite keep up with the 20-25 Mbps data rate of the video. During the dragon attack scene in Chapter 1, I observed 14% CPU utilization and 310 MB of memory utilization. The same sequence in WinDVD was very smooth in playback, with 2% CPU and 355 MB of memory utilized.  The video playback options in the Nero product allow for Full Hardware (default), Partial Hardware, and Software decoding for the video. Changing to Partial Hardware resulted in a little smoother playback, with 16% CPU and 382 MB RAM utilization. Switching to Full Software mode improved the choppiness some more, but still not to the level of WinDVD, with 25% CPU and 410 MB of RAM being used.  There is a setting in the Audio options for directing audio to the SPDIF/HDMI output instead of the analog output on my motherboard. This raised my hopes, as I use a separate set of speakers for the default system sounds and other normal use, and for watching movies or playing music. Windows Media Player is one of the few programs which allows me to have select the SPDIF output for playback of music and DVD's, while still using the analog output as the default on the PC. With the Playback Device set to the analog output in Windows 7 and choosing the SPDIF/HDMI output option in Nero, I received an error dialog saying that there was a problem with the audio output device. Switching the default to the SPDIF output kept that error from occurring, so it is not possible to have Nero's Blu-ray playback software to act like Windows Media Player in that regard. (By comparison, WinDVD does not offer an option at all, so it only outputs to the default sound device.)  One last thing to bring up which impacts the usability of the Blu-ray player is that it will not play full-screen on my second monitor while allowing me to work normally on the primary monitor. I hadn't even considered that this would be an issue, as WinDVD has always worked that way, but this issue prevents sending the video to one monitor while working on another.  For this reason, as well as the others listed above, I cannot recommend using Nero Blu-ray Player for playing movies on Blu-ray. It's possible that this is a system-specific issue, but it is something to be aware of when considering this software.	1
I've used Nero for a decade now and will probably continue to do so, but I more and more find it to be difficult to use. It does more than it used to, but for the most part I don't want to do most of the things it alleges it is capable of. It seems to be less intuitive than it used to be. And it still has some irritating features, like not blowing past disc protection. Let's face it, a lot of times you want a copy of a disc for completely legal reasons, such as a gaming disc that you will use as the playing copy.  So I will use this, but so far I am not as enamored of it as I was of its predecessors	1
My netbook has many hours of home video files stored on it that I wanted to share with family.  Using Nero 2014 Platinum and a USB DVD writer, I have had success burning these movies.  Read on to find out what this software can really do!  Installation I installed Nero 2014 Platinum on my Acer Aspire V5-122P-0637 netbook.  The AMD quad core processor and 6Gb of memory seemed more than enough to try out video editing on my favorite portable computer.  The installer detected that I needed Microsoft XML 4.0 SP3 and a reboot validator so I had to restart my system to complete the process on my Microsoft Windows 8.1 64bit machine.  Upon reboot, I entered my serial number and began the file install.  Approximately 15 minutes later Nero was installed.  The content pack took another 10 minutes to load.  Use First and foremost, before Nero 2014 Platinum was installed on my Acer Aspire several of my movies could not be played because their file extensions were not recognized.  After installation, the MKV video files could be played.  Next, I burned a digital copy of a movie I purchased to DVD+R Double Layer disc using Nero Video.  The process took 2 hours 35 minutes to complete, mostly because of the transcoding process.  The transcoding used all four cores of my AMD A6-1450 cpu.  Extras The Nero 2014 Platinum installation DVD also features content packs.  You will find video effects, themes and menu templates in this collection of content.  In conclusion, Nero 2014 Platinum does a fine job of editing and burning movies.	1
I've used Nero to burn data and music CDs and DVDs for years. The interface is easy to use and the results have always been good. I don't think I've ever burned a "coaster" with Nero.  I finally decided to join the 21st century, at least partially. I've migrated most of my daily use to Windows 7, but I still maintain an XP partition on my computer. With the migration to Windows 7 I felt the need to also upgrade the software, so I was pleased to be able to snag this 2014 version of Nero through Vine.  Installation from the CD went smoothly In both partitions and it accepted the serial number with no problems. The interface is similar to what I'm used to with Nero. So far, I've burned a couple of data discs and, as expected, they burned just fine.  Though I haven't used it for a video as of yet I will report back when I do.	1
I'm been using all different kinds of software on my PC's for ripping and burning CD's. I make a lot of home movies of family and friend events and this program helps me rip my old home video DVDs and then edit them in a separate program.  Of course it helps that I have a really good PC, built for photo and video editing. This program runs smoothly for me. But it all depends on what you want to use this software for, and the performance of the PC you will be installing the software on.  Since I did not have prior versions or any other ripping/burning software on my PC, Nero installed without any issues. I'm running Windows 7 Pro. As someone mentioned, you may run into issues if you have prior versions. You may need to completely remove the prior installation in order for Nero to install correctly.  The Blu-ray player worked fine for me. I have yet to test the 3D capability. I need to get a 3D monitor first. The launch window is similar to the Windows 8 design. I don't like Windows 8, which is why I stick with 7, but there's not much I can do except get used to the launch window.  I did convert some short home videos to be played on my Kindle and iPad and it worked fine. But those devices can also play the files without being converted.  Overall, I really like Nero 2014 Platinum. But like I said, your results may vary based on your PC performance, prior installations, and what you plan on using the software for. I've been using it for mainly playing movies and creating files for mobile devices. When I test the other capabilities or run into issues, I will update the review.	1
I've used previous versions of NERO for burning DVDs and Blu-rays and they've all worked great. This all in one suite adds a DVD/Blu-ray player as well as video editing. In the short time that I've used it, it worked well. So far I haven't ran into any bugs or issues...will update review when I've had more time to explore more of its features.	1
If you frequently burn DVDs and CDs, this is the software program you want/need. For that task there's not a better program out there. I really love Nero for the task of burning DVDs and CDs. I also found this particular Nero software version to be intuitive and pretty easy to learn and use. The learning curve is quite small. And again, Nero is definitely the best software for performing the task of burning.  If you're thinking about buying this software package because of all of its other listed capabilities, it's quite competent at performing those tasks as well. Is it the best at performing all of those other tasks, too? No. I don't think it is. There are other individual programs that can perform specific individual tasks a little better, but Nero 2014 Platinum is basically a suite of programs, and it does perform all of its functions competently.  Overall I think you'll likely be quite satisfied with this software. I am. And as a software program that performs many, many photo and video tasks, I honestly don't think you can go wrong with Nero 2014 Platinum. It's a great program suite. I recommend it highly.	1
I literally could never get this product to successfully install. That was back in the Windows 7 days, and Windows 10 isn't all the different. However, this is an older version. Maybe they fixed those bugs in the latest revision.	-1
Worked as advertised.	1
easy to use ,very friendly and reviews all the things you should be deducting.	1
works as expected	1
use it every year	1
good	1
I have used Turbo Tax Home & Business for years.  It has easy to follow instructions that guide you safely through the program and make completing your taxes very easy.  I would highly recommend Turbo Tax to anyone interested doing their own taxes.	1
I keep looking for something other than TurboTax every year and am never satisfied with any of the alternatives. I keep buying TurboTax.	-1
As expected.  Installed without error  I have used this software for years and it has been a significant help with tax preparation.	1
I use turbo tax every year.	1
I have used TurboTax for years and found it very complete (unlike some other cheaper products I used in the past).	1
First of all I had no problems downloading and installing the mac version of the software at all. Choose the correct installer (Mac or PC) and meet the minimum requirements listed several times while purchasing the software and your good to go. My mac is a 2006 mac book running 10.7.5 and I had no issues.  The software is very thorough as usual and very simple.  The issue I had was with the Amazon gift card offer. It's a deal where they give you 10% additional cash when diverting a portion of your refund to the gift card. They only let you do $100 increments so I went with a $300 card which yields me a $330 gift card. It's supposed to be delivered via a validation code that is emailed to you. I still have not received that code and I see other people are having similar problems. That is not the biggest problem. I know that issue will eventually be resolved.  The biggest problem with this offer is the generic language used by Sunrise Banks the provider of the card. In the enrollment phase of the issuant of the card. There are several hoops that need to be jumped through. One of those hoops is the "explanation" of what info of yours that Sunrise can collect and that you need to approve before they can give you the card. They generically state the some info included in your return can be used by sunrise.  I thought to my self it's probably unidentifiable info typically collected by companies to generate information about groups of people like Age, State of residence, income level and the sort. At no point before you transmit the approval do they SPECIFICALLY state what will be gleaned from your tax return. After I printed out my return I noticed a detailed section from sunrise listing what info they specifically collect and my social security number was one of them. Had I known that (and I should have known better) I would have told them to keep their measly $30. I have posted a picture of the specific details by sunrise in the picture section of this amazon listing. Take a look at it and make sure your comfortable with the info that they collect before proceeding. I'm such a fool. I hope this helps some of you make up your own mind if it's worth it or not.	1
Do not buy.  I have used TurboTax for several years with no problem - until now.  Intuit  has ruined the program and it will not work.  You end up in a loop trying to update the forms and files - which the program will not do unless you call and give a code.  When you call you get an automated Robo voice which after several questions tells you to wait and then disconnects about a minute later.  TurboTax also seems much more intrusive than before.  It snoops all over your computer files for extra information that it does not need.	-1
I have used TurboTax for years, so it is the path of least resistance for me.  It seems to do a good job, and it helps get the job done quickly and with minimal agony.	1
I am 80% of the way through my tax return and so far, no issues to report. What DOES make me angry though is the way Intuit "gouges" the users for the TOTAL "USE" COST to complete a federal and state return with EFile!  A lot of people complained last year about local Tax Preparers (WE ALL KNOW WHO THEY ARE)  and the fees they charged of their services. Truth be told, it is almost worth it to have your taxes done by those folks when you consider the time it takes to do it yourself.  Congrats Intui!  You ruined Quicken for the Mac - now your getting greedy with the customers that made you successful during tax season!	-1
I use turbotax every year. I think the "refund bonus offer" is totally useless. But the basic turbotax (which is what this is) seems to work well and do the computations correctly. Can't ask for much more. It is a bit more clunky every year to use but I can put up with that.	1
You can get the bundle discount on digital downloads of Quicken and Turbo Tax even though the digital purchase does not go through the cart.  After phoning customer support I purchased Turbo Tax and then purchased Quicken.  At payment time for the Quicken the total was reduced by the $35 bundle reduction.  So it did work :-)	1
Bought for my 2013 return.  I like how easy turbo tax is.	1
I have used turbo tax for at least 10 years and it just keeps getting better. This is a great product.	1
Turbo Tax has, as usual, delivered a quality product. If you are not a tax professional it can guide you step by step through the process of filing your income tax and makes sure you do not forget any credits you are due.	1
still the best as far as I am concerned	1
Turbotax not only removed some needed features, THEY FORCE YOU TO SIGN IN TO THEIR WEB SITE TO OPEN YOUR OWN FILE ON YOUR OWN COMPUTER!!!@@@###. Not only so, but I have two accounts and there is a problem signing in even after a password reset. WHAT A HUGE HASSLE.  Next year I'm looking into alternatives after years of using Turbotax.	-1
Been using TurboTax for some time now. It can be a little confusing at first, but if you stick with it, it will gather all your information and put it where it's supposed to be. It helps to have last year's tax return to make sure you have everything the first time you use the program. Then, the following years TurboTax will keep your previous year's return data and you just update the items that have changed. You can ask questions, but I have not had success with the TurboTax customer support, probably better off asking the community. Good record keeping and having all your information updated and handy is a plus. Good luck!	1
It made taxes very easy and I was happy to use it.	1
Easy to use. With tax updates at fingertip	1
I used TurboTax Deluxe 2013 to calculate my anticipated tax burden and potential refund the day after receiving my last paycheck of 2013 (of course I will re-evaluate it once we get our actual W2s). If you filed last year with TurboTax 2012, yes, it is basically the exact same program. But the behind-the-scenes stuff gets updated with new forms and tax laws, etc. I'm sure all of that costs plenty to keep up with, justifying having to re-buy what seems like the same program every year. Though it does beg the question, could we maybe just buy a single TurboTax and pay each year just for the updates and to e-file, instead of re-buying nearly identical software, and a new box and disc and updated marketing, etc. But I digress.  I file Married Filing Jointly and have a pretty simple tax situation (wife and I each have one job, no kids, standard deduction). And for this purpose it was EXTREMELY easy and simple to file. I've used TurboTax since 2011, and I really like how it imports the previous year and unless anything major has changed, you basically just swap some numbers around and you are DONE! I probably spent less than 10 minutes importing my 2012 return and updating it for 2013. Since I've used TurboTax for the last 3 years, it also shows you a tax history with your history of income and taxes. It's kind of fun to see a trendline over the years, especially if it is (hopefully) in the upward direction.  What I also like, is switching back and forth between the "hold my hand' version of the software and the raw tax forms. Some of the questions and situations TurboTax asks me about, I am curious what actual tax basis there is to the question. So after I fill it out, I switch to the forms and see exactly which fields on which forms are being populated based on my answers. It can help you understand tax filing much better to actually look at all the forms being submitted rather than relying solely on the user-friendly walkthrough version. But if that stuff doesn't interest you, it seems accurate and reliable enough to not really need to fret too much over it either.  Make sure you look at the difference between the TurboTax versions (Basic, Deluxe, Premier, Home & Business) so you don't leave tax deductions/credits on the table. Deluxe was what I needed, but depending on your situation it may benefit you to pay a little extra for the pricier ones. If you have a pretty simple tax situation and could file a 1040EZ, the cheapest basic one could be all you need. If you are self-employed, own a business, trade stocks, I would look into the Premier or Home & Business options.  If you are new to TurboTax and will not have anything to import from last year, it takes a little longer, but it is still pretty quick to enter everything in. I could maybe do mine from scratch in 20 minutes. Granted, many people have all kinds of deductions and credits or self-employment details (or if you bought/sold real estate or stocks etc.) that could drastically lengthen the time it takes to go through the process. But all I know, is for me personally, this product is simple, thorough, and exactly what I needed. I fully intend to purchase TurboTax again next tax year.  FYI: The IRS will not process returns in 2014 for tax year 2013 until after January 31st, so don't feel too rushed to buy this and file immediately, as you will still need to wait until *at least* February for any possible refund.	1
Love that I can download and have it instantly and it's cheaper than even Costco.	1
These dopes think I'm going to write something here. Nuts to them.	1
As Advertised	1
I have used TTax for so long I cannot remember when I started (I know it was well back in the 90's) and have always found it to be a superior product.  By the way, did I mention that I'm a CPA.	1
NOTE:  PC Download is the same as the CD software, not sure why the reviews are separated.  I downloaded my software, but entered my review in the CD product first, not realizing they were separated.  [This part of the review written in early Dec 2013]  So far so good. I just downloaded Premier this past weekend, installed on my Win7x64 machine with no problems. I imported last year's data, and then ran through an estimated calculation for Fed & State, saw only one problem (see below). My situation is a bit unusual: no W2, but Sch C, Sch K, college costs, and investment income.  Not much change from last year in the program's look and feel and flow, but obviously quite a few changes in tax law. I've been using TT for many years now (have also used competitors in the past), but I was mildly surprised by how quickly I was able to do everything.  The one flaw: when entering college costs in the "interview", the field for "Room and Board" didn't show up in the "Other School-Related Expenses". I went directly to the form (which needed some finding, it's called Student Info Worksheet), entered the value directly, and after that the field popped up on the interview.  Overall, I'm happy with the product, but of course I'll be even happier when I'm finally done using it in April!  [Update Jan 31, 2014]  So far I've downloaded several updates, and the program has continued to work without any hitches. I've been able to download 1099 data successfully from my financial firm, and the process of correcting the basis for "uncovered transactions" was simple (but you have to understand the basics here, of course).  On the downside, I'm finding that the guidance for business income & expenses is very poort, especially when you go to the state Sch C. Based on the descriptions, I'm not convinced that Home & Business will be better in this area, but I'm going to take a look at that.	1
Good s/w....	1
Met expectations.  I have been using for years.	1
Nice...as expected	1
I have use Turbo Tax for over 20 years Loads your data automatically from previous year, and keeps IRS forms up to date.	1
It's TurboTax. The only tax software I would recommend. It is easy to use, step-by-step guide, with built-in check and balances. Even my mom can use this.	1
Wise up Intuit.  You are leaving you customer base high and dry.  My wife picked up a copy of this version at Sam's and I noticed the price spike.  I read the reviews and decided to take it back unopened for a refund.  Short-changing your customers by forms omission and price spikes is a foolish business plan.  Take a page from the Sears and Roebuck book ... once they were the cornerstone of American merchandising and they abandoned their customer base.  They aren't a player any more.  Will this happen to Intuit?	-1
I've used this program for the past 4 years and it just works, taking me through the process step by step	1
Its a great product an gets better every year.	1
Easy to use, worked well, didn't disappoint.	1
just can't go wrong with this software - gets better and better every year - Intuit has really nailed it for making tax time stress free - highly recommended have been using it for 5 years and just gets better all the time	1
TurboTax is easy to use and I trust it to remind me of things that would be easy to overlook. We've used TurboTax for more than 10 years. The user interface has improved over the years.  Two features I really appreciate are the ability to either walk through one step at a time, or to jump around easily if I want to. The other feature I like is the ability to switch between interview style to the "forms" mode where I can see the raw details shown in the government publication format.  I quit using a tax adviser years ago. One year I paid the tax preparer but I also used TurboTax in parallel. TurboTax returned almost $1,000 more than the tax adviser did. That was the last time I used the adviser.	1
I have been using TurboTax for several years.  Each year its use becomes easier as I am able to pull in the previous year's return as  reference particularly with schedule D where I have carry over investment losses.  More companies are uploading directly into TurboTax so filing my returns gets easier and easier.	1
When I started looking for tax program I went to turbo on line, they wanted to charge me ten dollars more for the basic program plus an additional 49 dollars for a state tax. This was a much better deal. There was a little glitch down loading it because you need a amazon pre program to get this to download properly, but once that was downloaded everything went smoothly. Another reason for my rating is the program directly using the net, turbo lost my info. This caused an additional three hours of redoing my tax info. With this download the info was always on my computer not all on the net thus little chance of loss. After the info was accepted by the fed and the state I downloaded the info to a storage devise and erased it from my computer. this will prevent hackers the ability to retrieve this info should I be hacked.	1
This is a great tax program that walks you through the whole process. It even saves your info to use again next year.	1
Don't know why I shouldn't expect this... more bugs again this year.  Entered all our Wages and Income data from W-2 forms, Ameritrade 1099s, and a 1098 from the checking account.  Entered the data perfectly and precisely.  Ran Error Check just now and it throws 12 errors.  Starting with Line 12 items from the W-2, which it wants RE-ENTERED, as it thinks THEY ARE NOT THERE.  Then it asks for Line 1 items from the Ameritrade 1099DIV, AS IF IT WERE NOT THERE, and then it asked for the 1098 info AS IF IT WERE NOT THERE.  Re-entered all the requested data, even though I KNEW THIS WAS A BUG IN THE SOFTWARE, and then it throws and error dialog message about a duplicate W-2 form and how I can E-file.  Digging into the Wages and Income section, I can see that the TT Premier software has now created a small DUPLICATE w-2 form, and a small duplicate 1099DIV form, both of which I have to DELETE.  THIS IS CLEARLY A SERIOUS BUG THAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED.  And, at tax time is NOT THE TIME to find out that my expensive copy of TT PREMIER has bugs preventing me from completing an not-very-complex return.  It's a shame, too, as the software otherwise would have gotten perfect marks.  I WELCOME A REPLY FROM THE TT MANAGER WHO READS THESE REVIEWS ON THIS BUG AND WHAT THEY ARE DOING ABOUT IT.	-1
Have been using Turbo Tax for years.  I always do my taxes for myself and family and friends.  I once tried HR Block and did not come close years ago.  Why change company when I have been satisfied year after year.	1
I have been using TurboTax since 2000 to do my federal and state income taxes. It is an easy, relatively fast, and accurate method to get them done.	1
I've been using TurboTax for around 20 years. I like how it easily imports data from previous years and the walk-through interview as I'm compiling my return simplifies the process.  As long as the cost of TT remains reasonable I will continue using it.  I just wish the cost included Efile of the state return.  I'm too cheap to spend the additional $19.95 and so I spend 75-cents or so in postage and mail it in.	1
I have been using TurboTax for decades.  As the years progressed, Intuit continued to make improvements.  This program provides all the forms needed to complete your tax filing - federal and state - and clear guidance on how your information must be presented.  If you are using TurboTax for the first time, you will need to enter your personal identification information; in subsequent years, the next TurboTax edition will import it for you. You can also have TurboTax import all your major financial data directly from the institutions where you have funds - employers, banks, brokerages, and mutual funds.  I find that with my mutual funds, the data imported will be inserted in the appropriate places by TurboTax - complete with breakdowns by short and long term investments, withdrawals, etc. If you use Quicken as your accounting tool (probably also with QuickBooks) and dutifully mark every expenditure with the appropriate tax category, TurboTax will import that data as well. I am meticulous in keeping track of my medical mileage (we have a lot of it) and charitable donations, which must be entered manually.  TurboTax walks you through any donations of household goods or services you made to charities such as Habitat for Humanity using a form that includes the IRS allowable deduction for each item, then summarizes them for submission on your tax form. All of the required information is copied directly into the state forms, with only a few questions necessary for each individual state's requirements. There is no cost for e-filing for your federal taxes; there is a small charge for the state filing.	1
As usual, the product downloads and installs without any problem.  The tax software itself is perfect for anyone with simple or complex investment tax situations, including the dreaded K-1's.  Very detail-oriented software with plenty of online support.	1
I have used TurboTax for the last 6 years. I wouldn't think of doing my income taxes with any other software, or paying anyone else to do it for me either. This is the best product on the market hands down. I will never use another software other than TurboTax. Very easy to follow instructions if exploring on your own, and even easier if you let the software guide you. Love it and you will too!	1
Price could be a little bit better but have used it consistently for many years. It could be a little more user friendly.	1
... It does do the job and it does the job pretty well. I am not a person who understands finances and taxation very well and I have a reasonably complex tax situation with stock and a foreign bank account. I'm consistently surprised by how easily TurboTax walks me through everything and gives me links to more explanation when I need it. For the price, I think it's absolutely worth it, and indeed critical for me to do my taxes. I can't give this 5 stars as it's more a necessary evil, than a desired purchase, but it's something I will continue to use.	1
I have used TurboTax for many years.  This years is working very well.  Easy to use.  The only difficult process is when you want to go back and change or check an already filled in topic.	1
Turbo Tax is easy to use and asks questions to cover all topics. It explains all sections in great detail.	1
I've been using Turbo Tax for the last 5 years for my federal and state filings.  I have always used the web version except for this year that I decided to purchase the downloadable desktop version.  The reason for the switch was simply because  I wanted to take advantage of a discount offer that was not available for the web or any other version.  Transferring last years' return should have been more straightforward.  I was expecting a transparent transfer of last's years data, since it comes from the same company (intuit), regardless of where the data was stored, but it required me to start filing the 2013 form on the web, then loading 2012's data into the 2013 form, exporting the 2013 data into a file and finally importing this file manually into the desktop application version. I was able to figure this out, but only after searching through the intuit web site, and following a user-posted workaround procedure, not intuit's.  I probably understand the security and technical reasons behind this, but I can also see the headache's for less technically-inclined users going through the same situation.  I took one star out for the reasons mentioned above.  In the end, the actual filing process was smoother than with the web version.  The software responded more quickly to my inputs and clicks, and I didn't hesitate going back to make adjustments or corrections to the different forms.  With the web version you can get confused when navigating the application; sometimes the browser's back button is not the correct option to go back to a previous section and it gets a little stressful.  I had an overall positive experience with this product and recommend it for new users.  Just make sure that this is the correct version for you.	1
Some years I have problems installing or getting the updates to work.  But this year everything went just right.  Even my import from Quicken went without a hitch.  it is a beautiful thing when the import from Quicken matches the statement from my broker to the penny.  Printing copies both on paper and to a .pdf file went very well.  Maybe part of all this ease of use was related to the fact that I did NOT import last year's data in.  I started basically with a fresh install and didn't import the TurboTax file from last year.  It all did seem a lot cleaner.  Of course as others have noted do be prepared to spend an additional 19.95 to e-file with your home State.  Also, the 10% added to an Amazon gift card is a really nice bonus.  If you're going to spend money on Amazon anyway you might as well get a free 10% bonus for doing so.  I allocated $600 of my return for an amazon gift card which became $660 with the bonus.  I'll update this review if anything goes wrong with that process.	1
I have used TurboTax for many years (and reviewed some previous versions).  I like it - it does the job for me and I'm done with my taxes in two short evenings.  I have a fairly simple situation, with only a home, some investments, and one dependent, so I bought the Deluxe version (which by the way is cheaper here at Amazon than directly from Intuit!).  One note -- yes I have investments and Intuit recommends their Premium (more expensive) version for that.  But you can still file your investment expenses/gains (or any other form, really) with the Deluxe version.  The only thing you are buying with the higher versions is the "Help" videos and files that walk you through rental properties, stock purchases/sales, etc.  If you are confident with your knowledge of the forms needed, and especially if you filed those same forms last year and can see what you filled in last year, then you don't need to pay for the higher version.  Even if you do find out you need the help, you can consult with Intuit help online or in their community forums.  And if that doesn't work for you, you can always 'upgrade' the software later and it will let you pay the difference to get the extra help.	1
I have used TurboTax for many years.  The Amazon purchase provides easy download and payment at the best available price at the current time in the market. Recommend to others and will buy again next year.	1
Have used TurboTax since they (I believe) bought out Parsons Technology's (a competitor) tax software.  Very user friendly, e.g. offers user the option of being "led" through the process by responding to questions asked by TurboTax, or charting one's own path (for more experienced/knowledgeable users).	1
. I've used&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/H-R-Block-Deluxe/dp/B00G0DXA9Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">H&R Block Deluxe</a>&nbsp;for the last 9 years, but this year I tried Turbo-Tax because I got a deal on it through Vanguard.  H&R Block has always been my choice because:   - It's a great value ($20-$25 for Deluxe Fed + State if you set a price alert and wait a few weeks).  - Good enough for my moderately complex returns.  - Some annoying flaws, but no deal breakers.  Now I think Turbo-Tax is worth the extra $25 for many people.   - The interface is significantly cleaner and easier.  - Guidance is worded with extreme clarity. Less head scratching. Less second-guessing.  If you're preparing multiple returns, or even one return with some curve balls, you might appreciate Turbo-Tax's clearer, friendlier interface.  ~~~ Comments & questions welcome ~~~	1
This is our 15 year using Turbo Tax and have seen very HAPPY. My returns have never been questioned, because TT guides to the best and most honest. Every year TT is improves.	1
I decided to buy on Amazon because I can reload the software from them.  In the past, using a cd, I got into the issues of passwords and codes that I lost and could not reload app.  I have learned that it is best to have several yrs of turbotax application loaded with your files so you can prepare the next year's return. I have had too many occassion to need to reload the software (e.g. when you reload windows, you have to reload applications). It works pretty good.	1
DO YOU NEED TO FILE STATE TAX? Make sure you get a state version if you do, or federal only if you don't.  This review is for TuboTax 2013 Deluxe for Federal Returns. Fortunately I live in Texas and there is no state income tax so I don't have to worry about the state portion.  TurboTax has had its share of issues but I came back to it because it does seem to be the best there is, but I'm knocking off a star because of the history of issues I've had with the program in previous years (like it not calculating tax correctly until I deleted some assets and then re-entered them). However, I was a little shocked to read that it requires 515MB of HD space PLUS up to 1.5GB more if Microsoft .NET 4 if not installed (Mac is only 360MB). Wow! That could be over 2GB of HD to do taxes. How inefficient we have become, bat at least HD space is cheap nowadays.  The system requirements specifically mention Windows XP, Vista, and Windows 7/8 but not Windows 8.1. When I installed it on my Windows 8.1 64-bit machine, installation (mid Jan 2014) seemed to go well without any problems. When it checked for updates, it found 4 updates and they all seemed to install properly... so no major install issues for me (unlike a few years ago).  NOTE: Deluxe will do a Schedule C just fine, but it may not provide as much help as the Home & Business version. If you have been doing taxes yourself for awhile then you might not need to pay the extra money for the additional help.  I will update this review as I continue to use the product.  Pros: * Price includes federal E-File * Overall, probably the best tax program there is * Does not say it works on Windows XP 64-bit (but does with 32-bit XP with SP 3+) (anyone even use XP 64-bit anyway?) * Works on 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Vista and Windows 7/8/8.1 * Deluxe version can do a Schedule C for the self-employed - but it doesn't provide as much guidance as the Home & Business edition * Claims that your return will be accurate, guaranteed* (with some fine print)  Cons: * Not perfect (but how can US taxes ever be perfect)? * Have encountered bugs in previous years that caused me to have to delete and re-enter assets * Might take over 2GB of HD space on Windows according to the system requirements * I'm not happy with the reports I've read indicating saying that Intuit lobbies Congress to keep taxes overly complicated, presumably so they can make more money from sales of their tax software.  WARNING ABOUT THE ONLINE VERSION (DOES NOT APPLY TO DESKTOP VERSION):  * Intuit has removed the ability to do Schedule D and E in TurboTax Online Deluxe (you need Premier) * Intuit has removed the ability to do Schedule C and F in TurboTax Online Deluxe (you need Home & Business)	1
I have been using Turbo Tax since 1986 when the DOS version first came out. It has never let me down. The best thing I like about it is its e-filing capability for both State and Federal. Sure beats going to the post office and standing in line.	1
...TurboTax can help ease the pain.  This is the 15th consecutive year I've used TurboTax for our state and federal returns. Over that time, Intuit has offered some better (and weaker) versions. The 2013 edition is as good as any I've used to date.  If asked to identify those chores that personal computing and online services have helped tame, I wouldn't hesitate to place income tax preparation at the top of the list. Tax time before TurboTax used to be a three-day long parade of headache-inducing calculations, trips to the library for the correct forms, and the pain of the calculations from worksheets and schedules. While my tax situation has been relatively stable from year to year, TurboTax has compressed three days of extended misery over the correctness of my math to a much shorter period of compressed misery over the extent of my tax burden and interpreting IRS instructions. Intuit had rough period in the early 2000s with both privacy and functionality in TurboTax (and a STINGY approach to how many users could prepare taxes from a single copy). Happily, those days are far in the past  This version allows you to prepare and E-File up to five federal returns. Installation was issue free and took less than 10 minutes in a Windows 7 machine (64-bit, Intel i7-3770 CPU @ 3.4 GHZ and 16 GB RAM). Updates since installation have also been painless. Because I had return data from last year's edition on my computer already, our personal data was already filled in, and the program smartly queried about the same sources of income and interest and deductions/credits as last year.  With all of my tax documents at hand, and a moderately complex 1040 filing scenario, I was finished in less than an hour. Other than the fundamental pain that comes with tax time: what's not to like about that?	1
Will not download.  Continues going thru a repair screen, restarts and same thing over again.  Seems to be a Net Framework error, but who knows?  CD worked perfectly last year, but the download is hopeless.  Using Windows XP Home.  Hope the CD will actually work, but don't know at this point.  Would NOT recommend.	-1
This product works and looks as presented, it does the job for which it was intended, that's what it should do.	1
No audit yet...	1
I buy this every year; it's great!	1
H & R Block Software has helped me do my taxes now for at least 10 years. I had a question this year that I couldn't find an answer for and the live chat representative helped me with an answer.	1
East to install.  They will release more updates after the beginning of the year.  But so far, it has been easy to do my taxes and I am just waiting for the final updates.  I have rental properties, sale of stocks, carryover losses, sale of a rental property---and this product handles it all.  I am not sure what the advantage is to purchasing the platinum version.  I have bought it in the past but never have felt that it offered me anything that this version didn't---so I happily save the money.  Highly recommend H&R block tax software.  I have used competitors in the past but didn't feel like they were as user friendly for my situation.	1
The H&R Block software pays for itself every year.  It knows stuff about taxes I don't, but it is also SO easy to use!	1
This software was actually more than I needed since I never needed to go to the separate business app at all.  The premium allowed me to enter all I needed for my small business.  My business is not complicated and I'd done all the work up front with my records so all I had to do was enter the totals.  It would have imported them from Quickbooks automatically so for 2014 I'm using that and next year the tax prep will be even easier.  I used to use TurboTax, but switched a few years ago when they had some problems plus jacked up the price for version that included business.  I was really pleased with H&R Block, finding it clearer and easier to use,  It asked me all the right questions and stepped me through things I wasn't sure of.  I had the whole trauma of both Federal and State taxes done in 3 hours.  I've been very pleased with this software.	1
IT WAS A GIFT.	1
been using this program for several years now love it	1
The forms and data entry are excellent.  Backup is easy and efficient.  There is no problem importing data or last years information.  It is easy to update data that you already entered.  Some of the more obscure forms do not have a data entry panel so one has to deal with the incredibly complicated IRS forms.  Tell congress and the IRS to simplify the tax code!!	1
VERMONTERS DO NOT USE THIS SOFTWARE. Tax Software is suppose to help you complete your taxes accurately. How can you complete your taxes when they don't have all the forms you need? H&R Block does not have the forms necessary to file for a homestead in Vermont and they refuse to correct the problem even after they have been made aware of it. This is a basic form that all Vermonters should file if they owner their home and claim Vermont as their primary residence. I recommend Turbo Tax or Tax Hawk, I have used both in the past and both have the proper forms to declare a homestead. One star is too good a rating for this software.	-1
I've been using H&R Tax Software for the last three years. Before that I used Turbo Tax. I actually like both and have no issues with either. I'm able to get through all my entries easily, and file my taxes with ease.  My situation is simple though, with main work income, interest from savings accounts, and a few dividends and stock sales. I don't deduct much since I don't own a home.  H&R Block Tax Software does a great job of going through every section step-by-step. The program does a great job of providing additional information for any section or question they ask.  The calculations have been accurate for me all three years. I usually file in March, and I also run through other online programs to verify that they calculate the same refund or amount owed.  The program installed easily without any problems on my AMD triple-core PC with 8 GB of RAM. It should install on most computers easily, as long as yours isn't completely outdated. It imported my data from the previous year. And when it was time to file, it did it without any problems. I love this software. I also loved the Turbo Tax software when I was using it years ago. But since H&R Block software has been cheaper, I just pickup this one.  As for the costs, the federal program is included and e-file is also free. The state program is included, but the e-file is what you have to pay for if you do that, and that's usually around twenty.  But you can always print out the forms and send it by mail.	1
I have used their software for many years.  I ordered this by mistake and returned, but used this version last year and works great	1
I've used the H&R Block software for years. This is the first year I bought the business software. The CD actually loads two programs on your PC. The Premium program is similar to the Deluxe and Basic. But the Business program is different. It has its own icon, it keeps documents in a different folder. It's a little less friendly than the Premium/Deluxe in that the interview doesn't seem to hold your hands like the others. I was easily able to create a 1041 return, along with its K-1. I was unable to e-file it. Maybe because I'm not a business. It wanted to know my EFIN for e-filing. I do like that it has unlimited chat support.	1
As a refugee from a horribly broken TurboTax Home & Business experience for my 2012 taxes, I decided to try TaxCut this year, and I am very glad that I did.  For one thing, TaxCut comes with audit protection included. That is, if the IRS comes calling, you will have help.  More importantly, the program is easy to follow, and it works. Updates actually install. They do not break the program and prevent it from running -- my experience last year with TurboTax, which forced me eventually to install the program on an entirely new computer in order to be able to complete the job. An incredible time waster, and frustrating.  TaxCut is relatively inexpensive, and also includes free Federal and State filing.  My one complaint is that there are not enough lines provided for various details, for example charitable gifts and medical expenses. I prefer to have a complete inventory, item by item, in the event there are any questions.  Still, this is an excellent program and a good value.	1
1st off this is one of the last items I will be purchasing from Amazon. They raised their fees so much I might as well keep my local businesses open.  Everything I bought previously is now an average of 20%-30% higher.	-1
I've used H & R Block tax software for over 10 years.  I worked as a tax preparer for 20 years, and this software is as good as the professional software I used.	1
Started using H&R Block product on a MAC in 1988 - kept using it as easy to use product that always gave me the support I needed even for rental properties	1
This is good tax prep software at a decent price (check for sales or discounts). Interview format but you can jump to forms when desired. Links to explanations or additional info when you need it. Imports last year's data and imports tax forms from most major financial service firms. Includes one state program. Five federal e-files included so you can take care of family. On the negative side of things I had issues printing the state returns--it would stall the printer. I was able to work around but it was a hassle. And, other than putting money in H&R Block's pocket why charge for the state e-file? Check out the online tax prep services or free services like AARP's TaxAide, but if if they don't fit your needs, this software should get the job done at a modest price.	1
I have been using this program for years.  It takes appropriate data from the prior year so you don't have to refigure it.  This includes the names of sources of interest and dividends, names of recipients of charitable contributions and adjusted basis of IRAs.  Download of updates is fast.  Watch the price closely and you should be able to get it for around $30.	1
I have been using H&R Block tax software to do my taxes for several years now after using TurboTax once and didn't like it. H&R block, no matter what its name is currently, is a great program to do income taxes. It is easy to read and follow. It isn't a perfect program, but what is, but it does the job it is advertised to do. Until they change the program and make it go downhill, I will continue to use it.  I just wish I didn't have to pay to e-file my state taxes.	1
I find that the software asks all the right questions and gets the job done.  Best of all got it at the usual great price at Amazon.	1
I've been using this tax program for around 8 years and it works great.  They have the best deal on Amazon (even better than the renewal price I get in the mail) so I always order it here every year.  Just remember to get the version that matches your needs since there are several.	1
And H&R Block kept up with the rules and regulations thrown at us each year. Makes doing your taxes a breeze.	1
I've used this tax software for 4 years now and it continues to meet my tax filing needs at a fair price.  I too ran into the install snag that H&R block customer support seemed unable to help me with.  After pressing them harder, I did find a solution that worked, but was more complicated than the suggestions listed here.  They basically had me copy the CD to my desktop, then "run as administrator" when it appears you can do it right from the CD.  E-filing is straightforward and I received my return promptly.  Will use again next year.	1
This software was easy to install and easy to upgrade when the IRS offered several upgrades.  All worked seamlessly.  The interview is direct and complete for most taxpayers, I'd say over 90%.  There are more complex programs for more complex returns but it seems that this one provides the IRS forms for even those returns.	1
I have been using TaxCut/H&R Block for at least 10 years.  It is very straight forward.  Last year I had a unique problem entering some new data for a farm rental property and called they Tech Support group who were very helpful and sorted out the situation.	1
For Years I have loved H&R block but this year has much left to be desired I have had two weeks of Waiting on Call backs from tech support and only half my Taxes have been filed. There tech people are nice but very bad at Fallow through all the money you save on doing at the Store is wasted in time Trying to get all the hidden fees pain and waiting on people to Follow through. DONT BOTHER THEY DONT KNOW HOW TO HELP YOU IF THE SOFTWARE GOES BAD AND THEY NEVER CALL YOU BACK IF YOU NEED THERE HELP THERE GOAL IS TO TAKE YOUR MONEY AND GET YOU OFF THE PHONE AND LEAVE You WITH A MESS TO CLEAN UP	-1

I have used H&R Block (or Tax Cut) for over 10 years.  I got the disk this time and it has installed and updated with no issues.  I am using a Win 7 machine.  I have not finished a return yet (I'm still waiting for many IRS forms, including my W-2), but so far the product looks and feels like the 2012 program, which worked fine.	1
I haven't tried this years yet, but I have used this tax software for years. My last experience, years ago, with TurboTax was that it was loaded with bloatware. In trying to remove the bloatware after doing my taxes, it crashed my computer. I promised myself then to never ever use TurboTax again, and I haven't. H & R Block has always done a super job for me.	1
I have used H&R tax software for at least 15 years and it's very easy to use.  I like that it's by a company that has lots of tax experience as that adds confidence that the calculations are accurate.	1
After spending countless hours trying to get Turbo Tax, which I'd used for about 10 years, to fill in and calculate my taxes correctly, I gave up and bought H&R Block At Home Deluxe + State 3 years ago instead. I've been happy with the software every year since then. The first year I did the online download through Amazon and it went quickly. Installation was straightforward as it is with the actual disc. In fact, the whole process went quickly and it filled in and calculated our taxes. It was able to handle the HSA account info I had for two of the year's accurately and without a glitch. This was what had caused the problem with Turbo. It also took me through itemized deductions, interest and dividends easily.  The interface isn't as graphically appealing as Turbo Tax, but it's easy to use and did my taxes accurately. I was able to download the state version for free and it took less than 5 minutes for it to install, get my info from the federal taxes and fill it out. Both state and federal seemed to go faster with H&R and it was very straightforward. I'll be using H&R Block from now on. H&R has a feature that can get your info from last year's Turbo Tax if you decide to switch over.	1
Use H & R Block (Tax Cut) program every year for well over 10 years! It is reasonably priced and does the job.  It has handled complex tax years and easy tax years for me. As with any tax program you just have to go slow through the questions and answers. If you answer no to a question that should have been yes you may not get the proper forms or part of the return to fill out. If not sure just answer yes and you can by pass the part when it comes up. Overall it makes a complex task easy as long as you do not rush.	1
I used this program because I am comfortable with it.  I can't say if it is any better or worse for anyone else.  I once got a free copy of Turbo Tax after doing my tax return and had enough confidence to not bother to see if the more expensive Turbo Tax produced any different results.  Most of us do not have very complicated tax returns but using a program like this reduces math errors.	1
I've used H&R Block's tax software (formerly called TaxCut) every year since 1995. Several times when I saw a promotional deal I purchased both TaxCut and TurboTax to compare. I found that TurboTax did not do anything better than TaxCut while costing consistently more.   INSTALLATION ~~~~~~~~~~~~~  If you encounter issues with display, such as not seeing selection boxes, check your screen resolution. Both Windows and Mac minimum requirement for the screen resolution is 1024 x 768 pixels or higher. At a lower resolution H&R Block software will have problem with display such as not properly displaying selection boxes. Screen resolution can be changed on your control panel by change PC's display settings.   If you are using a digital download you will need a key-code to install the software after you download it. The key-code can be located two ways. Option 1: After my download finished the install started automatically offering me a choice of two links "View Keys" and "Install". When I selected view key-code after a fairly long pause it displayed my key-code in a browser window. Option 2: You can locate it in your Amazon account: 1) Log into Amazon 2) Select Your Account at the top right of the page 3) Select Games and Software downloads which is towards the bottom of the long page you see when you log in 4) Then under H&R software entry you will see the key-code that you need to enter to unlock the software   Does H&R allow to install the software on two PCs? I found the answer on H&R Block web site FAQ under the topic "Installing Software on Another Computer"  I quote the FAQ answer below: "There are just a few steps necessary to re-install the H&R Block At Home program from the CD you received in the mail. Follow the steps below to re-install the program or install it on a second computer. Insert the H&R Block At Home CD into your computer. Click the Need to Re-install? link on the menu bar at the bottom of the screen. The Frequently Asked Questions page will open to the first FAQ titled, "Can I install the software on a second computer?" Enter your activation code and last 4 digits of the credit card you used to purchase the program initially and click Activate. You can find your activation code in your purchase confirmation e-mail. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation."   WHAT IS INCLUDED ~~~~~~~~~~~~~  I purchased a digital download version of H&R Block Deluxe plus State. The Federal portion of these two packages is identical, so I am cross posting my review of the Federal portion of the software for both packages .  H&R Block Deluxe entitles you to 5 free federal e-files. You can print and mail as many returns as you want, there is no limit on printing.   GENERAL ~~~~~~~~~~~~~  I just finished my preliminary tax return and below are my observations. Note: the forms are not final until January 9, 2014.   H&R Block starts the interview process with an annoying up-sell pitch, recommending an upgrade from Deluxe to Premium even when it is not necessary. In my opinion, they should wait until the person enters this year's data and suggest the upgrade only if there is something about the return that can benefit from the Premium version. That would have been useful.  What is the difference between Premium and Deluxe? The Premium version offers advanced tools for self-employed and rental property owners: cost basis of home sales, dividends, gifts, and inheritance assets. It has advanced schedule C guidance to maximize deductions for self-employment income. And finally it has guidance for rental property income and expenses. The rest of the Premium package is the same as Deluxe.  Note that the Deluxe package has support for self-employed income as well as stock sale cost basis calculations. Last year I had to do both and I found the guidance in Deluxe package was sufficient to complete the forms.   Pet Peeve: Help is not context sensitive. For example, when you click on "learn more" about a particular topic the general help window opens but it does not show help topics for the specific topic that you were working on. Instead you need to search and know which key words to use locate the relevant topics.   H&R Block provides you some guidance for completing Form 1116 (foreign tax credit, for example foreign tax paid by mutual funds). However, you need to keep switching between whole-form view to enter data and then back to interview to read the instructions. Even though the form where you can enter data is visible at the same time as instructions you cannot enter data into it until you switch into whole-form view. This is cumbersome, but at least there is some guidance for this form.   DeductionPro (which helps you put value on your charitable donations) is integrated into H&R Block software running on your local PC. You no longer need to enter this information on H&R web site. I prefer having this information locally on my PC for better security. The change from web site to local PC was introduced last year and I was happy to see that this change is here to stay.   I don't use the default location for the tax returns due to how I set up my backup software. The H&R Block software does not initially remember this new location on the second start of the application, it told me I have no returns. I needed to pick the return manually from the File menu, as it did remember recently used files. The third time I started the software, it finally knew the location of the tax return file.   I use large font option on my monitor display and in the past years had display issues on some forms (text boxes were display overlapping each other on some forms). This year all forms displayed properly.   I usually purchase tax software as early as possible to help me with end year tax planning. However, if timing is not important to you be aware that the price on this package changes often and you can catch some great discounts. I use a nice tool that shows history of Amazon prices. If you enter "Amazon price history alert" in Google it will come up at the top, my favorite has the word camel in the name. You can set up the tool to send you an alert when you desired price drop is reached. During the last tax year season the price fluctuated between $20 and the list price of $44.99, and was on the gold deal special a couple of times.   At the end of the interview process there is a check step (which you can run at any time, but the interview ends with this check). This step flags problems (e.g. missing information) and potential audit alerts (e.g. unusual deductions) with red flags, and reminders (e.g. things you marked tentative) with yellow flags.   Does H&R has the ability to import TurboTax data from previous years? Yes. TurboTax files have a .tax extension. Use the Browse button within H&R Block application to navigate to the folder you need and it will import the data from TT return.   Update: Several people asked me via comments if Schedule C is included in Deluxe edition because it is not explicitly mentioned in the description.  Schedule C form is included and covered in the interview.  I have been a H&R Block/TaxCut user for many years. I keep coming back because it works well for the tax forms I need to do and it is less expensive than TurboTax. If you have a question I have not covered leave a comment and I will do my best to answer it.  Ali Julia review	1
About six years ago I went to a tax adviser, sat there with my files, and answered all their questions while they typed the information into a form on their computer.  I then paid them $150.  Afterwards, I thought to myself, "I can do that."  I've tried both TurboTax and H&R Block, and am a full fledged fan of H&R Block.  Why?  This past year 2013 is really what sold me.  My taxes were a little more complex than usual due to some stock options I exercised.  I decided to try their online assistance.  It took about ten minutes for me to connect (this was mid-March), and once I did the agent on the other end was extremely helpful and patient.  I even commented during our online chat session that due to my circumstances, I should probably go and see a consultant in person.  The response was something along the lines of "you're welcome to do that and I can show you how to contact an H&R Block representative in your area, but I'm sure I can help you here..."  And, they were absolutely correct.  My questions were answered and my concerns were resolved.  All of this was via an easy click on a link from the software.  The questions are straight forward as you fill out the forms, and the process is very easy.  I get a fairly good comfort level when using this software for my taxes...I just don't see the need to make a switch.  Great service, great support if you need it, and much cheaper and more convenient than going to someone's office.	1
The basic program is good. Had an issue with Schedule K-1 for which I had to manually access the form and fix.	1
I attempted to install the H&R Block software from the DVD into my Windows 8 PC. After repeated unsuccessful attempts, I called H&R Blocks help desk, and after the usual "Reboot and try again" solution, the help desk agent sent me a link to download a working copy of the installation software.  Once installed, the software did a good job of leading me through the Federal 1040 Tax return. The program offered to help me prepare the State tax return, but I did not pay for it, so I declined. I then went to use the IL state tax web site to complete my state tax return. It recommended H&R Block's online state tax software. When I tried to use that software, it would not let me start until I first completed the Online Federal return. It could not figure out that I already completed my Federal 1040 return.  So I went directly to the State of IL e-file web site and tried to use their online system. That appeared to work until I tried to print the completed return. The online program froze and discarded my return.  Next year, I think I will just go to a local H&R Block tax preparer and save all th ehassle.	1
I invest at Betterment. COM, where I made two sales and once changed my stock/bond percentages. To me that was 3 transactions, but to H&R Block  and the IRS it's at least sixty, maybe a hundred. The program downloads that information from Betterment -- no problem! But then it FORCES me to "confirm" every one of them individually. That means clicking "edit" next to each one that has an exclamation point (all of them) and click "Next" anywhere from two to five times, depending.  There's no effin' way I can actually CONFIRM all those details -- I have to trust Betterment. But H&R Block does not, so it will take an hour or two to do what's supposed to be "automatic". All of this for a total of $97 in capital gains and $5 in disallowed short sales.  What a load.  (Added comments below)  The result was MUCH WORSE than I thought -- 29 pages x 12 transactions per page on Schedule D and 19 pages x 14 per page on form 8949 -- for a total of close to 600 entries.  After "confirming" each transaction, H&R Block brought me back to the top of the list, where I had to scroll down, down, down, down, down (yawn), down, down, down to find a transaction not yet "confirmed". This made an annoying situation even worse.  There should have been just ONE check box to confirm ALL these downloaded transactions at once.	-1
I my self have used WEBROOT for more than a few Years on Windows XP, VISTA, 7, 8.1, 10 to present windows 10 new update to version1607... WEBROOT works great for me!!! NO Trouble at all...I used NORTON : (  and don't like Norton ad Not A fan of Norton used more than a few times The Free Version of Norton Is GREAT!!! but the one you Pay for YUCK!!! it uses to much space on your Hard drive and at times lock you off being able get online and ties the computer up...	1
One hour hold time to speak with tech support, unacceptable, and the software seems buggy	-1
love it ,thank you !	1
I bought this to install on my 2 computers. Neither computer would accept and install. I called WEBROOT support. I was informed that my Internet network connection was not secured and that it would cost me hundreds of dollars for them to fix. I would then be able to install this software. I said no thank you and called my ISP, ATT. They told me that my Internet network connection was indeed secure. I've since installed Microsoft Security Essentials. The cost: $0.00. Other people I know that use this say that it works great. One person thinks this is a tool MS uses to track down hackers.	-1
i'd think twice before ya'll buy webroots software, it's not even rated in the top 10 for internet security suites !	-1
Doubled ordered . I am so lame.	1
Webroot is a great product and it replace my Aunt Norton 360. She has since bought a new computer and is using a product that was included free for 1 year.	1
Soi Far , so Good.  Have not had a virus since Webroot was installed and I had some from Nortons, as well as McAfee. IN Fact a person claiming he was an employee from McAfee stole $5,100.00( Pay Pal claims)from my p[ay Pal account.  That's when I removed the others and instaledl Webroot.  So far, so good.  Recommended.	1
Where do I begin with their lies and deception?  1) Small size on HD! Not true. ALL of the data hides in programdata/WRData and can baloon up to 50, even 100GIGS on your hard drive. Even quickly filling your SSD's.. Webroot takes up the most HD space of any AV. 2) Small footprint! NOT true. Webroot rides on the SYSTEM process in windows. Often ballooning the system process to 500% over normal. This bogs everything down and is a deception by Webroot who claims it's an 'old bug' (claiming this for 5 years) 3) Advanced technology! Not true. It's a simple karma/reputation and whitelist/blacklist app. It tosses your unknown stuff in a sandbox monitoring it. This requires constant tickets to support for whitelisting with EVERY new version of EVERY software.  Webroot is a product no serious security/IT person would ever deploy. It's a joke!	-1
We're on our second year of Webroot and just grabbed this to replace my dad's McAfee, talk about a power hungry night mare antivirus software I would never use McAfee or recommend it to anyone.	1
Best antivirus out there.  Luv that it does most of the scans and stuff for u.  Most people never remember to manually run them.	1
Lightweight and thorough so far.	1
Another great webroot software at a great price.	1
just can't like it.	-1
That was fast! Ordered on-line and within minutes got the download and license. Installed it without any problems. Installed it on my laptop, my son's desktop and daughter's laptop with the license code.	1

Works behind the scenes and have had no virus issues. Was a little difficult to get all the old Norton stuff off. Caused some problems until it found it all.	1
Doubled ordered . I am so lame.	1
Used it for years. Great anti virus.	1
This purchase was for my 2nd year using Webroot, to renew my subscription.  I have found the program to work well. It is effective, fast and does not hog system resources or annoy me by trying to make itself too helpful.  It just does what it is supposed to do.  I got this download because it is half the price of renewing a subscription online directly with Webroot. I use Windows 10 and based on the advice given by another reviewer, did not bother installing this version but instead entered the security key I received with my purchase. That worked perfectly and everything is running like it did before, which is to say very well.  Only "complaint" is that I am getting reminders from Webroot telling me my subscription is expired and I need to renew right away. But on my computer it is up and running.	1
Webroot seems to work fine on my Mac computer.  I have decided to use Windows Defender on my Dell PC with Win 10.  I'm glad that Windows is finally giving its customers some help  with the awful problem of spyware and malware.   Webroot seems to respond reliably to e-mail questions and they have an good Threat Blog.    Get a Mac!	1
Would not recognize my registered email, and turn off all saved passwords in firefox browser. Uninstalled bought another anti virus software. What a wasted $20	-1
Over the years I've run the gamut of anti-virus software from venerable companies like Norton and McAfee to lesser known brands like Trend Micro and Kaspersky. With my latest subscription to McAfee coming due I was looking for a change. Don't get me wrong, overall I think the McAfee product did exactly what I'd hoped it would do - keep my PCs relatively safe and free from malware. However, the well documented trade-offs had finally worn me down to the point that I was constantly annoyed with McAfee's impacts to system performance and constant interruptions.  I've been using Webroot AV 2016 for two full months and I really like this software. Compared to similar products from McAfee, Norton, and Trend the Webroot AV product is incredibly lightweight. There is a systemic "minimalist" approach to this software that extends from the installation of the product to running scans and to system performance. Webroot has seemingly listened to the legions of AV users who complain repeatedly about the same things - intrusive, bloated AV software stinks. So the emphasis with Webroot is speed.  Overall I'm pleased with the product. It's extremely fast and probably the least intrusive AV program I've ever uses. Based on my limited testing and research Webroot seems to perform quite well at detecting and stopping intrusive known malware. The key here is known. In several reviews I've read the Achilles heel of this software seems to be it's performance in detecting zero-day malware or otherwise unknown/new malware that hasn't had time to make it into known malware definitions. Most AV programs scan the host for indicators that zero-day threats are present. In this regard it seems Webroot doesn't perform quite as well and significantly lags other major AV companies.  So there remains a trade-off even with Webroot. Ultimately decide what's best for your machines and household based on your use. Certainly I wouldn't recommend this software to everyone. However, paired with individual good security practices and awareness of threats I think Webroot can be a great software.	1

Highly effective AV	1

This requires constant tickets to support for whitelisting with EVERY new version of EVERY software. 4) Webroot hires former NSA spooks. Google it. Their top guy is NSA. The founder was found tossed over a cliff. 5) Webroot support is pretty good - UNTIL you have a real problem. Then they ignore you, for months. 6) TripleHelix is a known disinformation agent, Webroot fanboy, and forum disruption agent that's been banned from countless forums.  Webroot is a product no serious security/IT person would ever deploy. It's a joke!	-1
Works quietly in the background and so far has not interrupted or slowed my work on a Win 7 desktop. Has identified both suspicious email content and online prompts.  So far no false alarms.	1
Good product, good price, although sometimes a pain to download. If that happens, call Webroot support, they helped me in 10 minutes, when Amazon customer support couldn't help in 2 hours. They really tried, I will say.	1
Will not install. There are no instructions on how to return it, and their website in laughable. Also you are not allowed to return it. Never again. Product support blames other software.	-1
Very light on PC resources, effective and fast.  Like the fact that I can have it clean all temp files and browser history overnight along with many other settings.  I set it to do a virus/malware scan nightly at 1 AM.  Very easy to install and use.	1
I have tried for a week to get this key code started.  I used Webroot last year and found it fine for what I needed.  I tried to extend my Webroot android protection and have had nothing but failure.  The website will not let me update my old key code because it says that my old key code in invalid (yeah I know that) but, then it will not let me change the key code because the email address that I use is associated with the old key code.  Anyway, this has been a do loop created by Webroot that sends me to URLs "not found", logs me out of the verification page before I can put in the security code, and the help function also sent me off into ether land - an email that would get back to me - two days ago.  I have bought another package and I have learned a lesson about Webroot.  What a waste of time and money.	-1
Doesn't take up a lot of memory, and downloads fast. It is effective, but sometimes malware gets through. The Amazon download price is the best deal.	1
This has worked well so far and is not heavy or intrusive. Had a few glitches with overstretch on a few files that were not a problem. But, that was once and haven't seen that again. Impressed by its lack of trouble and yet its protection level is fine.	1
Works seamlessly.  Does not seem to tie up resources.	1

So far so good, I've been running SecureAnywhere AntiVirus 3 for a little over a month now. When I first installed it, it actually picked up on something my previous, expired antivirus (Avira) missed. No slow down or performance issues. No obnoxious interference with my regular online activity, which is good because I go to school online and a big part of my job is online. I doubt it blocks the NSA but other than that, for the price, this software does what I expect it to do without getting in the way.	1
One hour hold time to speak with tech support, unacceptable, and the software seems buggy	-1
Okay	1
So far it seems to be working but only bee a month.	1
I started using Web-root after reading some reviews and comparing antivirus programs. Web-root IMHO is one of the best. It uses few resources operates in a cloud and after installing my ssid drive on my desktop with windows 7 it runs a full scan in 15 seconds. On my slower laptop with newly installed ssid drive it runs in 1.16 minutes. It also has a firewall that runs with windows firewalls and can be setup to your liking. The price here at Amazon is the best and you can't go wrong with this software. Install it and you will never notice it is on until or unless an ad-ware or infection tries to enter your computer. It works great for me and I wouldn't use anything else at this time.	1
Worked fine! I simply downloaded the file and installed it. I put in the CD Key and that was it! I bought the 5 PC edition so I could install it on my wife's laptop, and the three teens at home. I really like Webroot because it does not use a lot of hard drive space, and runs smoothly in the background and you don't even notice it. I have it installed on both Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 - no problems!	1
I really like Webroot.  It does an excellent job protecting against attacks, does not impede the PC performance and will run a scan faster than anything else I have tried.  It will find some residual issues on the first run and after this it does a fantastic job protecting the PC.  I have it installed on my home desktop, laptop as well as the PC's for my wife and two son's.  That's a lot of web time and we have never had any issues with our PC's.  It proactively protects against threats and if anything should land on your PC, it will be pretty benign and the scan will pick it up quickly, clean it completely and do it all it the background.  Good product - I just renewed for 2016.	1
I guess it works	1

Webroot SecureAnywhere Internet Security has become my favorite for my Windows PCs over the past two years.  So much so that I recommended it to my step-father, knowing that I'd be the one installing it on his PCs after he made the purchase on Amazon.  INSTALLATION:  Download went smoothly (as expected) and then it was time to install the software on (5) Windows PCs running XP, Windows 7 64-bit, Windows 8 and two running 8.1 as an operating system.  All of the installs went off without a hitch and Webroot SecureAnywhere  is running quietly in the background.  FIRST SCANS:  On the XP PC the first scan snagged several virus'.  This PC had formerly been using AVG Free.  On the Windows 8 PC it had been using AVAST Free, and the first scan with Webroot found a virus.  On the two Windows 8.1 PCs which both had trial versions; one of Norton and one of Kaspersky, no virus' were found upon the initial scan with Webroot.  On the Windows 7 PC no virus' were found.  It had been using Webroot SecureAnywhere 2013; subscription had just run out.  WHY GET THIS SOFTWARE?  1. 'Always on' protection for enhanced internet security on all your devices. 2. No need to mess with it once it's installed. 3. Protects against virus', malware, phishing, identity theft, cybe rcrime, social network threats, and unsafe websites. 4. Warns before you click! 5. Manages passwords for you. 6. 25GB of FREE online storage across your (5) devices is included. 7. Protection on Facebook and Twitter. 8. System analysis to detect system issues. 9. Can wipe history and make deleted files unrecoverable. 10 Automatically scans Android apps and downloads. 11. Can remotely lock and wipe data from smartphones and tablets, and help to locate stolen devices. 12. GREAT price for protecting all that on (5) devices for 1 year!  I use it, and I recommend it!  SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Operating Systems  For Windows...  Microsoft XP 32 and 64-bit SP2, SP3 Windows Vista 32 (all editions), SP1, SP2 32 and 64-bit Windows 7 32 and 64-bit all editions, SP1 32 and 64 bit all editions.

I WILL NEVER DOWNLOAD THIS INTRUSIVE SOFTWARE EVER AGAIN. TECH SUPPORT IS UNRESPONSIVE OR IRRELEVANT TO MY PROBLEM. DON'T BUY THIS.	-1
I started using Webroot last year.  It's my favorite security software.  It downloads and installs with no problems, works completely unnoticed in the background, and always catches any virus that shows up.  It also scans and cleans up your PC super quick.  The only time it seeks your attention is when it detects a virus, detects a webpage that may be trouble, or when your subscription has less than 30 days left.  I never pay full price for it, and never will for any security software.	1
The Best do-it yourself Tax Software	1
Love all H&R Block Tax Products.  I get my taxes done in 1/3 the time, even with self employment.  I feel confident that the regular updates keep you safe with your Federal and State taxes.  I file with confidence that I won't be flagged for an audit, unless I ignore the suggestions made by the software.	1
On an Inspiron 15R running Windows 8 I inserted the DVD in the drive and nothing happened.  I went to file manager, saw the DVD, and double clicked on it.  I told it to install and shortly received the message "failure to install".  The solution that worked was to right click on TCAUTO in file manager.  One of the options this gives is to run as system administrator.  When this option is selected the installation proceeds without any problem.  I have not run the program but will update this review when I do.	1
I've used H&R Block's tax software (formerly called TaxCut) every year since 1995. Several times when I saw a promotional deal I purchased both TaxCut and TurboTax to compare. I found that TurboTax did not do anything better than TaxCut while costing consistently more.   INSTALLATION ~~~~~~~~~~~~~  If you encounter issues with display, such as not seeing selection boxes, check your screen resolution. Both Windows and Mac minimum requirement for the screen resolution is 1024 x 768 pixels or higher. At a lower resolution H&R Block software will have problem with display such as not properly displaying selection boxes. Screen resolution can be changed on your control panel by change PC's display settings.   If you are using a digital download you will need a key-code to install the software after you dowload it.  The key-code can be located two ways. Option 1: After my download finished the install started automatically offering me a choice of two links "View Keys" and "Install". When I selected view key-code after a fairly long pause it displayed my key-code in a browser window. Option 2: You can locate it in your Amazon account: 1) Log into Amazon 2) Select Your Account at the top right of the page 3) Select Games and Software downloads which is towards the bottom of the long page you see when you log in 4) Then under H&R software entry you will see the key-code that you need to enter to unlock the software   Does H&R allow to install the software on two PCs? I found the answer on H&R Block web site FAQ under the topic "Installing Software on Another Computer" I quote the FAQ answer below: "There are just a few steps necessary to re-install the H&R Block At Home program from the CD you received in the mail. Follow the steps below to re-install the program or install it on a second computer. Insert the H&R Block At Home CD into your computer. Click the Need to Re-install? link on the menu bar at the bottom of the screen. The Frequently Asked Questions page will open to the first FAQ titled, "Can I install the software on a second computer?" Enter your activation code and last 4 digits of the credit card you used to purchase the program initially and click Activate. You can find your activation code in your purchase confirmation e-mail. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation."   WHAT IS INCLUDED ~~~~~~~~~~~~~  I purchased a digital download version of H&R Block Deluxe plus State. This version entitles you to 5 free federal e-files.  You can print and mail as many returns as you want, there is no limit on printing.  One state software is included in the package but the package does NOT include free e-file for the state return (see one exception below). If you want to e-file  your state return you will need to pay a fee of $19.95 to e-file each state return. Alternatively, you can print all the forms and mail them using US post office.  If you need to file taxes for an additional state, each additional state is $39.95 plus $19.95 e-file fee.  Ouch!  Note: NY state residents can e-file state returns for free.   GENERAL ~~~~~~~~~~~~~  I just finished my preliminary tax return and below are my observations. Note: the forms are not final until January 9, 2014.   H&R Block starts the interview process with an annoying up-sell pitch, recommending an upgrade from Deluxe to Premium even when it is not necessary. In my opinion, they should wait until the person enters this year's data and suggest the upgrade only if there is something about the return that can benefit from the Premium version.  That would have been useful.  What is the difference between Premium and Deluxe? The Premium version offers advanced tools for self-employed and rental property owners: cost basis of home sales, dividends, gifts, and inheritance assets. It has advanced schedule C guidance to maximize deductions for self-employment income. And finally it has guidance for rental property income and expenses. The rest of the Premium package is the same as Deluxe.  Note that the Deluxe package has support for self-employed income as well as stock sale cost basis calculations. Last year I had to do both and I found the guidance in Deluxe package was sufficient to complete the forms.   Pet Peeve: Help is not context sensitive. For example, when you click on "learn more" about a particular topic the general help window opens but it does not show help topics for the specific topic that you were working on. Instead you need to search and know which key words to use locate the relevant topics.   H&R Block provides you some guidance for completing Form 1116 (foreign tax credit, for example foreign tax paid by mutual funds). However, you need to keep switching between whole-form view to enter data and then back to interview to read the instructions. Even though the form where you can enter data is visible at the same time as instructions you cannot enter data into it until you switch into whole-form view. This is cumbersome, but at least there is some guidance for this form.   DeductionPro (which helps you put value on your charitable donations) is integrated into H&R Block software running on your local PC.  You no longer need to enter this information on H&R web site.  I prefer having this information locally on my PC for better security.  The change from web site to local PC was introduced last year and I was happy to see that this change is here to stay.   I don't use the default location for the tax returns due to how I set up my backup software. The H&R Block software does not initially remember this new location on the second start of the application, it told me I have no returns. I needed to pick the return manually from the File menu, as it did remember recently used files. The third time I started the software, it finally knew the location of the tax return file.   I use large font option on my monitor display and in the past years had display issues on some forms (text boxes were display overlapping each other on some forms). This year all forms displayed properly.   I usually purchase tax software as early as possible to help me with end year tax planning. However, if timing is not important to you be aware that the price on this package changes often and you can catch some great discounts. I use a nice tool that shows history of Amazon prices. If you enter "Amazon price history alert" in Google it will come up at the top, my favorite has the word camel in the name. You can set up the tool to send you an alert when you desired price drop is reached.  During the last tax year season the price fluctuated between $20 and the list price of $44.99, and was on the gold deal special a couple of times.   For folks trying to download State Forms. The state forms are not available as of 11/17/2013. You have an option of entering email where you will be notified as soon as the form for your state becomes available. Alternatively, you can go to H&R website, click on "Download Software" on the top banner, and select "State Editions".  Currently it says "Available in January 2014".  When the state forms will become available they can be downloaded by selecting the State Tab and then clicking on the button labelled "Buy" (a little scary since we already paid for it) but then "buy" will turn into "update" and the forms will be downloaded to your computer.   At the end of the interview process there is a check step (which you can run at any time, but the interview ends with this check). This step flags problems (e.g. missing information) and potential audit alerts (e.g. unusual deductions) with red flags, and reminders (e.g. things you marked tentative) with yellow flags.   Update: To post an answer to a good question asked via a comment:  Does H&R has the ability to import TurboTax data from previous years?  Yes. TurboTax files have a .tax extension. Use the Browse button within H&R Block application to navigate to the folder you need and it will import the data from TT return.   Update: Several people asked me via comments if Schedule C is included in Deluxe edition because it is not explicitly mentioned in the description.  Schedule C form is included and covered in the interview.  I have been a H&R Block/TaxCut user for many years.  I keep coming back because it works well for the tax forms I need to do and it is less expensive than TurboTax. If you have a question I have not covered leave a comment and I will do my best to answer it.  Ali Julia review	1
great product	1
Received as promised	1
Never had a problem with any of the H&R Block tax software versions including this one.	1
I bought this software to do my taxes when it was still on CD.  Then they came out with this online download version.  I went for that too.  H&R Block is really, really easy to use.  I swear, I think a 10 year old could fill in the information properly because it's almost impossible to make a mistake with the way H&R Block lays out the questions they ask, which decide what you need to do or provide as information.  And, I love that then, in successive years, they give a comparison sheet that print out with your taxes, showing the differences in certain categories for the last few years vs. the current year.  And, of course, once it's filed (I e-file it), you can still pull it up any time you need it again to print out or to get information for whatever purpose.  In fact, I think the IRS has recommended it on their website from time to time, although the IRS does not actually endorse any specific tax prep. people or software.  That would not be ethical, I guess.	1
It worked great.	1
Use it every year. works great for me.	1
have used h&r block for past 7 years with absolutely no issues. the program is just as accurate with it's calculations as all the other programs and imports from most money software.	1
I have used H&R Block tax software for several years. This tax year (2013) was no exception. I rated it four stars because of a couple of reasons. Once when I clicked "back" it did not return to the previous screen but carried me back to the beginning of that particular section. Then, I had to forward through several screens to get to where I wanted to go. The second thing I don't like is that each time you load the program it does a lengthy search for "notifications." It would be nice if it recognized that you had the latest updates and opened more quickly. Overall I would recommend it and will probably buy it again next year.	1
I've been using H&R Block software for several years and have been doing my own taxes all my life.  When I think back to the early years when my returns were simple, those returns still took longer to prepare than my current ones.  And my returns today are considerably more complicated (as are the tax laws).  Yet, with H&R Block tax software, I not only can effortlessly prepare my taxes, but I also can relax knowing that I've not made a simple, perhaps stupid mistake, since the software will catch those.  It certainly can save you from having to file a 1040X as I had to do once or twice many years ago to correct one of my errors.  I've tried other software in the past but H&R Block's seems to require much less effort on my part and is much easier and more instinctive to use.	1
Easy install and automatic update to latest updates from H&R Block web site.  Interview approach is relatively easy to follow and complete return.  Requires some knowledge of tax regulations for more complex returns since interview does not provide sufficient explanation for all areas.  Can complete state return but must pay additional to electronically file state.  Can print state for mail-in to avoid additional significant electronic filing fee.	1
This is a very good product at a price much lower than the other "big" tax preparation software company.  I don't have a complicated return but I am sure that this product will stand should to shoulder to the more expensive brand.	1
VERMONTERS DO NOT USE THIS SOFTWARE. Tax Software is suppose to help you complete your taxes accurately. How can you complete your taxes when they don't have all the forms you need? H&R Block does not have the forms necessary to file for a homestead in Vermont and they refuse to correct the problem even after they have been made aware of it. This is a basic form that all Vermonters should file if they owner their home and claim Vermont as their primary residence. I recommend Turbo Tax or Tax Hawk, I have used both in the past and both have the proper forms to declare a homestead. One star is too good a rating for this software.	-1
I remember the bad old days with columns of figures on paper, stacks of receipts, files full of records, a calculator, and a "working 1040 form". I'd come across a missed receipt and erase and change numbers on two different forms and three different pages. It was hard work and took a very long time.  This program makes that process easy. Find an extra $40 receipt? Add $40 to one place and all the things that need to change update through your return.  But the real strength are the wizards that take you through more complicated deductions. Rather than reading lots of instructions for line after line, this software asks you for the correct set of numbers, you supply them ... done.  For me, it shortened a two day process down to two hours.  Highly recommended.	1
Did my taxes got a refund didn't cost too much to do did state too and everything seems to be ok so far.	1
This is my 3rd. time using H&R Block's Deluxe + State.  I waited until Amazon ran a special price and purchased.  As always with Amazon, the download was quick and easy taking only a few minutes over a 5 Mbps DSL connection.  Info from my prior return was loaded without problem.  Entry of the current year's info was simple and provided answers to any changes in tax law that might apply to my return.  No issues in return preparation or submission.  Program audits alerted to me to any possible problems that I might need to address.  Returns were transmitted easily to the IRS and state.  H&R Block kept me informed as to the status of the return.  Although I filed later than usual, my state refund was received in less than 2 weeks.  My IRS return required a payment.  A nice option with the software allowed me to submit my return and then schedule payment to the IRS later.  Compared to Turbo Tax, there are no substantial differences for me in the preparation and submission of my returns.  Both make it very easy.  The BETTER VALUE is definitely H&R BLOCK as it was about 1/2 the price of Turbo Tax.  The BEST PLACE TO BUY IS AMAZON!!!!.	1
Not sure what I can add to the other reviews.  H&R Block is a useful tool for filing your taxes, and if you file electronically it really speeds up your refund.  I have use both H&R block and Turbo Tax in the last few years, both work good for me, H&R Block has been the better deal the last two years.	1
have been using H & R Block tax software for many years..so it makes it very easy transferring data from last year's forms.. it talks you through the process via questions in various categories..and quite easy to use...plus backed by the H&R block brand.	1
More than 20 years ago, I used to use Turbo Tax. After Intuit instituted a policy that I felt was unfair to consumers, I decided to switch to HR Block. I haven't looked back since. I buy it every year and have always been able to get my taxes done without a hassle. Sometimes I pay the feds and other times the feds pay me. I'm always confident that all is in order.	1
Fourth year with H&R Block's Tax Software and I am completely satisfied. There were no install issues despite having a previous version on the PC. I used this year's version to do returns for five family members that ranged from a super easy 1040EZ to a pretty complicated 1040 that included a home sale, a move and multiple short and long term capital gains / losses. The software performed smoothly and flawlessly for all five of the Federal and state returns.	1
I've been using H&R Block software since I filed for tax year 2000.  I had one bad year with the software when they had too many ads inside it, but that hasn't happened since.  I also know from personal experience that this software is more accurate under some conditions than other software on the market.  It's quick, easy to use, and inexpensive.  You can't go wrong with H&R Block.	1
- HR Block has worked well for me over the years going to the actual HR office, but this year I figured I had seen it done enough at the office, so I wanted to try it myself using their software. -I  purchased and downloaded the deluxe version which includes free federal e-file, but I have to pay $19.95 to e file the state, or I may just print it out and save the money. - The setup was very easy, but I have a fairly simple tax situation. I didn't have to go into a lot of the categories that seemed more complex, so I'm speaking from that perspective. - Entered basic info,  W2 info, car taxes, mortgage interest, and the program runs a check for you to see if everything is filled out correctly. It flagged a couple boxes I didn't enter the first time, and it was fairly easy to get back to the page I needed to make the additional entries on. - I used the help button once, typed in my question and the software answered it and took me to the location where I had to enter the information I had questions about. - There is a live chat help button, but I haven't used it. I also think you can call to speak to a tax expert if needed as well, which is nice. There are also a good number of HR block offices within driving distance, so I'm assuming if you got stuck they could lend a hand. I like this feature for the first time do it yourself, because if you really get stuck, there's an actual location to go to. - I haven't e filed, but I ran the "audit" check, and it tells you your "risk of audit" from green, to yellow, to red, though anyone can be audited from what I read, it shows you the "chance" they think you have based on what you entered, or at least thats what I'm getting from it. - I found it helpful to click through some of the function menus to get familiar with the program before I really started. That seemed to help also. - I did the download version to avoid having another CD sitting around, and the download from amazon was easy. The program installed, and then updated, and was ready to go. I did have to close out of the initial download screen though, it was giving me an error. So i closed it out, went to my orders, found the purchase and clicked download from there and it went smooth. - Like I said I'm pleased with this option for my tax situation. There are other competing products, and there are other ways to have taxes done such as an office, CPA, accountant, but for me this seems like something I can handle knowing HR is there to help if it gets tricky. - Once I e-file I will update this review on how that process went!  ** update: I finished my taxes and couldn't be more pleased with the software. The program checked over the return before e filing, led me through some steps to e file, with links when needed, let me pay for the state taxes owed, paid the 19.99 fee to file the STATE..fed was free...printed it all out, it had me back it up to a flash drive, and finished up. HR block sent me emails when my returns were accepted by the IRS and the state, and the software also allowed me to check on this. Pleased overall. - Good luck.	1

I have been using this product to do my taxes for years.  I like doing my taxes using software since they are not that complicated and it is easy to use.  It is pretty hard to miss any deductions since the question process goes over pretty much anything to do with taxes including deductions.  This program has always served me well so I continue to use it.  I also use Quicken for my financial needs and it is very easy to import my tax transactions into the tax software.  It is important to make sure to categorize everything in the Quicken transactions to make this work correctly.  If you do, then a large part of your tax items are already placed on the correct forms in the tax software when you import the Quicken tax report for that year.  I have never used TurboTax primarily because it is more expensive and have never been told it does a better job.	1
I have a relatively complex Federal tax situation with some investments and a subchapter S and a partnership, which means that I can't do the simplest tax returns, but I have been doing my own taxes for so long that all I really need is an assist and a heads up for any tax changes (rarely).  I also have to file tax returns in two states which means that I just go the state web sites and download the forms. Everytime I have tried to use paid State tax forms it hasn't worked out well.  So I definitely don't want to pay for something  I cannot use.  I also like the option to download the program.  Makes me feel like I'm saving on all the worthless ads and bits of paper that used to be included in the package when I bought it at an office supply store.	1
Using TurboTax for more than 10 years for my returns and those of my family, I reluctantly switched to H&R Block because I could prepare more than one return per purchase.  This is my 6th or 7th year with H&R Block and I've found the program to meet my expectations and then more.  I no longer use the program for my return due to my husband working overseas and the complexities involved but still it for family members.  The program is efficient identifying what the user's tax information is needed, provides excellent links to resources outside of H&R Block and provides and excellent "things to-do" list when completion of the return in one sitting is impossible.  Oh, it still allows preparation of returns for more than one taxpayer.	1
Over several years, I have successfully and, for the most part, found this program easy to use and quick for the online filing of federal taxes.  This year, after having completed and submitted my 1040, I discovered I had left out some investment gains and needed to submit a correction and decided to use H&R's included 1040X procedure to submit this correction. This turned into a bit of a blessing.  In entering the additional investment gains I had left out, I discovered that H&R had incorrectly calculated my investments gains by including gain information from a previous tax year. In addition, the programs instructions for filing a corrected1040X, are fuzzy at some points which led me into obviously erroneous tax refund issues. Email and phone contacts were courteous but not helpful.   As it turned out, when I agreed to allow the H&R to import my 2013 investment data into the program, the program failed to delete some of my 2012 investment data from the prior years tax return. Nothing like paying taxes twice on the same earnings!  The imperative here: the H&R investment data importing feature for 2014 really needs your careful attention if you have or should you choose to use it.	-1
Does the trick. The only thing I wish is that the information imported from the previous year's return was more visible in the new year. I can't explain it any better than that.	1

This product works well. Unlike other reviewers, I had no problems with installation or hang-ups during and a new computer (Windows 8, 16 Gig RAM).  User interface is easy and intuitive and the results are acceptable.  This isn't the highest end video processing software, but it works well and is fantastic at this price point.  Will outperform any software from 5 years ago at any price.  Having played with various programs for about 15 years, I am amazed at how my capability the new software has.  Recommended.	1
<div id="video-block-R25SL7KGJ4SJ07" class="a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block"></div><input type="hidden" name="" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/E1E8MqXqLES.mp4" class="video-url"><input type="hidden" name="" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61uOTrV8t5S.png" class="video-slate-img-url">When consumer digital video cameras came to market, users needed capture cards and software to import the video. Capture cards typically came bundled with software for capturing, editing and producing video in DVD and other formats. The most common ones at the time were Pinnacle Studio and Ulead Video Studio. Ulead is now part of Corel, and is sold as&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Corel-VideoStudio/dp/B00BFYEH8G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Corel VideoStudio</a>. That product has evolved quite a bit, and is still a good choice. I reviewed it separately as part of Corel Photo Video Suite X6. Pinnacle evolved quite a bit too, and this version is a departure from previous versions. I never used version 16, but compared to version 15 and below, this version has a substantially different interface. Its old one was centered around the paradigm of the steps mentioned above, which was common for Video Studio and also for Cyberlink Power Director. Others such as Sony took a fresh approach, and this is a fresh approach for Pinnacle.  The new interface is cleaner and more powerful. I can now edit far more video tracks, rendering is much faster, and many features have been added. Unfortunately, while video editing software seemed to be the last software product around that still came with a hard copy manual, Corel has dropped it for both this and Video Studio. I suppose if you have a Kindle, you can get by with the PDF, but you most likely want your full computer screen for running the product itself. I found the PDF manual to be lacking, and some very simple things are not documented. Thus the learning curve was greater than I expected, even though once I learned it, it was easy to use.  The newest features are useful and practical, but there is also an increasing array of features that go far beyond what I'll ever need. In past versions, I often failed to see why I need hundreds of new transitions and more title backgrounds than I'd care to look at when I'll only use a handful, but if you are looking for a special title slide or want to have effects similar to the wipes, fades, pans, folds and spins of an over the top sports broadcast, you can do that too.  The product is still well suited for getting those old Digital8 or MiniDV tapes off the shelf and putting them on line, but it's even better suited to giving you the features necessary to work with your full HD videos and render things in any popular format or burn to a Blu-ray disc. It will also handle 3D videos. It won't handle subtitles the way Cyberlink will and you'd have to rely on standard titles for that. But the interface is much cleaner than something like Cyberlink's, which tries to upsell itself.  I've found it particularly useful when multiple video cameras are used at the same event and I wish to cut from one angle to another but have a cohesive video with no breaks in action or dialog. But the same editing capabilities come in handy even with lesser quality video, and my video review shows how I was able to salvage bits and pieces of videos to come up with something better.  Whether you merely want to take a collection of video clips and put them together, adding transitions and little more, or whether you want to edit multiple videos together with fancy titles rolling credits and Blu-Ray disc menus with a different moving background for each scene selection, you can do it with this product. The PLUS version of the product doesn't have all the features of the Ultimate version, so I suggest you check the feature comparison chart. I suspect that for most users, this will work fine, especially if you save your videos on your computer or want to watch them on line. If you want to burn things to Blu-Ray disc or want support for 4K ultra HD, the Ultimate version will be better for you.	1
The sheer number of options available can be overwhelming but stay tuned, it gets better. After a straightforward installation and some time spent updating the software, you're presented with an intuitive interface. There are a good number of resources for help in using it, starting with a free 30-day installation support with registration. The manual is a bit light and would have benefited from a competent technical writer.  It wasn't difficult to jump in and start modifying and editing clips, most of it is just drag and drop. Cutting is easy, moving samples around is also very easy. There are a huge number of transitions, effects and ask that will either make your movie great our very kitschy. Less is more. All of this happens with almost instant and continuous rendering so you can get a hint at the eventual product.  The usual capabilities exist: adding audio, recording voiceovers and so on. In spite of this, the software isn't that cumbersome on system resources. Importing and exporting is straightforward as well. This is a solid performer that does all the basics any amateur would be satisfied with. Four stars.	1
I use this software to edit a small web series. There are few special effects, but it does well with small things (integrating a car chase and animation, in my case). This software is a vital tool for clarifying picture and color on a budget. I run Windows 8 Enterprise on a Lenovo All-In-One, and this runs smoothly without conflicting with other programs or causing issues (which Corel always did to me). If you have simple projects that don't require a whole lot of special effects, this is a good budget program, and I definitely recommend it.	1
Pinnacle Studio 17 continues the product's evolution by adding interfaces for more modern sources for footage and online/device outputs.  This makes it very flexible in that you can capture footage from just about any device that might be used in your home:  phones, camcorders, GoPros, etc.  Then you can watch your results on an equally impressive array of devices aimed at fitting everyone's needs - if the kids want to watch on their Xbox, no problem; if you want to share with Grandma via Facebook, fine; if your team posts their highlight clips to YouTube or Vimeo, you can do that.  This flexibility is a threshold requirement these days and Pinnacle Studio is definitely up to speed.  The editing process is simple but powerful.  I've used several different home editing suites and always come back to Pinnacle due to the simplicity of the on-screen interface and controls.  I'm able to make great-looking videos that get lots of "wow - how did you do that?" comments without having to fumble around indefinitely figuring out how to do this transition or drop in that graphic.  That, coupled with its affordability make it a great choice for anyone looking to quickly make family movies, team highlight reels, etc.  I did have some hiccups during installation (Windows 8), but Pinnacle's customer service was able to help me get past it.  A note on that - this product only comes with 14 days of that support before they begin charging for it, so really it only covers the installation period.  Basically, the install needed to run my DirectX back from v. 11 to v. 9.  After implementing Customer Service's fix, the install completed with no issue.  Also, i have run into a couple instances where Pinnacle Studio just crashes during rendering even though my machine meets the program's minimum requirements.  Overall, Pinnacle Studio is powerful, flexible and easy to use.  It's my choice for making all sorts of videos for home, work and fun.	1
I already had a bad experience with Pinnacle Studio 17 Ultimate and found it too difficult to use - it's no good for anyone other than someone who's an expert video editor.  I decided to give it a 2nd shot with Pinnacle Studio 17 Plus and could not even get the software to install. I tried several times, restarted my computer, etc. and the installation would not run. I saw others comment that they were able to install the software by doing it in pieces, but I wouldn't even know where to begin with that.  P.S. My computer does meet all the requirements listed on the box.	-1
After getting past some install issues with windows 8.1, I found the whole process of editing videos to be somewhat of a hassle compared to other programs I've used in the past such as windows movie maker or iMovie.  The UI was very hard to navigate and it was just time consuming trying to figure out the simplest of features.  Frankly, I just don't have the time to learn this software and regret the time sink I spent on it.	-1
I tried again and again to get this software installed on my Windows 8 desktop by all normal means and it just wasn't going to happen. The CD just would not run. I was eventually able to install portions of this software by opening them up, one-by-one, by exploring the disc files. I had to install them in bits, and even that wasn't entirely successful. I could not get ALL of this product installed on my computer, so I was only able to try out portions of it. Though what I did get installed does seem to be working, the experience of installing it was just too frustrating for me to be able to recommend this product to others.	-1
Pinnacle Studio 17 Plus is an easy to use program that's great for those who have a bit of experience with video editing software, but users don't have to be an expert to get good results. Its fairly easy to learn and has a lot of great features.  Installation was easy as well, and ran with no difficulties, although it took about 20 minutes to complete.  I was most interested in the Live Screen Capture feature, but it was a bit difficult to find.  Users are required to look for it in Program files and manually make a shortcut in order to access it.  Despite that small flaw, Live Screen Capture works well most of the time.  For instance, it will capture video from MineCraft flawlessly, but I've had issues trying to get it to screen capture some other video games.  All around, Pinnacle Studio 17 Plus does a good job with minimal effort.	1
Yes I now have two Pinnacle products that I should never have purchased.(the other one is the Studio 17 Ultimate) What was I thinking? The product performed before par and I found it to be a pain in the neck to actually do what I wanted it to which is to help me edit photos Simple right? That's what I thought After the fiasco of trying to get help for the problems I had with Studio 17 and being charged to get support, I just gave up. There are so many other programs out there that are far superior than Pinnacle Systems. I would suggest going to your local Best Buy or similar store where you can speak to someone in person (no charge) to compare programs to your needs. That is what I did after I through this in the garbage along with the Studio 17. Sorry Pinnacle..this was my last purchase with you	-1

It doesn't have all of the bells and whistles that some other movie editing software has, but it has a well-rounded selection for a reasonable price. If you are a novice in home video editing but want to step up from your simple minimalistic editing program that came with your camera, for example, this is a good choice.  It introduces you to the interface of a more professional editor without the depth to get you lost quickly.  The setup is very user friendly. Mine asked for a DirectX Update immediately.  You can decide if you want it to install all the Bonus Content.  You will get prompted to update the software the first time it opens. When you finally open the software after the update the application opens up with "The-Sky-is-the-Limit. Movie."  The movie has music, images, video, and effects.  You can use this video to learn how everything is organized.  I suggest you save it to a new project name if you want to experiment with it. In the timeline just move the slider to go to each part of the movie where there is an effect and you can then see it on the timeline.  You can also scroll to the end to see how the end title is handled. In the title timeline (lower part of the window) you can double-click on the effect and get more detail about how it was done.  See the attached video to get more details.  The video was done using the Live Screen Capturing application that came with Pinnacle Studio.  I then took the video that was created and brought it into Pinnacle Studio and converted it to MP4 format for Amazon.  All very straightforward.  I will be using this application in the future as it offers me more options.	1
Unlike quite a few other users, I found Pinnacle Studio 17 Plus fairly easy to learn and use. And I had no issues with installation either. I think the problems people are having must either be user, hardware requirements, or computer settings related. And I do own a previous version of this software, so that could be why I didn't experience any problems or confusion with setup and use. My last version of this software was version 14, and I did find version to be quite a bit faster and better.  Now, while this version has a lot of editing tools, for only a few dollars more you can get Pinnacle Studio 17 Ultimate. And in my opinion, given it's only a few dollars more, that's certainly the way to go. Pinnacle Studio 17 Ultimate will allow you to produce next generation 4K videos and Blu-ray videos. And while that may not be important to you right now, it likely will be in the not too distant future. And the Ultimate version also gives you more 2D and 3D special effects, the Red Giant Filmmaker's Toolkit, and the Motion Graphics Toolkit. It's well worth the few extra bucks.  Now, while all the improvements to version 17 are really terrific, what makes this new version a winner is the fact that it's still very affordable. Pinnacle Studio 17 Plus is a great set of tools at a great price. A bargain really. You get a lot of bang for your video editing buck. It contains all the tools you need to make really great videos. I recommend this latest version highly.	1
Overall, the program runs fairly cleanly.  I haven't had too many issues with crashes or freezes, though it isn't the most user friendly, either.  It supported most any video type I threw at it from multiple camcorders, phones, etc.  The one place it failed were on some AVIs of 8mm films that were encoded with the Cineform codec.  I used my 14-day 1-use support request only to get a semi-english response that said "sorry it doesn't work with Cineform".  Beware that support is iffy with this product.  You only get 14 days from the point of install, and only 1 issue.  After that you have to pay.  I wouldn't pay for the support I received.  Realtime preview is ok, but it wants to render things a bit more than I expected.  Particularly with speeding up video, it has to render the scene completely before it'll show any sort of preview.  Rendering 1080 video from my camcorder took a long time, as does exporting to other formats.  One other annoying thing is that it automatically starts searching and importing media files whenever you start up.  Also, the export presets are plentiful, but you can't modify them.  Instead you have to select a custom format, then set it up to do what you want.  There's also no function to specify a specific output type, then specify a maximum size.  For Amazon reviews, you have a 100MB limit.  I couldn't just set output to 99MB and let it choose the bitrate, nor could I easily exclude audio or set it to mono without making a complete custom setting.  Further, when customizing an output format, it wouldn't update the estimated size, so in the end I just had to make changes and export, then hope it fell under the size I was looking for.  As for actual editing, I thought it did pretty well.  Every program has its own learning curve and this one is no different.  As with most programs it has more transitions and effects than I'll ever use.  I also like that this version comes with the live screen capture built in, as that is something I've used other programs for in the past.  In the future, I'd probably upgrade to the next level up to be able to author blu-ray, but since I don't currently have a BD-writer, it's not an issue for me right now.	1
After trying - and liking - Pinnacle Studio 17, I was looking forward to giving Studio 17 Plus a try. But there have been too many frustrations in just getting it up and running to really enjoy it. As many others have pointed out, installation takes HOURS, a process that data mines every media file on your computer (with no way to opt out). I work in the news media and have literally thousands and thousands of media files on my computer and no, I do not need to get bogged down in every file I ever processed each time I want to create something new. The learning curve is steep on this - the user interface is not particularly intuitive or user friendly. And as others have noted, be sure to check that your computer meets the minimum system requirements or your experience will prove even more frustrating. I'll keep at this for another month or so and update if something changes but as of now, this is too frustrating for all but the most die hard video editors.	-1
Compared to Adobe Premiere Elements - which costs the same, this software blows it away in terms of features and capability.  I was using Premiere Elements for years but often got frustrated by the limited number of adjustments that I could me.  Sure Premiere Elements let me run automatic adjustments with lighting, color corrections, and scene transitions.  But when I wanted to get fancy, this software became limiting.  With Pinnacle Studio I am able to perform many more automatic adjustments than Abode, more scene transitions, and I'm able to tweak my videos in ways I never could before.  So far I'm really enjoying this software.  After 3 weeks I'm still discovering more that it can do!  Some people noted the difficult installation.  I wouldn't call it difficult.  I would call it time consuming.  But this I expect with any professional level video editing software.  These installations are huge, especially with all the features, macros, effects, etc that it installs.  Also, a strong processor is important when rendering videos.  I recommend 2 or 4 cores.	1
My video editing skills fall under the basic guidelines, this package filled the need for some basic design concepts and was easy to use.  It did take a while to load but it's a large software package.  Pros: -Easy layout of basic features -Lots of options/templates for a quick start and consistent appearance -Great 2d and 3D rendering -Quick Processing -Good interface  Cons: -Snails pace install (Large software) -Needs a fast processor or you lag a bit -More advanced features are a little quirky to use -steep learning curve if new to this program  Good program, over all it's a nice platform and highly recommended.	1
This software was easy to install, but I was just as intuitive as the video editing software I use on my phone.  I installed it on my Windows 7 computer without any issue.  I did compare it between iMovie on MAC.  I like iMovie, it doesn't take anything away from this software, but the learning curve is different.  This is a good start for any novice who wants to learn how to edit videos together beyond the basic Windows Movie Maker.  I also like the fact it came with 50GB of cloud storage with BOX.	1
I have been a huge fan of Pinnacle Studio products for years.  This release is no dissapointment.  I don't get every release, so much had changed since my last copy. It has greatly improved the process of importing video and photos from your digital device of choice. Combined with video capture devices such as a Dazzle&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Dazzle-Digital-Video-Creator-DVC-90-Video-Capture-Device-and-Movie-Maker/dp/B00028CAL2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Dazzle Digital Video Creator DVC-90 Video Capture Device and Movie Maker</a>&nbsp;you can even convert all of your old VHS tapes into electronic media files...which I have done.  The ability to import projects from your iPad's Avid Studio is a huge plus as well. You can even creat custom-fit soundtracks. But probably the best improvement is the way in which you can instantly share your videos via Facebook or YouTube rather than just making a DVD and dropping it in the mailbox...but you can still make DVD's as well.  This is not a high end video editing suite, but for the masses, the "you and me" types, Pinnacle has always delivered both form and function.	1
I wanted to try something beyond Movie Maker.  This gives you a few more options.  Its fairly cheap but is not too bad a program to cut your teeth with..	1
I used Corel VideoStudio Pro before I move on to Adobe Creative Cloud and have been using Premiere Pro.  Sometimes, I feel the Premiere Pro is overkill for some quick and small projects that are intended for Internet upload only, such as on YouTube.  In that case Pinnacale Studio 17 serves the purpose well.  Considering it's price point and the purpose stated on the product description, I don't think it should be compared with Premiere.  The user interface is very attractive and there are time saving features for uploading finished videos directly to YouTube, Vimeo, and Facebook.  It also has many stunning effects that you can quickly apply to your video.  You can quickly turn your photos into a nice moving video.  You can also burn the videos on DVD directly.  The over all processing speed is reasonably fast.	1
I haven't used this yet, I have used camtasia, and will update when I use it but decided to start with my 12 year old son's review  He needed to create a movie for a school project and put together content from his phone (pics and video) as well as online - he was able to easy cut and paste clips and transition easily, even adding in some nice special effects.  That type of outta the box ease of use is key.	1
This product will serve you well if you are not a video pro, and just want to put together some effects on video you shot with your phone, camera, etc. It doesn't have all the pro bells and whistles, for that you need to step up to their more expensive versions. But that also means it's not too difficult to learn or to use this software.  It's ease of use is pretty much on par with the free Movie Maker from Microsoft, and has some more features, doodads and geegaws. Makes it easier to share once you are done too.  You can make slideshows with music of your photos as well, not just for full motion video.	1
This is a very nice video editing program. I live right beside the Chattahoochee National Recreation Area and have been telling everyone about how nice it is. My dog and I get to hike in it everyday. So I made two sets of videos, one using my Samsung Galaxy s4 and a second one using my Hero3+ camera with a chest strap. Editing each one was intuitive and easy using the software for the first time. I didn't try to do much with effects. If you are looking for a first rate photo editing program, I definitely recommend this. I need to add a caveat: I'm a rank amateur where videos are concerned. Well, making them. So if you are looking for some professional quality software, I would not pay attention to my review. I'm speaking to my fellow rank amateurs. Hey, we need guidance too.	1
Must admit that my personal fort has for years been still photography, but with the advent of the YouTube generation, and videos appearing on Facebook and Vimeo, it was time to take a closer look at a way of taking advantage of video formatting.  Had a few stumbles and hiccups at first installing&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Pinnacle-Studio-17/dp/B00GC1ZMYA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Pinnacle Studio 17</a>&nbsp;on a rock-solid Windows 7 PC, so switched to one that is running Windows 8.1 and it was smoother, with no hassles. This experience was far better than that with&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Adobe-Premiere-Elements-9-Old-Version/dp/B003YV62CM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Adobe Premiere Elements 9 [Old Version</a>] from about two years ago, which turned out to be a disappointment, and on many levels.  Taking this one slowly and easily, using simple videos created over the last few years as the basis for my initial videos. Later will come combining still photos for effect, along with adding sound. Initial experiments with create soundtracks with Scorefitter show some promise, but since I'm no beginning Coppola or Scorsese, it will take time before some really satisfactory results are available.  Also looked at&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Pinnacle-Studio-17-Plus/dp/B00G6CLN3Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Pinnacle Studio 17 Plus</a>, which runs about $25 more at the time of this review, but the only thing that I could see above the basic package was the addition of the Live Screen Capture feature. On the other hand,&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Pinnacle-Studio-17-Ultimate/dp/B00G6CLNCK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Pinnacle Studio 17 Ultimate</a>&nbsp;appears to be a far more full-featured package, and may be the way to go.  On the other hand, since Corel bought Pinnacle Products in 2012, it might be better to make the jump all the way to&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Corel-VideoStudio-Ultimate-X7/dp/B00IIL0S8W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Corel VideoStudio Ultimate X7</a>. This one offers more than their&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Corel-VideoStudio-Pro-X7/dp/B00IIL0SCS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Corel VideoStudio Pro X7</a>&nbsp;in that it includes a number of time-saving premium 64-bit video FX apps for a reasonably small price difference.  So far so good with&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Pinnacle-Studio-17/dp/B00GC1ZMYA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Pinnacle Studio 17</a>&nbsp;as a decent basic start, but take that from the viewpoint of a beginner with feet entrenched into still images for many years. Time will tell, and expect updates to this review as new experiences are encountered.  JW  3/20/2014	1
This is a good entry level video editing package that is very easy to use even for a beginner. The user interface is very attractive and clean, not overwhelming or cluttered with a bunch of icons or buttons. It's simplicity is similar to Apple's iMovie yet there are so many different features included. There is a ton of 2D/3D effects and the BOX cloud integration is very welcome. For anyone who's looking for a very good yet simple video editing package at a reasonable price that's very easy to use, this is definitely a solid choice.	1
I enjoy taking a lot of home movies and have redoubled my efforts since my son was born about a year ago. These days just about any device - from camcorders to smartphones - can take HD quality movies. Yet frustratingly the movie fragments you're left with are cumbersome, large files that don't translate well into home-movie watching experiences. I've tinkered around with various software suites over the years and recently received Pinnacle Studio 17. I've found the software to be a good mix of powerful editing tools and approachability that's somewhat marred by a lack of polish and bugs.  -------------------- INSTALLATION:  I installed Pinnacle 17 on my relatively powerful custom built desktop PC running Windows 7 (64-bit), Core i7 processor, 16GB RAM, RAID 1, and 2 Nvidia GTX 660s in SLI. Installation was super easy without any hiccups. This software is also Windows 8 and Vista compatible. Full installation takes around 5.8GB.  -------------------- SOFTWARE:  Pinnacle 17 for newbies is essentially a set of tools that allows you to create your own home movies that can ultimately (if you so choose) result in a burnt disc (a DVD) or a file that's easily watchable on platforms of your choosing. It's really a lot more than that but at its core this is what this software allows you to do. Pinnacle also lets you quickly add some pizzazz to your home movies by adding things like a title screen, credits, transitions, a music score and comes preloaded with 1500 effects. Adding these elements is a breeze once you understand the basics of the software. Unfortunately there isn't much of a tutorial built in but if you consult the included 'readme' MS Word document (unbelievably not a PDF or similar format) there are links to Pinnacles excellent FAQs and user forums. There is also a nearly 400 page behemoth of an instruction manual that sort of serves as a guide.  In short, having experience with software like Camtasia, Sony Vegas, and Cyberlink Power Director I was up and running and editing my home movies after a short time. The software really comes in three steps or tabs - Organize, Edit and Author. Each tab gives you access to different sets of tools with different purposes. Organize allows you to quickly see your attached drives and bore down to where your files are located. Edit is where you core movie making (or picture disc) takes place. Finally author is where you put some of the finishing touches on your movie by adding title screens, names, and all manner of cheesy material associated with home movies.  Lastly, though I only have Pinnacle Studio 17 my software came with the Live Screen Capture tool which lets you record your computers desktop and everything taking place and generate a movie file. Pretty neat feature that's unexpected as the box to my software claims this is only included with Pinnacle Studio 17 Plus.  I should also include some of the handled formats...  Supported import formats include (not all inclusive): MVC, AVCHD, HDV, AVI MPEG-1/2/4 DivX, Flash, WMV, MKV  Supported export formats include (not all inclusive): AVCHD, DV, HDV, AVI, DivX, WMV, MPEG-1/2/4, H.264  The great thing about the export tool is that each format comes with a brief explanation of the final resolution, mbits/sec, frames/sec, resolution, supported players (e.g. suitable for playback on DVD or PS3, etc) and many more details to help you create and informed decision about your final output file or disc.  -------------------- SOME NOT SO GOOD STUFF...  First, the software comes preloaded with many sample pictures and movies. I briefly watched onE sample movie before stopping and attempting to delete it (via Pinnacle) and caused the software to hang. This required task manager to kill the process. This same issue reoccurred each time I even clicked on any of the included media samples. I eventually gave up deleting the media via Pinnacle and just found the files on my disc and removed them. Not a huge issue but definitely annoying.  Second, I've come to have a love-hate relationship with the 'Organize' tab. Yes, it's there to help you quickly track and map to your source media but it's frustrating to use! For example after importing some new home movies from my Sony camcorder the library keeps displaying an exclamation point "!" under a tab labeled missing media. There are also an equal number of "!" file icons in a temporary directory that I use to dump media files. I cannot make the software forget these files. Again, more of an annoyance than anything else but this feature is supposed to make my life easier!  -------------------- WHAT I LIKE:  (+) Once you get the hang of this software you'll be a home movie making king. Consult the massive guide first if this is your first foray into home movie making. Then copy a bunch of movies you don't particularly mind if you accidentally screw up and start playing!  (+) For the price this is hard to beat and I found the software much more usable than Cyberlink Power Director 11.  (+) Lots of included effects, menus, transitions, sounds... you know the cheesy stuff everyone likes adding to home movies.  (+) Video rendering (heavily dependent on your hardware) screams. Again, giving Pinnacle 17 the nod above Power Director 11 here.  (+) Great file format support and I love how the software explains output formats very clearly.  -------------------- CONCLUSION:  Despite some hiccups and a few areas that lack polish Pinnacle 17 delivers really powerful home movie making software at a budget price. I've tried the competition and I'd pick this software. Recommended!	1
Basic zip/unzip support (called "compressed" in Windows 7 and 8) is built into the newer version of Windows, so why buy a premium version? I decided to order this product to see how it compares. I find it to have a lot of features that many people will probably not need, to be simple to use, and to be valuable for those who want a bit more compression capabilities. For normal users I don't think it adds a lot of needed functionality.  The program installs  in either 32 or 64 bit versions (I tested the 64-bit version). Installation was no problem. The programs uses a "ribbon" style interface, like the newer Microsoft Office products; I found it to be very intuitive. It also integrates directly with the Windows Explorer (the file window used in Win 7 and 8), so that one can right click and access options for compressing/decompressing files. The program works by simple drag and drop to add files. Clicking on a zip file brings up the main program. I found the interface and program functionality to be fine.  For an additional 9.95 (each), one can add zip capabilities to SharePoint, Outlook, and Photos. I didn't try those features.  The only real problem I had is that I would have liked to use a command-line interface for backing up files. The program is advertised as having this; according to the documentation, the capability is available as an add-on, but there is no such add-on listed at the web page.  Summary: If you want to create smaller backups, encrypted or self-extracting zip files, or have a need to regularly zip files for professional use, this is a great choice. Highly recommended.  I've put in some additional information below if you are interested. --------------------------------------------------------- Here are the program features that are NOT built in to Windows:  + Capability of making self-extracting zip files. This means the person receiving the file can simply click on it to have it unzip itself. I think this is somewhat limited in utility, because most people receiving the file will be able to unzip it anyway via Windows.  + Advanced levels of encryption. When turned on, the zip file will be protected by AES level encryption. Provided you use a strong password, it is much more secure.  + Multiple capabilties of zip compression, varying from fast to maximum.  + Simple integration with cloud drives. You can save directly to those drives and open from them.  + Direct integration with social media, which allows one to upload directly - although most social media doesn't really use zipped files.  + Integrated email capabilities (though most folks will use whatever email client they normally use).  + Capability of resizing photos as they are zipped. This might be nice for those who are uploading to social media or other situations when a specific resize is needed.  + Capability to convert all files to PDF as they are added to the zip archive. This is useful for professionals who always want to protect their distributed files from being (easily) modified.  + Capability of adding a watermark to files as they are zipped. This would be very useful for professionals who are sharing samples of their work.  + Capability of using the program to perform backups. There is a backup menu devoted to this function. This is useful for those with smaller external backup disks. Along these lines, the program allows for a "split" archive, and includes settings for the maximum DVD size - useful for making backups to DVD. There are provisions for only backing up files with the "archive" bit set, so it can be used for both full and incremental backups.	1
I was a PKZip user going way back to the dawn of my first BBS back in the mid 80's. I remember the days of when a new PKZip came out, you re-compressed everything because of better compression rates. Over time (and especially once Windows came into being) PKZip stagnated, and I eventually moved to WinRAR instead of WinZip when that came out, as the early WinZips were nothing to write home about. Later on, when PKWare introduced the new zipx format, I switched back. Have been there since.  That brings us to this one, WinZip 18. I love some of the nice small interface features here. All your modern compressors integrate with the OS well enough, but it's the little "touchy feely" things that make it work for me. For some reason I love the end of compression summary screen on this software. It's nothing special, but as a guy from the ancient days of BBS's, I loved seeing those minimal increases in space savings by using the latest, and this screen speaks to that for some reason.  A lot of what is in this software goes way beyond simple file compression. In this day and age when Windows has "compressed folders" built in, they have to diffentiate themselves.  To me, that is their zipx compression routines.  These compress files a lot smaller, however, it could be viewed as a different file format.  The tried and true old school zip file is not compatible with zipx.  Given I rarely share my zip files, I use zipx exclusively on my system.  However, I have to share, I need to pick the older compression format so other programs and other people can read them. The newer compression methods (zipx) will actually compress jpg files - something that up until relatively recently wasn't possible. They do this without data loss to the image, too. But this stuff has been the last 3-4 major revisions to WinZip anyway.  Some other stuff that you can do with zip files in this Pro version that you can't with standard old Windows Compressed folders is..  * You can zip and encrypt file attachments in email * You can schedule certain files for periodic zipping/archiving * Password protect your zip files - Windows "Compressed Folders" can't do that. * You can preview images inside Zip archives * You can add watermarks * You can convert things to a PDF * You can share files to Facebook, Linkedin, & Twitter (!)  Something else v18 is a big drive to cloud based services such as Box, SkyDrive, Dropbox, Google Drive, CloudMe, and SugarSync.  The last two I've never even heard of, but they're trying to make WinZip into a file server of sorts that will take your files and send them to these services by itself.  For me personally, I have no use of that, but I can see where some would.  If you use these services a lot, Winzip could be used to automate/batch process files on your system and send them there.  However, for me personally, I use it pretty much for local file archiving and organization.  In this day and age, one doesn't really need to save tons of space when one has multiple terabytes of storage on their system.  I use it to archive directories into single files mostly - things like old web page archives where you have 4000 files spread out over 150 sub directories.  It's easier to store in a single file, and for me that's the reason I use WinZip mostly.  Yeah, compressed folders could probably do that, but not nearly as nicely as WinZip does.  So yeah, if you're in need of archiving/moving files to the cloud that goes beyond the basics of what built into Windows functions can do, then you'd probably benefit by looking at this software.  I give it four stars over five, as I'd actually prefer it to be a bit simpler, while there's a lot in here, there's also a lot I'll never use - it's got that "shoot a squirrel with a 357 magnum" feel somewhat.  Yeah, it can do some things, but I'll never use them.	1
Every been frustrated because you needed something unzipped, but were being asked to purchase the program first? Wonder what is so great about the paid version? I have to say this version of WinZip does provide many additional options not found in the free versions. While I haven't yet used everything the program has to offer, I can say it has worked well with Google Drive files. It is nice to be able to zip not just large files, but those files you would like to keep secure. Overall I can say this product is a good fit for individuals that need zip capabilities (not just to unzip, but to compress files on your end) and for those that work in a lot of different software packages. Installation is easy and web based. Happy with the product overall.	1
To be quite honest, the only reason I need a utility like this is for the occasional RAR file I come across. I was previously using Smith-Micro's Stuffit for RARs, and pretty unhappy with it. Stuffit is slow, so slow that I often think it has locked up ... and dragging and dropping with Stuffit is dodgy at best.  For Zip files, the utility built into Windows words better than ANY utility based ZIP handler I've ever tried. So I literally don't need and wouldn't use this software for the file compression used in it's very name.  WinZip has a much cleaner, better performing implementation of RAR management, which is enough to give it four stars in my book. I'm just not sure it is worth the sixty dollar price (as of the date of this review) for my own purpose. If you have frequent need to use or access compression formats other than Zip files, it might be more worth that price to you than it is to me.	1
Utility software is not exciting, and it either does the job or it doesn't.  This does the job of zipping and unzipping without a lot of fuss.  I like it for that.	1
For those who don't know, WinZip is a file archiver, a way of compressing files for Windows and other operating systems. It has been around since the early 1990s as a GUI (Graphical User Interface) front end for PKZIP, the data compression utility that had been authored by the late Phil Katz. I note this as two people asked me about ZIP files in the last couple months. So much for the brief history lesson.  <a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/WinZip-18-Pro/dp/B00GDF83SM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">WinZip 18 Pro</a>&nbsp;is the latest version of WinZip, and is a full-featured product, with a lot of good functionality. It does an excellent job opening and extracting ZIP, Zipx, 7Z, LHA/LZH, RAR, BZ2 and about all of the other major compression file formats of which you can think. It makes fast work of converting Microsoft Word docs (and other Office files) to PDF format, and it's easy to create them as read-only PDF if you want to avoid file alteration by other parties.  This version offers more that the older&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/WinZip-17-Standard/dp/B009RG41HQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">WinZip 17 Standard</a>&nbsp;and other variations in that it makes it easier to protect your privacy and share files in email messages, in social media, and on the cloud. It has been redesigned to support new add-ons, and cloud navigation makes it simpler to protect, manage and share your files online. An updated Zip engine makes even smaller ZIP and Zipx files.  Now you can display photos within ZIP files without extracting them by using WinZip's internal image viewer, and you can use the 'Photos' button to rapidly transfer photos from supported cameras and iPhones, then rotate and compress them into picture shows for sharing. Among the new features, you can use direct access to cloud services. These include Google Drive, SkyDrive (now Cloud Drive), and Dropbox, which I've tried successfully. You can also access other cloud services such as  Box, CloudMe and SugarSync, though I have not tried these. You can also send links to your cloud files via instant messaging, email and social media with the Cloud Links feature.  If you have a large number of digital images on your hard drive, it will reduce your .JPG files by about 20 to 25% with no loss of photo quality or data integrity. Photographers with a large number of images should note that WinZip may (or may not) cause some issues with image management/viewing applications such as Adobe Photoshop Lightroom or Nikon ViewNX 2, so run some tests before you try to compress all of your images. I have not tried compressing RAW images, as keeping them intact is a personal thing.  <a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/WinZip-18-Pro/dp/B00GDF83SM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">WinZip 18 Pro</a>&nbsp;is available here on CD-ROM or as a PC download for Windows 7, Vista and Windows 8.x.

Users of the WinZip 17 versions may or may not wish to go for this new version; it's a personal choice depending on what features you want. Both versions do their job well, have a good interface, and are extremely handy for taking advantage of cloud storage.  JW  4/15/2014	1
Installed the software on a Windows 8.1 64 bit system.  No problems were encountered during installation.  As a basic zipping/unzipping program this has no equal.  Very easy to understand and use.  The interface is laid out in a logical and easy to understand manner.  Highly recommended.	1
WinZip maintains a look similar to its previous iterations, a bit old-fashioned, but tried and true with some revamped icons. This was actually nice because I felt right at home jumping in and beginning to use WinZip 18.  WinZip integrates into your Windows Explorer just like most compression programs and will replace and enhance your built-in windows zip functionality. The function s that I have found particularly helpful are the following: 1. Add files to recent .zip files. This allows .zip archives to be made from windows explorer rather than within the WinZip program. Files from multiple locations can easily be added to archives. 2. ZipShare. This lets you quickly zip and share files (including just a link to a file if stored on the appropriate cloud service, with which WinZip integrates). Unfortunately WinZip charges $10 to integrate this with outlook which I thought was pretty poor form especially for a $60 piece of software. 3. Easily unzip from right click menu. Unzipping from right click menu can be done natively in Windows Explorer (but not all formats are supported in Windows and I haven't found one yet not supported by WinZip), but with WinZip, you can choose where to extract the file from the menu. Very nice to keep from having multiple nested folders created or to keep from unzipping a large archive directly to your "downloads" folder. 4. Resize photos: Very nice, easy to use batch processing feature for photos. If you have need to resize multiple photos, this might add the value to the program necessary for you to purchase. 5. Convert to PDF. You can convert .doc, .docx, .xls, .xlsx, .ppt, and .pptx files to pdf in batch form from within the program. This is a feature that I was happy to find and did not expect. You can also add a watermark to the file, nice if you are going to share a bunch of files and want to be careful how they are used. 6. The ability to discount .RAR files.  My only concern is the price. I receive this free, and while I use it multiple times per day, I am not certain if I'd still pay full retail price.	1
Havent used WINZIP in a while, so I thought Id try the newest version WinZip 18 and checkout the Pro extras. Was easy to load on my computer. Worked well compressing document files, also was easy to convert files to PDF . Extremely useful doing all this with one software. Unzipping compressed files was quick and complete. Take a lot of photos and the resize function was easy to comprehend and utilize in uploading to social media. Find the cloud access makes it simple to store and very helpful in sharing files. I find this upgraded WinZip version easy to use and truly useful tool.	1
But WinZip is still that trusty software program that I used waay back in the Windows 97 era. Only it does ALOT more -- besides its "usual" compess-decompessing abilities, I especially like the security features.  I doubt I'll need it for the more advance functions (cloud, backup) but it's nice to know theya re there in case I find out I actually DO need to use them.  The program downloaded easily and placed an iocon on my desktop. Seamlessly.	1
Why file compression?  The basic idea is to decrease the space needed to store data so that you can add more data to your backup device.  Also, file compression decreases the time required to transfer the data and allows you to email more data if your email service limits the size of attachments.  WinZip has been around since 1991, but it is not the only compression utility available.  Other popular compression utilities include 7-Zip, WinRAR and MagicRAR.  All of the  compression utilities can handle ZIP, the most commonly-used compression format, along with a number of other popular formats such as 7z, RAR, TAR, and GZIP.  WinZip does not compress into CAB, RAR, TAR, 7Z, or LHA/LZH.  Performance The speed with which WinZip 18 compresses files depends on your processor.  Toms Hardware benchmarked several different compression programs using different processors and found that the choice of processor could half the time required for compression.  You can speed up the compression even further by choosing the OpenCL under preferences.  WinZip 18 claims to be the fastest version yet, but I haven't noticed great increases in speed as compared to WinZip 17 on my Core i7 machine.  File Formats WinZip 18 can compress into six file formats including: Zip, BZ2, ZipX, PPMD, LZMA and WavPack. WinZip can not compress into CAB, RAR, TAR, 7Z, or LHA/LZH.  However, it can extract files from 13 formats including ZIP, CAB, RAR, GZ, ISO, TAR, TGZ, IMG, ZipX, BZ2, PPMD, 7Z and LZMA. This is very useful if you share compressed data with people who use other compression formats.  Zip to the Cloud WinZip works not just with local files but also with data stored o the most popular cloud sites.  WinZip 18 supports Box, CloudMe, Dropbox, Google Drive, SkyDrive and the newly added SugarSync as well as ZipSend, WinZips sharing service.  WinZip 18 can retrieve files from the cloud or send data to the cloud in compressed form saving space and the time to log into your account.  Installation I downloaded the latest version from the internet with the intention of then entering my license code from the product box I received.  During installation, I was asked if I wanted to add a toolbar to my browser and to improve WinZip by sending WinZip your usage data and the default option is to send the data.  I didn't want to do either and WinZip never bothered me about these things again.  So be careful when you install the product that you don't get third-party tools that you don't want or need.  Especially since I have gone back to find out more about the program to make WinZip better and I can find the settings turn this on or off.  Once WinZip was installed, I needed to enter my license code and then validate it online.  Here is where I had trouble because I kept getting errors.  I Googled the error and it turns out this is a common installation problem in Windows 7 64 bit.  It turns out that The Windows 8, Windows 7, and Windows Vista operating systems have security rules and User Account Control settings that restrict writing data to certain protected files and folders.  So, Windows was preventing the validation.  I tried following the workaround offered on the WinZip website which required me to delete a folder from my computer, but this turned out to be useless.  However, I could complete the installation by simply right clicking on the icon WinZip put on my desktop and running the program as an administrator.  Note that this method will not work if you don't have administrative rights on your computer.  Express Add Ons One of the new features of WinZip 18 is the ability to add Express Add Ons.  These are programs for Windows Explorer, for Photos, for Outlook and for Sharepoint.  However, be aware that with the exception of the Add On for Windows Explorer, you have to pay an additional fee for the Add Ons.  The Add ON for Windows Explorer is free with the WinZip 18 license.  The Add On provides fast access to the key features in WinZip: compression, encryption, file conversion and watermarking, sharing via social media or email and uploading to a cloud service. All these options are present in a single window and achieving the task involves just a few clicks.  The benefit is that you don't have to launch the main WinZip program when using the Add On.  Summary Overall, WinZip is a very good file compression utility with a lot of features that allow you to do more with the files you compress.  The ability to upload and to view files on the Cloud through the program are nice features.  I found the default options for adding AVG and performance enhancers to be annoying during installation, but since then there have been no other annoyances.	1
Unless there are some pretty radical changes in my file administration needs (and personal philosophy) the only intended use I have for this software is unzipping RAR files and occasionally, conversion to a PDF.  There might arise some instances where I want to compress for attachment to an email, but not all that likely either.  I suppose there is justification to adding watermarks to photos, if I ever make a practice of uploading photos to some sharing site.  If there is an interest in, or requirement for, encryption of certain files for added security the capability is here and relatively easy to implement.  Files may also be compressed for backup storage but with the abundance of relatively inexpensive high capacity drives, I don't have a need for that functionality either. The learning curve for this utility shouldnt be all that taxing users accustomed to Office style ribbon menuing interfaces or users who regularly share files via social media sites or store in a cloud service.  Essentially, this is a suite of utilities that may have considerate value for users with wider range of requirements who do not desire to use a separate program even if in many instances those individualized lower cost (or free)  apps may be more efficient or focused on a specific demand.	1
This product is hard to assess since it traverses the product area between personal and an outright enterprise level piece of software. This product is called WinZip 18 Pro but after you start the setup, which gives you an option of 32-bit or 64-bit, it indicates that it is WinZip 17 [in most cases you should choose 64-bit unless your computer will simply not function at the 64-bit level]. After the option is offered, click install. Depending on what you are going to use WinZip 18 Pro for, you should probably take a careful look at the EULA, since this states that the software is licensed to you, not sold to you. Businesses, whether small or especially larger businesses, are required to maintain records of installations for audits. The terms of use are especially relevant since the privacy points states that information can and will be automatically collected. Although WinZip user feedback gives an opt out selection, this may apply to certain things, but it does not mean that the information will not be collected. In setting up your given options and the associations selection has key choices with implications for security, and this would be very relevant for businesses. There is an option to check for updates which gives auto,  ask, and do not check; my recommendation in all cases is for the system to ask, since auto will cause a lot of problems potentially.   Registration using serial number is different to the registration code. The "as is" warranty disclaimer appearing during registration is somewhat at odds with the EULA. The warranty seems to cover WinZip, WinZip Courier, and WinZip self extractor.   The program is structured like office 2013. Social media and cloud options are extensive and these are all integrated into the ribbon structure. The create/share option is part of this, as is copy to , backup, tools (diagnostics are important, especially for fixing corrupt zip files); and settings, view (which contains various themes for the program), help and the knowledge base is very useful, but much of it can be worked out either by working with the program, or testing what you want to do.   The last version of this program that I had was WinZip 14 plus. The jump between version 14 plus and version 18 Pro is mostly in the technical nitty-gritty, however the cloud and the encryption elements of the two largest expansions. WinZip 18 Pro has many elements that a business can use, however some of the cloud and social media elements have dubious business value mainly because of some severe security issues, and this is probably where in the out-of-the-box situation it would work well for a home use situation. Whatever the case, the advanced elements need to be looked at very carefully since they will be suited for some, and will need very stringent controls for other WinZip users who want to use the extensive capabilities for zip and encryption, but avoid cloud and social media.	1
WinZip 18 has a number of features that go beyond just zipping (compressing) and unzipping files. The zip engine in WinZip 18 is said to compress files smaller and faster.  The Pro version includes a Backup function and the Jobs Wizard to automate repetitive processes.  Pros: 1) WinZip states it supports 25+ compressed file formats including Zip, ZipX, RAR, 7Z, ISO, IMG, BZ2, BZ, TBZ, TBZ2, TAR, Z, GZ, TGZ, LZH, CAB, UUencode, BitHex, and MIME. 2) WinZip now has iOS and Android apps for your tablets and smartphones. 3) You can connect to several cloud drives: Box, CloudMe, DropBox, GoogleDrive, SkyDrive, and SugarSync 4) WinZip can convert DOC, DOCX, Excel XLS, XLSX, PPT, and PPTX files to PDF (Adobe's Public Document Format). 5) You can share files on Facebook, LinkedIn, or Twitter. 6) The proprietary ZipX format saved JPG photos in a considerably smaller file.  A test of 100 photos of 450 MB was reduced only 1% (4 MB) in a traditional zip format, but were reduced 20% (90 MB) in a ZipX file.  (This was without the photo reduction feature that reduces picture dimensions.) 7)  WinZip states that there is an option to resize pictures to reduce file sizes (but this is apparently only found in the zip and email function).  Cons: 1) The License states that WinZip can be installed on up to 3 computers.  However after I installed it to my desktop computer, I installed it to my laptop.  When I entered the registration code I received an error that the activation code had already been used and it wanted me to buy another license. 2) While WinZip states that it supports 25+ compressed file formats, the Knowledgebase states it will only create Zip, Zipx, Lha/Lzh, and UUencoded files. 3) It can be really hard to find options in WinZip.  I spent nearly 10 minutes trying to find out how to save files into the ZipX format rather than the Zip format.  I wasn't able to find how to save an Lha file, even in the Knowledgebase. 4) WinZip claims that you can email an attachment of up to 2 GB in size.  However if you want to send attachments that large, you'll have to pay $10 a month for ZipSend Pro.  (Or you can use WinZip to upload the file to the cloud and send a link from the cloud.) 5) The WinZip Help states, "WinZip can convert high-resolution images to more convenient sharing sizes instantly when adding them to your Zip file. Simply click Resize Photos in the Create or Edit tab and decide what size you want..."  When I click on Resize Photos, it doesn't do anything. And then when I add photos to the zip file, they are not reduced in size. 6) WinZip defaulted to the "ribbon" menus.  WinZip claims that its smart ribbon only shows you the tools you need but it sometimes hides the tools that you're looking for.  For example if you open a zip file and want to copy it to the cloud, that option is not shown on the default smart ribbon tab. 7) Some features are apparently available only from the right click menu within Windows Explorer and not from the smart ribbon menu. 8) Be advised that if you use the Move command to add a file to WinZip, the original file is moved to the WinZip file and then Winzip deletes the original file to the Recycle Bin.  So this could be a security issue if you believe that the file only exists in the WinZip file. 9) I created an encrypted zip file.  When I double clicked on the zip file to open it, WinZip opens the zip file and displays all of the files within the zip file and displays a password entry box.  I don't like it that WinZip displays the contents of the encrypted zip file prior to a password being entered. WinZip will also display some of the file properties without a password.  That might be helpful to someone trying to crack the encrypted zip file. 10) A couple hours after I installed WinZip 18 I found that I was unable to drag and drop files in Windows Explorer.  I had not uninstalled any other software in several days and this was the first time ever that I could not drag and drop in Windows 7 Pro.  So I attributed the problem to the new install of WinZip 18. After rebooting it seemed everything was back to normal, for now. 11) My copy of WinZip 17 had started giving me this error messages for unencrypted WinZip files that I had created:  "Open WinZip File: You don't have permission to open this file. Contact the file owner or an administrator to obtain permission."  Well I am the owner and the administrator.  I haven't seen this problem in WinZip 18 yet, but then I've only used it a few weeks.  There are a number of freeware zip programs available (like 7-Zip), so you would have to decide if the paid features in WinZip 18 are worth it.	-1
You're probably wondering why you'd possibly even need a compression program nowadays.  Didn't Windows XP and beyond add a compressed folder support for Zip files?  Why would I spend money on something I already have?  What are you trying to pull?  You're hair looks stupid!  I'll get to those questions shortly, except for the hair thing.  That's just hurtful and not even actually a question.  Why you gotta be so mean?  If you're like me the only time you've seen WinZip in the past is people using the shareware version of it, probably questionably from a legal point of view, to zip and unzip files.  So yeah, you're doing that then you don't need to go spending a chunk of money on something to do it.  Use what's in Windows.  Have a blast.  You'll be happy.  Skip the rest of the review.  However, if you're getting files off the web, then you're likely to hit the need for additional formats.  That's where WinZip truly shines.  According to WinZip, WinZip 18 supports the following types/extensions.  I've not tried all yet, but have no reason to doubt them.  The program performed flawlessly on zip and rar files, except for one set which were corrupted and it offered no option to fix.  A past program I had a long time back would offer to try to fix a file and occasionally work.  It would have been nice to have it at least make an attempt.  I also used it to open a 750 MB .iso image, off a USB drive, in about 3 seconds.  That's obviously not the time to extract the files, but it was able to open up so I could see them all that quickly.  Type----------Extension zip----------.zip .zipx tar----------.tar gzip---------.gz compress-----.z cab----------.cab RAR----------.rar bz2----------.bz2 lha/lzh------.lzh 7z-----------.7z IMG----------.img ISO----------.iso XZ-----------.xz  A lot of these formats give better compression than good old reliable zip.  Even WinZip 18 pushes a format zipx which compresses much smaller, but is unfortunately incompatible with Windows or other programs only supporting zip.  So you do have to be careful that anything you compress is sent to someone either as a self-extracting archive or that they have a compatible program like WinZip too.  I've uploaded a couple of screenshots to the images for this product.  One of them shows a very nice feature, the program can be installed as either native 32-bit or 64-bit.  Some software skimps and just does everything 32-bit so it works on the older computers, but 64-bit will run better on newer ones, typically Windows 7 and later are 64-bit.  I also included the registration page.  The program needs online activation, likely for the aforementioned people using it questionably with the shareware versions.  However, the activation should be one time.  They provide you with an alphanumeric code after that which it indicates will allow you to install it.  My guess, this is so they can balance the very risky online activation only where you may be offline, traveling, a company may go out of business, etc. with the ability to know who leaked the first code if the offline key starts getting used all over the web.  I still don't like any online registration being forced, but at least it's a bit of a compromise.  WinZip makes it appear it can even easily do backup jobs for you, but they'll force you to upgrade to Pro.  For example, they make it look like you can have it backup your documents folder and compress it to another location, but when you actually try to do it, it demands you upgrade.  It should be clearly labeled it requires an upgrade without someone having to try to use it and getting slapped down.  Hey, here's another one.  Want to watermark a picture?  Just turn on watermark, drag the photo in, and you're good.  Want to actually double-click on the picture to view it?  Silly, you have to upgrade to Pro to do that.  I've also yet to get convert to PDF to actually do anything at all except with Word and Excel docs, which frankly feels like a lie based on what the box says; I use LibreOffice and text a lot.  Seriously not cool guys.  It leaves me wondering what other features might appear to be there, but are not actually useable when I need them.  So how does it fair?  Well to me it was overall quite good, except for the in my opinion slightly obnoxious calls to go to Pro and the problems with text files to PDF.  The number of formats it supports will meet my needs.  It has the other features, but many I truly don't need that much.  Most likely, it will just sit on my PC opening up the odd differently compressed file that a friend sends me and get little use outside of that.  So for the price, it's a bit higher than I'd normally go for.  However, if you'll use all the features, use Dropbox a lot, want to watermark images, easily convert Word docs to PDF, and want it in a convenient place through a single program, then this one should be a good value for you.	1
WinZip has been around for ages.  Throughout the years the program has gained several features which have made it more of a swiss army knife for power users.  Although there are several freeware programs that provide similar functionality, none provide the all inclusive features that Win Zip does.	1
Love the latest version of this classic tool.  Has all the bells and whistles for a quick, painless tuneup of my PC plus the excellent WinZip functions.  Highly recommended.	1
Some people may not need to zip files, but it does make sending things by email easier or for the storage space thrifty person who may be working with limited resources get a little more bang for the buck.  Things have changed a great deal in the past couple decades space wise, currently most people have huge terrabytes of space to work with so compression isn't as much a necessity as it was 10 years ago or more.  That said, this little bundle of software is handy, and does exactly what its supposed to do.  I'm not sure if the price is good or not but a program set in the 40 buck range does not seem that outrageous.  I understand for those who may not want to pay so much, there are cheaper alternatives, but this one has a very easy to use format and a range of file extensions that it works with so if you don't want to go scrambling about for an a program to zip / unzip or load up your files, this puts everything together in a tidy pile - a useful tool that is fairly easy to work with.  Don't expect technical specs.  I load programs in and follow instructions as best I can, but this didn't seem all that complicated.	1
WinZip 18 is the latest version of the popular zip and compression software from Corel. While there are many free and shareware options available, they aren't always compatible with many systems. 7-Zip, a popular option was used by my company. I had to stop using it because everyone I sent zip files to could not open or read anything compressed with 7-Zip even though many had the program installed on their computers. We never had this problem using WinZip. It is a standard that does work well with virtually any program. I didn't see a large amount of difference between version 17 as opposed to version 18. It is still fast and efficient. I do love the integration with the cloud services. WinZip will zip to Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive (formerly Skydrive from Microsoft), Box, SugarSync and CloudMe. It will also zip to Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn. It also will encrypt your files for protection. The Cloud navigation has been improved, though it was always easy for me to access my Cloud zips before. You can also send links to you zip files in the Cloud if you need to share them. I also love the fact that you can create PDF files from WinZip and add watermarks. That is a great option if you don't have a PDF creator available. You can also create self-extracting zip files for those who don't have a zip program. It handles the usual RAR, 7-Zip, BZ2 and many others. When extracting encrypted files WinZip does auto wipe the temporary files for protection One new feature are the WinZip Express Add-Ons. The new Add-Ons are available for Windows Explorer (in Windows Vista and Windows 7, Windows 8 has replaced Explorer with OneDrive), photos, Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft SharePoint (Enterprise option for work) and photos. As is normal for Corel, only the Add-On for Explorer is free to registered users of WinZip 18. The other options are $12.95 with a discount for registered users of $9.95 at the time of this writing. Although I find WinZip to be the best service for zipping, compressing and encrypting files that I have used, Corel charges for everything now, upgrades to Pro, extra charges for the Add-Ons. I am certain these were separated because inclusion would have made the program more costly and everyone does not need as many features. WinZip has also ballooned to include a wide variety of services besides the base product and you will hear about those after you register your email address (required). It is still the best overall for regular consumers and the easiest to use that works with nearly everything. I still highly recommend it since I have tried several other compressions that are too complicated to use and/or others were not able to read the compressed files. Zipping, compressing and encryption do word much faster and easier with WinZip.	1
I've wanted WinZip software for a couple of decades and now I finally have it.  This software has a wide range of applications built into a single user interface - not just file compression anymore. I admit that I don't have a pressing need to use zipped files except on rare occasions to attach photos and other documents to emails.  JPEG files are highly compressed already.  The typical reduction for me is about 20% overall.  I compressed several text documents and the compression ranged from as much as 90% down to about 24% depending upon the file I chose.  Compression is very fast - only a few seconds typically.  But I have a very fast CPU running at 4.6 GHz.  Conversion to PDF files takes a little longer, but still very fast. It seemed to take longer than it actually did - still measured in seconds of maybe 10 to 15 seconds depending on the file size and content.  I've somehow managed to get by without compression software for thirty years. Hard disks have very high capacity and are relatively cheap these days.  But now that SSDs are becoming ubiquitous in laptop computers, the need to compress files has returned - along with the need for encryption of very sensitive data that most people have loaded on their laptop computers, especially worrisome when traveling. And this software application package includes encryption.  The price is somewhat high for pure compression software, but since they bundled numerous extra applications, the value is fairly good. The included conversion to PDF documents is very useful. Cloud storage can be particularly sensitive.  I for one have avoided cloud storage - very cautious what people might be able to obtain through hacking.  I would definitely want to encrypt most everything I put on public cloud storage.	1
This new version of a classic program does what it is supposed to do. It installed easily on my Windows 7 laptop. It zipped and unzipped sample files with ease. If you use cloud services (SkyDrive, Dropbox, Google Drive,CoudMe, and SugarSync), this will save you upload and download time, as well as storage fees. Links in the program make sharing easier too. Zipping large files can save space on your own hard drives and the program makes that easy. The program will resize images as well as text files, but I think you should use dedicated image programs, even free ones, for resizing. This is the basic edition. The Pro edition offers some features I would love to have, such as PDF backups of email. This is not the Pro edition and it does not include these features. It will open self-extracting files, but it won't create them. If you distribute software, you will need more advanced version. Recommended for those who share a lot of files to Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn, as well as the Cloud.	1
works	1
Windows 7 was purchased to repair a failing operating system.	1
Upgraded to an HP laptop that had 'Vista' installed, and, then installed it to a desktop that originally had Win 7 pro factory installed and was unable to restore after a crash. Inserted the disk and rather quickly both my laptop and desktop were functioning again. Very pleased with this Windows 7 installation.	1
Had to get a 32 bit version for some compatibility issues, but Windows 7 has come a long way. Not a big fan of 8 yet and have seen 10 running but I thing 7 will be the old stand by until tried and tested for a while. Great price and with Amazon Prime was here in two days. Two even means Sunday in my neighborhood.	1
I love Windows 7. It is probably the best operating system Microsoft has ever made. Windows 8 is aweful. I just hope Windows 10 which will be free for Windows 7 and Windows 8 users will be as good as Windows 7	1
Got it...	1
Got it...	1
Update 3/4/15: My HP Pav. Elite  running Win7 Pro died and I was loaded this Win. 7 package, essentially resurrecting it.  I purchased "Win 7 Home Premium SP1 32 (OEM) System" to upgrade an older HP laptop running Vista which I totally hated. And I've very little to say about the experience, except that I loaded the DVD, followed the screen prompts, and now the laptop is running Windows 7 which I like almost as much as XP.  It was as easy as I hoped and, honestly, I'm beside myself; wow! Microsoft actually got something right.	1
I still like XP better as far as the user interface goes and for navigating with Windows Explorer. It's the Start Menu changes that I dislike the most which is why I hate and will not buy Windows 8	1
Installed Windows 7 on a 2006 Dell XPS 400 with 2.8 Ghz CPU and 3 Ggb of RAM.  At first it trashed my machine.  Almost every website would message "website not responding, recover webpage".  Thinking there was a conflict somewhere, I tried everything to fix it.  Finally, I bought additional RAM from Amazon and replaced two 512 Mg memory chips with 1 Gb chips.  Problem solved.  Notwithstanding that Microsoft advises a minimum of 2 Gb of RAM, I suggest not running Windows 7 unless you have at least 4 Gb.  Memory is cheap.  It only cost $20 to upgrade.  However, be advised that some software that ran on XP will not run on Windows 7.	1
Love this program and shoul of keep it going . Great working with it . all of Windows 7 should of stay on the market right now.	1
It came in a sealed package and looked brand new just like your local store. It was great for my old Dell Dimension 4600 computer. Thanks again.	1
It installed without any problem and has worked fine for over a month. As others have noted, the license key is in really, really small print but was readable with a magnifying glass. It's too bad that the license cannot be transferred if my current hardware dies. So, one star off for that.	1
I installed it without a hitch to our newly bought refurb iMac Intel i5.  Now I was able to install Autodesk MEP 2011 drafting software - it runs zippy! (with 12G of RAM)  Note: System builder marries permanently the OS to the hardware.  You can not transfer it to another PC if the PC dies.  Procedure:  Start Boot Assistant.  Fastest way to find it is to use Spotlight (the magnifying glass on top right) and type boot assistant. You will be asked how much you want to divide the memory between Windows 7 and Lion.  I wanted 100G for Windows and about 400G for Mac OS. You will need a USB memory stick or a blank CD or DVD so that the iMac will load the latest additional drivers for your Windows. Insert the Windows disk and install. Done.  Now you have Windows without WiFi and a mismatched display resolution. The next step will fix all of these. Place the USB drive or the CD/DVD.  Find the Setup file and run it.  Done.	1
The product was exactly what was represented.  It was delivered promptly and I am fully satisfied.  I will purchase the product again in the future and recommend it to my associates.	1
Sign up to amson music for a three  mouth sale.	1
I have no complaints about this app absolutely love it	1
App is total junk.  Freezes up with the infamous "beachball" twirling endlessly.  Why pay for Amazon Music subscriptions when their Mac app fails to work?  Who the heck is doing the quality control over at Amazon for this Mac app?  Wake up and fix it, Amazon.  As for now, I'm cancelling my music subscription until this mess is finally fixed.  Are you listening, Amazon?	-1
they was good.	1
Amazon music player did work with my older Mac which is using Mac O.S. 10.4.	1
I've gotten used to Amazon Prime's music offerings from preloaded jazz, light stuff, classical and all others at my desk at work. Nice to finally hear some of the artists I've heard about but never seem to hear. Best, I'm in a bad radio zone, so pulling in music via Amazon is wonderful.  I'll happily renew!	1

My daughter and I have been using Ancestry.com for awhile now. When the opportunity arose to try Family Tree Maker for Mac and have a free 3-month subscription as stated we were tickled pink. We had tons of printed data we have been entering into Ancestry.com that she has been receiving from family members.  We installed the program on a iMac and after the program installed we actually had a bit of a problem locating it. Finally we found it by going to the Macintosh HD icon on the desktop. We followed the directions to sign up for our 3-month free subscription but that did not exist. I had to enter a credit card number and got a 6-moth free trial and after the 6 months if I do not cancel it with in the trial subscription I will be charged $99 for another 6 months of service. So I guess I got a better deal but I made sure to give myself a reminder in case I don't want it to renew itself after the 6-month trial is over.  All I can say about the program it it is worthless. It constantly signs us out and I don't understand why. We enjoyed using the services on Ancestry.com more after signing up for the free trial subscription through the program. My daughter and I spent hours going viewing documents, pictures and hints of possible family members then trying to figure out why the program would not import our information.  Overall all I can say is the program is not very user-friendly and the menu interface confusing to say the least.  However, we did order our DNA kits for the special price offered after signing up for the trial subscription - so that was a bonus!	-1
My daughter and I have been working on the free version on Ancestry.com for a couple months now.  When the opportunity arose to try Family Tree Maker for Mac and have a free 3-month subscription as stated we were tickled pink.  We had tons of printed data we have been entering into Ancestry.com that she has been receiving from family members.  After the program installed we actually had a bit of a problem locating it.

The thing is, genealogy sites and programs work best if you have a stereotypically linear family tree. For example, two of my grandfather's siblings married siblings from another family. So far, I haven't found a way to show that correctly. So far the program is was easy to use and it walks you through the set up very well. I'm going to come back and add more to this review as I get better with it, so please check back. So far, I'd recommend it.	1
I've been using Family Tree Maker for a number of years, mostly on Windows.  So this is my first Mac version, but I've been around the software before and use it extensively with ancestry.com sync features.  At first glance, FTM for the Mac 3 Deluxe seems to be fairly feature complete, on par with the Windows version.  Of course, it's also a bit sluggish, which I've come to expect from the FTM products.  Now, while I have used FTM for a number of years, by no means am I a genealogical expert.  It's all personal use and it often comes in spurts.  I use the software to update a family tree on occasion and likely don't come back to it for several months to a year.  Like other FTM products, it comes with a three month subscription to ancestry.com.  Syncing with the online tree is great and has been much improved over the years.  It does an excellent job of tracking changes and keeping your tree(s) in sync.  The interface is nice with a UI that is easy to navigate.  There are plenty of printing and viewing options.  There are times that grabbing online content and waiting for things to process is sluggish.  Again, I've grown accustomed to this over the years with FTM.  Each version seems to get a little better, but there's often a few quarks to get used to.  Overall, a nice family tree product with syncing and plenty of features to keep you busy on your various genealogical projects.	1
About the time Windows Vista came out, I switched to Macs. For the most part, I never found myself wanting for software offerings unless it was (1) a game or (2) genealogy software. Sure, there was Mac software, but it just didn't appeal to me like FTM for PC did. When a version was finally released for the Mac a few years ago, I was ecstatic, only to be thoroughly disappointed when it turned out to be something like a port of a PC version from years before, and wouldn't even read the PC database file without a sketchy conversion process. Finally, with FTM 3, PC and Mac users are on more or less equal footing. Perhaps the most notable improvement, and the one which appeals to me most, is the fact that the database file is finally "native" for the Mac version. I was able to easily put my PC file on a flash drive and open it with FTM for Mac 3, make some changes, save, and then open it back up on my PC. In fact, I can now just store the file in my DropBox folder and open it on whichever computer I happen to be near. Though I really only have a PC for gaming, I can now comfortably abandon FTM for the PC secure in the knowledge that if something should ever happen and I need access to FTM on a PC, I don't have to jump through any hoops to make things work. I can e-mail the database file to relatives who have a PC without having to worry about losing data in a conversion (and they can send their PC files just as easily). It really is a game-changer for me, and I'm glad I've stuck with FTM long enough to finally see this development (though it should have come years earlier).	1
Others who are experienced in gathering data and building family trees have addressed this program's functionality, so I'm focusing on what it's like for a beginner to start a genealogy project with the aid of this software.  I first tried to work on a family genealogy using the Windows version of Family Tree Maker, but am much more comfortable on a Mac. I'm not sure whether it's my Mac background or differences among the versions, but I am finding Family Tree Maker Mac 3 to be more intuitive to use.  What's working for me thus far was to begin with the family members about whom I knew the most. Because much of the basic research was done, I was able to get comfortable with inputting data and exploring the multimedia and customizable features of the program. I also gained immediate feedback on how to enter and edit effectively, and was able to view my data in various formats.  Working with your data and thinking about what form you want your charts, reports, and books to take is important to consider early in the process so that your work is consistent. Especially if you write narrative sections and include a number of images, the way your materials are output may influence how you choose to write and input images. After I'd finished this step, I made my way back to the product-registration section and registered the software, which began the three-month membership in Ancestry.com that is bundled with the program.  The day you begin, set aside an uninterrupted half-hour to install the program from the enclosed DVD, register it, and download and install any software updates. Although the program ships with a paperback guide, the install disk also contains a PDF file of the guide. If you have space, install it on your computer so you can zoom in on screen shots and other information as you get used to the program.  Entering data is pretty intuitive, and it's pretty simple to toggle between people, even when your list grows. The program's auto-save feature is handy, but if you're working with the program only periodically, you may want to install the program and thus your database on an external hard drive and store it away from your computer. The ability to work on and sync your data among your computer and your iOS devices is a boon, as long as you are comfortable with storing your data on the Ancestry.com website (product materials provide details on data protection).	1
The Family Tree Maker Mac 3 Deluxe genealogy software is simply awesome. After using this product over a period of time, I have grown to really love it. Although I am not a big fan of Ancestry.com I have been able to use this product with the website and it has been beneficial even though I have already traced many of my family lines. There have been some interesting snipits of information gathered from other sources and other people's lines.  I like the way pictures and information can be easily added and it is very easy to use. I have also backed up my family files and transfered them over to my Family Tree Maker program for my PC computer with absolutely no problems. I wish that the pictures I added for the family tree would autocrop themselves so that they filled in the picture square perfectly. As it is the picture doesn't always fill the square and leaves blank sides for rectangle pictures.	1
The software is very easy to use which is fine but my biggest requirement was GEDCOM support.  GEDCOM is the open standard for family tree data.  Do if you need to move the data to another program in the future you should be safe.	1
Ancestry is a fun web site and resource.  I have tried it several times through the years, and it is quite accurate and interesting.  I highly suggest doing this with kids.  They will have something to talk about in school the next day.  The appeal to this product is that it is more of an instructional and tip guide, with helpful software for organizing and reviewing information offline.  But this is a live online experience. You don't need this software, at all, to use the web site.  But it costs the same if you were to pay for three months of site access, so why not get the book and software package?  Since it comes with "3 free months" at ancestry.  The only problem with this service is that it is not cheap.  You do countless hours of research and additions, and you are mainly growing their database, and fixing their errors.  If you stop using ancestry, you lose everything.  If it's worth a minimum of 240 bucks annually, then go right ahead.  In some ways it is worth it, but I believe they should just have the software and access to the site should be free at all times.  Make money on the software instead.  I hate being locked down to anything like this.  The software interface has improved with better navigation, photo and document organization, and easier connective use with the site being able to merge everything.  Get rid of the monthly fee, and it's a 5 star service.	1
Family Tree Maker (FTM) for Mac 3 package includes main software (computer program) in the box and 3-mo membership to Ancestry valued now at $60 ($19.99/mo) making the software alone inexpensive. The program is well designed and easy to use for its very intuitive interface (screen layout). It provides full access to Ancestry's database over the Internet thus necessary to have provided. Unlike FTM for Mac 2, this Mac version 3 has as many features as its PC (MS Windows) equivalent package, which is by far the best of its kind on the market, and set the standard in the field.  Finally, the Mac users are not disadvantaged... much.	1
I installed the software on a Mac OS 10.9.2 system. No problems or error messages were encountered during install or use. The software now has a really great feature set and I felt it was very easy to learn and use. In my opinion this is the best software of its type available for the Mac platform today.  The only shortcoming I see is that only a three month subscription is provided with this version.  I seem to recall much longer was provided in the past.  Overall though this product is excellent and is highly recommended.	1
nice anti virus	1
not good security	-1
Good so far	1
Good	1
This program did not find the viruses that were for sure in my computer, and the popups were VERY frequent and frustratingly pointless. Only used free trial, but I would never pay for this horrible product. Stick with the big names at least they will not waste your money.	-1
Tried to download it but it would not cooperate so I cancelled it.	-1
Great product.	1
Now I know why they call their junk AVAST; because the place is run by a bunch of Pirates that's why! If I could give this Schlock Deal less than ONE STAR I would! This is nothing but shareware that offers more Pop-Ups to sell phony internet security junk than any real protection content. Don't buy this product! Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves make a more trustworthy security software program!	-1
good anti virus being  disabled when I can afford a full  version I will  buy it	1
Works for Mac or Pc but not on widows 10.	1
Loaded quickly.  Doesn't seem to be a huge resource hog like many other anti-virus softwares	1
Excellent	1
Did not like.	-1
Don't know if it is working or not.  Must be because I haven't gotten a notice of problems.  What do you expect "FREE".	1
great	1
good	1
it's chinese spy stuffs.	-1
The protection was not very reliable	1
Works fine, but the settings were a bit tricky and at first things were working VERY slow	1
It was easy to install and already has stop viruses.  I have been using AVG but I think I like Avast a bit better.  It certainly difficult to determine which Antivirus program I like better. Reports have the other Virus programs a being better.  I have used some that literally take over the computer.  You know this is there but it is not bothersome. Interfacing with us humans is very important to me.  So after a month of use I may change all my computers to Avast by the end of the year.	1
Good antivirus for free.	1
There is so much that you can simply say about computers and tablets. We do have all different ways of getting connected with others. But if there is honestly one thing that we do still have to have as a constant is protecting our devices with security software. But which ones you buy, will determine the overall longevity of a computer. There are just so many different ones. But ones that do not cost anything, do not give you the best in value, and just do more harm overall. When I had heard about Avast anti-virus software, I was absolutely concerned to know whether it would hold up with great brands like Norton and Bitdefender. Honestly the free anti-virus software does no good. It actually can scan and try to protect the computer, but honestly the spyware stays in the computer, and doesn't do a hard job in the way that others do at getting the hackers out, and staying out. Overall, I would definitely pass up this anti-virus software from Avast and go find something that definitely does the job at keeping your computer clean.  Price: D  Convience & Setup: F+  Overall: D-	-1
Keep my keyboard protected	1
I don't know if they have changed this software recently, and the great reviews people are giving are based off an earlier version that was much better, or if the reviews are fake. But I do know for sure, this free 2015 software is crap!! If there was a zero star I would give it that! So, I wasn't expecting much given the fact that it is free, but it was much worse than even my really low expectations. If you download this, nearly EVERY feature it has is not usable unless you buy an upgraded version. Even the basic firewall wasn't working unless I paid!! Really? A basic firewall you couldn't even give me that? ALSO it has an option to scan your router to make sure its secure, and it popped up with this message saying my router has been compromised/hacked and its a huge security threat. I was skeptical (given the fact that immediately below this message is another one saying I can solve this problem and keep myself safe by buying such and such on their paid version, blah blah. How convenient right?) But I was still freaked out, called my computer geek buddy to double check this, to see if my router had really been hacked. After thoroughly checking it out he said everything was fine and they were just trying to to scare me into buying their paid services. So I uninstalled this SCAM from my computer and have gone with paid software from another company.	-1
Avast makes a great free product! In December I needed antivirus protection for a Win XP machine when my Norton Security subscription ended. I used another product for my Windows 7 machines, but spotted this free version and it's perfect for this use. As a matter of fact, I am so impressed with it I will definitely evaluate the paid versions when my other service subscription expires.  It seems to function well, doesn't take up a lot of resources and the offers to upgrade or add features are entirely reasonable and don't interfere with the operation or get in your way. This is how to win customers from a free version!	1
I have used this product for 5 months and I'm quite happy with it because it never uses 2-3% CPU unless it's you're using it to actively scan your drives. It's intercepted a few Internet nasties in the time I've had it and kept the health of my system in tiptop shape. Unlike others, mine has NO popup ads that try to get you to buy the full/pay version (probably because mine's an older version of the program).	1
I had forgotten that I tried this a few years back so I tried it again.  In spite of the reviews, I found this program to slow my computer and the various warning screens became tedious.	-1
great for a free antivirus	1
Nice little piece of free software.	1
Update: A day later and I'm still trying to undo the damage. AVG loaded with no issue but there are still others to try.  I've used 'Avast Antivirus' in the past without any difficulty. However, I recently downloaded the free version for the purpose of comparing to other programs prior to purchasing.  During the download it not only crashed my Win7 pro64 system but when I removed it from the PC it took extras with it necessitating the need to use a recovery disc to get back up and running. I don't want to malign Avast as it may have just been a conflict with one of my programs, but, thought I'd give a heads up, anyway.	-1
This free internet security program is only part of an internet security program.  A vital part, but still only a part.  It works very nicely.  I have installed it on two computers.  On one, as expected, there was no threats found.  I did expect some threats on the other, and avast! Free Antivirus 2014 did find them and did neutralize them.  But here is the thing that bothers me: downloading the rest of the program is presently going for just under $20.00 for each computer download.  If you have more than one computer, each one will cost twenty bucks!  I have not purchased it, but I do expect the pay for downloads will be as good as the free download.  Some of those who have paid for this have stated satisfaction. I have nothing to say about program update maintenance, but they have done well so far.  UPDATE 11/02/2014:  I have taken this half way security program off my computers.  The reason is that paying for the parts that are not free - for 3 separate computers - is too expensive in my estimation.  But who wants only half o a security app?  And I just don't like tricky deals. I installed WEBROOT Secure Anywhere in its place.  (This is information, not a recommendation.  My use of Amazon's review system is to convey information; not to be judgmental.  Information and numbers of STARS is meant only to represent my level of enthusiasm about this deal.	-1
Right now avast is better than Norton. I brought Norton and it never found anything on my computer. However, I knew I had a virus, I looked for another antivirus. I was surprise to found a free one here on amazon. I uploaded and right away it found the virus. Give it a try, it's free and it's better than Norton.	1
It made my laptop slow way down and sounded like it was working hard. When I went to uninstall this product it fought me hard to stay installed. It kept trying to reinstall.	-1
real good	1
I was not expecting much from a free download, but I was pleasantly surprised how well this program worked.  It detected and isolated several problems that the previous antivirus missed.  Good job.	1
Avast  works great . I've had less problems since I installed it .	1
Have used this software for years now. My whole family does. Find it doesn't take away from the computers performance. Have kept our computers virus free.	1
Catches malware that MSE does not. Removes viruses in emails that MSE does not. Works well, and updates are frequent. Pretty good stuff.  However, I have seen it prevent certain websites from working correctly in certain situations so its not trouble-free, but it should work fine for most people.	1
Only a limited trial version is "free".  I bought the software for 1 year & started having problems with my computer right away.  Their customer service by phone was not satisfactory- they did not solve my problem or even try.  They do not back up their product with any guarantee.  DO NOT WASTE YOU TIME OR MONEY!!	-1
I like the Free Avast Antivirus 2014.  I have tried several antivirus products. Most of them work well, but I find Avast is the best I have used so far.  It is very easy to use and so far it has keep me safe.  I live in a adult retirement community and Avast is one of a couple that is recommended to use. It doesn't jam up my hard drive.  I give it a 4 and 1/2.  There is always room for improvement that is why I didn't give it a complete 5.  I recommend Avast.	1
works as stated	1
There are many antivirus options out there, but avast! continues to lead the pack as the best FREE offering, followed by AVG and a few others. I picked up this download for a PC that had a paid antivirus software subscription that had run out.   Installation was quick and easy, and the software runs quietly in the background - not really taking up any system resources. You do need to read carefully during the process however, to uncheck certain things to prevent them from being installed on your system. (Toolbar, etc... is offered, but you just make sure it's deselected and all's well.)  This product in combination with the free version of Malwarebytes, makes for a wonderful alternative to McAfee, Norton and others for basic PC protection against virus'.  While it's not as full featured as some security suites, it's very good at what it does and you can't beat the price.	1
Yes, this software is free and all that but it's just a limited protection package. To get it all costs around $30. I'm going to delete it and put Webroot back on my computers.	-1
quick to download, simple to install, no viruses or other nasty stuff comes along for the ride.. love it much	1
Bad	-1
no  test drive yet	-1
Will not install AVG finds Malware	-1
A very good program for free use.	1
Great product just use https://www.moviestudiozen.com/ for great tutorials.  I work in the IT Field and used this to edit and render tutorials on how to use our products.  Seems to me the PC equivalent of iLife suite for PC.  Without having to pay the pricier cost of owning a mac.  I am not anti-Mac I work on both platforms, just cite cost for my opinion.	1
Many users are moving over from Vega, however, I'm moving over from a different software company altogether (Corel) and to be honest, didn't expect too much from this video editing suite. I was pleasantly surprised.  I mainly create short videos, mainly of the tutorial variety, and this had an easier learning curve than Corel. Don't get me wrong, though, there's still a steep learning curve, but at least the "help" is actually helpful.  The suite offers a slew of effects (many of which I'll admit to not having tried simply because they don't apply to me), but they do have the basic transitions one is likely to use--fade, cross fade, so forth--it allows for adding subtitles/close-captioning, and for doing voiceovers.  Finally, rendering video was relatively speedy. To render a 15min. mpg took less than 5 minutes which was delightful, and the couple hour long features I needed to edit required about 30 minutes apiece. Your mileage may vary. While this may not be a Hollywood grade editing suite, it will certainly meet basic needs for short videos, especially of the home or to-be-viewed-on-youtube variety.	1
We do have a touch screen computer (an HP Envy) ,  so I liked that the software was optimized to use with touch.  I've been using Pinnacle's video editing software for the last few years. I think that the software is pretty user friendly. I'm not especially technical,  but I was able to get the software figured out fairly easily. I thought the additional music/sound editing software was a helpful addition. It was easy to import video files (I have a few different Sony cameras and compatibility was not an issue at all). I also liked that it was easy to share the completed videos on social media.	1
Not everyone can afford thousands of dollars for Final Cut or Adobe products. With this suite, Sony offers a fairly extensive video editing suite for a decent price. For the vast, vast majority of users this software will be sufficient for video editing. I think this program is a great place to start for any beginner or intermediate level editor. You can always upgrade to Final Cut or Adobe later if your needs outpace this software. In the meantime, this is a solid program for a great price and I highly recommend it.	1
The Sony Movie Studio Suite is a powerful program for video editing novices. You can create awesome home movies without having to be an expert. The package comes with a whole slew of tools if you want to get creative, but the standard set of instructional videos will get you started making your own videos. Final Cut Pro is a much more robust product, but if you are a beginner, this is a good choice.	1
Pros: -affordable video and audio editing software that's fairly easy to use -comprehensive detailed tutorials - definitely worth spending the time going through these if you're new to Sony -impressive special effects -very intuitive interface -gives you all the necessary tools to create great videos without overwhelming you with unnecessary features  Cons: really none in my mind! I don't think there's anything in this price range that is comparable and unless you're a pro looking for all the bells and whistles, this software provides all the capabilities/features you'll need.	1
I've used Movie Studio before and found it effective and rock steady - version 13 is no different, though the learning curve can be a bit steep.  Installation was a breeze and went quickly. Startup is relatively fast, and once in the program you're presented with  multiple ways to get started, tutorials, etc. Help bubbles are on by default, which is helpful.  As far as functionality, the program just works. Once you get your head around how to use it (there are plenty of tutorials out there to help) the workflow makes sense and things move along quickly. It handles all relevant formats, including 4K video, which is fantastic. The included filters and plugins are extensive and useful, and really I can't see most users outgrowing this software unless you're moving into a professional setting.  Then you've got music - which is a huge bonus. In addition to Sound Forge, which is an incredibly solid and useful music editing program, Acid Music Studio is included, which makes it relatively easy and fun to create your own music for your video projects.  Frankly, I'm blown away by how much value is in this package - great video editing, audio editing, audio recording/creation and dvd authoring that would destroy far more expensive programs that were out only a few years ago. To get this package at this price is a steal, and I can recommend it wholeheartedly.	1
Sony hits a home run with this software.  For around $100 I get a video editing program, DVD authoring program, audio recording program and audio creation program.  4 programs worth over $300 for $100.  No other software company does this type of package yet... and definitely not at this price.  After 4 weeks of playing with these programs (I use Sony's higher end professional software for my business) I can easily give it 5 stars and a recommendation.  The only other comparable video software is Corel VideoStudio X7 Ultimate ($60-$100).  I can't recommend any audio software to match.  The bottom line is - Sony gives you everything you need in this 4-software package to edit your videos and author them on DVD or Blu-ray discs, and to edit your audio files or create brand new ones.  The add-on loops, sound and video effects, make this a complete package with nothing left out and nothing left to purchase.  You just can't top this.  And Sony software - in my professional opinion - excels in this field.  I record and edit movies as part of my business and Sony Vegas Pro has been my preferred software since 2012, when I switched from Adobe Premiere Pro.  I preferred Sony's interface (much easier to use and to apply effects from the library) and the significantly lower rate of software crashes.  I may have experienced 3 software crashes with Sony in well over 1,000 hour of use since 2012.  With Abode, my software would crash at least once per month.  I'm sure Adobe had improved their software over the years, but this experience was enough to shift me to Sony's professional video software.  Since 2012, I have extremely happy and doubt that I will go back to any other brand.	1
I use many video editing suites and I do have a favorite that has year in and year out proven its worth. It has the power with the ease of use. Sony Movie Studio has always offered some power but at a cost...learning curve. The new version is no exception but this is the most stable and powerful release yet.  I like how you can full customize your workspace compared to the mostly static view of competing programs. This is a very nice feature and gives me quick access to my most needed options.  Sony offers a lot of power compared to other suites. Not only can you now edit 4K videos, but new options include being able to just render a part of your video. This comes in handy if you only need to send a clip.  You also get a lot of value with Sony Movie Studio. You get 4 programs: Movie Studio 13 Platinum, ACID Music Studio 10, Forge Audio Studio 10, DVD Architect Studio 5. All of them have their use and merit though I've always found DVD Architect Studio difficult to used compared to say, Adobe Premiere Elements.  But as a video enthusiast, I like having options and the more I use Movie Studio 13, the more I can recommend it.	1
This software comes with some helpful tutorials that are very useful in learning the software. It took very little time to download and set up compared to some other video editing software. It also does not pause or crash like my Pinnacle software or the generic Windows movie making software.   Simple mode is not designed for major video editing like transitions and text editing. It's made for cutting your clips to size. The advanced mode is useful and provides the major video editing features. The features like trim start, trim end and split are useful as they bring down the editing time significantly over some more basic software. Being able to view all components of the video like audio, video, music track really helps sync the video to the music beats.  Some simple features are intuitive and easy to use to make a quick video. Speeding up a shot, being able to crop the video frame, you can add transitions to video, add text and transitions to text, filters that change picture quality and add vignettes make a simple video sparkle. I have not yet used all the other more advanced features in ACID music studio and SoundForge that allow you to edit audio and music track and record high-def sound on your PC.  Overall, I like the software as it's non-glitchy and easy to use with many features for the amateur video editor.	1
I installed this on a computer running Windows 8.1 64-bit with an Intel i7 processor. No problems with the install and no stability issues with the video editing program to date. But I am having significant problems importing media. Apparently, for example, not all MP4 files are created equal as far as this program is concerned. Or MOV files either. Some open. Some dont. I know quite a bit about video formats and I haven't called Sony Tech Support yet because I am trying to figure out the issue son my own.   This is a nice video editor for beginners or more experienced editors who are looking for simplified workflow to turn out smaller projects faster (assuming you can import your video). The User Interface has a very clean deign and is reasonably intuitive. Making life somewhat easier for newer editors is having a Simple Edit mode and an advanced edit mode.   I was able to knock out a small, simple project pretty quickly without needing to consult the Help file.   Sony has produced some interesting add-ons that are available as downloads at modest cost. In my opinion, a few of the add-ons should have been built into the program, but others represent excellent value, so I guess it balances out.   I admit to being focused on the media imkport problem since files from some of cameras cant be imported without being converted first, which annoys me. Also, I have not ued the auxillary programs yet.   My initial impression, however, is that the video editor is excellent for new editors and for more experienced editors seeking more efficient workflow. This version won't replace adobe Premiere Pro  and isn't intended to  but it will do a fine job in handling the footage from your cameras and crafting a fairly complex video project without an overly steep learning curve.   I like it and will be coming back to it once I resolve my media import issues.  Jerry	1
Sony usually has excellent software to bring to the table, and they're keeping that trend going with the Sony Movie Studio 13 Suite. Installed on a Microsoft Windows 8 Professional machine with an Intel Core i7 processor, this editing suite is super stable and leverages the multi-core and hyper-threading features very well making this suite very efficient and fast.  The various editing tasks are assigned to their own editing programs within the suite, making each editing task such as audio, video, and so-forth more focused with better working features that aren't just all clumped together and inefficient. Sony allows you to focus on the specific task at hand without distractions, and the navigation through the various settings and tools is very intuitive and easy.  If you do a lot of video editing, this suite will end up saving you a lot of time in the long run because of it's efficient and well laid out design that lends itself to a smoother workflow. Bear in mind, however that is a more simplified, consumer oriented suite that is meant to provide with both the basics and quite a few extras, without over-encumbering the suite with a lot of professional level features that most people wouldn't be able to take advantage of, but also without stripping out too many of the features, making this a very well balanced editing suite perfect for the beginner and advanced hobbyist alike.	1
Movie Studio 13 is incredibly intuitive and its user interface is pretty "standard." By "standard," I mean if you've ever used the free Microsoft Movie Maker (that comes with Windows) and are familiar with basic multi-track movie editing and timeline concepts, you'll have no problem picking up Movie Studio. It's. That. Easy.  If you've never used a movie editing software before, start with the free Microsoft Movie Maker and seek out free tutorials on that free (albeit advert-laden) video site. THEN, come back to Movie Studio 13. The basic concepts are the same -- so you'll have no problem transitioning to Movie Studio.  Movie Studio 13 Suite is of course A LOT more powerful than Movie Maker. The Suite comes with Movie Studio 13 (for editing movies), Sound Forge Audio Studio 10 (for editing sound files), DVD Architect Studio 5.0 (for creating and authoring DVD/Blu-ray Discs), and Acid Music Studio 10 (for creating soundtracks for your movie -- includes 1 GB of high quality sounds/music you can mix to your heart's content). So, you see, Movie Studio 13 Suite contains a very powerful and complete suite of tools to enable you to produce PROFESSIONAL-grade videos.  If you're debating whether you should get&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Sony-Movie-Studio-13/dp/B00I3MTI9Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Sony Movie Studio 13</a>&nbsp;(basic stripped down version),&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Sony-Movie-Studio-13-Platinum/dp/B00I3MSBC6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Sony Movie Studio 13 Platinum</a>&nbsp;(a cut above the basic version), or this version of Sony Movie Studio (Sony Movie Studio Suite 13), I'd strongly recommend you swing for Sony Movie Studio Suite 13. Dollar for dollar, you get a lot more for what you pay when you buy the Suite version of Movie Studio.  Some features that I love about Sony Movie Stuidio 13:  + Fully Customizable Workspace The Workspace contains the following panels that you can optionally turn on or turn off:  Explorer, Trimmer, Master Bus, Video Preview, Project Media|Transitions, Video FX, Media Generators, Device Explorer. To do so, go to View/Window and select Explorer|Trimmer|Master Bus|Video Preview|Project Media|Transitions|Video FX|Media Generators|Device Explorer. Each panel is resizable and can be rearranged to suit your preferences.  + Easy And Intuitive User Interface You can drag and drop your resources (video clips, sound files, images, etc) right from Windows explorer into the tracks.  + Easily Apply Effects (To One Or More Tracks At A Time) You can Link and Unlink each track (e.g. Video, Audio, Music) and apply Fade in, Fade Out, transitions, and other effects to all tracks all at the same time (Ctrl-click to select each track). Similarly you can perform other operations like splitting, cuting/copying/pasting multiple tracks at the same time.  + Make All Or Part Of Your Video Movie allows you to rendering (or make) all or PART of your video into WMV, MOV, MPEG-2, MP4, or AVCHD files. To do so, select a region, go to Make Movie, and check Render Loop Region Only. I find the option to render only part of the movie immensely useful because I often find myself debating whether to include a particular sound or movie clip. With the option to render only part of the project, I can make quick changes at a later time by either incorporating or omiting elements in the final cut.  + Movie Studio supports 4K videos 4K videos are ultra high definition videos FOUR TIMES the resolution of 1080p/Full HD movies. When 4K videos become the de facto standard for high-definition videos, you know you'll be ready.  --- Movie Studio 13 Suite is a superior movie editing software that's equipped to help you produce professional-grade videos WITH EASE. I really, really love it.  If you're new to Movie Studio or if you're trying to decide if the new Movie Studio 13 Suite is worth the upgrade, I'd recommend you download and install the 30-day free trial of the programs that comprise the Movie Studio Suite (Movie Studio Platinum, DVD Architect Studio, Sound Forge Audio Studio, and ACID Music Studio). These are available for download at "sonycreativesoftware com-download-trials-moviestudiopp" (replace the space with "." and each "-" with "/" to reconstitute the Web address). You have 30 days to try out the programs to see for yourself if the Movie Studio Suite is worth purchasing.	1
The first thing I noticed about this program is that opposed to say Nero or Roxio it is pretty hard to get in the computer, you have to input about a dozen licenses to get it all set up. However once you finally get it in, it is a superior program that will allow you to do cool things that other video suites and burning software just can't compete with,	1
I'm not a movie pro.  I can barely manage to crop a photo.  This program isn't going to turn me into a movie editor but it does let me edit videos and assemble them in a coherent format.  I still have some things to learn to spruce them up more.	1
I absolutely enjoyed using Sony Movie Studio 13 suite.  It installed without any grief and was intuitively simple to use considering I've used several similar applications and am becoming increasingly skilled with many apps included within my Adobe CC subscription.  Sony Movie Studio 13 Suite is aimed for the audience who is more into social media (it's very easy to share completed videos directly to FB!)  If you don't need some less used pro level tools of Premiere Pro (and After Effects), and want to OWN the software instead of leasing it at approximately $50 / month, then Sony Movie Studio is definitely worth a consideration.  The included Sony Sound Forge Audio Studio 10 is an added bonus for editing, mixing and blending audio tracks. The vocal eraser allows karaoke tunes to be created from more traditional audio sources.  My audiophile spouse was VERY pleased with the audio recording and editing ability - not exactly my area of expertise, but if he's happy then I'm happy.	1
THE QUICK TAKE:  The Sony Movie Studio 13 Suite provides a bundle with a lot of features for a very reasonable price.  If you're looking for software that can handle a wide range of tasks, and are willing to put some time into learning how to use it, it's a very good choice.  FULL REVIEW: I find I form long-term relationships with software. ;-) Personally, I don't want to invest the time in learning my way around a particular piece of software only to bump into its limitations - to find out that it doesn't perform, or is lacking important features.  So I usually narrow my options to proven software with a balance of performance and usability, but with a bias toward features and performance.  If that fits your needs, Sony Movie Studio 13 is a good option.  SIMPLE VS ADVANCED:  Movie Studio does have the option to choose a Simple or Advanced interface, so it may help the transition for those looking to start by using a limited range of features, and have the ability to switch to the Advanced interface later on.  (Or not - the software is a good value even without using all the features. I know I'll never use all of them.)  VERY GOOD SOUND EDITOR: SoundForge offers a nice range of features if you need to do additional editing on the sound.  You can read reviews for it at the Amazon page for&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Sony-Sound-Forge-Audio-Studio-10/dp/B003L51CUI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Sony Sound Forge Audio Studio 10</a>.  Note that it is not a multi-track editor.  Besides the video and audio editor, a lot of other features are included.  But those are the two components I use, and those alone make it worthwhile for me.  TOUCH ENABLED:  It's also not a feature I use, but if you're interested in touch enabled editing, it's a new feature in Movie Studio 13, so you may want to look into reviews of that feature.  CHECK YOUR HARDWARE:  Sony provides hardware requirements that are somewhat useful with respect to graphics cards (you need a reasonably good one).  I wish they'd provide better  guidance on that, and with respect to processor and RAM. As far as I can tell, they provide the hardware requirements for editing low-res video.  Sure, the software might run on that hardware, but that's not what people are buying this software to do.  I have a&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/EVGA-GeForce-GTX-750/dp/B00IDG3NDY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">EVGA GeForce GTX 750</a>&nbsp;in a desktop with an i5 3450 processor (mid- to upper-level i5) and 32GB of RAM. While you might not need that much RAM, I'd suggest installing at least 8GB to 12GB if you can.	1
I was surprised at the product, being that it is quite impressive, but yet, seems very intimidating, and moreso, it is intimidating if you don't have an iota of what and how the program works.  It is easy to download.  And, I have never seen such long key numbers for entry, but fear not, if you lose your place, you are prompted if you made an error.  I don't think the average person will know how to work this software.  The online tutorials are very helpful, explaining what each section on the interface screen does.  But, aside from that, it has a ton of info, and interactive buttons to select.  So, if you struggle with average software, and don't have experience doing this, you will struggle for sure.  This software is for the experienced, and I am not the experienced ......Rizzo	1
I'm able to take advantage of two of the three programs included. Not being a composer the ACID component is beyond my talents. On the other hand working with video is relatively easy in Movie Studio 13  and creating CDs from  audio from multiple sources or from your video ( I specialized in performance videos) is also relatively easy in Sound Forge. I was bit disappointed that the Suite didn't include Vegas as I've been anticipating comparing it to  similar programs, but  based on what is included I find the SONY products a bit more user friendly. Recommended!	1
I have always used Microsoft Office products and when they switched over to the subscription based approach, I wasn't sure if I would like that.  Well it turns out that it's not so bad as you always stay up to date.  If you like the idea of just buying it once then this isn't for you.  They still sell it so that you can install it on one PC (or tablet) so you would have to buy it for every device.  The subscription based version has a one PC/Tablet or 5 PC/Tablet option.  As far as the products included, they have thus far worked just as expected.	1
I renew this every year. It's great. It lets me use Microsoft word & I can then create documents as I need them. Highly recommend.	1
No problems renewing my subscription with this code.	1
This was a "code" for Office 365 for MS10/64Pro. Worked perfectly.  Very good cost savings!	1
This key card will help you set up a Microsoft account from which you can download and install the software. But it cannot be used to extend or 'stack' more years to your account. It will reject the numbers from more of these keycards if you try them. You have to buy additional years from Microsoft, or any company authorized to sell them.  I have used Office 2010, and Office 2016 (which is what Office 365 installs) is similar enough to be easy to adjust to. And it seems smarter, and its obviously an improvement.  However, Outlook 2016 doesn't like my SBS2003 Exchange service. Its at end of life, but its all I have. I have to configure outlook 2016 manually for pop3 and smtp. If you select the automatic 'Exchange' option of connecting to the server, Outlook will stop working. When that happens, you have to close Outlook, open the 'Mail' control panel and create a pop3 account, make it the primary account, then delete the Exchange account. whew!  If you have a current version of Exchange, you won't need to worry. It works perfectly with those.  Office 2016 itself is very nicely done. It looks and works great in Windows 10.	1
What can you say, its microsoft.	1
PERSONAL installs on one pc and two other devices. the home version installs on up to 5 computers/devices. 1yr renewable license	1
MS has a little surprise for you AFTER you purchase and begin install. Upon attempting to download i got the message that Mavericks is incompatible with Office 2016 and you will have to "upgrade" to Yosemite or download a previous version of OFFICE 365 PERSONAL. Office is Yosemite restricted.	-1
I am very pleased with the availability of Office 365 for 1 PC, and I am even happier with the reasonable price for a 1 year license. I purchased this for my granddaughter's PC, and by this time next year she will be in college and can take advantage of the discount Microsoft offers for the Student edition of this software. We only wanted and needed a license for 1 year and just for 1 PC, so this product satisfied that need perfectly. Consumers should be aware that this particular version does not come with any installation DVD's. It is simply a code on a card that allows you to activate your license and then to download and install the software from Microsoft. Last year at this time we had to purchase the 3 PC license, because that was all Microsoft had available. I am happy they expanded their Office 365 product line to better serve the needs of their customers.	1
Office 365 is a good product that delivers near desktop capability to a web based version of office. You get to spread your cost of ownership over many months instead of a large upfront cost.  For those people that lightly edit a word document every now and then and do minor writing, then Office 2010 or even 2007, might be plenty for you. I am sure you can find a copy on ebay or amazon ... for those that need much more robust capability and spend many hours a week on Office Software, then this type of model is great. You get updated versions in a continuous fashion, and get robust desktop and web versions of software that can handle a vast amount of work.  Overall, I like the new options that Microsoft has taken, and if this type of deal doesn't suit you, you can always purchase the full version. It just costs a bunch of front.	1
This product seems good for what it does - able to be installed on one desktop/laptop and one mobile device.  It seems more full featured than the free google office apps, but it should be for the price tag associated with it.  It will be interesting comparing the two going forward.  Installation didn't take too long, less than 10 minutes.  It took me a couple of minutes to figure out how to launch the office suite from inside the browser.	1
Microsoft Office is a vital program to have on any computer.  For work, for school, it's absolutely essential.  Even on a completely personal computer, chances are someone will send you a Word file at some point.  You want the real deal, actual Office, not some knock-off.  The functionality is just that much better with Microsoft Word.  That being said, I don't see the purpose of Office 365.  I do not like the concept of a subscription service for essential software.  You're better off just buying a copy of Office 2010 that will last you for years instead of a copy of 365 that will only last you 1 year.	1
Since Microsoft Office has virtually no competition and is pretty much required for students, workers and those who partake in the 21st century, it's not especially surprising that they are now embracing the annual fee concept. With this 'Personal' edition you are allowed access for 1 year on 1 computer and 1 tablet. Upgrading to the 'Home' edition allows access on up to 5 computers. It's basically a rip-off, but since Office Suites become outdated so quickly it's not as bad as it sounds. At least with this you can get continual updates as they come along.  But now that I've griped about the subscription, let me say that I am fairly impressed with the 2014 upgrade. The SkyDrive Cloud concept is obviously the most notable change, allowing you to save directly to your online storage space rather than to the hard drive. I think this is a great way keep documents updated and accessible anywhere without having to e-mail yourself the files or trying to remember which version is which. Very cool.  Other than that, you'll find mostly cosmetic upgrades that will take some time getting used to and don't serve a lot of purpose, but do look nice. There are some really cool new templates, especially in Excel, that are worth checking out.  OVERALL: Although the subscription fees rub me the wrong way, I love the save-to-cloud upgrade that Office 365 offers and am a fan of some of the new content/layouts. As everyone knows, Office is a must-have for pretty much everything we do in the world nowadays, and it is fabulous software. If you don't care about the cloud, however, don't feel like you have to rush out and upgrade. The new perks are hardly revolutionary, merely cool at best.	1
Office 365 is Microsoft's latest bright idea for how to get us to subscribe to the software we once bought.  For $49 a year you get Office 2013 on a PC or Office 2011 on a Mac, plus more-robust versions of the tablet/phone versions of Office than you get for free.  You also get 1TB of space in Microsoft's cloud and the ability to sync a doc from anywhere you edit it.  Sort of like a keychain USB drive, except no physical drive.  Plus some Skype minutes.  1TB of space is nothing to sneeze at, and paying an annual fee for drive space is industry standard practice.  For me the installation on the PC went fine even though I had Word 2010 already.  I am happy with the features added in 2013 over 2010, particularly for Excel.  The iPad version is about as good as you might expect, and with Office 365 you get to edit docs from OneDrive.  So far so good.  But does it make sense to go for this version?  If you have lots of devices, get Office 365 Home, which supports installs on 5 devices.  If you don't trust Cloud storage and don't need OneDrive and syncing, search out the regular Home and Office or Home and Business versions; one purchase price covers you forever, or until hardware/OS incompatibilities end that dream.  If, at the end of my subscription year I have actually used OneDrive a lot, I'll renew using my own money.  If I like the 2013 version of Office enough but don't use the cloud storage, I'll buy a permanent license for 2013....assuming they still sell such a thing.  I hope they do.  At the retail level, rental software benefits the vendor far more than the buyer.	1
Quick note: In places the box says you get 20 GB of storage, but that's been bumped up to 1TB instead. Pretty significant increase.  Also, I would say NOT to buy this for college students without checking in with them first. There are many Universities who offer completely free access to this software if students want it, so they may have no use for a separate license.  Those things said, this is actually a fairly decent offering, particularly if you buy the key card version that can be discounted. (I'm under the impression the card counts as a physical product, and can be discounted freely, but just a code alone is a digital sale and will tend to stay at full price. It's odd, but that's how it seems to work).  There are actually several other excellent alternatives to Microsoft Office now, including LibreOffice and Google Docs. So, this is much less in the "many people MUST have it" category than it once was. The competition has pushed Microsoft to offer a better product and at more reasonable prices.  You can download a copy for your computer, use it online, and install a copy onto a tablet as well. That's pretty good for being able to access documents from just about anywhere.  A lot of people can still probably comfortably get by with the purely free options, like Google Docs. This is a lot better than it used to be, though, and once you account for the online storage space and the Skype minutes, it's really not a terrible deal.	1
Office 365 is what I've been using for my email and documents for over a year now.  It's great to have access to all of my files, with the ability to edit and share them, from wherever I go. Getting a subscription card just makes it that much easier, so you don't have to worry about reoccurring payments - it's a great gift for a college student!	1
This is all you would expect from an Office program. I agree with what others have written about the details of this program. The one thing I would add is that the program is not available for the Kindle Fire platforms. It would be nice if Microsoft could add this as an option for those of us with Kindle tablets. Works nice on my Android phone, though!	1
I've been using Video Studio Pro for the last three iterations.  This easily is the best revision to date.  I'm using this on a machine I built with an AMD FX-8320 (eight core) processor with 16 gb of RAM.  I'm using Windows 8.1 64-bit.  The 64-bit code runs fast on the computer, and it renders video quickly.  I'm finding that it will render 1080p video in MP4 format about twice as quick as X6 did.  That's a great software-driven upgrade.  The interface has minor tweaks that have made it somewhat more intuitive than prior versions, especially for exporting projects to video, etc.  The feature set is largely the same as prior versions.  You can do quite a lot with this software and don't have to be a rocket scientist to do it.  That said, Adobe's products offer some additional functionality for true power users.  Overall, I continue to recommend this as a reasonably priced video editor.  It's faster and more stable than before, and improvement is always welcome.	1
The interface for using the Corel Video Studio Pro X7 is very complex, but I suspect the features are worth learning when I have the time, but do not buy this as an easy photo editor to make just common fixes.  For that purpose it is overly complex unless I have overlooked a menu control setting.	1
I had a good first impression with the program. The user interface was simple and intuitive, the editing capabilities and features were powerful enough for my needs, and the performance was generally without hiccups. However, that soon came to crashing halt when I imported video files longer than a few minutes, and tried using the audio editing features. Clicking the sound mixer button, the program just hangs with a "loading wave data" message, and gets stuck there indefinitely. My computer is a quad-core Intel Core i7 with 12 GB RAM, Windows 7 Pro, so the system is fast enough for video editing. In other programs like Blender, it takes a few seconds to draw wave data. In Corel VS7, it just chokes. Unless Corel actually fixes such a gross oversight, I have no choice but to uninstall the software and look for an alternative.	-1
All the bells and whistles of the big boys brands, and certainly does the job. But, if you want to work in the professional field, you need Adobe Premiere, or AVID.  However, Corel VideoStudio Pro packs an awesome punch. Fast editing, even in 4K, enhanced extras like visual effects and templates to make quick projects a snap.  If you have no video software, you can't beat the price, and you will learn the techniques and hone your edit skills. Then you can upgrade.  If you just want to make the most killer holiday video letter to family and friends, this is totally it!!! I have my 11 year old working on it now and he's mastered it. Its just that easy!	1
I'm still learning how to use this so I'm not as comfortable with it as I'd like, but it's a very powerful video studio that I wouldn't recommend to newbies (unless a tutor comes with it!).	1
I've always liked Corel software, and this was no different. Installation was a breeze. I found the workspace to be intuitive and easy to follow and was pleasantly surprised by the overall performance and speed of the program. Having a slightly older machine that I did not build with video editing or rendering in mind, I was happy to find that this was not sluggish at all. It has the features that most amatuer video editors would need.	1
I don't do a lot of fancy stuff with videos, so for my purposes the product fit my needs. Simple editing with simple to use tools that didn't cause me to stress out about where certain basic features were.  The price is well worth it.	1
Ive used Roxios products for years to make home movies, always cursing at the lack of support and system crashes, and wish I had found this piece of software a lot earlier.  Its easy to use, your home movies covert over to record pretty quick, and I haven't a system crash or issue with Windows 8.  Installation was easy.  If you make a lot of home movies of your family events, etc., I would recommend this one.	1
Corel has really done it this year.  We see the most significant update since years with X7 and many more useful add-ons.  Here's what's new for Ultimate X7.  *** At the end of the review I'll compare X7 Ultimate to X7 Pro ***  UPDATE #1 - 64-Bit processing. This is huge!  All previous versions were 32-bit, meaning that the new 64-bit X7 can process videos at twice the power.  To get a grasp on this concept, think of your computer processor as being a tube that can either be 32 or 64 inches wide. When you have the smaller 32 inch size, less information can flow through and the tube is more likely to  full and "bottleneck". Bottlenecks are when the maximum information is flowing through the tube.  This causes other processing to slow down and your system to load slower because each process has to wait for the others to finish before it can begin. If you 64 inch wide tubes, then there is 2x as much room for information to pass through before the computer bottlenecks and slows down.  Some people online ran some speed tests and they found that the new VideoStudio X7 beats last year's VideoStudio X6 by rendering up to 68 percent faster for HD multitrack projects with hardware acceleration, up to 153 percent for 4K projects, and up to 854 percent with smart rendering (processing only the changed regions of the video.  This is nearly twice to more than twice as fast as last year for standard rendering and nearly 9 times as fast for smart rendering (less processing done on each video when rendering, more carryover from original video clip).  These are amazing gains!  Since Windows 7, most computers are running 64-bit Windows.  Now Corel is running at 64-bit as well.  This is the greatest improvement - beyond all the add-ons and plug-ins.  This is a true core software update.  This is alone is enough to want any user of Corel VIdeoStudio (any version) to upgrade to X7. Thanks Corel!  UPDATE #2 New HD add-ons and effects.  Since the software is now 64-bit, Corel has given us higher resolution (1920 x 1080) HD templates, backgrounds, and color patterns.  UPDATE #3 - FastFlick.  This feature is aimed at the beginner video user or people wanting to spend less time making videos.  FastFlick is a one-click processing feature that adds may effects, themes, transitions, etc onto a single video, series of video clips or series of photos...immediately processing it and rendering it as a brand new stylized video.  Basically, select your own videos or photos, then select the FastFlick theme you want, click start and come back to a completed final video that is ready to upload and watch.  UPDATE #4 - Cleaner Layout.  This is a minor change, but still important enough to list.  They cleaned up the layout / video editing screen to give us more space, less clutter.  The look is not closer to Corel Paintshop, making it easier for a person to use both softwares.  UPDATE #5 -  Discovery Center Video Tutorials.  This feature I really like. There are so many features to VideoStudio X7 that discovering them all on your own is very unlikely.  The video tutorials in the Discovery Center (access by a little blue button at the top right toolbar) guide a person through many of the great features and quickly teach anyone how to use the software.  I personally love video tutorials over written tutorials (which Corel also includes as PDFs, accessible through the main menu as well).  Watching the process is better than reading about it.  So here you have it - the top 5 new updates for Corel VideoStudio X7!  DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ULTIMATE X7 and PRO X7 VERSIONS  VideoStudio Pro X7 vs. VideoStudio Ultimate X7  These two versions are basically the same except that Ultimate X7 gives you 7 special effects apps that are not in the Pro version.  All of these are very high quality, helping you to create more professional looking videos.  Other than that, the software is identical..  1) NewBlue FX ColorFast - Color correction tools to improve the look of the video (either more realistic color corrections or more abstract - you control it).  2) NewBlue FX Motion Effects - Over 100 preset motion effects to create some very creative looks.  3) Boris Graffiti 6 - A large collection of titles and graphics.  4) proDAD Mercalli SE - Video stabilization plus advanced features that create the shaky camera effects that are very popular in today's videos.  5) proDAD VitaScene LE - Even more transitions, filters and film-style effects.  6) proDAD Handscript Animation - Handwriting effects that animate as the video plays - such as signing a signature.  Great for titles.  7) proDAD RotoPen - Rotoscope style animated effects for maps, graphics and photos. Rotoscope is where the video turns into a sketchpad or animated cartoon look.  So this is a lot of great features to get for only $20. Get Ultimate.  MY PERSONAL OPINION  The long story short.  3 years ago (with Corel VideoStudio X5) I switched over from using Adobe Premiere Elements and I haven't looked back.  I use the Corel VideoStudio software about once every week or two for 3-4 hours, plus periods of daily use when I have larger projects.  I like to get the newest version each year because Corel is always adding more plug-ins, effects, filters, etc.  The bottom line is Corel VideoStudio is the best bang for your buck and a flawless performer.  I feel it blows away Adobe Premiere Elements and the other $100-ish video software.	1
I use several different tools for editing video: Premiere Pro, VideoStudio and even MovieMaker. Ask me which product is most powerful and I would list these three in the same order. If I were to list these products based on ease of use, that list would be reversed. VideoStudio is somewhere in the middle.  You can do many of the fancy editing techniques but without the Swiss Army knife complexity of Premiere Pro. I honestly think VideoStudio is going to start becoming much more prevalent due to Adobe's licensing change.  Many customers want to buy an own software,  not rent it by the month.  For them VideoStudio is very attractive option.  From the X6 release this software has many refinements and the performance feels noticeably faster and easier to use.  I can't say too much about the 4K support.  At this point 4K seems like a gimmick. I have a 4K TV and almost no way of playing 4K video.	1
Corel VideoStudio is a great, affordable and user friendly software for editing videos. I'm not very tech savvy and usually find most  video editing programs too complicated and too cumbersome to use. I am amazed at how much you get with Corel for under $70!  The included instructions were also very helpful in getting started with the software, figuring out tips and tricks, etc.	1
As a hobby, my buddies and I started a youtube channel devoted to gaming and each of us (crew of five) have editing software of some kind.  I use Final Cut Pro X (FCPX) on my MacBook Pro as does our executive producer while the other three use Windows and, unfortunately with the updates from 7-X making it incompatible with Windows, they have to use other software for editing.  We were thinking of acquiring a few licenses for Adobe Premier as some of us had used it before, but were very fortunate to be able to try Corel VideoStudio Pro X7 and Ultimate Edition (see ultimate edition for related review).  Our co-producer and primary screenwriter tested Corel Pro and, after a month of use he has produced several video prototypes that look almost as good as FCPX albeit with some missing features that are in the Ultimate Edition.  Our screenwriter (Barnard) noted that the editing interface was incredibly comprehensive with your standard storyboard tools and clip editor very similar to FCPX.  He loves the selection of transitions, text editor, features generator (blank screens, shapes, etc.), and much more but laments that it lacks the smooth streamlined feeling of Final Cut.  Perhaps it was his older computer (Windows Vista, yick!) but he did notice a few moments of technical delays and lacking smoothness of operation.  Oh well.  All in all, Corel Pro is good for any amateur filmmaker or personal creating fun family videos that doesn't want to shell out well over $1000 in Mac products for industrial quality.	1
After using Corel Ulead Video Studio 11.5 for years, I was given the opportunity to give VideoStudio ProX7 a try.  The first thing I noted was how similar the interface is between those two, true they're both Corel, but I would have thought after 6 years it would be quite changed. This is not bad at all, if you like me, have used a similar software in the past, you should have no problems getting used to the new version and its enhancements.  Very easy to install, once running I must say I was impressed with the performance, quite an enhancement once compared to Ulead 11.5, considering the program is working with very heavy HD files.  The interface for editing videos or creating slideshows is unbelievable easy to use, you can even drag and drop and then select your desired object to edit or add effects, text and filters to it. My first project was a video comprised of several short ones of my almost two year old son. I was able to edit, add music, transitions and effects without any problems at all. One thing that happened to me though, is that while editing, the VideoStudioProX7 recognized all video formats I used (even .mov, which was not recognized by the older version) I saved the project and when I opened it the day after, all my .mov videos were unlinked and could not be added, if I tried to, the application would error out indicating an invalid file format. I tried to find answers on the web and was unable to (understandable being this a new version), I exited the application, reopened it and all my videos were there. It was very odd but I thought I'd mention it should it happen to someone else.  As a heavy user of this type of applications (not professionally of course, mostly family videos and the like) I can definitely recommend the ProX7, while very similar to older versions in its front end, there are a great deal of enhancements, templates and new features that make it worth the upgrade.	1

Not only does it allow you to do an amazing amount of editing and adding special effects to existing videos it also lets you create screen-capture videos of what is on your computer monitor.  The short video I've included was done with this software.  I'm used to working with video software, primarily Camtasia Studio($299), so it didn't take too long to figure out the basics of this program.  However, there are a lot of special effects and techniques that can be used so I was happy to find that Corel has an online site with both video and written tutorials on how to use this software. One feature I want to try next is the "stop motion animation."  If you are looking for a relatively inexpensive program that has a lot of advanced features (they claim there are "hundreds of stunning visual effects") this would be a program to consider purchasing.  It allows you to import a wide variety of digital media, capture video, and output the videos in a wide range of formats. It also includes a complete disk burning program.  The software can be installed in either 32 or 64-bit!  I'm using it on a 64-bit Windows 7 computer.	1
I have several Corel products including this one and have loved them all.  Easy to use.  My kids had fun with it too.	1
this has magic wand and magic wand is worth the upgrade from any previous version of PSP. it also has custom color palettes, complimentary colors and color gradients that make edits nice.	1
I've been using this program for a while now and I really like it's simplicity. I usually upgrade when I have a new operating system. Only have to buy it once unless there are new features that I really need to have.	1
A very good program. Even better is only the eighth version.	1
Great product. I would buy again.	1
Having struggled for years with Mac's Final Cut Express, I am a big fan of Video Studio, having discovered VS6 last year. It is inexpensive and very versatile software that is, as these things go, unusually easy to use. Video Studio X7 tweaks the old VS6 with some excellent improvements--faster rendering and more sophisticated ways of editing your video. It has a new "FastFlick" feature that is great for people who don't want to spend a lot of time editing--just a few steps and you can put a video together quickly and easily (and, for many people's needs "good enough" esoecially if the end goal is YouTube. This makes it fast and easy to do.).  One Warning: Be sure to delete your old VS software before installing VS7--it doesn't work as an upgrade and your computer may continue to default to VS6.  One Negative: I took away 1 star because although I like the product very, very much, I don't appreciate the lack of documentation. They have only a short little blurb in the box--no booklet--and, worst of all, no "Help" menu where you can search for topics. If you want to do that, you have to sign in to the Corell website--imo, very irritating and even when you do it, not that well organized. There is no book published for Video Studio 6 or 7 but I have used this one with VS6  It doesn't explain, of course, the new features of VS7, but will point you in the right direction with many of the basic questions that will come up.	1
I have been a fan and user of VideoStudio for a long time (I believe since version 5) and Corel continues to deliver on superb performance for a GREAT price. Yes, I sound like a fan boy, but I'm sorry: for the price, it's a great product.  So what's great about this version? For starters, I used to complain about documentation/tutorial videos, etc. Corel has delivered big-time: look around, Youtube, etc. they've commissioned some great introductory videos, and the documentation is a lot more streamlined. The PDF User Guide is clear, easy-to-read, and the Corel Discovery Center has both video and written tutorials! I have nothing to complain about anymore on this front! This new version also comes in a 64-bit edition, which makes much better use of memory and CPU resources, especially in rendering.  For the absolute newbie, there's a feature called Fast Flick which does quite a reasonable job of creating a movie from assembled clips, which means you can immediately see how things work, enabling a learn-by-watching type experience. The interface layout is self-explanatory, three large sections: Capture/Edit/Share. Since I don't have a need for capture since I don't own anything I can capture from (for example, with certain types of digital cameras, it's possible to capture stop motion movies directly from them, cheap animation! and the Screen Capture looks intriguing), I spend most of my time in the Edit and Share tabs.  Editing is straight-forward. Import your videos, put them onto the tracks, cut out the boring bits, insert other types of media (pictures, sounds) as you wish, ensure you have suitable transitions--so many transitions are available, but please, use sparingly. Titles--again, an immense amount, only a small number of which you'll actually use. And, let's not forget FX. These are advanced  well, effects, you can add to your videos. Essentially, animations, applying color shifts, vintage-looking films, etc. A ton! You get the feeling by now, I hope, that Corel has inundated the budding editor with CHOICE, but just because these exist doesn't mean you have to use them, word to the wise.  My videos got a lot better after reading the superb book, How to Shoot Video that Doesn't Suck. Highly recommended (and I just saw they reduced the Kindle price to $2.51 after I bought it at full price! Argh!)  Exporting (or "sharing") your video is also easy, with different output formats available, avi, MPEG-4, MPEG-2, only audio, etc. You can also directly export to YouTube, Flickr, Vimeo. Take my advice, export to a file format THEN upload that file to YouTube, etc. You can also, of course, burn it to DVD.  If you're coming to VideoStudio from another editing suite, I suggest you take the time to learn its idiosyncrasies, of which there are a few (how to manage transitions, for example) but this is the equal of any one of consumer-grade video editing suites. Corel has made some great strides in VideoStudio, and it shows because there's just about nothing I can ding. 5 stars!	1
I've been making home videos for years (and I have years more to do still on hard drives!) I'm always looking for a better, easier, and faster way of making them work. I've used everything from Microsoft Movie Maker to Adobe products to Nero products. This product has several things going for it but some operational issues hold me back from wholeheartedly recommending it.  PROS: +Quick movies. This cranked out a completed movie (rendering and on disc) in about an hour on an older PC (4 GB RAM, AMD quad-core). That's not bad at all. +Very simple UI. It's easy to get up and running for anyone who has ever used any type of movie maker and clean enough that it would be easy for new users as well. +Output looks good. The DVD worked well after burn and played right on several machines.  CONS: -Adding items to Timeline is hard. Once you try to add something to the timeline it generally goes to the end of the timeline for that section. So when I tried to add a picture between two clips I kept having it go to the very end and had to drag it back to where I wanted it. It's just not that intuitive or flexible. After making four or five movies I was able to figure this out, but there is a learning curve. -Lack of content for menus, themes, transitions. The themese that come with VS are basic and not easy to customize. I didn't see an open source way of adding new ones either. Contrasted with Adobe Premier Elements (around the same cost) and this is a big detriment.  Overall, this makes quick movies but has a bunch of design elements that I just didn't like. If they don't matter to you then this is a good program. If you are like me, you may want a different one.	1
Corel has really done it this year.  We see the most significant update since years with X7 and many more useful add-ons.  Here's what's new for Ultimate X7.  *** At the end of the review I'll compare X7 Ultimate to X7 Pro ***  UPDATE #1 - 64-Bit processing. This is huge!  All previous versions were 32-bit, meaning that the new 64-bit X7 can process videos at twice the power.  To get a grasp on this concept, think of your computer processor as being a tube that can either be 32 or 64 inches wide. When you have the smaller 32 inch size, less information can flow through and the tube is more likely to  full and "bottleneck". Bottlenecks are when the maximum information is flowing through the tube.  This causes other processing to slow down and your system to load slower because each process has to wait for the others to finish before it can begin. If you 64 inch wide tubes, then there is 2x as much room for information to pass through before the computer bottlenecks and slows down.  Some people online ran some speed tests and they found that the new VideoStudio X7 beats last year's VideoStudio X6 by rendering up to 68 percent faster for HD multitrack projects with hardware acceleration, up to 153 percent for 4K projects, and up to 854 percent with smart rendering (processing only the changed regions of the video.  This is nearly twice to more than twice as fast as last year for standard rendering and nearly 9 times as fast for smart rendering (less processing done on each video when rendering, more carryover from original video clip).  These are amazing gains!  Since Windows 7, most computers are running 64-bit Windows.  Now Corel is running at 64-bit as well.  This is the greatest improvement - beyond all the add-ons and plug-ins.  This is a true core software update.  This is alone is enough to want any user of Corel VIdeoStudio (any version) to upgrade to X7. Thanks Corel!  UPDATE #2 New HD add-ons and effects.  Since the software is now 64-bit, Corel has given us higher resolution (1920 x 1080) HD templates, backgrounds, and color patterns.  UPDATE #3 - FastFlick.  This feature is aimed at the beginner video user or people wanting to spend less time making videos.  FastFlick is a one-click processing feature that adds may effects, themes, transitions, etc onto a single video, series of video clips or series of photos...immediately processing it and rendering it as a brand new stylized video.  Basically, select your own videos or photos, then select the FastFlick theme you want, click start and come back to a completed final video that is ready to upload and watch.  UPDATE #4 - Cleaner Layout.  This is a minor change, but still important enough to list.  They cleaned up the layout / video editing screen to give us more space, less clutter.  The look is not closer to Corel Paintshop, making it easier for a person to use both softwares.  UPDATE #5 -  Discovery Center Video Tutorials.  This feature I really like. There are so many features to VideoStudio X7 that discovering them all on your own is very unlikely.  The video tutorials in the Discovery Center (access by a little blue button at the top right toolbar) guide a person through many of the great features and quickly teach anyone how to use the software.  I personally love video tutorials over written tutorials (which Corel also includes as PDFs, accessible through the main menu as well).  Watching the process is better than reading about it.  So here you have it - the top 5 new updates for Corel VideoStudio X7!  DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ULTIMATE X7 and PRO X7 VERSIONS  VideoStudio Pro X7 vs. VideoStudio Ultimate X7  These two versions are basically the same except that Ultimate X7 gives you 7 special effects apps that are not in the Pro version.  All of these are very high quality, helping you to create more professional looking videos.  Other than that, the software is identical..  1) NewBlue FX ColorFast - Color correction tools to improve the look of the video (either more realistic color corrections or more abstract - you control it).  2) NewBlue FX Motion Effects - Over 100 preset motion effects to create some very creative looks.  3) Boris Graffiti 6 - A large collection of titles and graphics.  4) proDAD Mercalli SE - Video stabilization plus advanced features that create the shaky camera effects that are very popular in today's videos.  5) proDAD VitaScene LE - Even more transitions, filters and film-style effects.  6) proDAD Handscript Animation - Handwriting effects that animate as the video plays - such as signing a signature.  Great for titles.  7) proDAD RotoPen - Rotoscope style animated effects for maps, graphics and photos. Rotoscope is where the video turns into a sketchpad or animated cartoon look.  So this is a lot of great features to get for only $20. Get Ultimate.  MY PERSONAL OPINION  The long story short.  3 years ago (with Corel VideoStudio X5) I switched over from using Adobe Premiere Elements and I haven't looked back.  I use the Corel VideoStudio software about once every week or two for 3-4 hours, plus periods of daily use when I have larger projects.

I feel it blows away Adobe Premiere Elements and the other $100-ish video software.	1
I've taken some videos with my camera and my phone and sometimes they have size limitations on how long you can record before you have to start a new recording.  I have a not so smart smart phone :(  I have some videos that I wanted to try and put together to make it one video instead of several shorter clips so I decided to try out this Corel Video Studio.  I'm sure this is much more robust than I actually need, but it got good reviews so I thought why not?  It was relatively non-stressful to install.  I hate installing new programs because it never goes as smoothly or as quickly as I think it should.  After installation I started it up and quickly realized that there was going to be a learning curve involved.  I've learned the basics, and I have no doubt that there is much more that I haven't learned to do, but in the end it did what I wanted it to do without throwing my hands up in frustration :)  I'm sure there are other more technical reviews, but from the perspective of a novice I think you will be pleasantly surprised at how quickly and easily you can add "director" to your list of attributes.	1
As a hobby on the weekends I run an AV team (five crew members) of gaming junkies that help run a youtube channel devoted to gaming and not all of us have enough discretionary income to purchase MacBooks and/or Final Cut Pro X.  As such it was a real treat to test out both Corel VideoStudio Ultimate and Pro X7 (for more information on Pro, see respective product for more) and we've had very positive feedback on the Ultimate edition.  Our co-founder and marketing expert Tom tried the Ultimate version and quickly discovered that his laptop was not only grossly obsolete (Windows 7) but most of the features exclusive to the ultimate edition are more gimmicky than utilitarian.  After find Tom a suitable computer to work on, he began working on a Legend of Zelda project using in game footage we captured with an Elgato capture card and some live-action sequences we filmed.  One of the first things he began to experiment with was the 3D plug-in and quickly disregarded when his new PC didn't feel like supporting them that and we have no need for them.  The other premium plug-ins were the Hollywood-esque transitions and titles but they still resembled something a high school or film student makes in his bedroom so they're not that great.  However, what Ultimate missed in its plug-ins it makes up for in its comprehensive layout and use.  While not as streamlined as Final Cut Pro X, it still had a very easy-to-understand layout even for rookies like Tom to understand and master quickly.  The software is, relatively, user-friendly and that is a plus to anyone that doesn't feel like shelling out over $1000 in premium software or Mac products like I did.  All in all, I would probably recommend Pro over Ultimate since the premium features on the latter are less professional than one would think.  I'd keep things simple.	1
Pros: * Upgrading from Pro X6 on my Windows 7 machine went smoothly * A boatload of special effects/transitions * Allows easy manipulation of audio/video separately or in tandem * Renders video very quickly (my videos average 15 min. apiece and will render within a few minutes if they aren't heavy of the audio and extras--of course, this would vary based on the type of video you're producing along with your hardware set up)  Neutral: * Doesn't include a user manual--documentation must be downloaded from the Corel website (and it's highly recommended to do so and read it because...learning curve)  Cons: * Learning curve -- I went through this with X6 Pro, but this upgrade moved a few things around and added a few features which sent me back to VideoStudion bootcamp, so it's wise to plan accordingly * Ultra-strict licensing -- this isn't new, but still worth mentioning: If privacy is a major concern, you'll want to read and re-read the license agreement because there's a note in there about collecting potentially personally identifiable information, plus, you may only install this software on a single machine and should you wish to reinstall it on another machine, you'd need to contact Corel for permission.  Overall, this was a great upgrade from the previous version of VideoStudio with added useful features an the simplification of a few others.	1
Corel VideoStudio Ultimate X7 is a stable advanced multifunctional video editor finally 64-bit that is surprisingly easy to use thanks to the clear and simple interface. It has a multitude of tools for making the video funny, supports the 4K Ultra HD (4K UHD) resolution of 3840 pixels  2160 lines (8.3 megapixels, aspect ratio 16:9) and 3D/3-D (three-dimensional)/S3D (stereoscopic 3D) media, creation of the video Web pages in the HTML5 markup language, as well as the motion tracking allowing adding text, effects, and objects that follow a moving element. It has the unparalleled stop motion capability to create high quality animated movies, a new FastFlick tool for easy automated editing, and its interface has undergone minor tweaks.  Now, VideoStudio renders (processes video) only slightly slower than Pinnacle Studio 17 Ultimate and CyberLink PowerDirector 12, though faster than Sony Movie Studio 13 and Adobe Premiere Elements 12, but lacks organizational tools of the Elements, like tags and search for effects or media, and allows just 20 overlay (video) tracks (Elements - 100).  VideoStudio performs multiple cuts/trims (e.g. removal of unwanted TV adds) better than the Elements and Movie Studio, shines where it counts, and lags where it does not.  The 64-bit X7 is much faster than, and thus superior to, the only 32-bit X6.	1
I've used CorelDRAW for years - since CorelDraw 3 - so I was very excited to get the chance to use Corel VideoStudio Ultimate x7.  I'm a complete novice at video editing. Prior to getting VideoStudio, my video was whatever I recorded at the time. I had no idea how to edit out unintended stuff or add titles or add music, etc. Even though it has plenty of very sophisticated and complex editing options available to the user, this software makes it easy to get started.  In the box is two discs. That's it. The user's manual is included in the installation and there are loads of video tutorials you can access from inside program.  Installation was easy and straightforward. Note: the EULA states that you are licensed to have VideoStudio installed on only one computer at a time so if you have multiple computers in your home, choose wisely or you will have to uninstall from one computer in order to install it on another one.  The software places 3 icons on your desktop - VideoStudio, FastFlick and ScreenCap. If you are new to video editing, FastFlick is an amazing tool. Download your videos and pictures that you wish to edit to your computer and then FastFlick will let even a novice produce a surprisingly professional bit of video. Through the use of templates you can add titles, music, add additional video clips, apply effects like pan and zoom and lots of other things. Even if, like me, you've never edited video before, you can use FastFlick.  Corel also makes it easy for you to upload your finished videos to places like YouTube and Facebook, as well as burning your video to a DVD- all from within the software!  VideoStudio is a full-fledged video editing program that gives you a myriad of different ways to edit your raw video. If you've never used video editing software before, there will be a learning curve when it comes to VideoStudio. Don't expect to be able to edit a video immediately. Corel knows this, which is why they created and included FastFlick. It acts as kind of an intro to video editing and at the same time, give you immediate gratification by helping you produce a very attractively edited video right out of the box.  The user's guide, which you can find under the Help tab in VideoStudio, is refreshingly well written and easy to search. It's in .PDF format and you can download it to your computer. It's worth reading even if you aren't normally the type to read the manual. ;-)  For the current price of under $80, I think this software is a bargain! It's easy enough, thanks to FastFlick, that even a newbie can create a respectable video, but powerful enough that someone familiar with this kind of software will be very pleased. (I confirmed this with a friend, whose job it is to edit advertising video. He couldn't believe how powerful it was - even compared to the commercial editing software he uses at work.)  If you want or need to edit your videos to make them something special, Corel made this software for you!	1
I've been using the last several versions of Corel VideoStudio along side my (still) favorite, Adobe Premiere Elements. The two things I found about VideoStudio was that it was easier to use but also slow. I am happy to say that in X7, speed is much improved.  The one thing I can say about VideoStudio X7 is that it makes everything easy for the newbie. If there was one video editing suite I would recommend to newcomers, it would be this. Everything is straight forward and easy to understand and follow.  I did mention speed enhancements. Not only is it smooth during the editing process but also for rendering and burning disks. I would say it is a full 40% faster than Adobe Premiere elements at rendering. To me, this is HUGE.  I have to say, VideoStudio X7 is the video editing suite to get if you are on a budget.	1
I have been making home videos for years. I used VideoStudio 7, 9, X1, X2 plus, X3 Plus, X4, X5, X6 and now the latest X7. I also tried digital video software from Pinnacle, Roxio, Adobe Premiere. However, Corel software beats them for stability and easy of use. The Adobe Premiere is a great software, but it's overwhelming and overkill for most of us. In general, Corel's VideoStudio is less frustrating than any other software.  If you are new to VideoStudio, there is a complete PDF file you can download from the site which includes full instructions on using the video.  From product line point of view, Corel VideoStudio has all the basics, not a lot of bells and whistles that are hard to learn. The basic functions are easy to use and intuitive. You use the timeline to place video clips, then add transitions, background music, titles. After you are done, it can be easily exported to YouTube, FaceBook, Flicker...etc. Or you can burn your own DVD, or Blu-Ray disks.  By the way, editing HD videos requires a very powerful PC system, this is especially true when you are dealing with the highly compressed AVCHD videos. My system configuration is: Core i7 processor, 12 GB ram, Window 7 64-bit, 1GB video card, two SATA-2 drives. I have no problem to advance AVCHD videos frame by frame for precise editing, or use mouse to fast forward AVCHD videos for quick preview...etc. Also, the rendering time is fast. During rendering, my CPU usage can go up to 90%. If you see frame drop, out-of-sync between audio and video, color bleaching, software is slow to response to your mouse clicking, or video editing process is not smooth...etc, before blaming VideoStudio software, you may want to check your hardware system first.  So far, I have done couple home videos and created some AVCHD disks. I am very happy with the latest VideoStudio X7. Comparing with previous version, this X7 version runs much faster.  Though I have long experience with VideoStudio, I would definitely recommend this software to beginners. It comes with so many pre-packaged automated processes that beginners can use them easily.	1
The VideoStudio product tends to stay along a very narrow path - eschewing complex features for ease of use - and this version does that yet again. As an example, its main feature this iteration is something you may not even notice - its 64-bit architecture!  What you get is a product that is amazingly intuitive and targeted squarely at the occasional editor rather than a videographer.  Users of previous versions of this software will be able to jump right in - it has the exact same idioms and workflow - making it easy to get working with minimal fuss.  The Capture > Edit > Share workflow is traditional. You capture or import video files (I used AVC files from a camcorder); add them to a timeline; throw in a few transitions, titles, and effects; and render to an appropriate format  for sharing. That's it!  If you want to push the envelope a bit, you get the ability to add subtitles (with a neat scanning feature where the software actually locates spoken words), and then there's FastFlick that lets you create some neat videos using preset templates. After I was done with my editing, I created a short FastFlick video for fun, and am embarassed to say that it did a better job than I did.  Overall, this version of VideoStudio is stable, competent, and intuitive making it easy to recommend this software.  Happy Editing! ~A_E~	1
Out of the box I was intrigued, I've been using Premiere Pro CC lately but I'm still a big fan of purchased software instead of paying the cloud. Ultimate X7 installed AND activated without any issues.  It's fast, it's smooth, and it's soo easy to use (try saying that about Premiere Pro straight off the cloud.  I'm impressed.  I am very satisfied overall with all the Corel programs I've been using, including the PaintShop Pro X6.	1
As someone new to video editing, I found Video Studio X7 to be very helpful. The tutorials are great for getting you started, and the FastFlick option is a very easy way to help create your first videos. Using FastFlick, the program walks you through the process, and it's just a quick 3 steps to create your video using template options. It makes creating a video very easy to follow - especially while you're learning the program.  After a little use, I still like FastFlick for creating quick simple videos, but the additional flexibility and customization available through the regular video creation is also fantastic. Including titles, credits or subtitles is very simple, and the Capture studio allows you to film video to edit in the program directly from your webcam or compatible camera.  The stop-motion studio is very useful as well, and super easy to use. It likewise can be utilized through the Capture studio, using your webcam or camera to input images into the program as you take each picture. It even has an "onion skin" feature, allowing you to see a see-through copy of your previous picture overlapping your next one, so you can easily line up your pictures for good stop-motion flow.  All in all, a very useful program, and pretty easy to use even for a beginner.	1
I have been using the Corel VideoStudio software for many years for creating family videos and my Youtube videos..  I am very pleased with its vast selection of features, ease of use, and stability.  The Corel VideoStudio Ultimate X7 packs with a lot of new enhancements particularly its support of the 64 bit performance support. Another new feature I like is the Fastflick with pre-loaded video  templates which makes it easier for our video projects. The user interface is pretty much the same as the prior versions and is quite intuitive to use.  The Ultimate version has some very nice special FX features. The ones I like the most are the ProDAD Mecali SE which provides stabilization of the videos and the proDAD Vitascene for creating special effects to the videos. There is also a variety of output format including AVI, MPEG-2, MPEG-4, AVC/H.264, WMV, and audio only outputs. the MPEG-4 AVC supports upto 4096 x 2304 HD resolution.  This is a great product with a reasonable price for those who are interested in video production.	1
I liked X6 quite a bit for making animations, slide show videos and editing videos because it was clear and intuitive. This version has a few more bells and whistles, but it's mostly the same program. Except it's a lot faster.  What I like about VideoStudio is that it's somewhere between being absolutely a beginner's video editing program and a full featured pro editing software. It's more than enough for the types of videos that I make- mostly instructional craft videos or simple animations and slideshows. Putting in subtitles, or timing the animation frames is easy to do. Adjusting a slideshow to fit the music I'm setting it to is also easy.  It does use a lot of memory still, but as long as I'm not trying to work with huge graphics in my graphics suite at the same time I'm editing a video- it hasn't frozen or crashed my system. So it seems very stable.  I like the speed, and still like how easy it is to use. It installs easily. My only complaint is that you have to download a user's manual.	1
This has been a really nice piece of editing software.  The users manual is almost like and afterthought if you get stuck.  There is also a pdf manual if needed.  If you are a true beginner to the process, then look at the Fast Flick application to get the full idea and support you need.  In comparison to the pro version it provides an additional special effects package within the program. It allows you to create high quality special effects, cinematic style titles, almost natural screen handwriting, image correction, and animated pen effects.  If you need access to these features then purchase the Ultimate version, if not go Pro version.  It's very easy to install and you can access updates online at their website or click on the updates tab to have the program look online.	1
I found Corel VideoStudio Ultimate X7 relatively easy to learn and use, and I had no issues with installation either. My last version of this software was version X3, and I certainly did find this version to be quite a bit faster, and the user interface to be quite a bit better. This latest version boasts several performance improvements over previous versions, and it also has an even longer list of editing tools. Corel VideoStudio Ultimate X7 is an efficient and comprehensive video editing program that has more than enough features and video editing capabilities for the average user.  One reason I got this new version is because it allows me to produce next generation 4K videos and Blu-ray videos. And while that may not be important to you right now, it likely will be in the not too distant future. But the main reason I got this new version is for the 64-bit high-end Special FX Pack, the really great slideshow maker, and the much faster video rendering. This software is designed to take advantage of more computing power if your computer has it available. My computer does in fact have quite a bit of muscle, and I did find this version of this software to be faster. It's certainly not "WOW" faster, but quite noticeably faster. However, if your computer is lacking in the muscle department, you likely won't notice much of a difference in rendering speeds, so do take that into account.  Something else I wanted to mention is that I own several other video editing programs, and while their specs are the same as Corel's, for some reason Corel's rendered output just plain looks better. I don't know why, but it does. And not just a little bit better either. It's significantly better. After you finish your project, what you see onscreen is significantly clearer and smoother. This, of course, isn't a minor thing, this is a major thing, and this tells me that Corel's software is definitely doing something differently, something much better than what their competitor's software is doing. So, while there are other video editing programs that certainly have more bells and whistles than Corel's, if the quality of the finished product is the most important thing to you, do take Corel's top quality output into account.  Now, like I said, my last version of the software was version X3, and while all the improvements to this latest version are really terrific, what makes this newest version a real winner is the fact that it's still very affordable. Corel VideoStudio Ultimate X7 is a great set of tools at a great price. A bargain really. You get a lot of bang for your video editing buck. It contains all the tools you need to make really great videos. I recommend this latest version highly. I hope you found this review helpful.	1
I occasionally do video projects, so I was excited to see the new version of Corel Studio. I find it to be exceptionally powerful, with lots of effects and good performance in editing and rendering.  The program came on two DVDs: one for the program (32 or 64 bit) and one for the extra add-on programs. Installation was painless, except that there was no integrated install screen; the two disks are stand-alone, and one might think at first that the second disk is for 32 bit or something. Not a big deal, but it would have been nice to have better labels than "Disk 1" and "Disk 2". Several of the add on programs tried to install the .net framework (which is already installed in Windows 8), but functioned fine. My system is an AMD Phenom 6 at 3.4 Ghz, with a 250Mb SSD that I used for the program, and a 2 TB data disk. I have 16 Gb of memory.  For new folks, there is a program called FastFlick, which opens up a set of templates that can be used to rapidly create a video. From what I can tell it is best suited to making picture slide shows, although various elements can be edited, and custom music can be used. But it pales in comparison to the capabilities of the main program.  For experienced users, or those wanting to be, the program offers seemingly endless possibilities for creating a sophisticated video. There are many options for transitions, editing, titles, music, mixing, and, well, just about anything. The program works by importing media files into the main program, then dragging the files onto a timeline. After that one can use additional tracks to add titles, music, additional video overlays, FX transitions, and many other options. A small preview area offers basic editing and clipping, plus full screen or partial screen preview. After the video is completed, there are options to "share" it, which means save in various formats: Computer (AVI, MPEG, H.264, MPEG-2, or WMV), phone optimized, Web optimized (HTML-5 projects are possible), DVD (including menus), or 3D. The program features full multi-processor support and 4K (I don't have any 4K video to test it with, however). The interface is advertised as more streamlined, and I did indeed find that it seemed to work better (particularly the add-in programs). Also included is a stand-alone handy screen capture/recording program, which would be good for creating presentations showing how a computer program is run. There are a number of templates, which are basically the components of the FastFlick program, but broken apart for individual use in the main program; these would provide a new user with some place to start. For those so inclined, the program integrates with a camera to perform stop-motion.  Performance wise, I rendered a 4 minute video in 9 minutes, which is a bit better than previous versions of the program.  Documentation is strictly online via a PDF file that can be either viewed or downloaded. The add-ons bring up a help file when needed; I found the manual and add-in files to be well written and useful. When the program opens up, one is offered the opportunity to view some tutorials on the "discovery center", which requires registration. There are additional templates and such available on line once registration is complete.  There are a number of add-ons bundled with the program. They are pretty easy to use; simply drag them to the clip, and then open the options and customize the effect - thus they are plug-ins and not stand-alone. They are found in the FX portion of the program. Titles include:  Boris Graffiti 6 - Animated titles Newblue Colorfast - color correction ProDad Mercalli SE - video stabilization (worked very well) ProDad Vitascene V2 LE - this has a series of special effect screens proDAD RotoPen - Produces a nice pen effect across the screen. proDAD Handscript Animation - allows some custom movement of the screen NewBlue Motion effect - Smear, liquify, etc. effects  Summary: A powerful program that needs some time to learn, but allows the user to put out basic projects fairly quickly, or complex projects with a bit more work. Highly Recommended.	1
A little more advanced that my needs, but simple enough for me to use.  I have used other Corel products for editing photos.  I have started using video more in my marketing via social media.  So this now becomes a handy tool for my professional work.  Corel generally is less frustrating than Microsoft and makes more sense in my non-technical background.	1
Many things can be said about this and competing products, most of them being aimed at editor features and render speed.  I'm going to stick to one subject only because this is where Corel gets it right where nobody else is:  ACTUAL QUALITY OF HD OUTPUT.  If all you want to do is make cute little youtube videos, then any junky editor will do because quality simply does not matter.  But If you want to make BluRays, listen up, Pespecially your PowerDirector fans:  I try every version of PowerDirector (including 12) that comes out, and end up running right back to Corel's VSX.  Why?  because no matter what kind of editing process/features you may enjoy about these two products, what does it all matter if the HD output is garbage?  Are you using this software to enjoy the editing process or are you using it to create good looking content?  Corel produces flawlessly beautifull, crystal clear HD content (I'm talking BluRay production here).  PowerDirector doesn't, and CANT.  Time and time again, no matter how I try with PD's limited controls, I can't get PD's BlueRay output to look good on a 55" flatscreen.  It's grainy, pixilated, especialyl during pans or action sequences, which pixelate and blur BADLY.  Also, there is no render quality settings to fix this.  If you use PowerDirector, you are STUCK with this.  Corel, even with a bit if a dumbed down interface (but not much), has a boatload of output and quality options that allow you to drill down as far as you want to go to control every aspect of ouput quality and format.  This is really where Corel stomps all over PowerDirector - and always has.  Between these two products, there is only one difference that actually matters:  Output quality.  Everything else is just a bunch of worthless fluff.  The new 64-bit version just means that Corel's VSX is now on the same playing field as PowerDirector speed-wise, and PowerDirector has just lost its only bragging right against VSX.  But Corel has the edge in output options and quality, now making Corel's VideoStudio Pro the superior product.  No contest - because output quality is EVERYTHING.	1
I have used Dragon on Windows going back to the 1990's and have also used the old IBM ViaVoice on Mac OS 9 (a product bought up and then killed by Nuance, who back then called themselves ScanSoft).  Compared to the PC version, Dragon Dictate for Mac leaves a lot to be desired. Recognition speed and accuracy are fair compared to the Windows version but still better than IBM ViaVoice.  Where Dragon Dictate 4.0 seriously falls short is with editing and correcting. You might as well be typing everything as there will be enough errors no matter how clearly you speak and how well you annunciate individual words and phrases. When using voice commands to edit and correct, Dragon makes random selections.  It also inserts text at random places after editing (i.e. not at the cursor).  It is unbelievable but true that they have shipped this product repeatedly with the same bugs. As a long-term Nuance customer, I received my copy for $99 together with Password Genie (that I see no use for) directly from Nuance. People planning to pay the full price should be at least twice as reluctant to purchase.  To be fair, I would have paid $20 for something with this level of reliability and functionality.  Hence only 1 out of 5 stars.  Despite wanting to promote vendors who support the OS X platform, I really cannot recommend this product unless they would iron out the bugs.	-1
I have been using Dragon Dictate for Mac since version 2.0 and I've used Dragon NaturallySpeaking for windows previous to that since version 7... When I switched to a Mac I was extremely frustrated with the unnatural commands and just that they were not very user-friendly and streamlined with the Windows versions. With version 4.0 this appears to have been fixed I've been using the program for about 12 hours of dictation time since yesterday... The accuracy is much improved and I have not experienced any errors whatsoever...  I absolutely hated the last version... So far I am very pleased with the changes in usability and reliability of this version. If you contact Nuance directly if you are upgrading you may be able to get an upgrade for $99.  Update: 4/3/14... Some of the bugs that plagued version 3.0 seem to have returned... I don't get as many fatal crashes but after reading some responses I'm going to try using pages and numbers today and see if I get better results. Stay tuned for an update  Update: 6/20/14... Sometimes the program randomly crashes when I use the mail application... Don't know why but it's pretty annoying. Still better than version 3.0 but hoping they fix this issue soon.  Update: 7/2/14... The random errors that shut down the program in the mail application I've gotten worse... I can't stand it anymore when the program works is better than the previous version but the constant errors are becoming very frustrating. I'm going to reduce this from a four star review to a two star review. And I do have version 4.02 installed  Update: 8/1/14: started a new voice file and it seemed to fix a lot of my issues.  Update: 3/4/15: still buggy do not buy unless you absolutely have to.	-1
My mother was one of the first to use a computer dictation program back in the 90s due to a medical condition.  I wish she could see how far they've come!  This Dragon Dictate for Mac is truly astonishing.  Now, I'm not comparing it to anything recent.  I'm comparing it to the voice-recognition on my smart phone and my mom's program from the 90s.  The most shocking thing about the program:  You don't have to speak slower for the software to understand you.  Once you go through the tutorial (what I'll call it), it understands you at a high rate of speed.  The main problem (and the star deduction) is for the formatting issues. It would take awhile for me to actually be able to use the program to create a professional document; it would still be faster for me to type it and format as I go.  I will use it for shorter, less complex, or informal writings.	1
Dragon Dictate for Mac 4.0 is great for those looking to do a lot of dictation from their Mac.  The Dragon software works just a bit better than the on-board software already provided in the Mac OS.  Dragon is something I'll be using over and over again.	1
Not sure how this buggy program made it into production! The description for the software advertises transcribing audio files front and center...and this software does not even come close to doing a passable transcription. I used an audio file with one person speaking clearly. What I got back from Dragon Dictate was incoherent and nowhere near what was actually spoken. As this was the main feature I was looking to use, Dragon Dictate was a complete waste for me.	-1
Multitasking on a computer is a must these days making streamlining the experience all the more prevalent.  Voice commands would be the next logical step as our hands are already tied up and vocal tasking allows us to do another set of tasks.  Problem is that vocal recognition has never been a perfected science in the consumer market for everyday users and detailed command lists, or lack thereof, make marketing such products even more difficult.  Sure, word processing dictation is a handy tool for recording meetings and legal procedures but most authors, writers, and casual users prefer to type by hand given the lacking accuracy of said dictation software.  Dragon Dictate attempts to bridge this gap for Mac users and accomplishes a good amount but fails at the rudimentary basics.  In short, this product is NOT ready for wide distribution oh, too late.  For me, I needed software that allows me to multitask Safari and Final Cut Pro but know that having vocal commands for the latter is a long way off.  However, it would've been nice to have vocal software that can help navigate menus more seamlessly than using a touchpad or keyboard.  It's like the XBox Kinect or Sony Move as they require more effort to execute an action that can be exponentially easier just but touching a button making it more gimmicky than practical.  Dragon Dictate suffers from the same liability as the software has a delay, requires a mic (the internal PC mic works even worse in my opinion), and is severely limited in what it can actually do.  After doing a very annoying read-a-long calibration test that seemed more pass/fail (usually fail) as I kept having to repeat myself and, no, I do not have a speech impediment, quite the opposite.  After that process I attempted to play around with the various commands, which seemed numerous at first, but it didn't take long for me to realize that it wasn't nearly enough and they were all very basic.  If anything, there seemed to be more commands with controlling the software than my MacBook.  There were not nearly enough commands for Safari to make it worth stepping away from my Mac as I had to use both my hands and the software to navigate.  This isn't streamlining the experience as I want the option to be able to step away, grab my tea, and still be able to issue commands without having to go back to my computer to hold the software's hand.  My lacking experience with Dragon Dictate and Safari was consistent with other instances on my Mac only it got worse as the amount of commands became less and less.  After an hour of messing around I came to the conclusion that this software, while on its way to becoming a quality product, is NOT AT ALL READY and should be pulled for further testing.  For the price, this software is not worth it at all.  It's a prototype in middle-development, NOT a finished product.  I give it 2-stars because it is on its way and great for testing but that's about it.  Your average consumer will not like this, avoid until they beta-test a version that doesn't get referred to as a beta product.	-1
For a basic dictation software, this works well enough.  It types what is said with great accuracy.  Dragon's voice recognition is truly the best available.  The problems arise with formatting and editing.  Often capital letters are missed.  Paragraph formatting has errors.  Inserting edits or new sentence fragments will create false capitalization.  This can be very frustrating and time consuming.  As a regular user of Dragon Naturally Speaking for Windows (versions 10 and 12), I was disappointed with these problems.  The Windows version doesn't have them.  Why the problems here?  It doesn't make sense considering the same company is creating both software programs.  After 3 weeks of playing around with this software, I'm going back to using my Windows computer and Dragon Naturally Speaking 12.	-1
Dragon Dictate has been a somewhat frustrating experience.  This software came on a disc with no key to download, even though new Apple computers haven't had optical drives for some time now.  The software should be sold on a flash drive rather than on a disc and with a download included.  Installation was no problem after getting a disc drive.  Training was not a problem.  However, there is a bit of a learning curve with the commands and when using the software, it is necessary to actively give dictation, rather than to just speak.  When I have given verbal commands to a computer in the past, it was frustrating, and giving dictation just multiplies that into a continuous irritation.  The biggest problem is that the resulting documents are very error-ridden and really are more work to go back over and clean up than it would be to type them manually in the first place.  I can only recommend this software as useful for people who both need to make a record of their thoughts quickly and who can't type or for situations where there are large volumes of information to be dictated and a clean final document isn't important so a very rough draft is acceptable.  For me, it just isn't worth the bother.	-1
There are so many things not to like here. I will list but a few.  Deep integration with OneDrive. Good luck if you are a DropBox fan. You cannot even add it as an official "Place." That is a terrible decision. You can navigate there but you cannot have it easily accessed but the ever present OneDrive is always in your face. I also dislike the less colorful icons. And there are many things where you cannot change the default in any easy way. For example, there are complex registry editing work arounds to the aforementioned DropBox issue. You can also take a series of steps to create a half work-around for changing the default PowerPoint slide shape back to 4:3. But it's a pain. I do not know anyone using 16:9 slide shapes regularly. I got one recently from a colleague and I thought they had screwed up (because it made the fonts so small and hard to read). Of course, that all can be changed--but not with a simple default setting change. You have to make such changes for every single presentation you build. There are so many poor design changes where something that worked fine before has been changed in some more limiting or hard-to-find manner. I would try to stay with the 2010 and earlier versions of Office as long as you possibly can--unless you want to be very unproductive and Google a lot of stuff (that you'll find out you cannot easily fix) for awhile.  I will not let my company upgrade to this from earlier versions of Office. I cannot accept how many lost hours of productivity this will result in among my team.	-1
Run away, this is a car with three square tires.  Expect to take two to three times as long to get your work done.	-1
The product is good, but the customer service from Corel is terrible. Strongly recommend looking for a different product for your needs. Amazon sells many different products to take care of needs. Shop around, don't spend your hard earned money on this product. You will need customer service and Corel currently policy is focused on sales, not retaining customers.	-1

Over the past 15 years, I have really loved Power DVD product.  It was perfect for doing what I wanted it to do, when I wanted it to do it.  This latest version changed the file associations on the PC I installed it on and did not give me the choice to opt out.  I had to uninstall the program, then reinstall another DVD player of choice.  The 10 GB of cloud space is very generous, but it does not make up for the monumental pain in the @$$ that the program caused on installation. Cyberlink NEEDS TO FIX THIS ISSUE!  I would not recommend installing this on a machine you do any sort of creative / video editing work on.  Be careful!	-1
I was very concerned that this product apparently changes all the defaults without an option to refuse.  I therefore choose to install on my older computer.  It isn't that old in that it runs Windows 7... but it has slowed down considerably which is why I upgraded...  So keep that in mind that this may not apply to you..  but it crashed on install and I couldn't use the product.  I would try it on my newer computer but I am reluctant to have all my defaults changed.	-1
I have been using a home theater PC to run my TV since 1998 when I got my first HDTV but didn't have any high def sources for it.  So I used a TV with a capture card to capture other sources and upscale them for the new TV.  And I've not been without a computer on the TV since.  Once Windows Media Center came out in the early days of Windows XP, I was in heaven.  So for me, I need something like this to play my blu ray content.  I have PlayStation 3 and 4, as well as the Xbox One, that can play DVD's, but I don't like the interfaces, even when using my Logitech Harmony remote with the Xbox One.  I've always preferred actual discs be played in my computer.  More options for me to do things.  I also have a ton of movies and TV shows in MKV format.  I never bothered worrying about playing them on my iPads and such.  I didn't need them THAT portable, I have a TV in the only two rooms I'm likely to want to watch something.  But when I got PowerDVD 13, I found that the media server worked very well for my iPads and even iPod touch and iPhone.  It was great that my son could pull up all the cartoons I have saved on my media server anytime he wanted with his iPad.  I was able to play my 3D blu rays as well without any problems, and my standard DVD's looked very good.  It did everything I wanted.  So I had hopes for the version 14.  But while the basics work fine, such as DVD playback, Blu Ray playback, or even using the free PowerDVD remote on my mobile devices to duplicate a touchpad to control the mouse, the one thing I had come to appreciate, the transcoding for remote devices, totally does not work.  I have the app on my iPad, and the iPad can see my computer in the list, but it won't connect anymore like it did in version 13.  It just errors out and says it can't connect.  Or sometimes it will connect, and all I see is an empty folder.  When I look at the computer that the software is installed on and look at the media it is offering up, I see all my files listed without any issues.  Firewall is turned off, there's nothing blocking any access.  From other computers I can still just map the network drive and play things fine, but from the Power Media Player on my iPad, I get nothing.  Since that was a bonus feature that I ended up enjoying, but not something critical for my base functionality, I'm not losing sleep over it, nor wasting time more than the 20 minutes I already spent trying to resolve it.  I just wrote it off as a feature that clearly doesn't work as well as it used to in the previous version.  I'm guessing part of the issue may be that this full version isn't smart enough to see a previous version and just UPGRADE the existing version, but it installs as a separate program.  That was a pain at the beginning, and I ended up uninstalling all the Version 13 components to help alleviate any conflicts from this poor install routine.  I'm guessing that I may be able to overcome some of my issues if I were to nuke it all off of my computer, and just do a clean install of version 14 now that version 13 doesn't exist anymore, but it's just not worth the hassle.  If they can't write their programs well enough to accommodate existing users who upgrade from one version to the next if they end up with a full version of the newer version, then I figure I will spend my time and money and effort with someone else's solution who does want to make the experience as trouble free as possible.  If you're looking for a way to watch DVD's and blu ray discs on your computer, this will work.  But I'd go with the lowest cost version for what your needs are.  If I had paid for this version, I would've wanted my money back.  As it was free, I'll just leave it alone and just use it to watch discs as needed, if I don't just ditch it altogether and start using the Xbox One for my Blu Ray playback instead...	-1
Summary Power DVD 14 Ultra is a multi-media powerhouse that is capable of playing all of the multimedia on you computer whether it be movies, photos or music.  The interface is easy to use and for ease of use I would give five stars.  However, the software is very invasive in that it changes your file associations and searches your computer for media without asking.  Review I have used Power DVD for years since it came preinstalled on my Dell laptop.  However, the version installed on my laptop would not play Blu-Rays and so it was time for an upgrade.  VLC media player is an option for those who are willing to go through the effort of making that work, but for the majority of people who just want to effortlessly play movies, Power DVD is probably one of the players under consideration.  The interface for Power DVD is very slick and probably one of the nicest looking players currently available.  The controls are intuitive and straightforward.  I found changing settings to be easy, but sometimes I had to change the settings more than once for Power DVD to take my changes.  PowerDVD 14 is a universal player in that it can play almost any type of video file, including Windows Media (WMV), QuickTime (MOV), MKV and AVI formats.  The program can also be used to view your digital photographs and play your digital music files.  The Blu-ray player software supports all high-definition audio formats, including DTS and Dolby Digital as well as 4K.  For the majority of people, Power DVD will be able to play all of their media.  Normal playback includes hardware acceleration, but theres also a CPU mode with TrueTheater enhancements which will make media such as playback from a DVD look more high definition.  I had a play with this and the controls are great.  You can even split the screen so that you can see the changed and unchanged versions of the video.  However, there were several really annoying problems with the installation of the software.  By default, Power DVD wants to be your media player and once installed, will scan your computer searching for your photos, music and videos.  If you don't want Power DVD to search your computer, you need to find the menu which lists the folders included in the software's library and remove them.  However, while you are doing this, the program will be busy searching until you convince it to stop.  I didn't want Power DVD to be my media player or to organize all my files and so removed the My Music and My Photos folders from the library, but then had to do it again when Power DVD added the folders again.  Power DVD associated all media files with Power DVD so that by default, they open with the program.  Other programs such as the VLC media player ask before doing this because it is very invasive, but Power DVD gave no warning.  I found that my photographs in raw as well as TIFF and DNG formats were no longer associated with Photoshop, but instead opened with Power DVD.  Since I want to open those files with Photoshop for editing,  I had to the Power DVD settings, disassociate the file types and then associate them correctly in Windows Explorer.  This was really annoying since I had to spend time fixing everything to the way it was and the Power DVD should have prompted me first to see of changing all of my file associations was acceptable.  PowerDVD 14 comes with a one-year 10GB subscription to Cyberlink Cloud, which allows you to sync media to the Internet and play it with the Power Media Player app.  There is also a Power Media Player app, which supports streaming or copying your media across iPad, Android and Windows 8 devices.  Lastly, there is an application for both iOS and Android devices for controlling playback on your computer via your phone.  Overall, a great movie player packed with features.  However, be aware that the program will try to incorporate all of the media on your computer.  If you are ok with this, it is a handy feature, but it really should be an optional one.	-1
So thankful I backed up my videos and photos that dated back to 2004 before installing this software. Cyberlink wants to do file associations of its own and I don't like it for this reason. Otherwise, this software would be decent....it worked fine with Windows 8.1, the user interface is easy on the eyes and it played any video format I wanted.	-1
I cannot recommend it.  "World No. 1 Movie & Media Play." This claim comes from the fact that the software is often bundled in PC system software and peripheral devices with optical drives. It doesn't mean everybody with the bundled software is using it.  Here's what happened: The program without giving me a chance to opt out, changed all my video file installations. Now if I fail to pay the subscription fee by the renewal date, I will lose access to all those files.	-1
As a long time MS Office user, I was disgusted with their upgrade tactics, used feature-limited Open Office for years, then used Google Docs which has many limitations. I installed WordPerfick Office X7 trial. My first test was to create a chart from a *.CSV file which is a frequent task for my engineering work. The Quattro spreadsheet hung up trying to parse the data. I reformatted the data several different ways to make it easier and could never get it to work. MS Excel would have opened the file in seconds. Quattro couldn't handle the import.  The next test was to open WordPerfick through their New Project interface which asks all kinds of questions about what kind of document. When I stepped through all that and WordPerfect was in the process of opening the new document and crashed, I decided the whole WP Office Suite was buggy and uninstalled it. I really wanted to find a reliable computer-based word processor! This isn't it. Open Office is the only reliable non-Microsoft application available. WordPerfect has a sketchy history. I should have known.  My computer is a 5 year old 2.6GHz HP Desktop with 6GB RAM running Win 7-64.	-1
WordPerfect was my word processor of choice in the days of DOS. It was slow to make the transition to Windows and seems to have never quite made it. Everything from inserting a photo to printing is "configured" showing that it does not conform to Windows protocols. Years later it looks and behaves almost identically to its original Windows version. It does not seamlessly import Word documents, especially those including graphics. As for the "Reveal Codes" feature, it is a menu choice in Word implemented with a click of the mouse. My wife likes WordPerfect and uses it daily.  Quattro Pro is not an original WordPerfect application and is well suited to Windows. It readily imports Excel documents. The original spreadsheet companion to WordPerfect was PlanPerfect which, for some reason, was discontinued years ago. I have no need for Presentations and have not used it so cannot comment.	-1

This has a few bells and whistles, but is not worth the hassle or the headache. It isn't "compatible" with existing Norton accounts, so if you have time remaining on a subscription from a different version of Norton, you would lose those days by installing this version.  We already had renewable Norton contracts on our smart phones, so we did not attempt to install it on those, but I lost almost 4 months of coverage that I still had remaining from the Norton 360 that was previously installed on my computer. I guess I could fight with telephone support at Symantec and try to get that put back on my account, but personally, I have things going on that are more urgent than spending a couple of hours on the phone with tech/product support.  My advice is to skip this, and get the Norton 360 Multi-Device instead,&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Norton-360-Multi-Device-2014-1-User-5-Devices/dp/B00EZPXVWU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Norton 360 Multi-Device 2014 - 1 User / 5 Devices</a>&nbsp;it is less expensive, it has already proven itself to work well with all my devices and it won't invalidate the remaining time that you have on your current Norton antivirus coverage.	-1
I've been using Norton for most of the years I've owned computers. I had 360 until I installed this new package. Plain and simple, I miss 360 and its features, such as the file and registry clean-up utilities. But I can live without those.  My biggest complaint? It keeps crashing in Google Chrome. I don't feel fully protected. I get regular messages of "This plug-in has quit working. Do you want to stop it?" or "Norton has crashed. Reload page?" SEVERAL TIMES a day. When I am working or playing or just whatever. It has also slowed down my Chrome page loading times. So no, I am not a happy Norton user and will probably uninstall this and buy 360 despite this version being free to me for a year for my honest review.  It reloads fairly quickly--or appears to--then it crashes again a few minutes later. I am using it on two different computers--a desktop PC and a laptop PC and it does this on both devices. I am wary. I don't feel safe. I am NOT inclined to try the password vault feature after all of that. Which doesn't lead me to recommend the product.  I'll give two stars because I like the concept of covering all the devices I use, but after using it on two, I won't be loading it onto the rest. Yuck.  To be fair, the system caught a bad app from messing with my computer after a rare bad app kerfuffle-I usually avoid those myself with internet savvy but this one got through--shortly after installation. Another reason I am sticking with the two stars. It saved my cookies once. But it's made me lose lots of minutes everyday since then.	-1
I wish I could say something substantive about this product, but it wouldn't download for me, telling me they were "unable to download the support packages" and to "check your internet connection and try again." I have a PhD in electrical engineering, which if nothing else means I should be able to install software. So, if there's something I was doing wrong, they should rethink their installation. That said, I don't think I did anything wrong, I think they just had a server down. I validated that my internet connection was working, and in fact their install program did download quite a bit of data. It just kept giving me the same error message after the download completed. For what it's worth, I'm using a Mac with OS X 10.9.  I tried this three times, and then gave up. Is it fair to give this one star? I think so. Maybe they just had a server down the times I tried. But if that's the level of service we can expect from software as important as this, I think it speaks volumes to the low level of commitment Symantec has for this product, at least for those of us using Macs. I hope this works great for most people, but my experience was very poor, and I have to reflect that in the rating. If my experience is atypical, and I hope it is, that will average out in the total ratings.	-1

This is one conception that IObit should keep on the shelf.  It is nothing but another con job aimed at those less computer savory people, so don't waste your time with this so called Free Download for it doesn't help your PC, but it sure helps them line their pockets with more money, because it all of a sudden finds all these problems with your PC that only they can help with by selling a person more and more downloads.  I have a new PC and you just would not believe what was said needed to be corrected all because of this download.  This applies to all other iObit free downloads: Advance Systems Care, iObit Uninstaller, and Smart Defrag.  These are all just scare tactics used in order to make one think that all these horrible things are wrong with your PC (thus prompting ) you to purchase more junk downloads.  I have been trying for several months now to rid, delete, or erase all remnants of these so called computer download helps and have only been successful in removing them from all Windows Downloads.  There are parts still in certain files of which will not delete, or erase.  I have been stung before and it has cost me beyond measure, and my only advise is this "nothing that is listed as free is it really free or is their strings attached".  Companies like this only prey on those of US that may not know everything about computers, but not me anymore.  Alfred D. Smith in Lakeland Florida	-1

This is one of the most useless downloads that you can add to your PC.  It is just another ploy to try and get a person to buy additional downloads that only prove to be added money in iObit's pockets.  This downloads has proven to be nothing but a con job and dose not improve the functions of your PC.  All that this program download does is make one doubt that even a "New PC" is just loaded with all kinds of malware of which is just their view point.  All I found out is that the company iObit does is try to get you to see that all these supposedly problems exist leaving a person to think that "the sky is falling" when it isn't.  This program download can be deleted from your PC, but try to get it erased from your files.  Remnants attached to other files and just will not delete or erase.  My advise is to watch out for anything free, for is it truly free or are there strings attached that can not be seen.  BUYER BEWARE.  Alfred D. Smith Lakeland Fl	-1

If windows 7 is about a 7 or 8 then windows 8 is in the negative numbers. Windows 10 is not as bad as 8 but is still pretty scavy. Boots slowly, crashes and comes with windows edge and Cortana both of which blow. No more Microsoft operating systems for me.	-1
Yes, W10 is WAY better than W8. But that doesn't mean it's an improvement over W7 in term of UI. Performance wise W10 a little faster, but the performance gain is useless when it takes more clicks to do the same thing that W7 does for less clicks. A logical UI is EVERYTHING to an OS, that's what made W7 is successful OS. Sadly W10 UI still have a long way to go.  An OS doesn't need to be fancy nor pretty, it just have to be stable and efficient. W7 definitely have areas need to be improved up on, but W10 is not heading that direction. In the year of 2016, Windows 10 still don't have tabs in Windows Explorer. That pretty much sums it up.  Lastly, Microsoft please stop spamming W10 upgrade every time I turn on my computer. Windows 7 Pro isn't a freemium! So stop it already!!	-1
Just read about how Win 10 tracks you.	-1
I can't believe how they screwed this up. Will be waiting for Windows 12.  Do I really have to give it a one, seams to me -1 is a much better rating.  Why I HATE Windows 10  Microsoft needs to show they are actual giving you something, so they change all the places that everything used to be. Well if you drill down and jump around enough you can find the same menus if you like spending a few hours figuring out where they moved everything to. Thanks to Googe you can find SOME solutions.  It only can find one monitor, and you can not tell it you have two, windows 7 allowed you to tell it you had two. I am sure with a little time I will fix this crap. Ok, forget an HDMI to VGA, and running a second monitor with a VGA switch. in Windows 7 it works easy, it DOES NOT WORK IN 10 BUY ALL NEW EQUIPMENT, OR JUST STAY WITH WINDOWS 7.  Ok, its only my first few days getting it started. Need to find a freeware program that sets it all back to win XP, or win 7. The ONLY reason to upgrade is some programs check what version of windows they are running on and Microsoft working with other companies like ADOBE will make sure you MUST upgrade, so since it is free I am putting it on an extra drive to start the painful time wasting process of learning what crap has changed, just to change it and make it look different. Lets face it if it looked like windows 98, XP, or 7 that would be to easy.  Hope windows 10 actually makes an improvement SOMEWHERE !!!!!!!  Be ready, like I am and have two hard drive to go back and forth. If I am lucky all my programs will work fine in Windows 7 and I can stall off actually upgrading to Windows 10 TILL NEVER.  PROS: It installed without any major problem, it does not like my WD Worldbook, says it is not working, but it is so will let it tell me it is not working, as long as it IS WORKING.    can't think of ANY OTHER PROS  CONS: they put Windows 8 and Windows 7 together, great way to screw up both systems. I liked Windows 3.1 which slowly changed into the nightmare of Windows 10. Windows 8 should have been on every logon a choice of Win 7 interface or Win 8. That's how mine is set up now, and I always go to Win 7. Not to insult anyone, but Win 8 is just to time consuming to learn when I know Win 3.1 to 7 and all are easy to do everything I want.  I am sure many hardware items will not have Windows 10 drivers, so time to buy all new hardware, again. Mouse and keyboard still work, and the connections are the same small ones that we went to years ago. Still have adapters from back then, thought they might switch back and forth every ten years.  Bluetooth dongle, nope no Windows 10 driver  Have not tested my Canon scanner, lost one scanner with every upgrade, just got rid of 5 scanners, in the landfill. no new drivers, no slots from the old days, TWAIN turned out to not be as universal as I was hoping.  WISH MICROSOFT INCLUDED NEW DRIVERS WITH EVERY UPGRADE INSTEAD OF A NEW INTERFACE give users the option of what interface THEY WANT TO USE WHEN INSTALLING THE SOFTWARE and let them change it later.	-1
Tried it and dumped it. Microsoft will tell you it starts faster, not true, it took double the time to start it. The check from Microsoft stated that all applications were compatible, yet could not get it out of safe mode start and some applications, specially internet security would not work at all, clashing with the forced windows options. I am required to have specific antivirus and internet protection software, since it cannot work, I cannot use it. The menu is back, but harder to use, and the stay connected portion, which I could care less about cannot be turned off. I upgraded from Windows 7 Professional to Windows 10 Pro, yet it won't work well and many options are no longer available.	-1
I have five computers with Windows 7.  Tried Windows 10 on three of my PCs.  Total disappointment!  Windows 10 was a step backward in every way,except it can use a touch screen!

Pure crap.  Released too soon with way too many issues.  I completely regret putting it on my bare metal.  I only ran Windows 8/8.1 in VMware Fusion on my Mac.  I totally screwed the pooch and installed on my Alienware.  Issues include but are not limited to- Cannot recognize my exFat formatted hard drives - which is a Microsoft designed format Cannot copy large files - Backing up my Virtuals to external hard drives continuously fails Cannot list all the applications i have installed in the start menu- Google "512 apps windows 10 start menu" Screen Flickers are going to give me a seizure!!! I forgot how much I DID NOT miss the Blue Screen of Death.  Luckily now it is sometimes black!!! Windows Update is now more of a virus than a tools.  You have zero control over it. Wi-Fi works when it feels like it.  Non-repeatable issues All my browsers have issues Edge = Turd...  Who is the world design that mess???  Fire them...  NOW!!! It is not a browser.  It is an ADHD nightmare application.  Do yourself a favor and stick with Windows 7.  I messed up and went with the every other release from Microsoft is good theory.  Yep, I got it for free.  If they want me to install it anywhere else it will cost them $500 per box!!!	-1
It's fast and lean. It's also pretty. Nevertheless, the engineers who wrote it are klutzes. The Windows 10 "Start" menu is more like the one in Windows 8.1 (awful) than in Windows XP (terrific). It certainly is no improvement over Windows 7, which was barely useable and very ugly.  I upgraded my slightly over one-year-old system to Windows 10 pro. Over half of my software did not make it into the Start menu in the process. The programs that did migrate from Windows 7 were not organized as in my Windows 7 setup, and did not include other programs and utilities contained in the same folders. Thus, when clicking "all apps," I inevitably found many programs missing. Worse, the "all apps" section of the Start menu cannot be modified or edited -- except to uninstall programs which did make it to the list. You can remove items which made the list, but not add back the missing stuff (except by a torturous series of edits using "regedit," which Microsoft has hidden to discourage use of this very dangerous utility).  Microsoft is obsessed with the "tiles" feature of the Startup menu. Yes, tiles are still with us. Ironically, unlike the "all apps" selection, this least liked feature of Windows 8 and 8.1 can be edited and modified in Windows 10, and programs missing from the "all apps" list can be migrated to tiles (the missing programs are somewhat buried in Windows 10, and sheer persistence is needed to reveal their location -- not in a place available for everyday use, but inserted so it seems as an afterthought to let you know they were not forgotten.). Dumb! Dumb! Dumb!  Edge (Microsoft's new Internet Explorer) is not even fully functional. It cannot accept add-ons, plug-ins or other essential accessories to make the browser useable. Microsoft promises this capacity will be forthcoming.  Still, only one of my programs available after the transfer did not survive the changeover from Win 7 to Win 10 -- Norton Internet Security (NIS). Almost immediately after booting up, I received notification that a new version of NIS was available and that it would be necessary to uninstall the old version before installing the new one. Even that venerable security standby did not do well in this new environment. The latest version was obviously rushed to completion by the folks at Symantec. I had considerable difficulty getting the program to register once installed. In fact, after many unsuccessful attempts to achieve this essential operation (otherwise the program ceases to function in 13 days ), I was compelled to seek the help of the good folks utilized by Symantec in India to exercise remote control of my computer to make the necessary adjustments to get NIS up, running and registered. Needless to say, allowing strangers to poke around inside my computer did not inspire much confidence in the security I was hoping to achieve.  I suppose I should be grateful that I was not one of those unfortunates who made the change to Vista or to Windows 8 (the latter was available as an option, but I elected to stick with Windows 7 on one system, and XP on two others). If Microsoft will fix the Start menu issues and render Edge fully functional, I believe that I will eventually adjust to this new operating system. And, quite possibly, even like it. I did so when moving from MS-Dos 2.11 to Windows 3.1, then to Windows 95 and onwards to Windows 98, and finally to XP. I never did care much for the change from XP to Win 7. But if nothing else, I do consider myself open to new and improved things...when they are proved better than what they replaced.  UPDATE: 8/20/15 - Installed Classic Shell Startup menu program. Solves ALL the Microsoft shortcomings with the startup menu. Installs easily. Allows for logical modification of the startup folders, simple additions to the "programs" listing, and even preserves the Windows 10 startup as an option (tiles and all).  UPDATE: 10/19/15 - The two most recent attempts to install Windows updates KB3093266 and KB3097617 have failed. The latter was supposed to fix the issue in the former. I made 10 unsuccessful attempts to install the most recent update between 10/13/15 and 10/19/15. Windows 10's control panel includes a utility to check and repair installation problems. It failed to do so. A telephone call to Microsoft support ended with a disconnect while waiting for a transfer to a techie who could assist me. An attempt to reconnect with support ended after numerous outgoing recorded messages, including a final one stating that support was overloaded and help could be expected in approximately 30 minutes. It is obvious to me (and others) that Windows 10 was not ready for general release, and unfortunates like me who "upgraded" to this latest Microsoft operating system fiasco can expect an indefinite period of frustration and futility while MS gets its act together.  I have downgraded this product rating from 3 stars to 2, and will lower it again if this situation does not improve.  UPDATE:  11/16/15 - The so-called "Threshold Update"which Microsoft rolled out Nov. 10-12 (a massive update supposedly equivalent to a "service Pack," or complete substitution for the existing Windows 10 installed free in July) did NOT make it to my computer automatically as promised. I was not alone in this experience. However, I was able to find the solution with the help of Google. The solution was to download the update/upgrade at Microsoft's website and manually install it. It took about 2.5 hours to download and install the entire package. Aside from some minor work needed to fix the Start Menu after the latest version was installed, everything else seems okay. Things appear to work faster, and I am thus far optimistic the switch from Win 7 to Win 10 may eventually prove acceptable. BUT, I still advise friends to wait a bit longer before leaving Win 7 or Win 8 for the new OS.  UPDATE:  8/3/16 - The so-called "anniversary update" available 8/1/16 (and gradually making its way to users with Win 10 already installed) is (IMHO) a dreadful disaster. The Start menu has not been fixed -- it is still a disorganized mess. Attempting to organize it so that it is usable is nigh impossible. Even removing items from the Menu is difficult (and nowhere explained). For the past 11 months I installed and utilized "Classic Shell," a godsend alternative to the truly miserable Start Menu.  With the anniversary upgrade this week, the folks at Microsoft to my dismay have rendered the Classic Shell incompatible. Thus, those who preferred the Win 7 (XP similar) styled start menu are stuck with the latest abomination.  The folks at Microsoft now insist that Windows Defender be used instead of anti-malware/anti-virus software preferred by the user  (in my case, Symantec's well-tested and highly regarded programs). I have been unable to get Win 10 to allow me to select the latter in place of Defender -- and error notifications persist if I try; mainly to the effect that I have no firewall. This, despite that I have updated Symantec -- which Win 10 seems to accept as compatible, but which nevertheless does not allow to be selected as the default security program.  And the "no firewall" doomsday message continues to appear.  Since installing Windows 10 last August, I have managed grudgingly to learn to live with the new Windows Explorer file system (This PC), to somehow find my way through the cluttered and sometimes vague Settings menu, to locate and adjust to the new Control Panel buried two levels down in the Start Menu Folders, and even to the thoroughly counterintuitive interface which now dominates Microsofts latest operating system concoction. But I sorely miss XP (which I continue to use on two computers).	-1
Since the August 22 release of Mac OS X 10.10.5, Toast 12 will not burn discs properly. I have a stack of coasters (blu ray discs are not cheap) that are unwatchable. Even standard DVDs play with constant freezes and a jerking picture.  Spent two days with Toast tech support and they could not solve the problem, just said to wait for an update to make the program work with Apple. I use this program to burn DVDs for my work. I'm out of business because Roxio/Toast isn't keeping up with the times.  DO NOT UPDATE TO OS X 10.10.5 or you will regret it using Toast (any version).  Can't tell any difference in performance from Toast 11 to 12.  Program still crashes repeatedly during edits (I make sure to save every 2 minutes - an "autosave" feature is definitely called for!), encoding is still incredibly slow.  Haven't tried the Blu-Ray copy feature yet as I am 36 hours into burning a Blu Ray disc and the encoding is only 29% complete!  Not impressed.  Not sure what I gained for my $50 (the upgrade version).  UPDATE: Program is getting buggier every day.  It actually crashes will sitting idle, doing nothing!  And this is the first version I have ever had that has crashed while encoding and I've had to restart from scratch.  DON'T BUY IT!  UPDATE 2: The program crashes while encoding if you use any other program (mail, surf the net).  I reported the problem to Roxio tech help, they told me that burning a disk uses a lot of disk capacity and not to use other programs while it is burning."  I am encoding and burning a blu-ray disk, which takes several days.  Never had this problem with Toast 11.  I have erased Toast 12 and reinstalled 11.  It wasn't that great, either, but better than this pathetic version.	-1
I purchased Toast 12 Titanium for my Mac running Yosemite hoping to get good video editing and DVD burning software.  I've been disappointed.  The basic video editing software is usable, but provides only the most basic video editing. It its defense, the program is primarily a DVD burning package, not video editor.  The DVD creation piece, is also very basic.  Limited to provided templates with some basic editing.  Sufficient, but does not allow for much customization other than changing the default titles and background picture.  The screen capture software is totally unusable. It has locked up my Mac every time I've tried to use it requiring a hard restart, can't even quit the screen capture program with the OPT-CMD-ESC keys that normally allow forcing quit.  Have never captured a single frame with the screen capture program.  If all you want to do is burn basic DVDs, then this will work for you.  If you expect to capture screens, edit them and then burn to DVD, look for something else.	-1
First, if you buy the disc version of this software, be sure you have a DVD drive for your mac.  (Most of them don't have one anymore.)  There didn't seem to be anyway to get the download version later (at least that I could find on the Roxio website), even if you have the purchased product key/serial number that comes with the disk.  (I find this practice to be scammy, as once you purchase a license for a piece of software, you should be able to access is on disk/download, however you want.)  Second, I decided to STOP using this software immediately after installation, since the VERY first think it did when I launched it was try to access all the CONTACTS on my Mac.  This is a huge red flag for Spamware, and I am not willing to risk running this software further, and finding out other malicious/spam tactics it might include.	-1
I'm familiar with earlier version of Roxio Toast so was hoping this newest version would be something special. It's not. At least, not on my Mac running OS 10.6.8 which is supposed to be supported. Almost any requested action is sure to start the spinning beachball of eternal waiting, even with no other programs running.  Although Roxio is quick to suggest you can use this to copy DVDs and Blu-Rays, the print is considerably smaller that tells you that it won't work on protected disks whether you own them or not. However, after ripping a DVD with another program, you can use Toast to burn it to disk...of course, you can also do that in the Mac OS. But with Toast, you can compress large video files to fit more on a disk. The problem? The compression engine doesn't work all that well. I tried converting a video file to MKV format and the result was a file twice as big as my other compression program makes, but only about half the visual quality (it was basically unwatchable).  I tried capturing web video - a new feature - and it flat out didn't work for me. Toast prompts you to start playing a video in your browser, and it will appear in Toast's capture window if it's compatible. I couldn't find anything compatible (like, oh, Youtube). Again, maybe this is a problem with using an older OS - but if that's the case, Roxio should change its recommended specs.  I assume that Toast 12 can still be used to burn basic archival disks of data, but for this price it should do a lot more - or at least do it a lot better.  There are a lot of inexpensive programs out there which will do one or more of the functions Toast offers, and do it better. Toast is an "all in one" product for those people who don't want to sift through the other offerings, but what they gain in convenience they'll lose in actual usability. Personally, I'll be going back to my earlier version of Toast which works more smoothly.	-1
The main reason I got this was because it claimed to capture streaming video from the web. I tried everything I could think of - using different browsers, and the web video never came up. There is nothing for capture in the built-in help, and the online manual is not very helpful.  If you are looking for a tool to burn video to disc, this is a good option with tons of different formats.  If you want to grab video from web sites, maybe this will work for you - it didn't work for me.	-1
When I tried to register this product since I had already had an account I didn't know the pass word. When ever I would try to reset the pass word they would ask for my pass word.

After multiple authorization code problems - this AFTER product setup and running fine.  So one day works, wake up - not working.

Never had the slightest problem with pop-ups and questionaires till I installed lousy Kaspersky 2015.  The software is bugged up. Safe Money is a joke. Then they have the audacity to deny access on certain downloads.  I would rather have bought Norton's. The same ol' installation stupidity.  Kaspersky stinks. Don't buy it.	-1
I'd recommend everyone avoid almost all Russian made products for IT security. Kaspersky has confirmed their 'close ties' with Russian Govt. for spying. But most importantly, they continuously BREAK this product, and you'll find it HIGHLY unstable under many conditions.  There is a reason Kaspersky has failed to penetrate the enterprise market, their products aren't stable enough over the long term for enterprise environments.  Also, this product is 'questionable' at detecting PUA/PUP infections, even with the option turned on. It's simply not capable of keeping a system clean from them. Real world performance is not up to the synthetic test results with Kaspersky. It performs well on tests because of the teams they employ to pass these tests, but in the real world? Not so well.  Buy Trend 2015 or Norton 2015, go with reputable firms with a long established history, and strong customer support.	-1
I bought a copy a few years ago but after reading about the company I decided I would not install it. Do I want to install Russian "security" software on my computer? Bloomberg.com published the following article: "The Company Securing Your Internet Has Close Ties to Russian Spies"	-1
In the first day, when I installed FileZilla, from FileZillas site, it puts this evil malware called Vosteran on your machine that takes over as a search engine.  Even if you go into Chrome to remove it, it adds itself back in.  Vosteran is evil.  Simple, but Kaspersky didn't stop it.  Even after creating an account, you cant make comments on their web page.  Called Kaspersky, and the woman spoke softly and couldn't understand me due to her accent, so I asked to speak to someone else. She wouldnt let me speak to someone else!  She couldn't fix the problem, and said shed send me an email about how to fix the problem, because for some reason, they don't put the solution online.  Of course, they also allowed the malware onto my machine.  The next person told me that there would be an additional charge if their technical support had to solve the problem (that they originally caused because their Total security didn't stop the malware).  Amazing.  The email didn't arrive, and she hung up on me.  The next guy didn't speak English well either, and said he sent me an email.  By this point, Id gotten about 8 emails from Kaspersky, from their forums that I tried to sign up for which were sending verification emails, which they never said they were sending, which was the reason that they didn't let me make comments, and finally, one from the previous woman, which came about 15 minutes late).  The 2nd guy escalates to a 3rd woman, who says I have to run a program, and then wait 24-48 hours to get a response.  Just got an email  THEY CLOSED MY CASE, and its still not solved.  Total time wasted getting rid of malware it should have prevented in the first place: about 3 hours	-1
The download for this product takes 3 to 4 hours and two times so far it resulted with a message "network error".  Unbelievable.  I am giving it one more attempt and if it doesn't work will request refund as I've never installed the incomplete download.  And I thought Norton was a pain!	-1
I'd recommend everyone avoid almost all Russian made products for IT security. Kaspersky has confirmed their 'close ties' with Russian Govt. for spying. But most importantly, they continuously BREAK this product, and you'll find it HIGHLY unstable under many conditions.  There is a reason Kaspersky has failed to penetrate the enterprise market, their products aren't stable enough over the long term for enterprise environments.  Also, this product is 'questionable' at detecting PUA/PUP infections, even with the option turned on. It's simply not capable of keeping a system clean from them. Real world performance is not up to the synthetic test results with Kaspersky. It performs well on tests because of the teams they employ to pass these tests, but in the real world? Not so well.  Buy Trend 2015 or Norton 2015, go with reputable firms with a long established history, and strong customer support.	-1
Kaspersky make it impossible to stop renew... took 3 calls and 45 minutes.  Do business with a real company.  Emails have fake links, no easy way to contact company.	-1
I can't be sure whether it's Microsoft or Kaspersky, but one (or both) of them has repeatedly created a mess of my Dell desktop purchased in 2014 (Win 7 pro installed). Each of the most recent three times Microsoft downloaded Windows updates, my PC was unable to reboot or install the updates. Installation stopped about midway. I was eventually able to boot my computer in Safe mode, and from there do a restore operation to return to a previously installed version of my system files. It usually took me about a half day to get up and running again. My guess is that Kaspersky's insistence on doing its own updates during startup has somehow conflicted with Microsoft's update routine. I also noticed that other software installed on my computer was affected by Kaspersky's usurping system files at boot-up. This continuing conflict left me justifiably concerned whether my computer would be trashed and rendered unusable (and non-salvageable) during one of these episodes. Accordingly, I decided not to renew my subscription to Kaspersky (2014) when it expired in April, 2015.  Having now returned to Norton's excellent security program, I have noticed that the startup issue with Microsoft's updates (and other programs) described above has disappeared. Moreover, my PC is now noticeably faster. While I was happy with the antivirus and anti-malware protection otherwise provided by Kaspersky, the inherent risks of continuing to utilize the program were more than I elected to accept.	-1
Slows computer down big time.	-1
We have been working to try to install this for two weeks and we give up.  I purchased the last version of Dragon and my son with dysgraphia has been using it. I was excited to have the new one.  We are trying to install on a Samsung laptop, 8 GB RAM I 3 core processor 2.0 GHz running windows 8.  It says there is a CD on the drive but does not recognize it to start the installation.	-1
Total TRASH!!!  Don't buy this unless you want headaches and virtually NO SUPPORT!!!	-1
May 2017 Stopped working!  Repeatedly says "Please say that again."  Save your money. DON'T BUY!  ***  Very buggy. If you like to spend time figuring out how to get poorly written programs to work you will love Dragon. Don't take my word for it. Google "Dragon not working" and join the crowd!	-1
Found it hard to use. My android does a much better job. Mic that came with software was useless. I had to order the Koss just to get the software to work a little.	-1
This is a dumbed down version of the Corel Draw Suite.  I didn't know that when I purchased it.  They should be up front and honest about that.  Avoid this and purchase the education edition if you want Corel Draw X7	-1
I have been purchasing nearly every single build of PaintShop Pro since the shareware version 3 that JASC Software made more than 15 years ago.  Unfortunate this version is just like the previous 3; it's unstable.  I have tried reinstalling the program 3 times and it won't even open without crashing.  Other reviewers are correct; Corel's support is sub-par at best.  As far as my use is concerned, there is only 1 reasonably stabled builds of PS Pro from Corel; x4 build 14.3.0.3. Versions x5, x6 and now x7 have all crashed on both Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 before I could finish editing a single photo; they're total junk and I wouldn't keep them on my computer if they were free.  If you can find PaintShop x4, get that, otherwise find something else as Corel just doesn't understand quality control.	-1
Very, Very, Very hard to use on the AApple!!!	-1
i'm updating a prior review.  Since I bought this product Intuit has discontinued development of Quicken. They are supposed to sell it to some other vendor. I've never seen a software sale of this magnitude work. For that reason alone this would be a two star rather than three star purchase.  What takes it down to 1 star is that today I'm getting Quicken emails about spending patterns. I did not (knowingly) enable online access to my accounts.  Don't use this product.  -------- The market for personal finance software is not what it was 15 years ago. It is now a niche market. (The reason why that happened is beyond the scope of an Amazon review.)  I am sure nobody would develop Quicken for Windows (the gold standard) today. It's development was funded in a different era, including the painful process of establishing connections to banks. So we can't compare a new product (Quicken for Mac 2015) to that product. If you want all those features you need to run windows in a Mac VM or do dual boot.  So we compare this product to using a spreadsheet (ugh) or iBank 5. Unfortunately that's a very hard comparison to make. I mentioned this was a niche market -- I've not seen any serious head-to-head comparisons from a trusted source.  I opted for this product assuming it leveraged the bank connectivity network funded by Quicken for Windows. It does indeed do that.  It is not a stellar product. It desperately, desperately, needs a manual -- but the finance market is now so small that even niche ePublishers won't write a guide for it. Installation and configuration was quirky. Manual setup of 529 and other non-integrated investment tools is weird. I ran into several UI bugs and usability issues.  There's no Help file.  On the other hand, after initial setup it's bringing data in from a variety of investment sources and multiple US bank accounts. That's something.  I think it's worth the money. A manual might even make it four stars.	-1
I got this product since I was moving cross country and wanted to use a quicken product without parallels.  While the interface is easy to use and I enjoy its simplicity for not complex transactions, it consistently had problems hooking up to my bank as compared to Quicken for Windows.  I also did not like that there is no feature to auto-reconcile.	-1
No Macs	-1
No better than Quicken Essentials.  In fact, I couldn't find any difference.  Bought it, tried the budgeting feature, found it just as useless as QE.  Asked for a refund in 24 hours.  Sticking with iBank5.	-1
Would not - and still does not - sync with my primary bank (which is a huge bank). Downloaded mutual funds but totals were based only on transfers to (not withdawals from) an account. Result : xfr of money from S&P fund to EAFE of XXX magically generates $xxx of new money! O M G  !!I feel like Janet Yellen at the Fed !	-1
Run far and run fast away from this software. The biggest piece of crap ever from this company.	-1
The Quicken product has steadily deteriorated into an almost useless product over the last decade. Use Moneydance instead, works extremely well and will download your bank and investment transactions just as Quicken does.	-1
Eight long years after its last real update of Quicken for Mac (version 2007 in August 2006), and some four years after release of its "Quicken Essentials for Mac" downgrade, Intuit finally released a "new" personal finance software product for Mac.  Is it, at last, the cross-platformed Quicken, compatible with *any* Quicken for Windows version, that Mac users have been telling Intuit we needed for 26 years, since the first "Quicken for Mac" in 1989? No.  Is there even a free download trial version of it, as there is with the far more capable, better supported, and cheaper full-featured personal finance software for Mac, iBank 5+, Moneydance and SEE Finance? No.  If you want to try Quicken for Mac 2015, you have to fork out up to $80-plus (more than competitors) to discover a software product that, just like "Quicken Essentials for Mac", yet again lacks many essential features even of obsolete Quicken for Mac 2007, let alone lacking full cross-platform compatibility in the Quicken range.  Intuit obstinately continues to deny its Mac customers the one Quicken for Mac which might be impressive: a Quicken for Mac with the same basic design and ALL features of the popular and successful Quicken for Windows, and capacity to read, write and work back and forth on native files between the two. I cannot identify any other high profile productivity software, with the same brand name in both Mac OS and Windows, which cannot read and write mutually compatible files without conversion. Intuit, with its mutually *incompatible* Quickens, stands out as a unique repeat offender in what is factually a gross form of deception. Many consumers evidently are misled to the reasonable, but false assumption current versions of Quicken are equal across platforms.  In fact, this product should not be called Quicken for Mac: there is not, and never has been, any such thing as a real Quicken For Mac. The so-called "Quicken For Mac" product line should be given a name that reflects its incompatible, standalone, feature-poor reality. Call it *anything* else but Quicken... "Lacking For Mac", "Quacken For Mac" or "Slacken For Mac" would be more appropriate product names.  Intuit's absurd, abominable, *abysmal* performance with Quicken for Mac has gone beyond a joke into the realm of insult to the Mac personal finance software customer community. Intuit again is vaguely promising to add missing features -- from a long list of missing features -- at some unspecified time in the future. Seem familiar to anyone? It's the post-Quicken for Mac 2007 vaporware song and dance routine all over again, re-enacted by the all-time star performer and unbeatable industry champion of Mac vaporware, Intuit Inc.  Many of even the most sympathetic and long-term devotees of Quicken for Mac now are puzzled and perplexed. This is amply summed up by the following two posts in the Intuit Quicken Community website on 22 August 2014. They appear under the exasperated original poster's heading, 'Why, after all this time, has Intuit produced a subpar version of Quicken for the Mac called Quicken 2015?'  "voxjleklrqtfkes "Quicken 2015  "This product is an extension of Quicken Essentials. It remains far behind Quicken 2007 and its predecessors in its ability to select and report data. It has many arcane features such as the "pickers." These are useless for those of us with many categories. How does one readily select (report) all but one category ... there is no practical way, for example.  "The user interface, Yosemite-like it is, is a retrograde step compared even to Quicken Essentials. I find, on a 27" iMac, the register listing to be virtually unusable. The numbers and columns do not readily stand out, as with Quicken Essentials and Quicken 2007.  "That's a problem.  "Unfortunately, I will stick with Quicken Essentials until I can find a third-party alternative. Quicken was a great product when I started using it a decade or two ago. But it's been downhill since the mid-2000's -- why oh why?"  "jacobs "SuperUser  "The answer to your question is a long and winding road of Intuit's on-and-off development of Mac software since shortly after Quicken 2007 came out 8 years ago. The Quicken 2007 software uses building blacks that Apple has stopped supporting in the modern Mac OS, and parts of the code are 20+ years old. They set out to build a new version, called Quicken Financial Life for Mac, which never came to market. Then they set out to build a new core of Quicken, which came to market in 2010 as Quicken Essentials. A full version of Quicken Deluxe was promised for the following year, but for reasons I've never read about, that effort was killed and the development team was disbanded. Then in 2012, they hired a new development team to build on the work that had been done for Essentials to create a full-fledged modern version of Quicken for Mac -- and this release of Quicken 2015 is the first step in a multi-step process.  "It represents a significant enhancement to Quicken Essentials, but it is missing many features users desire from Quicken 2007. In a departure for Intuit, the Mac development team has been allowed to pre-announce that there will be a series of free updates to Quicken 2015 as they continue programming to build out the features of the program. For the benefit of Essentials users who have not had updates, and Quicken for Windows users hanging onto old PCs or WinXP virtual machines, they decided it was better to complete, test, and release a version of Quicken 2015 that doesn't do everything today, and add to it over time -- rather than spending another year in the lab trying to develop a full-featured version that would satisfy everyone.  "The product manager has said publicly that this first release of Quicken 2015 won't meet everyone's needs, and they've been very upfront about the features not present in Quicken 2015. The hope is that development will continue at a good pace, and additional investment tools, better reports, and other features will follow in the months ahead. Quicken 2015 today doesn't meet all my needs, but I'm encouraged that it seems to be headed in the right direction. And most importantly, it represents a tangible re-commitment to having a robust Quicken for Mac from Intuit management."  My final comment: "jacobs, Superuser" 's assessment that Quicken for Mac 2015 "represents a tangible re-commitment to having a robust Quicken for Mac from Intuit management" is consistent with the hopeful expressions which have greeted this product from the eternal optimists of Quicken's shrunken, battered Mac customer base. Unfortunately, this sentiment represents the triumph of hope over experience.  It is long past time for Intuit to deliver a *real* Quicken for Mac, and to send the de facto Lacking For Mac product line to the knackery. I, for one, migrated my 14 years of detailed Quicken for Mac data in 2012 to iBank, a genuine cutting edge full-featured personal finance application, frequently updated and very well supported. I have looked at, and have been impressed also by Moneydance, which is particularly notable as being a true cross-platform application -- something Quicken was ideally placed to be, but never has been, from the 1990s to now. (iBank 5+ is a Mac OS and iOS-only application, but with exceptionally flexible file import and export features, including better compliance with Intuit's own QIF file exchange format than some Quicken-branded products.)  After more than eight years of empty promises and Mac vaporware from Intuit since Quicken for Mac 2007, I refuse to drink any more Quicken for Mac Kool-Aid. I have experienced, firsthand, the entire history of personal finance software on Mac because I have kept financial accounts on my Macs almost every day since 1984/85 (initially using a long-forgotten product called Dollars & $ense, then Quicken, MYOB and iBank, and Microsoft Excel in Mac and Windows as a financial calculation and reporting application since version 1.0). I am totally unimpressed by Quicken for Mac 2015.  In my earlier review of Quicken Essentials for Mac at http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RBWLK74B6EPJ/ I wrote, in part, that Intuit's epic failure to properly update Quicken for Mac amounted to "the worst betrayal of customer loyalty and dashed customer hopes in the entire history of Mac software". I described Quicken Essentials for Mac as "a toy plastic knife for the tasks of skinning the personal finance grizzly bear". Quicken for Mac 2015, with features that place it somewhere between the toy-town accounting Quicken Essentials and the obsolete Quicken for Mac 2007, merely strengthens my conviction of having been absolutely correct in earlier negative assessments. Indeed, the outrageous con Intuit has foisted on consumers with Quicken for Mac 2015 shows I have been far too mild, not harsh enough in my past criticism, excessively restrained in spraying this product line with caustic metaphors. No other software maker has a track record to rival Intuit in repeated releases, and the most assiduous neglectful nurture, of Mac products which are the software equivalent of ox carts hyped up as Teslas, Sopwith Camels in F-22 Raptor livery, or Barbie Dolls pitched as peers of Gisele Bndchen. I recommend the same response to every other Mac personal finance user.  I also recommend extreme caution and skepticism when reading ALL positive reviews of this mediocre, bottom-rung product. The pattern of four and five star, one and two line unsubstantiated positive reviews, often posted around same dates from sock puppet accounts that have posted nothing or little else, is highly suspicious. The overall average star rating, which has been skewed upwards by these highly suspicious (in any case, unreliable) reviews, should be entirely ignored. On all the facts, and in comparison with Intuit's own Windows range and other manufacturers' superior competing products for Mac, Quicken (Lacking) for Mac 2015 is a genuine one-star item: the lowest of the low, just another "toy plastic knife for the tasks of skinning the personal finance grizzly bear".  POSTSCRIPT (23 June 2015)  Being an incurably curious masochist, I purchased the boxed version of Quicken for Mac 2015 over the counter from a reputable retailer in Philadelphia in April 2015. The cost was $80.99 including Pennsylvanias 6% sales tax. Intuit's anti-customer policies and attitudes had prevented me, as a non-US resident, buying the online download, or the boxed version, until my next visit to the US.  My hands-on experience of this awful product has confirmed my lowest assessments of it derived from pre-purchase research. I tested it two ways: 1. importing my old Quicken for Mac 2007 file via the QfM 2015 conversion (note: it converts, it does not read or write QfM 2007 data), and 2. starting a new file from scratch.  Almost a year has passed since the initial release of QfM 2015 in August 2014, but the latest update version 2.5.0 has added no significant features to redress any major deficiency of the initial release. Most astonishing of all, Intuit seems still not to have worked out that many Mac users travel, work, earn, spend and invest outside the United States and in more than one country and currency.  "Quicken for Mac 2015" is not even basic: it is sub-standard, for all the reasons I and other reviewers and comment writers have set out in great detail.  Mac personal finance software "basic" includes 1. Multiple currency support, and 2. Ability to read and write native files between any same-branded products on Mac OS and Windows.  Quicken for Mac 2015 cannot do "basic", despite being the latest iteration of the Quicken for Mac line which was launched 26 years ago in 1989. It is the longest-running personal finance product line for Mac, yet it is the *least capable* product in the entire field. As stated above, at least three competing products in the field, iBank 5+, Moneydance 2014+ and SEE Finance, are years - even decades - ahead of Quicken for Mac on most criteria. QfM 2015 is as capable of meeting "basic" personal finance needs as an ox cart is capable of meeting a car buyer's basic need for transportation because it has wheels.  QfM 2015 deficiencies and flaws are innumerable, but here are a few more in addition to those specified above and in the 80-plus comments attached to this review:   Currency on converted file defaults to USD$. If you want to change that, no preference setting is available across the entire file: it is necessary to go into the settings for each account and change it there.   Each account can be set to different currencies  but no currency exchange rate conversion in Quicken is possible!   QfM 2015 deviates from long-established accounting practice in terminology, accounts structure and reports. Look in vain for a balance sheet, cash flow or other such standard report.   When starting a new file from scratch there are no standard charts of accounts or category sets for common purposes such as household accounting, small business, or other common user profiles.  * Cannot import or convert multiple currency transactions from Quicken for Windows or other multiple currency capable applications.   Conversion from Quicken 2007 for Mac will not carry over scheduled transactions.   QfM 2015 by default saves its data file in the Library folder, a folder intended only to contain auxiliary system or application files like fonts and preferences. There is no File>Save As command. The Quicken working data file can be moved, but with a non-standard File>Move To command.  No other Mac database application I ever have seen works this way, for good reason: saving working data in a System-related folder is not compliant with Mac OS design, and could get novice Mac users into trouble.	-1
Avoid, avoid, avoid! Intuit has Zero customer service and relies on extortion to get users to upgrade. I've been a captive Quicken user for many years. I should upgrade to Quickbooks for my new business except it is the same company, Intuit. My last forced upgrade was to 2013. Now that I'm less than a year from another forced upgrade I have to endure a $10 off advertisement for 2015 every single time I open Quicken. Sheesh - if they'd support their product it would be a different story.	-1
Try to start Quicken this morning, but it insists on downloading a patch that is corrupted.  Then it crashes.  But I need to pay my bills.  It seems this product is way too unstable to be serious.  Of course you can manually download the "mondo" patch for when they screw everything up.  But the mondo patch on their web site is version R5, and Quicken is trying to download R6.  Not only can't I pay my bills, I'm wasting hours of my life.  If it didn't have so many bugs, it wouldn't need so many patches.  Each patch is worse than the previous.  I don't know who they have working on this software, but obviously they completely don't care about their jobs.	-1
I would just like to know why Quicken doesn't resolve software issues with their product.  Ever since I upgraded to 2014, last year, the product is buggy and slow.  I have a relatively new computer so that isn't the problem.  I have gone back to entering data manually for my 401k.  I bought 2015 to see if this version corrected the bugs from 2014...it didn't.  It was the same products as 2014.  I tried download my information from one of my accounts and it was messed up!  I had to restore my from a backup to get back my original data.  Why can't they even get my net worth correctly?  I update the prices and they show the correct amount in the accounts balance on the left, but if I go to REPORTS, the balance doesn't match the account balances on the left.  It used to be a good product, but without competition they don't care.  Microsoft Money used to keep Quicken improving its product.	-1
Only new features - credit report and portfolio x-ray - do  not work. Don't waste your money.	-1
When I imported my Quicken 2012 backup file into this new 2015 Home and Business application it appeared it just ruined decades of faithful record keeping dating back to 1992.  Thankfully I had the foresight to save a backup file and loaded it onto my laptop computer with Quicken 2012 installed. I read the negative reviews extensively, but I just could not believe they were accurate or true. It was the one and only reason I bought this 2015 version. I was perfectly happy with the 2012 version. I despise their marketing strategy of disabling the ability to download transactions from your various bank accounts after 3 years. It doesn't cost them one penny to allow indefinite downloads.  It is like we have to rent Quicken on a three year contract.  Or else, it will stop performing certain key features if we don't upgrade. I have just recently started to hate Intuit.  I think they must have some new greedy management that gets huge incentives to cheat their customer base.  I didn't realize how bad the Quicken 2015 version was until today when I looked back a couple of years and saw insane numbers.  For instance, it showed over $30,000 in cash and then a few months later, it was negative by $19,000.  This is my pocket money account. I would never have this much cash with me at home or anywhere else.  I finally found the problem. In some accounts, it was sorted by category instead of by date.  I never touch the headings, so this is something that Quicken 2015 did during the import from my 2012 backup.  I was totally panicked until I found the source of the problem.  I nearly uninstalled it to go back to Quicken 2012.  I have been a loyal customer since about 1990 or about that timeframe.  I've had random issues with stock purchases for years.  I've had to do the calculations by hand or Excel to be more exact because I could never trust Quicken to make the profit or loss calculations correctly and I don't understand why, either.  It's simple arithmetic.  If you are upgrading from a prior version and have extensive data files dating into antiquity, I suggest you try to control yourself and keep your credit card in your wallet where it should remain indefinitely.  Don't be tempted or intimidated into buying this version.  The 2012 version of Quicken is just fine - but I am not confident with this one.  Also, every time I opened my Quicken file with this version, the loading time was far longer than in Quicken 2012. I've got a really fast computer running at 4.6 GHz and it takes 8 seconds to load.  It's not such a long time, but Quicken 2012 was near instant with the very same file.  I've been a Quicken defender and advocate of this product for 25 years and now my faith and confidence are destroyed.  I will not upgrade again. I will have to record things from the internet by hand because Quicken is being a total jerk by disallowing me to continue doing that after April 2015. It's totally arbitrary. They must have some new jerk in marketing who is trying to gouge its customer base to coerce customers to upgrade every three years.  That is being totally idiotic.  And they jacked up the prices of TurboTax this year as well.  They stripped out Schedule C without telling anyone.  And the new version is far more expensive.  Well, I've had enough of Intuit. I quit.  I've already decided I won't spend another penny on Intuit products. I hope everybody else does the same thing.  It is the only way they'll become sensible.	-1
The only reason I upgraded from 2012 is because they were cutting off my online access (which I think is a rip-off).  This version is just like the prior version and I don't see any improvements.  And it still pops up ads occasionally when I launch it.  Spamming your customers via their financial software that they PAID for is tacky.  Shame on you Intuit.  I have already dumped QuickBooks for one business I operate, and we are looking to dump it for another business.  And yesterday I dumped TurboTax for H&R Block because Intuit stripped some forms out of TurboTax Deluxe to force an upsell.  Now this may be my last Quicken purchase too if a viable alternative presents itself in the next three years.  If you continue to treat your customers as nothing but constant upsell targets you will continue to drive customers away.  I have been a customer for over 20 years.  I also had a problem getting my "Intuit ID" to work and learned the customer support phone number provided on your website is a sham.  When called it just says to go to the website and then hangs up.  Again, shame on you Intuit.  UPDATE 2016-01-16:  After a recent update to the software, now it forces me a view an advertisement popup every few times I open the program.  Reducing the rating to 1 star because of this.  Hey Intuit...you thick heads...when I pay for financial software I don't expect to see ads when I sit down to do my finances.  SHAME on you!!!	-1
I skipped a couple of years because of the bugs in the last version I tried (2012). I hated 2012 so much I stopped using it in 3 months and uninstalled it.  2015 still has GUI issues throughout the entire application. I am a software developer, so these things stand out really bad. It is a shame they cannot fix any of them in 3 years.  The worst though is I am still seeing the same problem with synchronizing my main bank account.  It routinely skips transactions and never downloads them.  If it was only one transaction here or there, that would be easy to find and add manually.  However it always skips more than that. This past week it skipped an entire day and also all deposits for the week before.  Just the deposits for that week.  Finding what is missing when it is that many is cumbersome at best. The only way to easily fix it is to delete the account and add it back.  That always downloads those missing transactions so that means it is not a bank problem. This is not a solution though because then categorizations would need redone each time.  Anyway, three years later and many of the same old problems plague version 2015. They really need to hire some management that would at least pretend to know something about software development.	-1
Junk.  I had Quicken Premier 2013 and I wish I had stayed there.  It worked.  That's all I wanted.  Someone dreamed up some convoluted password scheme for the financial institutions and it DOES NOT WORK.  Quicken is quick-en to blame password changes (that I have not done in several years).  If I could revert, I would.  InTWIT was sure to state that once you upgrade and convert your files, there is no going back.  In other words, you're hooked, and screwed.  Time to try to recover my data, if possible, and find another software solution that hasn't been farmed out (off-shored) to a cheaper developer with no real-world QA.  I've been a Quicken devotee for at least 20 years.  I'm done.  If they don't care, neither do I.  I bought my CD directly from InTWIT as they offered a price slightly less than Amazon (I am a devoted Amazon buyer), but I wanted to reach the widest audience.	-1
I just bought Premier 2015 today at Costco ($69.99). Upgraded from 2012. haven't had alot of time to go through everything, but I will give you my initial observations. First, aside from the Portfolio X-Ray button in Investments, I see absolutely no change from my 2012 version. Same GIU, same menu, same options, same features. Perhaps i will find something "new" as I go. So far the main difference is that 2015 will download transactions and updates for another 3 years whereas my 2012 version sunsets in April. Second, starting with this version you must create an online account with Intuit in order for the downloads and updates to work. Intuit obviously wants your cloud business, but that is not required. Also, I have not yet experienced any popup advertisements. Third, the Portfolio XRay feature took a little tweaking to work. After 30 minutes and half dozen quote downloads, it finally recognized my investments. haven't checked the accuracy of Portfolio XRay yet but it is linked with Morningstar's XRay which is pretty good. Overall, 2015 is nothing to get excited about. It offers basically the same "ho-hum" experience. If your version is sunsetting, you are pretty much stuck with buying this version or going to an alternate program. I've tried just about all of them and never found one that worked as well as Quicken. I ran into roadblocks either importing my Quicken data or linking to my broker's website. So, here I am with another upgrade for another 3 years. I suspect Intuit knows fully well that they have the market locked in, and have no motivation to offer us anything other than the old Quicken status quo.	-1
Stay away from this one. Way to buggy. They ruined a once great software and turned it into the current worst software.	-1
Runs very slow	-1
I have used Dragon on Windows going back to the 1990's and have also used the old IBM ViaVoice on Mac OS 9 (a product bought up and then killed by Nuance, who back then called themselves ScanSoft).  Compared to the PC version, Dragon Dictate for Mac leaves a lot to be desired. Recognition speed and accuracy are fair compared to the Windows version but still better than IBM ViaVoice.  Where Dragon Dictate 4.0 seriously falls short is with editing and correcting. You might as well be typing everything as there will be enough errors no matter how clearly you speak and how well you annunciate individual words and phrases. When using voice commands to edit and correct, Dragon makes random selections.  It also inserts text at random places after editing (i.e. not at the cursor).  It is unbelievable but true that they have shipped this product repeatedly with the same bugs. As a long-term Nuance customer, I received my copy for $99 together with Password Genie (that I see no use for) directly from Nuance. People planning to pay the full price should be at least twice as reluctant to purchase.  To be fair, I would have paid $20 for something with this level of reliability and functionality.  Hence only 1 out of 5 stars.  Despite wanting to promote vendors who support the OS X platform, I really cannot recommend this product unless they would iron out the bugs.	-1
Not sure how this buggy program made it into production! The description for the software advertises transcribing audio files front and center...and this software does not even come close to doing a passable transcription. I used an audio file with one person speaking clearly. What I got back from Dragon Dictate was incoherent and nowhere near what was actually spoken. As this was the main feature I was looking to use, Dragon Dictate was a complete waste for me.	-1
Multitasking on a computer is a must these days making streamlining the experience all the more prevalent.  Voice commands would be the next logical step as our hands are already tied up and vocal tasking allows us to do another set of tasks.  Problem is that vocal recognition has never been a perfected science in the consumer market for everyday users and detailed command lists, or lack thereof, make marketing such products even more difficult.  Sure, word processing dictation is a handy tool for recording meetings and legal procedures but most authors, writers, and casual users prefer to type by hand given the lacking accuracy of said dictation software.  Dragon Dictate attempts to bridge this gap for Mac users and accomplishes a good amount but fails at the rudimentary basics.  In short, this product is NOT ready for wide distribution oh, too late.  For me, I needed software that allows me to multitask Safari and Final Cut Pro but know that having vocal commands for the latter is a long way off.  However, it would've been nice to have vocal software that can help navigate menus more seamlessly than using a touchpad or keyboard.  It's like the XBox Kinect or Sony Move as they require more effort to execute an action that can be exponentially easier just but touching a button making it more gimmicky than practical.  Dragon Dictate suffers from the same liability as the software has a delay, requires a mic (the internal PC mic works even worse in my opinion), and is severely limited in what it can actually do.  After doing a very annoying read-a-long calibration test that seemed more pass/fail (usually fail) as I kept having to repeat myself and, no, I do not have a speech impediment, quite the opposite.  After that process I attempted to play around with the various commands, which seemed numerous at first, but it didn't take long for me to realize that it wasn't nearly enough and they were all very basic.  If anything, there seemed to be more commands with controlling the software than my MacBook.  There were not nearly enough commands for Safari to make it worth stepping away from my Mac as I had to use both my hands and the software to navigate.  This isn't streamlining the experience as I want the option to be able to step away, grab my tea, and still be able to issue commands without having to go back to my computer to hold the software's hand.  My lacking experience with Dragon Dictate and Safari was consistent with other instances on my Mac only it got worse as the amount of commands became less and less.  After an hour of messing around I came to the conclusion that this software, while on its way to becoming a quality product, is NOT AT ALL READY and should be pulled for further testing.  For the price, this software is not worth it at all.  It's a prototype in middle-development, NOT a finished product.  I give it 2-stars because it is on its way and great for testing but that's about it.  Your average consumer will not like this, avoid until they beta-test a version that doesn't get referred to as a beta product.	-1
For a basic dictation software, this works well enough.  It types what is said with great accuracy.  Dragon's voice recognition is truly the best available.  The problems arise with formatting and editing.  Often capital letters are missed.  Paragraph formatting has errors.  Inserting edits or new sentence fragments will create false capitalization.  This can be very frustrating and time consuming.  As a regular user of Dragon Naturally Speaking for Windows (versions 10 and 12), I was disappointed with these problems.  The Windows version doesn't have them.  Why the problems here?  It doesn't make sense considering the same company is creating both software programs.  After 3 weeks of playing around with this software, I'm going back to using my Windows computer and Dragon Naturally Speaking 12.	-1
Dragon Dictate has been a somewhat frustrating experience.  This software came on a disc with no key to download, even though new Apple computers haven't had optical drives for some time now.  The software should be sold on a flash drive rather than on a disc and with a download included.  Installation was no problem after getting a disc drive.  Training was not a problem.  However, there is a bit of a learning curve with the commands and when using the software, it is necessary to actively give dictation, rather than to just speak.  When I have given verbal commands to a computer in the past, it was frustrating, and giving dictation just multiplies that into a continuous irritation.  The biggest problem is that the resulting documents are very error-ridden and really are more work to go back over and clean up than it would be to type them manually in the first place.  I can only recommend this software as useful for people who both need to make a record of their thoughts quickly and who can't type or for situations where there are large volumes of information to be dictated and a clean final document isn't important so a very rough draft is acceptable.  For me, it just isn't worth the bother.	-1
So far disappointed.  Keeps crashing, Updates not taking, freezes on certain applications.	-1
Buyer beware.  Intuit's business model is based on selling upgrades.  After 4-5 years, QuickBooks will require you to upgrade to continue using core features such as creating PDF invoices, accessing bank account online, and even accessing company accounts created with older versions.  If you don't, the version you paid a few hundred dollars for will be rendered an expensive check register.  Another issue is setting up bank accounts.  I spent hours trying to set up my online account at one of the largest banks in the world, and all I got was error messages blaming the issue on my bank.  When I tried to connect to my bank account using a different accounting package, it connected instantly without any hassles.  In 1998, when i first bought QuickBooks it was the only game in town.  Today, there are a dozen better alternatives such as Wave Accounting, FreshBooks, and others, which are free or nearly free, work right the first time, have more user-friendly interfaces, and won't be rendered obsolete after a few years.	-1
I use Norton since more than 10 years. In some times I contact with Symantec customer support, well yesterday I contact again and after more than one hour in this case the issues wasn't resolved, because Norton have a bug with the networks config, this means that you only block one card at a time where the Internet is, so what happen when you have more ethernet cards and some subnetworks? the answer is ... you are completely unprotected, there is no way to block other subnetworks, if you need to block, the only way is block one MAC address at a time, but you need to know the MAC address, what happen if you are in a big company, how to know all MAC address? if another computer appear in your subnetwork there no way to detect it or what happen when you change from network to network like my case and use other subnetworks, theres no way to block massively, only one by one.	-1
I never have a chance to download the item, it keeps asking to purchase another code. And when it goes to Symantec website setup, it becomes more complicated. I will not purchase again.	-1
It has been installed 6 times & the 2nd day will not open. I have called or chat with them & I am hooked up with someone over seas that does not fix it. I have asked for a USA phone number & they will not give it to me. I have had NORTON for over 10 years & this year they will not give you a disk, they down load it.. This has been going on for over 2 months. I WOULD LIKE MY MONEY BACK SO I CAN GET SOMETHING THAT WORKS.	-1
Is sad to know that the automatic map recognition in the firewall was removed in this Norton version, in most cases the companies improves their software, but in this case Symantec loses this characteristic. Now is necessary know the MAC address of all the computers in the network, then you need to invest many hours take note and write in the Norton firewall, well I think that the computers should do part of my job, and what happen if you forget one MAC address? you still give access to unknown computers when you don't know someone else is looking or surfing your hard drive. Its a shame.	-1
I do not recommend Norton Security because : (1) Beware you are buying a subscription, not the software. Once the subscription expires, all the software stop running. (2) Norton Identity Safe which stores your usernames and passwords for websites,also stop running once the subscription expires. Norton claims it is a free password manager on its website norton (com) BUT IT IS NOT. (3) I am using Windows 8. The software is full of bugs. Sometimes it works, sometimes it does not.  Many items on the MENU of the software do not work or do not respond when I click on them. I think they are there just for looks. (4) Tech support is BAD. I called at least 7 separate times, each time the instructions given do not get the software to work. At first you are talking to someone with an Indian accent from India. Then if he/she does not fix the problems, usually the case, you are transferred to non-Indian tech support. He/she told me to reinstall the software at least 4 times. He/she told me to download a remote connection software so he/she could check inside my computer. After spending one hour inside my computer, he/she failed to fix the problems and just hung up. (5) The Identity Safe works sometimes in Google Chrome. It does not work in Internet Explorer or Firefox. You can read about numerous posts on the internet about it not working. (6) I am using Kaspersky Security which has less bugs and works in all 3 browsers, Chrome, IE and Firefox.	-1
Beware.  I've used Norton Antivirus exclusively for about eight years now, but this year's version has a big problem if you use encryption:  It will cause hard stops, the blue-screen-of-death if you try to run either TrueCrypt or any other form of file or disk encryption.  Until Symantec fixes this problem I would avoid Norton security products if there's any chance you will use encryption software	-1
Rotten. After it installed, it was very difficult to access the internet. I had to restart the machine several times. I ended up booting my machine from an external hard disk drive for a week. The uninstaller didn't work. So in despair, I installed a completely new system. That got rid of the problem. I then bought a competing product which seems to be working well. I have had good luck with Norton in the past but certainly won't ever buy it again.	-1
[Please read the new update at the end of this review]  I have used Nero as my CD/DVD burning software pretty much since my first computer, so I obviously am one of their loyal customers. It has always been a better choice than the other options out there, especially since some of those have become fat, sluggish media suites and have forgotten their roots.  Nero has also fattened up, but several of its components are still very usable and useful. Why then does this product rate only 1-star?  Despite all of the positive features, and there are many, there is at least one feature that makes this product totally unacceptable with a warning of Do Not Buy. Note that this feature may not apply to everyone, and there are lots of users who will never face this situation. But for those whom it affects, it is a disaster that you will have no control over, and it can utterly destroy your media library.  Here is what happened to me  when I opened the Media Home feature of the software it automatically searched my drive and ALL connected drives and automatically (and without my permission) converted numerous files and resaved them, overwriting my original file. This starts happening immediately, and as a typical user I have no idea what was happening at first. I started poking around in the options menu and learned that the program is set to change file names and formats by default and you have to manually turn that feature off.  So, in real terms, is this a deal-breaker? Yes. The first time I started Nero Media Home it started searching my attached backup drive and converting irreplaceable media files, some of which I had collected over as long as 15 years, into their acceptable format. Every one of them became a 291kb Nero format file, never to be opened by any other app ever again. So despite Nero advertising that their media player will play anything I tried to open those 291kb files (which is impossibly small to contain audio, video or photo information) and the app informed me that the file could not be opened. That it is corrupted and unusable. And I was left with countless worthless media files.  I immediately uninstalled the entire software suite when I saw what was happening and threw it in the trash. Please understand that you may buy, use and love this app and this may not affect you. Only those of us who have an archive of media files that Nero decides to convert on its own and without permission will consider this software to be unacceptable. If you're not sure, its a big risk to take. Too big!  To be fair, someone who said they represent Nero responded to my review basically saying what I described is impossible and that I should contact tech support but they didn't give me a service ticket number or escalation contact. However I already ditched the software so thats not much help. I'm surprised at their denial that there's a problem. That type feedback from them seems to be consistent throughout the other 1-star reviews (which seem to have a trend of getting not-helpful votes from "someone") while, as others have pointed out, it seems most of the 5-star reviews are only a few words long about how they love the product but those reviews lack any useful details why they love it so much. I did re-write my review to assure my experience is described honestly and accurately, whether Nero chooses to accept that fact or not, and as a previously happy long-time Nero user who has to this point said many positive things about them, I'm disappointed.  [IMPORTANT UPDATE]  after upgrading to WIN10 I thought I would give this software another chance, after all how could they keep selling it if it was so bad? I realize that most people only have a handful of photos, videos and songs on their computers these days and most people won't care if Nero decides to optimize their files. I installed Nero under controlled conditions (I unplugged all of my external drives first and made sure I didn't have anything important on my main hard drive. Sure enough the same thing happened to me as the first time I tested it. As soon as I connected a drive with pictures, videos and songs on it, Nero went to work to optimize them. This time I knew how to stop it before it destroyed everything and I took the time to take screen-shots before I uninstalled Nero (I was using a newer copy of the same version as I previously threw away).  Why would I care if my photos are turned into low-res JPEGs? Well, I purposely work with my files in both RAW and PNG so I can edit multiple layers in a non-destructive mode. Once the files are reduced to low-res JPEGs they are useless to me. Also  I have in excess of 50,000 photos on my hard drives. Nero wants to put them all into an album for me. That works for people who have maybe 100 photos on their computer. The last thing in the world I want is a photo album with 50,000 pictures in it.  BTW, once installed it is IMPOSSIBLE to remove just the MediaHome app by itself, so you cant just keep an app that may be actually useful like the burning ROM app.	-1
I have used many older versions of Nero software. The Nero2015 seems to have problems with linking to the Gracenotes database for extracting the song titles of my music CDs. I checked the settings and confirmed that the "access to Gracenote online database" option is enabled. I also installed all the latest updates and the problem still exist. I tried the same music CD with Nero 11 and it had no problems with extracting the song titles.  Lastly, I  searched the Nero online support forum and noted that other users also had the same issue but there was no response / solution from Nero support.  Buyer beware	-1
Would not install on windows 8.1, and after trying to talk to their tech support, or lack there of, I returned it for a refund	-1
I had never had any problems installing McAfee products in the past but not so this time.  On my first attempt, it prompted me to uninstall a competing Norton software had expired.  I uninstalled and was prompted to restart.  I rebooted and the installation was completed.  It even asked me to sign in to McAfee with my userid and password that I had set up years ago.  I restarted and noticed the McAfee extension on my Chrome nav bar, I clicked on it and it prompted me to enter my userid and password.  I entered the same ones that I used during the installation which had worked.  Not so this time!  It repeatedly told me that no such user exists even when I clicked on "forgot password".  Then, I clicked on forgot email.  It asked me to call customer service but did not give me any phone number.  I also did not find any links to register.  What?  Thinking there is a mistake, I restarted the computer again.  Another box pop up to prompt me to install the software.  What, I just did that.  I tried installing the software but I still experience the same issue when I clicked on the McAfee extension.  After 1.5 hr. fussing with this software, I gave up.  This infinite loop was just not worth my time.  Given my poor experience, I do not recommend this product.	-1
Installed easily on one computer but not on another one. Also, I am not happy with its ability to block viruses. My desktop (with McAfee Internet Security 2015) was rendered useless by a virus and the situation was so bad I couldn't use my rescue disks to reinstall the original factory software.	-1
Software would NOT load.  This diskette install software could not delete an an obsolete copy of Office Scan Client.  Went into a constant restart loop.  Finally the effort was aborted.	-1
Upon opening this new version of Norton Security I was surprised to see that even though it's a boxed product, there's no installation disc in there, just a card with a product key. You actually still have to download all the files to install (so why not just sell it as a digital download instead of assembling and shipping out boxes?). Unlike other reviewers I didn't have any problems with the installation, although I was amused right off the bat that the first thing it tried to do was uninstall AVG. It's true that you shouldn't run more than one anti-virus at a time, but rather than warning about that and offering to turn off your other anti-virus tool, it instead tries to uninstall it, which is pretty intrusive.  The main selling point on this edition of Norton Security is that it's compatible across a range of operating systems  Windows, Mac, and even mobile devices - and one instance covers up to 10 devices, so everything on your home network is protected instead of having to buy the software multiple times. Once it was installed I actually liked the sleek, minimalistic design that isn't overwhelming with options and features on the main window, and I found everything easy to navigate through.  Despite the nice design, the problems started popping up immediately as I began searching through the features. The software comes with 25GB of free online storage, with an option to buy more space. I clicked the more storage button and it tried to open a webpage by using my word processor, instead of my web browser. Obviously there are some programming issues here.  The software lets you setup automatic backups of folders to run regularly so you don't lose your data in the event of a problem with your computer. Unfortunately it's not super user friendly for selecting specific files and folders to back up, as that takes quite a few extra steps, and instead it wants to select for you the most commonly backed up file types (media files in My Documents, email addresses, etc.). Backup is also very, very slow. After 2 hours of still saying 0% copied with only a handful of text and image files selected I finally gave up and canceled.  I opened up Google Chrome to see if there was any troubleshooting tips available and I discover Norton has automatically installed a web browser extension without asking my permission  and that unwanted extension completely nerfs the Facebook interface, making the search bar float all over the screen while scrolling down. After uninstalling the extension, an add continuously pops up throughout the day at the bottom-right corner of my computer screen telling me to re-install the Norton toolbar in Chrome. At this point I'd had enough and started uninstalling.  On the upside, the Norton quick scan is actually quick - about 15 minutes and done, and unlike some other pay anti-virus tools I've used, it doesn't significantly slow down my computer or interfere with gaming. But considering all the problems with the program  and the fact that you have to re-buy it after 365 days  I'm left wondering why on Earth I'd pay for this instead of just using any of the free anti-virus tools readily available online that actually work and don't try to continuously install unnecessary tools I don't want.	-1
Well first off it's a "download" that I now paid more for than ever & must take it for 10 units if you want backup. Next after download your ID safe will not work on Firefox without a patch or something. On top of all that now I get to pay for an ad for "Staples". O'yes , I had to spend 45 min. with my computer under the control of the "on line customer service" somewhere in India or China you know so they could re-do the entire download/patch. Yes I would give it about a 1 1/2.	-1
I too am one of those unlucky ones who spent HOURS trying to get this to install on my computer. I am a HUGE Norton fan, use their Norton 360 for some of my computers; but was thrilled that this one would go on my phone and additional computers.  It was a huge disappointment. I spent hours on the phone with customer service, only for them to call a couple weeks later and say they had fixed the kinks in it... but it still had the same issues. I honestly never tried again after that; who needs this?  I do have it on my android cell phone and it seems good but nothing fancy. Meh.  Definitely either get it off their website, or else get an actual disk.  The whole "boxed key" thing was an absolute nightmare.	-1
iT DOES NOT WORK, I T SEEMS NORTON CAN NOT FIX IT.	-1
Do not buy Norton Security if you are using Windows 8 or 8.1 because : (1) Too many bugs. Nothing happens when you click on many menu choices. (2) Tech support is provided by Indians in India with a thick accent. They failed to fix the software problems. Then you are transferred to tech support in the USA, who ALSO failed to fix the software problems. Wasted 2 hours on the phone on 3 separate occasions. (3) Tech support remote accessed your computer, still failed to fix the software problems. (4) The software also causes your computer to run HOT. (4) The "free" password manager called "Identity Safe" works sometimes in Chrome, sometimes in Internet Explorer, depending on the websites. It worked on safeway website only in IE, but not in Chrome. It did not work on many webs sites.	-1
Why did we have to do away with the good old disc? I am a great booster of Norton and have used it since the TRS 80 days, but this new version came as a card with those endless serial numbers which are so easy to type wrong. Then I got into an endless battle about my password which I had entered before the stone age and had forgotten. Result: I don't know whether or not this is a good program because I am still trying to load it. I only want it for one machine, but my purchase is so over protected and guarded less I try to use it on six machines, I am totally disgusted and will have to go waste more time trying to load it.	-1
Norton is going down the tubs, harder to use and GUI is not intuitive.  This product was better before.	-1
It was not a disk. When I tried to get the upload from the Norton site, all I got was crap about buying more stuff. I have used Norton for a long time but I bought another brand this time.	-1
I'm a big fan of Norton Antivirus the past few years.  Slim, low profile and gets the job done.  Norton's changed the product line and merged Norton Antivirus and Internet Security.  Big mistake.  This product covers five devices, but most people don't need it for five systems.  At $80 a pop that's a crazy expensive product.  The mobile product line is deceptive.  The iOS version doesn't offer any malware protection (apple does that).  They offer a lost phone finder, which is built into the OS anyway.  I didn't test the Android version, but at least that version offers some malware protection	-1
Disclaimer: I am not a tax expert and do not claim to be one. However, I believe this "standard" edition of TurboTax that I have been asked to review has filed my taxes incorrectly.  Last year, I was unemployed and the IRS offers so called free filing through various companies if your income is below a certain limit so I tried the free version TurboTax offered through the IRS.  When I told them I had a HSA, suddenly I was no longer able to file taxes through TurboTax even though I met the income limit.  A HSA is nothing complex, it's a savings account for healthcare expenses, but suddenly I no longer qualified for free filing. Instead, they tried to upsell me to an expensive version.  This seems like a scam.  This year, I elected to review this retail version of Turbotax and the question of whether or not I had a HSA was not mentioned at all.  Fine, maybe laws changed because of the ACA and HSA's no longer matter.  TurboTax wanted to charge an extra $39 to file taxes for my state which I declined.  For no particular reason, I decided to look through a tax booklet (not included with TurboTax) and it seems I was supposed to include a Form 8889 with my taxes to show if I had deposited or withdrawn money from my HSA.  Because of this I believe TurboTax filed my taxes incorrectly, and I will need to go through the hassle of making corrections to my return.  Looking at the back of the TurboTax box, there are four (!) different versions to buy but there is nothing saying which version you should use if you have a HSA. So being unable to find the correct version of Turbotax to fit your needs may cause your taxes to be filed incorrectly.  This product claims to be able to file a 1040A which I normally use, but the truth is, it's only good for a 1040EZ and anyone should be able to file a 1040EZ on their own.  As a result, I don't recommend you use this product and I will not use it in the future.	-1
No need to pay for this when the free version is available on the web. I used the free version of TurboTax to prepare a 1040EZ, and a basic return is all that you can prepare with this paid version without having to upgrade, so save your money and use the free version. The free version was easy to use and resulted in a higher return than I was expecting, so I was quite pleased with it. I was going to use the free version of TaxAct for comparison purposes, but was never able, not even after multiple tries, to successfully register with the TaxAct website, so I don't recommend that one,	-1
There is nothing in this package that cannot be accomplished with TaxAct.  The only reason I stay with TurboTax is sheer passivity.  (Laziness.)  Over the years, I have already added all of the information to the program, from employers to assets and income, so that I basically only need to enter the numerical information.  The only work is in gathering the information.  There was a time when ONLY Turbo Tax worked with Macs.  That is not true any more.  This year, I have to spend a carpload of time arguing with them as well because they have made all of the schedules more expensive by putting the basic schedules in a more expensive package.  I received an email telling them that once I have purchased the Home & Business model, then I can apply for a $25 rebate.  NOT A CHANCE.  They have turned this into a fiasco for customers.	-1
Unless you have a single income, no deduction and you are expecting a full refund, then this product is probably not for you. Even if this is your situation, you probably still do not want this product.  If you make less than $60,000 from a single income and you plan to file a 1040EZ form, you should investigate the free file online at the IRS website.  So save your money and look elsewhere.  If you have deductions, of any sort, then you probably want one of the other Turbo Tax products, the TurboTax Deluxe, Premium, or even the Home & Business edition. These other versions help you calculate your deductions.  When I got this version, I did not realize it could not fill out a 1040 form or deal with common deductions.  I understand now that the product offering has been changed while the name has remained the same so you now getting a completely different product than in previous years.  This product is not worth the purchase price.	-1
When they say Basic, they really mean it. Turbo tax has taken good tax software and split it up into pieces. This software is not like other years where you get more for your buck. It's basic and for the 1040 EZ and A, but not much else. I would only buy this if I were filing the 1040 EZ and had nothing much to deduct.  This may be a death nell for Turbo Tax, I'm afraid.	-1
When I ordered this, I did not realized that this product has been altered from previous years and no longer meets our needs (or the needs of nearly anyone). I showed this to my father (who is a trained, volunteer who visits senior centers and assists elder-persons with their taxes) and asked him who could actual use it. He laughed and said, "A 16-year old who just got his first job at McDonalds." Sadly, only an extreme minority of people can actually use this software this year.  Hopefully, you are seeing this review and can catch yourself before ordering this product. I know that it's only $15.00 ... but you shouldn't be "out" $15.00 for a product that you can no longer use.	-1
Doesn't work for us.  When I ordered this, I didn't realize it did not include what we need.	-1
Intuit is now vying to become one of the most hated companies in the US. They have a great product (not this one), but their greed and contempt for customers gets worse every year.  I have purchased their products for years and almost always end up paying far more than I want in order to finish my return. I admit that their interface is superior to their competitors, but the programs often prompt you to purchase a more expensive version in order to finish your return.  The product I am reviewing today offers so little that it should be a free product. And it pretty much is if you go to https://shop.turbotax.intuit.com/taxfreedom/turnaway.jsp.  This Simple 1040EZ/Z is so limited that it's hard to conceive that many people can actually use it. For example, you cannot fill out a Schedule A or use a 1099, You also cannot use it if you have ANY investments, rental income, or business income. It exists so that Intuit can lure you into buying it, start your return, and then get prompted to purchase a much more expensive upgrade. This is their business model. They know that most people will not stop their return, especially since they've already paid Intuit.  Intuit has so much contempt for its customers and is so motivated by greed that if they continue on this road they will forever tarnish their brand. It won't be long before they'll need an Olivia Pope to come to their rescue.  Chill, Intuit. Offer your products at a reasonable price and quit being so freaking greedy. It's unseemly.  This is the year I stop using Intuit and their products.	-1
This is a truly dreadful product, worthless to all but the most basic tax-filers. One cannot include here any deductions beyond the scheduled standard deductions, no investment returns, not anything, in fact, except standard w-2 earnings reports and tax. Any need beyond that will require that you buy an extra, much more expensive program.  For years, I was a devoted Turbo Tax user. Last year, I switched to H&R Block Business, and the trial of this product confirms the wisdom of that decision.  No more Intuit Turbo Tax for me.	-1
Subterfuge!  Needed to upgrade to Premier, even though used Deluxe in 2013!	-1
This reviewer has used Turbo Tax for years with success.  This year's version was a disappointment; the company charged extra for features that previously been included in the basic package.  It is fair to note that after a storm of criticism, Turbo Tax attempted to make the situation right.  By the time this reviewer got around to filing later in the tax season, at least some of the problems had been corrected, and Turbo Tax continues to be a good way to manage the annual nightmare with the IRS.  Here's hoping that tax year 2015 sees a return to the comprehensive and easy to use product we have come to expect from Turbo Tax.	-1
Turbotax has crippled its version of the deluxe software by eliminating several forms that were available in its previous version. Turbotax is thus forcing one to upgrade to it s more expensive versions. It is time to switch to H & R Block software.	-1
Beware TurboTax Deluxe no longer provides  for 1099 B income.  I have used TurboTax for many years - except one year long ago when they tried to charge $9.99 to print an extra return.  Now they're doing it again with a different approach.  If you receive a 1099 B which is very common, when you try to enter it, it will hold you up until you give them $30.  You cannot even manually enter it. This is definitely a BIG price increase.  Now is the time to try other tax software.  PS: The support people for TurboTax are very nice.  I give them 5 stars.	-1
Utter and complete A-holes!  Not only does the "Premier" software not include basic things such as rental property, but then when you try to finish your taxes, they double charge you for the state download.  Deceptive pricing, because this will cost you at least double the price stated by the time you download the rest of the program and you pay twice for the state.  And to make things worse, when you call in you get a robot which will talk you in circles for 20 minutes before sending you to a real representative.  I was told by the representative that they knew they had a lot of issues with pricing this year and will go back to the way they did things in 2013.  I don't know if I can believe them.	-1
Should have listed to the other reviews. Have been using TurboTax for over a decade but the product has gone to the dogs. Will not be using next year, I can promise you that.	-1
The cost to do the same taxes this year with TurboTax has significantly increased over last year.  Even the State E file fees went up after I bought the product.  Intuit needs to understand that we won't continue to allow them to act like the IRS and take advantage of us.  We have choices like Tax Act, H&R Block etc.  Please boycott this company until they stop acting so greedy.	-1
As other have complained, Deluxe is now pretty much the basic package and if you have any stock or other investment income, it will not work for you AT ALL. It makes you pay $30 to upgrade.  Intuit has apologized and offered to refund $25 (why not all of it? This is a huge nuisance)  I would forgive them for all that, but the customer service has been HORRIBLE. After waiting on-line for over 20 minutes to find out why I didn't get my upgrade confirmation number, the incompetent CSR (who barely said two words to me in 5 minutes) accidentally hung up the phone. Now I'm back in line again for another half hour...  Other years, I would have given them 4 stars, but this year is a bit of a nightmare.  What a complete and utter screw-up.	-1
Lots of problems with the SW this year.  I was not happy with it.  We spent more time debugging and triple-checking than we should have.  Worst of all, Schedule C was omitted from Premier, and we used this same software last year and it was there.  Postings on the Intuit website say that Schedule C is included, and others say it is not.  The correct answer is IT IS NOT INCLUDED.  They instead expect you to buy TT Home and Business.  Consumers Beware of this tricky scheme.  Even worse is that when I tried to return the opened product within the 60 day window, as detailed in the TT policy, which says that returns are "Guaranteed Easy", my return was denied because I did not buy the software directly from Intuit. This is important to Amazon customers as this means that you may not be able to return the software if you find it won't do what you need it to do.  I spent almost an hour on the phone, only to get incorrect info about the return policy, which states that I should be able to return the software within 60 days.	-1
As with others, I have used the Delux version for years without issue until this year.  I was irritated, to say the least, with having to upgrade for something as stupid as "well, we want it to match the online versions we sell"!  What idiot takes away features?  Since i have been using this product for years, I did not want to have to change all of my data to a new system so I bought the "enhanced" product!  What a crock.  This version hounds you constantly to upgrade!!!!  Add to that the fact you cannot buy it without "State Tax Forms"  (We do not have an income tax in our state, why am I paying for this?) and they really did find a way to make things bad.  To add insult to injury, now Turbo Tax says they will refund the difference you had to pay for the version change.  The Catch?  You have to give them your SOCIAL SECURITY number!!!!  Why?  so they can get your last years tax return!!!  What do they need with my Tax Return??????  They have no business knowing what my taxes are!  Why should i trust them with that information?  So, here they go turning a bad situation into an absolute nightmare!!  I absoluetly will NOT use this product again after this year.  If I have to, I will go back to filing a paper form before i will ever buy from this company again!!!  I give it two stars because the software does work.	-1
WARNING WARNING This really ticks me off. This only works if your IMac is 10.7.5 or later!!! Now I have to buy upgrades.  NO reason for this- why can't it be more compatible?????	-1
Shifted over to Turbotax Deluxe last year (2013)just to get a product made by the same company as Quicken Mac.  Prior to that I had been using TaxCut (HR Block) for 10+ years.  I found the products to be similar and both gave the same result and refund.  Now getting ready to buy for 2014 taxes and find by the many reviews that Turbotax Deluxe does not cover filing of Schedule D (efile) and as a result I must buy Turbotax Premier which is $40 more than HR Block.  I am one of those that is shifting back to HR Block Deluxe.  Intuit let me know when you plan to revise Turbotax Deluxe to support Schedule D filing.  Your greediness lost another customer  Update after using HRBlock 2014. Very happy I shifted over to HRBlock from Turbotax. Bought HRBlock Deluxe for 2014 after using Turbotax for several years and Taxcut before that. I shifted over to HRBlock (used to be Taxcut) after reading many Turbtax reviews that you can no longer use TT Deluxe for Sched D efiling for the 2014 version. TT requires you to buy TT Premier at a cost that is 2x that of HRBlock Deluxe. I found HRBlock excellent. It imported last year Turbotax files as well as Quicken for Mac 2015 files without error. I found HR Block easier to use and the import was more complete than Turbtax (TT) deluxe. I am very happy with the shift to HRBlock. All of my fears of shifting tax software were unfounded. TT has gotten greedy and others should consider letting the market send a loud no buy message to Intuit (TT parent).	-1
As you've no doubt read, Intuit has decided to ripoff their long time customers this year. Here is the info that they have finally decided to share...  "The change we made to our desktop products, both the download and CD versions, includes removing Schedules C, D, E and F from TurboTax Deluxe, which some long-time customers had relied on to report business income, investment sales and rental property income. As a result, you may now be required to upgrade the version of TurboTax you use even though your tax situation hasn't changed from last year.  Here's why we made the change. Over the years, we have worked hard to make it easy for you to choose the TurboTax product that is right for you and your unique tax situation. We want that choice to be clear and confidence inspiring. However, as new online and mobile technologies emerged, our products, and the tax scope and features they included, began to differ, leading to customer confusion. These differences also impeded our ability to introduce new innovations across our entire product line."  They offer a $25 rebate if you filed with TT2013, TT2014 and filed both years using a CD/download version of the software - AND proceed to spend the additional $40 to upgrade to their Home & Business Edition. Though if you call them, you will likely get a free upgrade. However, this does not excuse what is blatant corporate greed, knowing full well that most people will just fork over the money and be done with it.  I made the mistake of attempting to file with TurboTax for 2015 only to have error after error with the final process. (See separate review.)	-1
After ten years of using Turbo Tax, I will be taking my money to H&R. While there is nothing wrong with TT, it's actually a fine product, this is the second time in 3 years that the makers greed has overshadowed the usefulness of the software. As a Quickbooks user, this "over site" by parent company Intuit, has also lead me to start looking for an alternative to QB as well.	-1
I first experienced Intuit's belligerent behavior when I upgraded my Quickbooks Enhanced Payroll last year and found that I would now be charged more to write checks and get to waste a half hour of my life on the phone getting myself off the automatic annual renewal treadmill. Now, with Turbo Tax Deluxe, the very same product I've used, and been very pleased with in years past, I find that I can only e-file half of my taxes, as schedules C and D can only be e-filed with an upgrade to Premier. You got me, Intuit... Classy!  To be fair, if you search out the product listing for Deluxe, it does what is described in the listing, which is great for folks that are experiencing their first rodeo. However, there are probably thousands upon thousands of people who have been using this product for years and expect to get what the product has always been. Instead, these loyal customers get a healthy punch to the abdomen. In my opinion, if you want to squeeze more money out of your regular clientele, just spit in their face up front by charging more for the product they're used to, as opposed to luring them into buying a product they think they know only to hit them with a gotcha half way through their tax preparation.  What in the world did Intuit think the public reaction to their new money siphoning tactics would be? I, for one, can't wrap my mind around any sort of justification.  Intuit has always made great products, nothing has changed in this regard. It is their mischievous, back door money grabbing that will be the death knell for this brand. If for no other reason than to show that you won't support a company that is obviously trying to take advantage of the loyalty of its customer base, don't buy this.	-1
After having had used TurboTax Deluxe for the last eight years to prepare both schedule C and E, TurboTax in its infinite wisdom (to maximize revenue) dropped these functions from Deluxe.  Customers reviews indicate that it might be possible for long term Deluxe users to get a rebate of $25.00.  However, I called customer support to discover that Intuit has yet again changed its policy and will instead give free upgrades to Deluxe purchasers.  This is not a stellar solution for those who buy and keep the discs for each year.  However, Customer Support did advise that I call after filing my returns to determine is a rebate is possible.  Current policy does not allow it.  Changing over to H&R Block requires climbing a learning curve, but anger is a great motivator.  Hopefully, Intuit will come to its senses before next year.  If not, bye bye.	-1
Im sure if TurboTax runs properly, its an enjoyable experience.  But if it doesnt, theres no recourse but to live with the softwares inadequacies.  TurboTax offers no absolutely helpnone that I was able to access.  So a frustrated user gets to the point of just paying extra taxes rather than doing maddeningly hopeless battle with TurboTax for more hours.  Im sure I overpaid at least $200 in federal tax this year, and overpaid a smaller amount in state taxtaxes that I didn't owe, and I might have avoided had TurboTax software run error-freeor if any help whatsoever were available.  I had two problems this yearother problems previous years, none ever resolved.  First, TurboTax would not let me enter the costs of vehicle registration.  Each time I tried, the program crashed.  I tried several times; I shut down and restarted, but each time I tried to enter vehicle registration costs, the program crashed.  I gave up.  The amounts were relatively small.  More significant were carry-over losses from stock-sales.  TurboTax would not enter this information because the program claimed my password was incorrect.  I was almost certain it wasn't incorrect; Id made careful notes from the previous year.  Nonetheless, I went through TurboTaxs change of password procedures.  When I got to the appropriate screen I entered a new password, and reentered it for verification, and I got a cheery little response: Your password has been successfully changed.  But it hadnt been.  TurboTax refused to accept the new password.  I tried the procedure again and again.  Again and again I was told my password had been reset.  But it never had been; TurboTax steadfastly refused the password, and refused to enter carry-over losses.  What I felt was interesting is that the problem I was having is evidently a common one, or so it would seem because TurboTax has a response button for exactly this problem.  That is, there is a pop-up button that suggests: If you have changed your password, but TurboTax still refuses to recognize your password, click here.  I did.  It took me to some advertisements for Intuit products.  The friendly TurboTax programmers must be roaring with laughter over that one.  But if a problem is common enough to merit a specific button, why not just fix the bug?  The answer to that question hints at TurboTaxs attitude toward its customers, I suspect.  If there is any way to get help from the folks at TurboTax, I sure haven't found it.  I think Id have more luck to have a prayer for a mega-lottery win answered.  When I finished my excess tax statement this year, TurboTax asked if Id like a copy save.  I responded, yes.  I was asked for my password, and then was told again that it was still wrong.  TurboTax should have a button at this point: Dare you still want to try to change you password, Sucker?  Abandon all hope yea who enter here.  I won't be using TurboTax next year if I can find any remotely suitable option.  Its far less frustrating to fill out the forms on paper.	-1
purchased and installed like the last 15 or so years. Discovered that I have to "upgrade" because we have some stocks and itemize deductions.  very disappointed that Turbo-tax is pulling the "must upgrade to do what you did last year(s)" shenanigans, just to get more money.  If you need to make more profit, just raise the price, don't eliminate the features of the prior years software.  I read somewhere that H&R block's software works without "upgrades"  turbotax may have lost a long time loyal customer if that is true.	-1
Bought in Dec but by January the price was lowered by $20.  I like most others thought we were buying the same program we had bought for 20 plus years but found that some of the functions we were used to are not in this version and had to buy up to get what we used to get.  So the price is higher and the functions are fewer.  Will definitely change to another tax program for future years.	-1
T Tax 2014 worked OK.  Two stars because the promised rebate has vanished into the ether wind.  All attempts to reach them on this matter has been to no avail.  The rebate won't make or break me, but its an Intuit integrity test, sort of.  This follows loud "Mea Culpas" from Intuit saying that they had screwed up.  Their promises and apologies rival those of a used car salesman.	-1
I am disappointedin the direction Intuit has taken with the most recent round of products. Rather than "Deluxe" offering you all of the forms and interviews you would require, the word "Deluxe" now just seems to be a differentiating brand on the packaging. In other words, Deluxe in the context of the description on the box doesn't mean what Webster's Dictionary says it means.  This will be the parting of ways for Intuit and my family. If you buy the Deluxe version, rather than being Deluxe it is going to wait for you to need a form that they say are not typical and offer you a chance to buy the forms and interview required to complete your taxes. I suppose that those extra interviews will make your version "More Deluxe". Maybe "Super Deluxe".  deluxe also de luxe  (d-lks, -looks) adj. Particularly elegant, luxurious, or elaborate for its kind; of superior quality or refinement: deluxe accommodations; a de luxe automobile; a hamburger deluxe.  Nope.	-1
I've been a TT Business user for many years and at this point, I am COMPLETELY FED UP WITH TURBO TAX BUSINESS - from a PRICING, FUNCTIONALITY AND UNRELIABILITY standpoint.  I just finished two 1041 Trust returns and had to report two major bugs to the Turbo Tax forum.  These were bugs in the GUI design or in the underlying code that drives calculations and fills in worksheets, or prevents you from doing so, in some cases.  I can back this up with comments from the TT forum acknowledging that I, as a former software tester, did find bugs.  Worse, Intuit just rolled out a software update to fix some of their bugs last week.  This is either good or bad depending on your point of view - and more importantly whether you already filed your return derived with the code that still had bugs in it!  Intuit/Turbo Tax got a lot of heat from their customer base with their sneaky repackaging and repricing schemes, and deservedly so.  I had already purchased my copy of TT Business and TT Premier, and am Mad as HELL that I have to buy two of the most expensive packages they sell, just because I own a small business and have to file a 1041 for my trust and an 1120s for my business.  I would rather just buy TT Ultimate in one package that has everything in it, and pay a $199 price and be done with it!  Instead, you start out each year playing the "pick your package" game with the TT software, which is getting OLD!  Even that would not be intolerable IF THE SOFTWARE WAS NOT RELEASED TO THE PUBLIC WITH GLARING BUGS AND GUI problems.  Here are just a few that I encountered that YOU need to be aware of if you are buying TT Business, especially if you need to do a 1041 for an estate or trust:  1.  MOST IMPORTANT:  TurboTax Business WILL NOT IMPORT YOUR Consolidated 1099 from ETrade, Ameritrade, Fidelity, Scottrade or ANYOTHER BROKERAGE Partner.  It is not possible to import a 1099 into TT Business.  NO SUCH FEATURE EXISTS.  I even had Ameritrade staff tell me it did, only to find out it did not on the TT forum website.  What this means is that, if you buy and sell a lot of stocks or bonds, you will have to enter EVERY DETAIL OF EVERY SINGLE TRANSACTION, one-at-a-time, including Purchase date, purchase price, Sale date, sale price, and description.  LOADS of fun.  Mine took about 4 hours!  Now, to be clear, if you buy Turbo Tax Deluxe, you can import your 1099 form for your brokerage.  But for $129 for Business, YOU LOSE THAT FUNCTIONALITY???  DOES THIS MAKE SENSE TO ANYONE?  You cant imagine the tedium of having to cross-reference an incomplete 1099 with a Gainskeeper Report to get all the data entered into Turbotax.  Then, there is the proof-reading of the manual entry of all that data.  Figure 6-8 hours total... LOST.  Thanks TurboTax.  2. There were bugs that cropped up during the completion of both 1041s we had to do.  A software update from a few days ago fixed part of the problem, but another part remains.  In short, DONT EVEN THINK ABOUT trying to do miscellaneous itemized deductions, as the code for the Miscellaneous Itemized Deductions Worksheet is mangled and it creates an error during final Error Check if you have any entry of any kind in this category.  Either put the deduction somewhere else, forgo it altogether, or buy another software program.  3.  If you are doing a 1041 and there are any foreign stocks in your account, such as BP or Vodaphone or any Canadian companies, then please be aware taht Form 1116 for Foreign Tax Credits is screwed up, too.  There is a workaround, but when you go through it the first time, don't expect it to work as it should.  4.  In prior versions of TT Business, you could shift into Forms mode and click on specific cells in the forms where calculated values appear, and then right-click and look up the Data Source for the value found in that cell.  This was a helpful feature in tracking down the ever-present bugs in TurboTax software so that you could find a way to complete your return in a timely fashion.  Well, not any more and not very much.  The developers at Intuit are either too busy, too lazy or just don't care, and they left out the data source info on almost every single calculated cell on almost every worksheet, at least as far as 1041 trust returns and related forms are concerned.  To be accurate, there were a few rare instances where the data source was filled in, but in most cases, either NOTHING appears (as if the option were greyed out), or what does appear in a pop-up is useless and meaningless.  5.  Last but not least, the constant issue of poorly designed GUI text and explanations.  Brevity may work in text messages, but if falls short in a tax return environment.  The ONLY GOOD THING ABOUT TURBO TAX BUSINESS IS THIS:  I get to spend a lot of extra time each year on the learning curve of the latest IRS tax forms and instructions, as I spend more time on their site trying to figure out WHY Turbo Tax's latest software is generating an error or not working properly, than I do entering data into the software.  THIS SOFTWARE IS PRICEY AND IS SUPPOSED TO WORK SEAMLESSLY SO THAT AN INTELLIGENT PERSON CAN ENTER THEIR DATA AND GENERATE AN ACCURATE TAX RETURN.  INSTEAD, WITH THIS YEARS SOFTWARE, YOU CAN COUNT ON SPENDING DOZENS OF EXTRA HOURS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHY ITS NOT WORKING.  Worst of all, I shopped around and bough this software at a discount price of $129 and now it has gone down in price.  As for me, I WOULD LIKE A REFUND.  I am completely fed up with the poor quality of TT software.  In fact, if it weren't for the kind assistance of some good hearted folks on the TT User forum, who are probably working for free, I would not have been able to complete my returns or have any faith in their accuracy.	-1
Edited 2.18.2014 I cannot even express my outrage and disgust over the two "apologies" I have received from Intuit over the downgrade of their TurboTax product, and their offer of $25 to "make it right." Apparently the Tylenol Effect has worn off, and this is the sort of corporate mumblemumble that passes for responsibility.  ******************************  Like so many other longtime TurboTax users, I reviewed my 2013 return to double-check the schedules I'd need.  Sure enough, I needed to move up two levels from my trusted TT Deluxe to TT Personal & Small Business to prepare my 2014 taxes using the same tax events as in years past. I'm deeply concerned that some aspect of this new return will be critically inconsistent with years prior, and trigger an audit. At this point I'm ready to forgo Amazon's 10% bonus, and turn to H&R Block software simply for a fresh start and some peace of mind.  I was talking with a friend who is a CPA, and apparently the Intuit dissatisfaction extends across all levels of their product line; TurboTax, QuickBooks, Quicken for Mac, on and on. She has had a wretched time preparing W-2's and other tax documents for her clients this year, all due to changes with Intuit's software for TY 2014. This is a company that has built a strong customer base over decades; I know, my family was involved from almost day one. This is as disgraceful as it gets, treating customers as dupes in a game of bait and switch which many will not realize until too late.	-1
I got TurboTax Deluxe only to find there is no Schedule C for small businesses.  So I gave it to my daughter. I've used TurboTax each and every year it has been available. Now I had to pay more than double for this version.  I'm buying H&R Block software next year. It's not enough that TurboTax has such a commanding market share, but now extreme greed has appeared. Some marketing genius decided to divide up the product into pieces to alienate all but the most basic customers.  So I'm switching next year. The reviews say that H&R Block software is equally as good. Now I regret buying TurboTax, especially when I can chat with a tax professional extensively at H&R Block. I may buy it anyway this year if I need any assistance or TurboTax is vague in some area.  I have some property in China and TurboTax is messed up in a certain area and I have to do some strange things to make it work. Somebody at TurboTax is out of date and doesn't know about the purchasing process.	-1
Have used Turbo Tax Deluxe for years, but this year Intuit decided to omit several forms in the Deluxe version and now charge an extra $30.00 just because these forms are now part of Turbo Tax Home & Business.  So much for customer appreciation and repeat users.  The program itself is good and installs easily.  Transfers are easy too.  Be careful however when installing because the program asks where you want to store your tax document--My Documents or Encrypted.  I first choose to store in My Documents--that received a pop-up stating this was risky and was I sure I wanted to do this.  I decided perhaps the files should be encrypted and filled out the necessary information to create an account on Intuit's web site.  Account created.  Then I saw the light so to speak.  Next year I will have to buy Turbo Tax again if I want to transfer my tax data.  I haven't found a way to save this year's return both on my computer and Intuit's Web site.  Uninstalling the program and reinstalling it still forces one to use Intuit's site.  The option to store in My Documents doesn't exist once you create an on line account to store your return.  Yes, this was my fault for creating an on line account, but there is an element of again taking advantage of the customer on the part of Intuit.	-1
Let me start by saying that this product worked for me because I didn't need schedule D or C this year. That being said I think that it is terrible that if you do need schedule D you would have to pay 40.00 more to upgrade. I have used TurboTax for many many years but in the future I will probably switch to H&R Block who do include them in the deluxe product. This is a greedy and stupid move that will no doubt cost Intuit many long time customers.	-1
Intuit has ripped it's customers off again! This is NOT the same product as last year's model! They have eliminated things I need. I buy the SAME version every year because I know it's what I need. Now they take that away and want to charge DOUBLE to get what I need. I want my money back and will never buy Turbo Tax again. You people are fools shooting yourself in the foot.  Free H&R Block software if you bought TT and want to switch! I'm in. http://thefinancebuff.com/free-hr-block-deluxe-state.htm Pass the word around.	-1
Intuit removed Schedule K-1 for reporting income from the Deluxe version after having it there for years and years and wanted me to buy the Premier version instead. I opted to buy the HR Block product instead.	-1
I've been a TaxCut (now "H&R Block Tax Software") user for nearly a decade, but I've always been curious as to whether or not the grass was really greener on the other side. I finally had a chance to see what my TurboTax friends have been raving about, and something tells me, we have very different tax needs.  TurboTax does a fine job of basic "I have a job, a mortgage, and kids" taxes, like you should expect from any not-free tax program. Plugging in hypothetical numbers for the 2014 tax year, the flow of TurboTax's interview isn't a huge departure from H&R Block, and is arguably easier. And, if you're expecting a big return, the 10% premium on receiving it as an Amazon gift card is very attractive.  But that's where the positives end. If you do any investing -- and I mean ANY investing, you're dead in the water with this product.  I saw on the feature matrix that the twice-as-expensive version was recommended for Schedule D. I make some complex options trades occasionally, and even my beloved H&R Block needs lots of help understanding how they should be entered, so I wasn't adverse to doing a lot of Schedule D manually. Thing is: you can't with this version of TurboTax. It's not a matter of the calculation feature being absent -- it's that you can't do it at all.  To be clear: I'm not saying "I can't believe they want another forty bucks just to calculate an iron condor option strategy that carried over two tax years from December 2013 to January 2014!". I'm saying if Grandma gave you 10 shares of Acme Corporation stock as a graduation gift, and you just sold it in 2014 to put towards a down payment on a house you bought. TurboTax will happily help you with the home purchase, but will do absolutely nothing for you to pay capital gains tax on the tiny number of shares you've had. H&R Block will, and will do it very well.  I simply can't see how Intuit gets off trying to justify this price, when&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/H-R-Block-Tax-Software-2014-Deluxe/dp/B00P6U8BA0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">H&R Block Tax Software 2014 Deluxe</a>&nbsp;does more out of the box, and for (at the time of this review) 25% less*. Let alone how five bucks more&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/H-R-Block-Tax-Software-2014-Premium/dp/B00P6U8C5Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">H&R Block Tax Software 2014 Premium</a>&nbsp;adds on Schedule C self-employment and rental property functionality. Go home, Intuit. You're drunk.  *What would a tax-related review be without an asterisk? While H&R Block Tax Software costs about 25% less, it includes free federal e-file, but not free state e-file. In my state (Michigan), there's an additional $19.95 cost to e-file. With state and federal, you have the option to print and mail your forms. As someone who usually owes state taxes, I've always chosen the cost of a stamp over the cost of e-filing. Your mileage may vary.	-1
I have been a happy TT Deluxe user for as long as tax software has been produced and was taken back last year with some loss of features so I was cautious as I looked for this year's software and started to read reviews first. What really stood out was the EXTREME difference between 1 star and 5 star numbers for TT Deluxe and what was brought forth in the 1 star reviews. Out of curiosity, for the first time, I began examining the ratings for other  tax software providers and am convinced that I need to change.  Goodby to TT Deluxe until I see a change in your response to user (dis)satisfaction!!!  PS. After a LOT of research on tax program reviews on other tax programs, I just ordered "H&R Block 14 Deluxe". Really looking forward to this experience!  Update 1/9/2015: Installed the new H&R Block yesterday and it went in with absolutely no problems or ado. Will know more and give another update when I receive the State program and do my taxes. Also, it only cost less than $24 which beats the heck out of TT!	-1
TurboTax Deluxe does not work this year.  They removed ability to handle 1099 B income.  Watch out!  They have also raised E file fee for state!	-1
with stock transactions buy/sell you can no longer e-file but we pay for e-file. is intuit that crazy to raise the price and for some eliminate e-file even though the user paid for it. why does intuit every other yer or so come out with a customer hit that costs them customers. h&r block here i come.	-1
Here is an update on what I have learned. As I understand 2014 Deluxe Turbotax they did not remove Schedule D and still provide all the same forms as last year and data can be entered using the interview process or forms method and your return can be E-filed. HOWEVER if you sold stocks, bonds, options, or other investment assets and if you are using Deluxe YOU CANNOT E-FILE.  In order to E-file starting this year you must enter stock, bonds, options, or other investment assets sale data using the Premier version. Some potential buyers will miss this subtle change. I did suggest that Turbotax clarify this new limitation on their web site and Amazon should do the same. It will save a lot of returns and a lot of unhappy customers. If you don't want to upgrade to Premier and pay the price look at the highly rated H&R Block program for $44 that imports data from Turbotax.  An update - 12/6/2014 I bought H&R Block Deluxe Mac disc version for $40 at Amazon and love it. Read my five star review on Amazon's H&R Block Deluxe site.	-1
This is complete plundering of their customer base.  Intui is getting extremely greed with both their Quicken products and this product.  Each year they put out a worsening product set(s) at a higher cost to tyeh consumer.  Their customer base will erode over time.  Someone at Intuit should get fired over this mindless plundering of their customer base.  After 20++ years of Quicken and Turbo Tax, I'm looking for altertnatives.  Options will present themselves to the market INTUIT, and will very likely suffer the consequences.	-1
Not a nice surprise as I truly did want to try out "Power Director 13", from CyberLink. But upon inserting the disk and attempting to install on my Win7 pro 64bit PC a window popped up indicating I didn't have, and needed to install, Windows Media Player 9 or above, as 'Power Director 13" requires it.  I didn't really want Media Player, but, for the sake of reviewing this product, I tried installing Player 9 and found it's incompatible with my PC; Player 10 is also incompatible, as is 11. The following is what I received from Microsoft: "You are running Windows 7 pro 64-bit. Although Windows Media Player will not run on your system, you can download Windows Media Player for other operating systems."  And I couldn't find any indication from the 'Power Director 13' advertisement indicating the need for a specific player, either. And I've 3 players on my machine: Quick Time, Adobe & Amazon. Bad luck for me.	-1
WE HAVE POWER DIRECTOR 10 ULTRA. UPGRADE TO PD 13 ? -- INTERESTING. FROM THE CYBERLINK SITE WE DOWNLOADED PD 13 ULTRA TRIAL VERSION (WE THOGHT). MESSAGE"(DOWNLOAD COMPLETE", MESSAGE DISAPPEARED AND NO SIGN OF PDR 13 COULD BE FOUND IN PROGRAMS AND FEATURES (WHERE PGMS ARE DELETED)  NOR IN C:PROGRAMS INCLUDING THE 86 FILE. CAN'T TEST IT IF WE CAN'T FIND IT. WIN 8.1 3.2, 8MB, 6TB, THREE MONITORS. NO CRASHES IN LAST SIX MONTHS.	-1
I give every single release of PD a chance.  And once again I learn the hard way that PowerDirector is the most shockingly unstable, problematic video editing jukware on the market - so much so that the company has to resort to having a paid hype man to respond (with vague responses) to all the negative reviews on Amazon.  How PowerDirector keeps getting awards is simply a baffling mystery.  I'm a software developer, and if I released software at this level of quality with my name on it, I'd get fired.  So once again, I'm running back to my workhorse, Corel VideoStudio Pro.  The bells and whistles count might be a tad lower (barely), but VSX7 is just as "64-bit" as PD, with no bugs, solid as a rock, better BluRay playback quality, interface that actually makes sense for a good workflow, professional quality downloadable content that isn't just a bunch of kiddie junk, real human tech support at no additional expense, no customers being treated like criminals, etc etc etc.  I'll give PD 14 a shot too.  But I can pretty much guess what's gonna happen, can't I?	-1
I bought it and messed up every computer it was on. I called and they said that I had to pay $150 to $175 more to get it fixed.	-1
I'm amazed what McAfee-HP did.  They installed a trial version on my mother's new HP PC, and when the trial expired after 30 days, disabled Window 8's ability to change firewall from McAfee to Defender.  I wasted 50 minutes trying to figure out why I couldn't change to Defender and then had to postpone my work, while I tried to get another McAfee license.  Meanwhile my mother's HP PC is entirely unprotected.  I actually have a McAfee 3 user license, so decided to activate my third license.  So wasted a day to get to my regular PC to get the activation code.  Then I learned from McAfee support that I have to remove McAfee trial and then install a new version of McAfee.  McAfee is deliberately wasting my time and its practice of crippling Defender is, in my opinion, wasting my time and is unethical.  1 hour later: I'm waiting for the email from McAfee that supposedly has a code I need.  You know, the email that I suppose to be send out immediately, and doesn't arrive for 30 minutes.  Meanwhile, I had to make a trip to my mom's and have to further wait here.  1 hour 30 minutes later:  waited 15 minutes on the phone for McAfee support.  4-10-15 Several times during the past 2 months, my computer nearly stopped (slower than slowed to a crawl).  After reviewing various potential causes, I finally determined McAfee Vulnerability Scanner was chewing up about 70% of my memory.  Called McAfee and they recommended I reinstall McAfee using the option of not installing  its  Vulnerability Scanner, which isn't required.  Lost about 3 hours so far.  Thanks a lot, McAfee.	-1
This product is a joke.  Using Windows 7 64 bit.  Would not install.  Checked their website.  Live Chat?  Said try again later.  Called the number and got an off-shore person who couldn't spell 'Tampa' where I was calling from.  They said it could take up to an hour to install.  An hour for a silly card program?  My DVD drive spun for 2 hours with no progress on the install bar.  You know this isn't even Hallmark, they out-source this to Nova, the maker of all those other mediocre products.  I'm actually a registered user of Hallmark 2011, but this upgrade was a disaster.	-1
Ive been using TurboTax for many years to file my returns, and had always been satisfied with them prior to this. Ive used both the online and installed software versions of their product in the past. My tax situation has been complex enough that Ive had to purchase much more expensive editions of the product to handle all the forms, and Ive generally paid extra for the audit defense guarantee.  This year I had two issues that really soured me on their product.  First, in some situations Intuit won't let you retrieve and print prior years returns unless youve paid for the current years product. I cant remember whether I filed the prior year in their online version or the downloaded software, but I am buying a house and needed to retreive the prior return for the bank. The lesson here is don't just save your tax return in Intuits file format. Export it as a PDF, save AND print it for your records.  The second problem had to do with one form I needed not being ready. I started my taxes in early January and filled in details as the forms arrived. The warning that I couldn't file because a particular form wasn't ready yet kept coming up, and finally I started looking for help in the forums. I found an article posted by them which said the form in question was available for everything but E-File on Mac, and that it would be available for that final format on January 30th. Two weeks past that date not only is the form not available for E-File, but printing a copy of it produces a big watermark DO NOT FILE - FORM NOT FINAL even though its supposed to be available. I tried checking for updates and reinstalling as suggested but no luck. I was finally able to find a telephone number for customer service and speak to someone there after a 20-minute hold, only to be told they had no information other than what I knew from searching the forums, and no process for escalating my call to anyone who could help or even give me an updated ETA. I was promised a full refund for the software but have had to start all over on preparing my taxes and several weeks have gone by in which I could have already filed my return.  Intuit makes it hard to speak to anyone in the first place, and harder still to find anyone who can help you with your problems. Between that and the limited access to your own information that magically becomes no problem if you simply give them more money, Im very dissatisfied.	-1
I have used TurboTax for the last several years, and each year, there is exactly one form that is keeping me from using a cheaper version of TurboTax.  One year, it was having an HSA. I could have filed with TurboTax Basic except for needing a single form (8889) causing me to need Deluxe instead.  The next year, it's a single stock sale causing me to need Premier instead of Deluxe. Is this by design?  I think intuit needs a better business model. Perhaps allowing you to buy single form add-ons for $1-2 each, instead of one form being a $20-40 upgrade to the next TT tier. Or just having only two versions of TurboTax: Home (includes ALL non-business forms), and Business (includes everything else).  Hopefully next year's TurboTax releases have a better strategy. If not, I will probably try out H&R Block's tax prep software.	-1
Turbotax has crippled its version this year so I am crippling my rating of its product!	-1
Isn't this the free version?  The "Basic" version used to do regular 1040 forms and also mortgage information and other deductions (although I never got any deductions).  Now you have to get the Deluxe.  And for Deluxe users, they have to get Premiere.  The 1040EZ version was always free.  Not sure what's going on in Intuit, but I'm out.  As much as I hate H & R Block, they are the lesser evil than Intuit.  I would give Intuit one more chance if they would upgrade me to Deluxe but when I called them, they couldn't tell me whether they would until I bought it.	-1
I did test out the free phone support offered with this version.  I called 4/14, and was told the wait would be >1.5 hours.  So much for priority phone support, I thought.  But, the automated menu gives you the option to leave a number for a call back later. I left my number, and YES, I got a call back 1:18 later from a real nice guy.  I don't know if he was a CPA, or just trained in tax prep, but he was reasonably knowledgeable.  My original question veered off to include a couple more topics by the time I was done.  He was very polite throughout, never seemed rushed, and was genuinely happy to help.  So that was a good experience in the end.  I hope that TT can hire more phone support people in the future so that wait times can be less than an hour at peak season.  The TT inputting seems to work pretty much the same as in past years.  If anything, there seems to be less annoying pop up ads to get users to purchase additional services than I remember.  I only use the investments (schedule D, K-1's - I know I should get rid of those) and not the rentals aspect.  I did feel somewhat forced to get the investment version even though I knew that Deluxe users could upgrade for free since I didn't want the risk of encountering a glitchy upgrade just before taxes are due.  However, just when I wanted to e-file my return, TT would not get past an error that I had to manually correct.  It just kept going around in circles.  So, I had to mail my return in, which was a waste of paper, time, & stamps for something that is usually easy and free.  Also, small bugs were in the program (like leaving in forms that were marked for deletion).  So I'm giving 5 stars for the phone, but the end frustration of not being able to e-file and the other small bugs was too large to ignore.	-1
I've used Turbotax for over 2o years.  2014 is the last year for me.  For the past 10 years I have owned a rental property in a foreign country and have prepared my taxes using Turbotax Deluxe.  This year I had to upgrade to the Home and Business version at a substantially higher price.  Strike One.  When I started to input my data on the rental property Turbotax software notified me that I had been claiming too much depreciation in past years and would have to file amended returns going back to 2010 as well as filing Form 3115 requesting IRS to allow me to change my depreciation method.  WTF???  I was relying on Turbotax to choose the appropriate depreciation method since I had inputted the fact that the property is in a foreign country and also provided the Canadian address.  Apparently turbotax has been miscalculating depreciation for the past 10 years despite the input data being correct.  Strike Two.  Now I have to do a lot of refiling and may incur penalties and interest (which, I assume Turbotax will pay) but even if I am held harmless the amount of time and effort spent, plus having to hire a CPA to fill out the form (Turbotax has not offered to provide any assistance with Form 3115, nor to pay the CPA's fee) it is still going to cost me big time.  Strike Three!  I am not the only person that has been burned on this depreciation issue.  The Turbotax community website is filled with similar stories.  My guess is that there will be a class action suit against Intuit over this.  They can count me in.	-1
Every year a negative surprise.	-1
Very over priced for just doing a 2 page grantors trust 1041 especially when you have to manually enter all the information.  They really should include this in a less expensive package or set something up online like they do for 1099 generation.  Next year I can do it myself without this package.	-1
This is absolutely horrible.  1) They have stripped out features that used to exist, at all levels, in order to force you into buying a higher level 2) The software makes frequent and gross errors in dealing with MLPs 3) There are bugs in the software, resulting in incorrect calculations 4) It crashes 5) There is no support. 6) Just to repeat - THERE IS NO SUPPORT - other than groupies who may / may not know what they are talking about	-1

Turbotax has crippled the functionality in its programs in order to get one to purchase a higher version of its software. In effect, they have underhandedly forced a price increase. Stay away and choose the several worthy alternatives like H & R Block!	-1
After using HR Block Business for my Form 1065 Partnership return and multiple Form 1041 Trust returns since 2006, I tried TT Business this year because I read that it now supports eFILE for Trust returns.  But after doing the first Trust return, it became apparent that there is no way to import Securities transactions into Schedule D / Form 8949 (which the IRS started to require for Trust returns two years ago).  For any Trust or business engaged in trading more than a few times a year, this is a non-starter for those who wish to eFILE.  For the Three Trust returns I have to do, I have over 500 securities transactions in 2014.  I doubt I could type all of those in by September 2015, even if I wanted to.  The TT User interface is very pretty, and it does permit one to switch between interview and forms view when necessary, but the process of dealing with a Schedule D is very clunky.  While HR Block doesn't support data import to Form 8949 yet either, at least they have a spreadsheet-like data entry screen where one can paste rows of information from an Excel file rather than type EVERY number into a screen form for hundreds of transactions.  Like another user, I've also discovered that there are a number of items on the Form 1041 that cannot be over-ridden, and allocations of Trust expenses between income and principle is impossible (well ... maybe not, but after several hours of trying to figure it out, I gave up).  TT Business also doesn't have any of the "Import last year data from a PDF of last year's tax return" capability that their less expensive personal products support.  So migrating from another product means that you must start from absolute scratch with filling out every form and tiny box on your business returns.  I give it two stars because the UI / Interview is easy to work with.  But the lack of ability to import Securities transactions into Schedule D / Form 8949 doesn't add enough value to me to justify the much higher price of this software over competing software from TaxAct or HR Block.	-1
You know what's great?  When you buy an $80 product and the CD doesn't work.  Then you waste several hours waiting to get the problem resolved by Turbotax.  Waste of time.  Terrible Product.	-1

The mistake I made was relying on my 20 years of using Turbo Tax as being a reasonably priced tax program.  I now notice that they do mention that the programs have changed, indeed they have.  This is my last year of using TurboTax, appears that other services are more reasonable in price and services.	-1
Buying this product leaves you feeling cheated because one is compelled to upgrade to this product because Turbox crippled the functionality of its Deluxe product	-1
Intuit would like to force me to pay extra in order to buy the Small Business edition of TurboTax.  I have a small business and can recite schedule C with my eyes closed. Since I never needed "extra help", TurboTax Deluxe worked perfectly for me, until this year. Intuit has crippled Deluxe and Premier for small business owners and is extorting extra money from its users for simple functionality. Oh, they said, I can print out the forms, fill them out by hand and then mail my return in. Why would I buy tax return software that did not efile?  Did the Ferengi aliens take over Intuit? This is the most ludicrous statement I have ever heard!  Done with TurboTax!  After using TurboTax ever since it came out (over 20 years ago), I have switched to H&R Block Deluxe which imports perfectly from last years TurboTax return, W2s, broker transactions and yes, ability to do schedule C and 5 free Federal efiles... everything that TurboTax Deluxe used to do!  Just because I hate corporate greed, I am now looking for a replacement for Quicken. I have two years before I have to pay the extortion fee (forced upgrade) for Quicken.	-1
Turbotax crippled its 2014 tax software by removing schedules in order to force customers to upgrade to a higher priced version. Buy it at your own risk or else you will discover the "extortion screen" asking you to pay $30 to upgrade to a higher version!	-1
I have used Turbo Tax for years and imagine my surprise that starting in 2014 they removed Schedules C, D, E & F and the supporting worksheets!  Raising the price of the product is one thing, but removing forms and not telling the customer until you buy the product and find out that not only can you not import last year's data, you can't even manually fill out this year's taxes!  Dirty, dirty trick!  I often wonder how companies that are at the top of the heap can fade out of existence so quickly.  Poor management decisions.  This is how it starts.	-1
I couldn't load the program on my MAC.  It's very hard to use if you can't load it.	-1
Better than last year but I did not like the the up-sell to use the investments at full cost as I would have saved 30 percent buying the version on Amazon!  I will use it again but watch out for the small print and buy the more advanced product avoiding the up-sell	-1
There was a time when Turbo Tax included everything you needed.  Now they break it up to charge you as many fees as they can while also trying to sideline you into deals with third parties to make extra money off the side.  I like to just pay for a product and be done, not be nickel and dimed afterwards.	-1
I just did my taxes for 2014 yesterday but I purchased the software 6 weeks ago at a local store on sale.  I have used Turbo Tax for over 20 years but now I am done with them.  Unlike many reviewers that post in December or January I don't review software that I haven't used.  I used this software and in the end I wish that I had purchased something else.  My review is based on actual experience and not just a review to garner votes by posting early.  I had numerous problems and it took me twice as long to do my taxes as it should have.  It kept asking the same questions over and over and I filled out the boxes and when that section was completed none of the dollar figures or answered questions showed up as correct.  The most glaring was when it asked me if I had prepaid estimated taxes and I answered yes.  It then asked me what amounts and I filled in the quarterly payments.  When done it did not include those payments in the refund calculation and I had to manually override the data and fix it.  This one mistake alone would have cost me $1200. If I had not been watching the refund amount at the top of the screen I might have missed this error.  I used the walk me through format as I normally do and this year it was just garbage.  It would ask me if a set of circumstances would apply to my return and I would answer no and then it would proceed to ask me 20 to 30 questions to which I have already answered that they did not apply.  When I answered yes to a section and answered every question and filled in numbers, when appropriate, it would not use the data or the numbers and I had to go back and fill out the data and numbers again.  Very time consuming and frustrating.  Ultimately I had no trust in the way this software worked and I rechecked every number and calculation before I filed.  Like I said before, one error alone would have cost me $1200.  When I was completed it did a scan and it found a mistake, or so it claimed.  It told me a number for my 2013 taxes was not entered correctly and I checked it and it was correct.  I even looked at the actual printout of my 2013 taxes to verify the number.  To make matters worse it truncated the code for the local tax authorities for the county that I live in making it almost impossible to determine what it was even questioning.  It stated the taxes paid to INC were wrong when the code is IN C-41.  I had to manually go back to the forms and fix the error that really was not a problem and it had no bearing on my 2014 return.  A simple waste of time for what it called a data collection form.  Doing taxes is not really fun and wasting twice as much time as required makes it really a hassle.  Turbo tax has lost a customer that has been loyal for over 20 year back to the days of Turbo Tax coming to you on floppy disks.  On top of that, go look at the recent 5 star reviews.  Many of them are first time reviewers posting 2 words to one sentence reviews.  They use no punctuation and no capital letters.  They are fake reviews.  How can you trust a company that does that because they are in trouble?	-1

Extremely disappointed. After submitting my tax return it did not save the file. Called customer service and they were  no help. Had to redo the entire return. TurboTax has gone to the dogs! Will never use again!	-1
Used turbotax for years.whatever happened to them,I don't know. In state taxes,never asked me if I had a pay voucher for 2014. I had to manually put in the $500 pay voucher. After I  put it in,they offered no review. Wanted me to pay nearly double in next step without a review. I went to H&R Block deluxe. This year they started importing financial info from your large banks such as Vanguard,T.D.Waterhouse,Fidelity.etc. I had no problem with H&R.there  prices float though,I payed $25 for fed e-file and state download yesterday,today it is $30. Two weeks ago it was $35.	-1
I have been a TurboTax user since the mid 1990's I believe.  This will be my first year to use something else.  I refuse to be forced to buy the "Premier" version just so I can have a Schedule C.  I have always had this in TurboTax Deluxe.  Intuit is now constantly advertising and trying to upsell their customers.  I recently cancelled an online QuickBooks account for the same reason.  And Quicken is getting worse each year too and pops up ads to me.  That makes me furious when I am working and an ad pops up...this is not FREEWARE software!  Hey Intuit...you are driving customers away.  I have been using Intuit products since 1993 and you are driving me away.	-1
TurboTax kind of let us down this year. We've been Turbo Tax users since 1999 and have always been satisfied in the past, but this year we couldn't "e-file" . So we paid for a "free" service that we couldn't use. Called tech people for a week and did exactly what we were told to do over and over.......at least 6 or 8 times and nothing worked. Finally decided to just mail it in. BTW, the IRS folks couldn't help either. The "signature pin" was never accepted.  .	-1
The $25 back for those of us who already used the software and were forced to pay midstream to upgrade is only for users who got the software as a download. If you purchased a CD you are out of luck.  Also, I am in the midst of my filled state form printing out as "Do not file". Turbotax is supposed to clear up this mess by Feb 20, 2015. We will see. Meanwhile, I can not file my state return.	-1
Ive been using TurboTax for many years to file my returns, and had always been satisfied with them prior to this. Ive used both the online and installed software versions of their product in the past. My tax situation has been complex enough that Ive had to purchase much more expensive editions of the product to handle all the forms, and Ive generally paid extra for the audit defense guarantee.  This year I had two issues that really soured me on their product.  First, in some situations Intuit won't let you retrieve and print prior years returns unless youve paid for the current years product. I cant remember whether I filed the prior year in their online version or the downloaded software, but I am buying a house and needed to retreive the prior return for the bank. The lesson here is don't just save your tax return in Intuits file format. Export it as a PDF, save AND print it for your records.  The second problem had to do with one form I needed not being ready. I started my taxes in early January and filled in details as the forms arrived. The warning that I couldn't file because a particular form wasn't ready yet kept coming up, and finally I started looking for help in the forums. I found an article posted by them which said the form in question was available for everything but E-File on Mac, and that it would be available for that final format on January 30th. Two weeks past that date not only is the form not available for E-File, but printing a copy of it produces a big watermark DO NOT FILE - FORM NOT FINAL even though its supposed to be available. I tried checking for updates and reinstalling as suggested but no luck. I was finally able to find a telephone number for customer service and speak to someone there after a 20-minute hold, only to be told they had no information other than what I knew from searching the forums, and no process for escalating my call to anyone who could help or even give me an updated ETA. I was promised a full refund for the software but have had to start all over on preparing my taxes and several weeks have gone by in which I could have already filed my return.  Intuit makes it hard to speak to anyone in the first place, and harder still to find anyone who can help you with your problems. Between that and the limited access to your own information that magically becomes no problem if you simply give them more money, Im very dissatisfied.	-1
I purchased this through newegg and it is a complete joke on explaniing lump sum distribution for social security lump sum distributions from previous year and 3rd party insurance disabilty. ,.It was very frustrating and feel like we wasted 75.00 as we will just take it all to a tax service now.	-1
With the crippling and removing of important forms for e-filing in TurboTax Deluxe, like Schedules C, D, and E, I am rating this one star. I use to use this product but I can't anymore.  Avoid TurboTax if you can and go with a better product that doesn't try to gouge you with surprise upgrade fees when you are doing your taxes. If you are able to easily move from TurboTax, than take advantage of that and switch now before you get locked in and it becomes more complicated to switch.  And don't forget that Intuit has lobbied Congress in the past to kill any chance of simplified IRS tax filing. You can probably guess why they would not want people to quickly and easily be able to file their taxes without their software. Search Google for "Intuit lobbying congress against simple filing" and "Corruption Is Why You Can't Do Your Taxes in Five Minutes" for more info.	-1
As if it wasn't bad enough that intuit makes people buy the SAME exact software each year, now intuit has crippled the functionality of the basic version to force people to pay more money for the premium version by eliminating common schedules used by virtually every small business owner.  Two thirds of reviewers rated this release one star for a reason Bob.  Listen to your customers for a change.	-1
Thanks to all for the heads up about Intuit's bait and switch with the versions of TurboTax.	-1
Like so many others here, I was about to purchase TurboTax Deluxe again this year as I have for many years, when I made the same unpleasant and terribly disappointing discovery that many others have reported here.  To the VP from TurboTax who said: "One of the challenges of selling on Amazon (and other sites) is that we don't know who purchases our product so we can't differentiate between new and returning customers like you. We know that some of our customers won't be able to use the same TurboTax product as last year. So purchase the product you normally get and then call one of my team members ... so they can get you the upgrade necessary to meet your needs. By the way, if we did this for revenue purposes we would have targeted a segment of our customer base much larger than the 2-4% who are affected by this change."  I say: "One of the challenges of buying things from your company is that we don't know how and when you will make arbitrary and inexplicable changes to your product for returning customers like us.  We now know that you don't care that some of your customers won't be able to use the same TurboTax product as last year.  We *did* want to purchase the product we normally got - and then actually GET the product that we have normally gotten - without now having to call and beg for it. By the way, why did you target *any* segment of your customer base for this treatment?  If not for revenue, then was it just to confuse them, or to annoy them, or to intentionally drive them away?"  It seems that Mr. Scrooge is now in charge at TurboTax.  Bah, Humbug!  We consumers can only vote with our dollars.  I have just used mine to vote for&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Block-Financial-H-R-Block-Tax-Software-14-Deluxe-State/dp/B00P6U8BA0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Block Financial H&R Block Tax Software 14 Deluxe + State</a>.	-1
TurboTax  - I'm changing to H&R Block.  The last time I changed was when you tried to impose a $9 fee for printing extra returns.  Now you are at it again by eliminating a key component to the program.  After many years as a customer, albeit one year I left because of the printing issue, I am now changing over to H&R.  I will request a refund for the product - Good bye!	-1
Crippled Software!!!!!! Shame on you TurboTax!!!  This year's Deluxe and Premier versions are crippled. We would have to buy the Home and Small Business Edition for $50 more. They are useless for those of us who have a small business and stock investments.  After almost 20 years of using TurboTax, I just bought H and R Block Deluxe for $29.99 via download from Amazon. It is not crippled and has everything last year's TT Deluxe had and installed/imported perfectly. All my gains/losses are there as well as all the depreciation information from my business. It has five Federal eFiles and includes one state return.  Intuit;  Just what the heck is wrong with you people?	-1
I've purchased TurboTax I believe every year since the company was founded.  This year I'll go with another product because of the reduced feature set in TurboTax Deluxe.  It isn't the money, it's the way customers are being treated that will cause me to make this change.  The tax software business is mature.  I guess to grow the bottom line at Intuit and thus have the executives make their bonuses, some features have been removed from the Deluxe version and are only available in Premium version.  It is a hidden price increase, although I guess not very well hidden based on the response here on Amazon.  TurboTax has been an acceptable, but not great product.  It's best if you know how to do your taxes and use the program for convenience and to avoid careless mistakes.  That's why I purchased it over the years.  The fact that current versions won't open old returns (MS Word, Excel and numerous other programs open old documents), the initial screen that almost demands personal data for marketing purposes, and the requirement to constantly load updates (likely bug fixes) when the program is run, among other items, eliminate the product from A-team status.	-1
..if you are unhappy with this change Tweet about it as well.  Sometimes social media can change corporate decisions in a way that Amazon reviews may not.	-1
I have been a loyal TurboTax customer since sometime in the 90's (I threw away the floppy disks a long time ago, and I don't  recall the earliest date, but it's been a long time.)  I am angry about the deliberate disabling of critical features in TurboTax Deluxe.  No Schedules C, D, or E.  In the past, the product was functional, even though the "Premier" version provided more help and guidance.  That was extra functionality and if you needed it you could buy it.  But in Deluxe you got the forms, the basic help info, the IRS docs, the final review checking, printing, and e-filing.  So if you knew what a schedule C or D was (it's not that hard) you could file your taxes.  Now in the name of "consistency" this has been taken away, and if I want to file my taxes using TurboTax I need to buy something almost twice as expensive.  I have read the words about how Intuit labored over the vital need to be "consistent" and yes indeed after their stressful labors they did indeed cripple the product and they will try to force people to buy the much more expensive version.  Please be honest -- just step up and say you decided to charge a lot more money.  Instead the official Intuit response sounds like we're supposed to feel sorry for how difficult it was for them to decide to raise the price.  Raising the price is something I would object to but it's just a price increase.  It's the disingenuous explanation that shows such contempt for the intelligence of customers which prompts me to give a one star rating, only because it's not possible to give zero stars.  Intuit used to be known for making products that pleased customers and surprised them -- in a positive way.  It's sad to see the company's current attitude.  **UPDATE -- IT'S EVEN WORSE** OK, I'm angry but I need to do a draft of my taxes for planning purposes prior to year end.  So I bit my lip and looked at ordering the Premier version.  Even in the high-priced Premier version, Schedule C is crippled -- limited to $100 of deductions in a couple of expense categories.  I.e. only good for a tiny hobby business, and maybe not even that.  So now having forced me to Premier, even that high priced product is useless to me.  Intuit, what is wrong with you people?  Everyone who reads this:  Maybe you will have to buy the product in order to avoid the trouble of converting to another product.  But even if you decide to buy it, please take the time to register a negative review here or at other product review sties.  You don't have to write as long a review as I did -- just a couple of sentences and click on 1-star.  Even if you have a rational reason for giving in to Intuit's extortion, maybe the negative reviews will cause other customers to choose other products.  Maybe someday Intuit will be forced to care about customers.	-1
Bait & Switch:  Name stays same, but features and options disappear to a higher version.  Deceptive.  Wrong.  Lies.  DO NOT BUY	-1
Turbotax Deluxe no longer includes Schedule E (rental property) or Schedule D (capital gains), unless you want to manually fill in the forms with no transfer of data to the rest of your return.  You get a message saying that if you need these forms, you have to "upgrade" to Turbotax Premier for an additional $30.  Bait and switch.  Time to try competing tax software, return this one to Amazon.	-1

I was happy to receive the 'Rosetta Stone Kids Reading' program targeted for ages 3-7, for the purpose of review, as I've two grandchildren within the age group. We've used it off and on for close to three weeks, with my just six year old granddaughter and her just three year old brother, in order to give the program an honest and accurate evaluation.  We encountered no difficulty regarding the internet aspect of the program; using a laptop connecting and downloading - all went well. Rosetta Stone touts itself as being an "award-winning program" and I have had some experience, in the past, with their products. However, our experience with the teaching aspect of this program has been less than stellar.  My six year old granddaughter adapted to the program very easily as, like many children her age, she's very familiar with laptops, leapfrog, phones and such. But it became evident almost from the start that her reading level was somewhat above what this program is capable of and she quickly became bored with it, especially the repetitious method used in teaching. Her three year old brother, however, who happens to be a very active type, just doesn't have the patience to sit with the program for any appreciable length of time and didn't find it fun, at all. And the children's mother voiced disbelief regarding the high price of this program. Reading other reviews of this Rosetta Stone product leads me to believe it may be suitable for other children but it just didn't work for ours.	-1
I've been using Acronis for years.  Upgraded from 2014 to 2015.  Backups were fine.  However, the 2015 recovery disk I created with the program would not boot.  Same for the backup.	-1
This  review also appears under the 3-license package listing.  I upgraded from the 2014 version to the 2015 release, trusting comments by Acronis representatives on this site that a longstanding problem, known as the "Operations in Progress bug," had finally been resolved. As a retired IT manager, I realize that fixes require time, and I am more patient than most.  The "Operations in Progress" behavior prevents Windows users from properly shutting down their machines. While the Acronis site states that this is short-term, necessary behavior for its application to complete processing, in fact, it will lock the shutdown process indefinitely. For a full description of the problem, and the simple kinds of coding changes Acronis could have made to fix it, go to my review of the 2014 product at http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1TT0JA4FRFOLM/ref=cm_cr_pr_viewpnt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EFRMBA6#R1TT0JA4FRFOLM.  The software behaved differently for a few months following the 2015 release's installation in November 2014, in that the "Operations in Progress" message usually timed out. But then, it abruptly changed back to the behavior so disliked in the 2014 release, always stopping the shutdown indefinitely. This tells me that not only has the problem not been fixed, but it certainly appears that Acronis altered the software without public notice a few months into this release. Any company that treats its customers with due respect will (a) listen to widespread concerns, and fix them; and (b) not apply updates without the customer's knowledge. However, Acronis projects an impression of corporate stubbornness and arrogance.  For a company that announced a billion-dollar (with a "b") revenue goal in March 2014, there is no excuse. Staffing should not be an issue. And the fixes should take only a few man-hours of coding time (if that), provided the software was written intelligently in the first place. I suspect the staff who reported to me could complete them in less than an hour.  The "Operations in Progress" problem continues to mess up Windows updates, many of which depend upon an orderly shutdown process that is not blocked by a third-party application like Acronis.  I am researching reviews for other backup options. I am impatient to move away from Acronis's products and its disrespect of customers.	-1
I have been a long time user of this product. In fact, I have over 17 registered products with them. This version is incomplete and the basic function of syncing directories between computers does not work UNLESS you buy cloud space from Acronis. There are many, many folks out there that have reported this and other issues with this recent version.  I did ask for a refund, one of the RARE times I was so frustrated with a product that I went through the effort of asking. Predictably, I was told because I was outside of the 30 day window they could not accommodate me. Now, I have a proven track record over the years with their products, there is a wealth of other users that have the same issues I complained about and yet, they would refuse me the cost of their defective product in the hopes that I might stay for the next version or even an update of this version.  So, save your money, look for any of the other alternatives and stay away from the 2015 version of this app.  I have already found a replacement product that provides the sync function the 2015 version removed for less than the updates.  For those that want a working and cheaper alternative to 2015 try http://www.easeus.com/file-sync/.  They make a GREAT backup/Image software too.  I used both and won't be missing Acronis products anytime soon.	-1
The application is nice and pretty, and seems to create backups with no issues - the backups even validate OK.  But consistently, the system backups fail to restore.  I have had some success (~50%) getting files  to restore, but full system backups fail to restore 100% of the time, failing about half way through.  I have tried this on multiple computers, with both Windows 7 and Windows 8.1, and the results are the same - what use is a backup program that can never restore?	-1
Stinks!  All they want is cloud subscription.  Don't buy this if you hate more monthly or yearly  payments. User interface is really bad.  I was going to detail what is bad, but the list got so long I decided to just say forget it!  Note: After  months of using this software and two major upgrades it is still bad!  The last update  on 4/29/2016 (Win 7 Pro) caused errors on my computer -"Acronis Stopped Running.....".  I tried to uninstall and reinstall, rolled back registry all to no avail.  I finally had to restore using an earlier backup.  So backup software that is supposed to protect my computer caused me to have to do a restore.  What is going on at Acronis?	-1

I honestly wish I could tell you how this program works.  But that would be impossible because I couldn't get it to load on my computer.  My PC is pretty new.  I purchased it last year.  So I figured there would be no problem installing this.  Boy was I wrong. First and foremost what is the deal with no hard copy physical instructions in the box?  Its just a disk.  Moving past this though we get to the real problem.  To once again copy all the other reviews on here, when it pops a box and tells me it has to remove programs, and I have no idea what it is referring to, thats where I draw the line. Who cares if it works or not?  Why in the world would I take the risk on this thing?  I would recommend staying very far away.  Save your money.	-1
I have to admit that installation made me a little nervous. As soon as I put in the disk, it told me that in order to proceed it needed to uninstall some programs, but it doesn't list what programs it wants to un-install. I have a wide variety of video/photo editing software installed on my computer, and I didn't want to risk it uninstalling a program that I really like and use on a regular basis.  The most appealing feature one this software was the live screen capture. I've thought about doing some web-tutorials, and this would be super-helpful. I genuinely wish that it would let me know what it's uninstalling before it removes programs from my computer. . . .	-1
I wasn't surprised that I'm the only one having problems installing this. The manual is on the disk, so no help THERE. Try to install it and wait. And wait. And wait. And then when it's done, nothing. Doesn't boot. And no help, cause the help you need is on the program that won't run!  I had to uninstall another program to put this monster on. Total frustration!  N.B. Another user who went through the Facebook route (and got nowhere from the company) said another user told him to click "no" to updates, and that made it work. If I have the patience, I may try that. Otherwise, this is going to be lining my trashcan.	-1
Out of the box - one disc - the manual is on the disc  I think it necessary to mention, that I currently had nero on my pc and figured I should remove it before installing roxio.  Generally the two most common burning software's are Nero and Roxio.  However, it is not advisable to have both installed at one time as they will interfere with each other.  It's almost as bad as trying to have two antivirus programs installed and running in auto protect mode at the same time - it simply WILL NOT work out!  Upon beginning the installation, it prompts to go online and check for updates.  It then found software on my system that it said needed to be uninstalled before it could install, but it didn't tell me what they were?  In order to continue, you have to agree to allow it to uninstall them first.  Therefore, I chose yes in order to proceed.  Then it does offer a custom or complete install.  The custom install allows you to pick and choose the programs you want to include and then lets you choose where to install them.  After I made my installation choices, it began installing everything I selected, but never indicated that it actually did uninstall any other software?  It may have found something left over from the Nero installation?  Ok, after some time, the installation finally said it was interrupted and therefore the installation was not successful..  Sigh - It appears that fastflick was the only thing that actually installed.  I tried two more times - still epic fail on the installation - color me done!  I obviously can NOT recommend due to not being able to install it myself. I think if the installation is this difficult without a clue as to why it is being interrupted, they clearly have some programming bugs to work out.	-1
The product is good, but the customer service from Corel is terrible. Strongly recommend looking for a different product for your needs. Amazon sells many different products to take care of needs. Shop around, don't spend your hard earned money on this product. You will need customer service and Corel currently policy is focused on sales, not retaining customers.	-1
Painter Essentials 5 simply refuses to launch, even after numerous reboots and reinstalls of the program. It sits in the running processes and eats up a hefty chunk of your processor (40% on average) but never actually DOES anything. Not even a splash screen appears. This is, hands-down, the worst piece of software I've ever encountered - at least everything else RUNS. For those who are curious about my hardware, I'm doing this on a Surface Pro 1 that has proven to be an incredible device for artistic endeavors. Painter failing to run is pretty disappointing.  That said, if you're daring enough to invest in this, know that inside the box is not only the DVD for the program, but the serial number along with a link to Corel's website where you can download the software. This is important to know for those of us out there with newer Macbooks or, like me, a Surface Pro, or other newer computers that lack a DVD drive. Another important thing to know is that the serial number is good for, as the site says in bold letters, "one copy only." I don't know if this means that you get one INSTALL, period, or an install on one COMPUTER as many times as you need. Since the software doesn't actually run, there's simply no way to test this.	-1
TRASH!!!!!	-1
My background is in the semiconductor industry and although I am not an Applications Engineer, what I would say is that if you have the time to figure out this software you have more time than I do. I decided to try it, because I thought that most people are mindless and didn't have a clue. Well, pick me. I'm all in for not having the time or a clue as to wanting to figure out this Cluster F$%k of free software. At the end of the day, nothing is free and neither is my time to figure this out.

It is buggy. It crashes on Windows 7 SP1, it crashes on Windows 8.1.  I have 96 GB of ram, SSD drives, SATA III drives on the Windows 7 box, I have tried it on both drive types and it crashes incessantly.  The Windows 8.1 box is a standard 12GB 1TB machine and no luck there either. Having a 64 bit program is sweet, having one that doesn't work isn't. I can't do a proper review because I can't get it to stay running long enough to do anything on either machine.  I have Premier Elements running on both machines as well as Premier Pro with no problems. I give it two stars for the free tracks, myriad presets, and free training...if they get it patched and working it could be a much better rated program.  However, for now I don't have the time to bother with it or Corel's lackluster support (long time Painter user and former Word Perfect user...so I know their support).	-1
July 2016 I am so frustrated with this software. All I wanted to do was pull in three or four stills along with three short videos. Total run time about 2 minutes. Adding captions was limited as far as I can tell; I was not able to do what I wanted to do. Then when I tried to export a .mp4 file Pinnacle Studio 18 failed to export the video portions. I've now spent about three hours on this little project and have not been able to spit out my little project.  There's no way I'd buy this software and don't recommend it.  February 9, 2016 I take it all back. Dropping back to 3 stars.  While Pinnacle Studio 18 has basic video editing capabilities the user interface sure needs some improvement. On top of that the Help PDF file could be better as well. I had to refer to customer youtube videos to get a few basic things done recently.  The user interface for importing video files is cumbersome. Managing those video files within the tool is much too complex for a basic tool like this.  At one point I wanted to separate a sound track from a video file. At first I couldn't figure out how to do that so I went to the help file but found nothing. Then I went to the user forum where there was even confusion whether Studio 18 could even do that basic task. In the end I found it to be quite easy to do, albeit a little hidden. This is an example about how the user interface and help file could be greatly improved.  I was easily able to add a title to a video. When it came to adding a caption to overlay part of a video I searched and searched. Finally a user youtube video helped. The solution was to click on a video segment and use the Title key again. How is a user supposed to figure that out? Title is title and Caption is caption. How easy it would have been to simply add a Caption button and make the editing behavior be easier to use.  So, as I have no better tool, I'll continue to use Studio 18, but there's no way I'd buy an upgrade version of this product.  January 28, 2014 Well I'm bumping my review up from 3 stars to 4. My son and I both purchased GoPro cameras and I've just finished editing two hours of captured motorcycle dirt ride video down to 13 minutes. I included fade-in and fade-out sound, titles, and captions that overlay the video. I'm beginning to understand the capabilities of the tool.  I do find the user manual a bit lacking, but goggling user help turns up text or youtube help that solves the issue.  There are definite speed improvements using Studio 18 over Microsoft Movie Maker.  Dec 17, 2014 I am dropping from 4 stars to 3 stars based on the fact that I can not get Pinnacle Studio 18 to export a decent video with the particular input file I'm using. This is the main thing a video editor needs to do so if it fails that it is pretty much useless. I give it two stars based on the features it has, and the fact that my problem seems to be just that - my problem.  I could find little evidence that Exported video quality is a widespread issue with Studio 18. There were very few complaints about video quality. My problem has to do with the input file I was working with. It is a file downloaded from the internet. Nonetheless that is the file I wanted to edit and it didn't come out well. At the same time Microsoft Movie Maker did a fine job on it.  It works well with better input files. I tried one from my DSLR camera and the final file from Pinnacle Studio 18 and Microsoft Movie Maker came out nearly as good as the input file.  I did try to contact Pinnacle but they want to be paid for support which I consider poor customer support. I did interact with the user forum where I picked up some hints on how to improve output quality but nothing worked.  I can use the program but it looks like it is going to be hit or miss depending on the quality of the input file. To save myself the trouble I'll just continue using Movie Maker most of the time unless I feel I want to use a more advanced editor at which time I'll try Studio 18.  At this point I wouldn't spend money on this product and wouldn't recommend it.  Dec 16, 2014 Trouble. I don't know if I'm doing something wrong but the video quality rendered in MP4/1080 is poor. I've tried to search the internet for help but didn't find any. If I create a video for Facebook no problem. But I have some videos that I wanted to trim some bad parts then render for watching on our large flat screen display. But even on my 24" 1920 x 1080 computer monitor the output of Pinnacle Studio 18 is a disappointment.  I took a single file, cut out all but the first 5 minutes, then Exported an MP4/1080 video from Pinnacle Studio 18. The results were much less than satisfactory.  I then took the same file, again cut out all but the first 5 minutes, then Saved the move for High Definition Display using Microsoft Movie Maker. The results were quite good.  I will attempt to contact Pinnacle to see if there is anything I can do. I have a hard time believing the rendered output file can't be improved. A video editor tool that outputs bad quality video files is useless. But I've tried a number of attempts to obtain better image quality without success. Even if Pinnacle provides a solution it shouldn't be this hard.  Dec 10, 2014 Update Today I captured a video of my 4-year-old receiving his yellow belt in Kempo Karate. Using Pinnacle Studio 18 I cliped out a part that was too long, then added a transition to make that cut out section flow nicely in the video. Then I added a title and a closing graphic transition.  Pros: - Easy to install - Easy to use the basic video editing features (without reading the manual if you can poke around a bit) - The user manual is pretty good. - The on-line video tutorials are quite informative. - Pinnacle Studio 18 comes with a large number (1,500) of transitions. - Comes with over 500 sounds (animals, bells, cartoons, etc.) - Comes with 45 music clips - Comes with over 550 Title video segments - You can import photos and do some basic editing of them. - It is easy to see that this program offers many features including multiple video tracks and audio tracks.  Cons: - I had a difficult time altering the default execution time for a transition. Perhaps I need to read up on this. - I was hoping I could "crop" or "zoom" a video. That doesn't seem to be available. On the other hand I don't know if any video editors allow that feature. Perhaps it is too much to expect.  Dec 9, 2014 Update While watching some vacation video I found one that I had captured hand held with a long zoom lens and the video was shaky. I wondered if Pinnacle Studio 18 could stabilize it and sure enough that feature exists. I loaded the video file, ran the Stabilize Render and Play process and Poof the video was now much more watchable. Nice feature. Once again it consumed about 80% of my 64-bit quad-core 2.4GHz processor.  Dec 7, 2014 First Impressions. I've only had Pinnacle Studio 18 for a couple of days and just started using it today. I am a relative novice with video tools but I have quite a lot of computer experience.  I received Pinnacle Studio 18 free as a member of the Amazon Vine program.  I have used powerful video editing tools in the past, but my recent reference is Windows Movie Maker in Windows 7. For my needs Windows Movie Maker has been sufficient, although there were things I wished I could do to my videos which Windows Movie Maker did not support, such as zooming.  After I loaded Pinnacle Studio 18 it immediately offered to load a patch update which I accepted. The update worked flawlessly.  I have a great deal of computer experience, including being a graphical user interface programmer for 10 years. I believe I should be able to start a new software tool and use the basic features without first reading a user manual, or else the program does not have a good user interface. On the other hand every piece of software is unique so there is a start-up learning curve. Accessing the more advanced features usually requires reading the manual or watching tutorials.  I jumped right into a project involving four video files spanning about 15 minutes. I wanted to view the video content, and clip out any sections I didn't want to be part of the final video. Within 15 minutes I was able to discern the basics; loading my video files into the tool, putting the four videos in the order I wanted, assigning the videos to the timeline, and I learned how to cut out unwanted clips. It took me about an hour to work over my video, and begin the process of saving the final MPEG-4 500 megabyte file. So the tool passed my basic requirements.  After going through this early basic learning curve I find Pinnacle Studio 18 is easier to use than Windows Movie Maker. I am very likely to use Pinnacle Studio 18 for my video projects going forward.  Pinnacle offers on-line video tutorials as well as a text based user manual. I watched a bit of one of the youtube.com videos which I thought was quite good. I will likely take advantage of those tutorials for some of the advanced features.  This tool works my computer quite hard. I have a quad 2.4GHz processor with 8GB of RAM so it is reasonably powerful. I also tend to have several things running on my computer. I did encounter slow operation of all of my computer tasks while Pinnacle Studio 18 was rendering and saving my video file. As soon as the file was saved, which was much faster than Windows Movie Maker would have taken, my computer was freed up and working normally.  The resulting video file was smooth and the transitions were clean.  I'm not done and intend to re-edit my video, adding fancy transitions. I may try some voice-overs too. I will return here to add more comments. I realize this review is currently lacking in useful detail.	-1
It would lockup and could not get anything done. Try Power Director 13 instead. Power Director also has a 30 day trail that everything works.	-1
I removed it.	-1
Don't Do IT!	-1
not worth the purchase. good thing i got it for free.	-1
Not bad but not much better	-1
I never used this feature for my PC for it seemed to evasive and not trustworthy. I have found that downloads such as this one have caused problems with my PC by embedding into other areas and can cause much greater problems that you might have at first.  If its free, Buyer Beware for nothing is absolutely is it.	-1
did not see any speed up in my pc.	-1
Down loaded this but couldn't find it on the PC. I would call it useless. I have used other Amazon APPs but this one is just not ready for prime time. I think Bezos took his eye off the ball.	-1
It's ok	-1
I paid $59.99/year for the unlimited online storage in April, 2015. I like the un-limited storage space, but Amazon Cloud Drive Desktop software is really too primitive.  My original intend is to use the amazon cloud drive as my on-line archive space to keep a copy of my videos, photos and other important encrypted documents. My COMCAST internet speed is 20 Mbps for down-stream and 6 Mbps for up-stream. With the 6 Mbps up-stream speed, it's understandable that it takes days (if not weeks) to up-load 600G data.  During the file uploading process, sometimes the up-load work got interrupted as amazon cloud drive asks me to sign-in again. This is bad as I can not keep the up-load work running for over-night. Even worse yet, when it stops, I don't know where the up-load task stops...I mean I have no way to figure out which files are updated already and which files are not.  The files/directories in the cloud drive can not be sorted based on file names, it's sorted based on the time it is uploaded. So, it's not easy for me to do a file-list cross reference check to identify which files are not up-loaded if a job is stop prematurely.  To prevent job interrupt if amazon cloud drive asks me to sign in again, I break my big up-load work into several small tasks and I make sure each up-load work won't last for 2-hour. I also have to make sure my computer does not go to sleep while the up-load work is on-going, otherwise, the up-load work will get killed...and I have to re-do that up-load batch again (not re-start from where it stops....because I don't know which files are not up-loaded.).  From time-to-time, the up-load work finishes with some error messages on a pop-up window. The error messages show the list of files that are not up-loaded successfully in this run. So, I can up-load them individually. I have to screenshot the file list from the pop-up window, because there is no "log", or "report" file for me to retrieve this file list. Even worse yet, the file list just show the file name without directory information. So, I have to use window search function to find each of the file listed in the file list.  It's sad that Amazon does not provide a user-friendly apps to help users to better maintain the up-load and down-load task. The provided up-load utility tool is very primitive. It becomes a high maintenance work to up-load big chunk of files. After 6-month, I only manage to up-load 450G of data.  For data down-loading, there are two methods. The 1st method is to download files directly from the web portal. But that has a 5GB per download limitation. The 2nd method is to download files through the window-application (I am using window-based computer). But the 2nd method has one issue: I have to download my whole entire cloud-drive data....I mean, the whole 450G !! There is no option for me to pick which file or which directory to download with the provided window tool.  After struggling with this cloud service for half-year, I finally decided to cancel my subscription. I won't recommend amazon cloud service till they can provide a more mature software tool to ease the pain for both up-loading and down-loading.	-1
Not adding much that hasn't been said above. Just a bit about my experience:  When I started with Amazon Cloud, they had an app that let you keep a folder on your computer up to date with your Amazon Cloud storage. Simple and easy. Works on a Mac, works on Windows, even works on things like tablets. That's just like Dropbox, Google and several others. I rumbled along not paying a lot of attention to changes. Now I go to install it on a machine I had to wipe. Surprise !!!. When I go to get the same old app to sync things up, it's no longer available. I can keep using it on the machines that it's still loaded on. The re-formatted machine is out of luck.  Is there a gotcha with the "sync" approach? Sure there is. If you have 200 Gb of pictures on your cloud, you *do not* want to sync them all with that old laptop with the 160 Gb disk. It's not going to work... All of the people writing the sync stuff allow you to select what you do and do not want to sync to this or that machine. It takes a bit of thought, but it's not that hard.  Any bets on how likely this makes me to sign up for the "Unlimited Everything" plan and use their silly new app to get things on and off their cloud storage? Unless they come up with a sync solution, I would avoid using their service. It's just not as useful as some of the others.  Why *would* I use their service? About the only use case I can see is for backups. Do a disk image each hour / day / week / month, zip it up and encrypt it. Feed it up to the unlimited plan with their app. If you have a disaster and need to recover, download it and start from there. May not save you from the ransomware guys. They might hit the backups as well as your main disk. It might work when the whole town and every computer in it goes under water.	-1
Very little space.....most are giving 25GB free...... Way to small.	-1
Awful product and even worse customer service from H&R Block. Missing forms, non intuitive, and a big old mess. Reluctantly, we went back to Turbo Tax.	-1
Beware, if you want direct deposit, these S.O.B's charge you another $39.00. I will never buy this item again!!! Do not be a fool like me.... AVOID THIS PRODUCT.	-1
Dear tax software companies,  Please, for the love of freshly shampooed dogs, baby pudding, and bountiful amounts of ketchup, please stop requiring the damn Internet to use your stupid software.  Thank you,  People whose parents are old and refuse to use the Internet.	-1
Well. I tried this software because of the competitor's pricing shenanigans.  The basic look and feel of the software is fine. It leads you through questions as you would hope it would do.  If you download information from financial firms, sometimes HR Block works, sometimes it does not and not every institution is accepted.  If you have basic taxes it works fine.  If you have more complicated scenarios, it doesn't work.  They tell you to basically fill out the form!  Isn't that why we use tax software, so we don't have to figure out the intricacies of the tax forms.  I was opening last year's tax program with the competitor and filling out old questionnaires.  Not a good method. So, I reverted back to the competitor after numerous other customers sent the same message and that company got the message and fixed their pricing.  That software worked everywhere that H&R Block did not, investment downloads, capital gains, education, K1's.  Hopefully, they won't go back to their old shenanigans because HR Block is not quite ready for the complicated returns.	-1
No Mac version.  I've used H&R Block for years and want to keep it going, but I need some of the functionality in Premium & Business.	-1
This does not work on a Mac, and for whatever reason H&R Block does not offer a Mac version of this.	-1
well, I bought the H&R Block and am extremely unhappy with it. I found a major glitch in the interview that would affect a lot of people that aren't knowledgeable about taxes. first I had major problems with the install, I assume a bad disk. it wouldn't boot directly from the disk and kept saying try again. I finally had to use MY COMPUTER and after a few try's got it to load. the desktop icon is just a green square which could be a glitch and between everything makes me not trust the validity of the disk. the interview is terrible compared to TT and a major flaw I found that in putting in a social security 1099 it doesn't ask you for the Medicare amounts paid and doesn't pinpoint it at any part of the interview even when you get to medical insurance for the schedule A. I found the interview overall extremely lacking. the forms view truly sucks and they incorporate worksheets into the form making too much clutter and confusion. going back to TT since intuit is making good on their screw up. Been a TT customer since the mid 90's. Block is OK, but so was TT ten years ago, Block is way behind in working out the kinks  REVISION  found two major glitches, already returned it and bought TT. DON'T TRUST IT  Medicare deduction for medical  has to be manually added TT asks for info off of SSA-1099  didn't carry over proper state income tax refund info, told me my refund was not taxable. took me two hours of comparing between the two programs to find the mistake	-1
I am one of the people caught in TurboTax's removal of forms from their Deluxe version, so I bought this version of H&R Block tax software. I filled out the interview portion of both TurboTax Deluxe (upgraded to Premium by Intuit) and H&R Block. The result was different numbers produced by the two tax software. I then needed to trouble-shoot the numerous numbers that were different. Trouble-shooting in TurboTax was easy because most cells have either a magnifying glass to show the source of the number in that cell, or I can right-click and see the source of the number. Unfortunately most of the cells in H&R Block do not have any was of determining the source.  Wow, I couldn't believe that. I called the H&R Block customer service phone number and waited 35 minutes on hold, without knowing how many people were ahead of me. The representative I talked with didn't know how to show the source of numbers in cells, so she requested a supervisor. About ten minutes later the supervisor came onto the phone and told me there isn't any way to determine the specific source of the number. Only the general area of the interview process is sometimes known, but not any specific numbers or cells from other forms.  This leaves me with not being able to determine the reason for the difference in numbers between the two tax software. After using TurboTax for years, and being able to go back to the source, I can't imagine using H&R Block tax software in the future and not being able to question or trouble-shoot the numbers I see. This is a HUGE problem. If a number doesn't look reasonable, I need to be able to determine why the number is the value that is shown, and I can't do that in H&R Block tax software ( a few cells, yes, but not for most cells).  Comparison of TurboTax and H&R Block Importing from TurboTax 2013:   TurboTax: Smoothly   H&R Block: Smoothly  Importing Brokerage accounts:   TurboTax: Accounts can be de-selected for importing, avoiding duplicating of some spouse accounts.   H&R Block: Accounts cannot be de-selected for importing.  Some spouse accounts duplicate the tax payer accounts, resulting in some accounts being shown twice.  Schedule A, medical insurance:   TurboTax: Medicare, Part B, is included automatically   H&R Block: Medicare, Part B, must be manually added  Schedule A, long term care insurance:   TurboTax: Part of the interview process, and a separate line in the worksheet.   H&R Block: No question or line. Must be manually added to the medical insurance.  Schedule A, line 5: local income taxes or sales tax:   TurboTax: TT automatically selected the higher amount.   H&R Block: The user needs to check one box, then the other, to determine the higher amount.  Customer service phone support:   H&R Block: 800-472-5625. No indication of how long the wait will be, to speak with someone.  Customer service web chat:   H&R Block: White screens in Chrome, Internet Explorer, and FireFox.	-1
This program is worthless.  If you have more than four daycare providers, which is difficult not to do when you have multiple kids and multiple summer camps, a limitation in the program will not allow you to E-File.  I used Turbo Tax for 15 years and used the Block program one year and became so frustrated that I didn't make that mistake again, until this year.  But I did, and you know what?  I am so frustrated AGAIN.  This program is worthless.	-1
It finds the TurboTax 2013 return, and asks if I want to import it. I click yes. It starts, immediately crashes, and exits saying sorry for the inconvenience.  I tried rebooting. Same problem. H&R block program immediately dies.  The HR& site says it can import  TurboTax 2013 returns. It cannot import mine.  I then got in contact with their support person via "chat". Took over an hour waiting for my turn.  He said there is a problem with H&R Block importing on XP, and there is no fix.  I asked for procedure to get a refund. He gave it to me. Apparently if you get the software on a CD and it's from Amazon, you can get a refund.  Each time I submitted the next line of the chat, took a long time for a reply. He must have been talking to multiple people at a time. He offered no suggestions or help.  He just sort of just sat there doing as little as possible. He had others to do the same with, I presume.  I asked if it would import my TurboTax if I installed in on another computer with a different operating system. He said probably.  I asked if I tried to install the same CD and license key on a different operating system, it there would be a problem, since it is already installed on my XP machine. He was unsure, but that he had heard it would work. I tried it, and it did install on a Windows 7 machine.  I asked if I could save the return, and copy that file to my XP machine and continue the return on my XP mahcine. He said yes.  So my take is if you need support from H$& block, they are not interested. If there is a problem, they just say yep it's a problem, and offer no suggestions.  You have to know more then them and know the right leading questions.  If you are clever enough, maybe you can find a work around. But they are not going to suggest it. They are on the line with another person(s) talking to them.  So my rating of 1 star still seems appropriate.  They well knew they could not import TurboTax into XP. But their Web site said nothing about that, other than a flat statement it will import it. Then you have to spend over an hour on hold to find they know it's a problem without a solution.  And then you are pretty much on your own and have to use your wits.  1/26/2015 I tried to import my Edward Jones 1099 information. H&R Block says it will.  It will not, and least today. I called Edward Jones and they said they were informed by H&R Block that they can't import from Edward Jones. They expect a program release/update on Feb 15, 2015 that should fix the problem. H&R Block (except for Microsoft Money and Quicken) currently only imports file types of .txf. Edward Jones only exports in CSV, Excel and .pdf. Not .txf.  On February 15th, Edward Jones will test the new versions of H&R Block and see if they will import their tax files, and if not, will work with them.	-1
While H and R Block did seem to attempt the remedy the awful Form 8949, Sales and Other Dispositions of Capital Assets, which is required for anyone who bought and sold stock and/or bonds, the remaining program and all the user interface are just awful with poor screen control and extremely difficult to manipulate as compared to Turbo Tax.  I tried to switch out of Turbo Tax because it becomes much more restrictive in doing your own Forms without the awful lengthy Interview.  Unfortunately HR Block is not the answer.  I gave it a 2 star because HR Block tech support does return your call.  Unfortunately, their Level 2 Tech is no more helpful than the Level 2 Tech from Turbo Tax because how this program was conceived and designed (basically a cheap imitation to Turbo Tax).	-1
Tried to install on my one year old Mac Air without success. Hung up on "update" both times. Mac if fully updated with flash drive so it's not like it's antique / out of date. Fortunately Amazon will refund the price, which is in my experience rare for software. I was hoping for something less expensive and more user friendly than turbotix. Oh well.	-1
Giving only two stars because it doesn't import TTax data from 2013 under XP OS.  HRB software crashes when the user attempts to do so.  Still prepared to enter the data by hand - about 5 hours additional - rather than return to Ttax.  A very nice lady at HRB said that an XP "patch" was underway, but its delivery date is uncertain.  Its commendable to call a Help-Desk and talk to someone who speaks English.  Moved to one star because the January 20th software upgrade didn't address the XP defect.  Amazon.com noted that if HRB inquiries aren't addressed in a few days, they probably won't be responded to at all.  So, it a choice ... get stiffed by TTax or HRB.	-1
well, I bought it for this year taxes. I have been using Turbo Tax in previous yrs. when I tried to import previous years tax info, it started asking me about which files and such. How do I know which files? So, I stopped using it.	-1
Did not impress me over other options	-1
Over three years ago, the IRS began requiring excruciating detail on securities transactions for Form 1041 Trust returns.  This requires using Form 8949 to support data entry to Schedule D.  And over three years later, HR Block Software doesn't support the ability to import securities transaction data (downloaded from your broker) to the Tax prep program so the multiple form 8949s and Schedule D can be created, and all totals rolled into your final return for eFiling.  If you have more than a handful of investment transactions, plan on spending a month of Sundays entering all the data by typing one field at a time.  Or, go to an external service who will prepare the forms from your downloaded data into PDF files, where you can then manually assemble it into your Tax Return.  So who needs to pay for HR Block for Business software if you have to do all that??  Hundreds of users on online forums have been complaining about this, but HR Block never addresses this critical lack of data import capability in the Business package.	-1
Swiched from turbotax this year. Made out Fed&State. Could not import turbo 2013 info,glitch in 1099r form imported from Fidelity Bank. After 1 hour run around when I called help line,lady said I could not import turbo info,so I did it manually. Also 1099r form done manually. I e-filed my fed return,after 1 week I was emailed that the fed return was not excepted without explaination. I called help line. After 2 hour run around I was hung up on. The software said I made several mistakes including my name,address,etc. though the original e-file clearly showed correct info on it. After manually doing the return, I e-fied again. This time it took it. I would not recommend either turbotax or H&R Block,in latter years they were good,what ever happened to them I do not know. Doesn't cost that much more to go to a private tax prep,that is where I'll go next year.	-1
So far, it has added $25,000 to our income that it won't let me delete. When I tried for chat, I waited 30 minutes and gave up. I am going to try some more and will amend if it starts working right. As of now, I want my money back at the very least!!	-1
Bought it after Turbotax deleted some schedules from Deluxe. Learned how to use H&R Block. Went to e-file and was told I had to update the program. Although I had all updates I updated twice again - once it took five hours. Still said I had to update. Called software support. They suggested I uninstall the program lose all my data, reinstall and reenter all data. That is when I went back and bought Turbotax Deluxe where they have given all necessary schedules for nothing admitting their mistake.	-1
I've used H&R Block for a dozen years now and in general I find it slightly better than "TurboTax" (the two are really very close to equal).  This year I had a question about the Minnesota Property Tax Return so I chatted with H&R Block support.  Their person basically said "I don't know anything about taxes and I don't know how our software works."  {laugh} That seems like pretty useless support.  It's a real toss up as to whether it is better to do your taxes by hand or to use a piece of software like this.  If you do your taxes by hand you will have a much better understanding of what you are filing (but it will still be confusing at points).  If you use the software it is "easier" as long as you just blindly click "next" and pray the software is doing it right (it missed one thing which I had to go back and manually figure out what was wrong and that made a $1000 difference on my return).  Note: this is all from the point of view of a person who is filing for income from both a normal job and a Schedule C for their own business.  To be fair, I think the tax software has an almost impossible job and 99% of the fault is with the government for making tax code so complex that only the wealthy (who can afford a tax attorney and accountant to optimize their taxes) can reasonably deal with filing taxes or the very low end of the income scale that has virtually nothing to report and can just do the "EZ" version.	-1
not worth the purchase. good thing i got it for free.	-1

I have used TurboTax for at least 25 years and it has served me well - until I filled out my 2014 taxes.  So what changed (other than the unconscionable increase in price)?  Well in 2014 TurboTax suddenly discovered that it had been incorrectly calculating depreciation on foreign rental properties.  Instead of using a 40 year life the software used a 27.5 year life, which only applies to properties located within the US.  This occurred year after year despite the fact that TurboTax explicitly asked if the property was located in a foreign country, to which I always checked the "Yes" box.  Because of this flaw all of my tax returns going back to 2005 had incorrectly claimed too much depreciation on my Canadian rental property, thereby requiring me to file a complicated Form 3115 to request a change in accounting convention.  Furthermore, I have to report extra income over the next four years so the IRS can recover the excess depreciation I took.  This, in turn, pushed me into a higher tax category and increased the amounts I will have to pay in Medicare premiums.  Judging from the outcry on the Turbotax user forum, many others were also affected by this incorrect depreciation calculation.  I suspect that thousands of taxpayers were impacted.  So why hasn't anyone filed a class action suit against TurboTax?  Well, if you read the software license, by using the software you give up your right to sue Intuit and must settle your grievance in binding arbitration.  Arbitrators almost always find in favor of the company so why even bother going there.  Furthermore, the fine print in the software license states that Turbotax does not guarantee that the software will produce the right answer so you use it at your own risk.  How convenient - for Intuit.  I have had it with this shoddy company.  I'm switching to the new guy on the block: TaxAct.  It is much cheaper and hopefully more accurate.  If it is not I will switch again - bit not to TurboTax.  Screw them!	-1
Ive been using TurboTax for many years to file my returns, and had always been satisfied with them prior to this. Ive used both the online and installed software versions of their product in the past. My tax situation has been complex enough that Ive had to purchase much more expensive editions of the product to handle all the forms, and Ive generally paid extra for the audit defense guarantee.  This year I had two issues that really soured me on their product.  First, in some situations Intuit won't let you retrieve and print prior years returns unless youve paid for the current years product. I cant remember whether I filed the prior year in their online version or the downloaded software, but I am buying a house and needed to retreive the prior return for the bank. The lesson here is don't just save your tax return in Intuits file format. Export it as a PDF, save AND print it for your records.  The second problem had to do with one form I needed not being ready. I started my taxes in early January and filled in details as the forms arrived. The warning that I couldn't file because a particular form wasn't ready yet kept coming up, and finally I started looking for help in the forums. I found an article posted by them which said the form in question was available for everything but E-File on Mac, and that it would be available for that final format on January 30th. Two weeks past that date not only is the form not available for E-File, but printing a copy of it produces a big watermark DO NOT FILE - FORM NOT FINAL even though its supposed to be available. I tried checking for updates and reinstalling as suggested but no luck. I was finally able to find a telephone number for customer service and speak to someone there after a 20-minute hold, only to be told they had no information other than what I knew from searching the forums, and no process for escalating my call to anyone who could help or even give me an updated ETA. I was promised a full refund for the software but have had to start all over on preparing my taxes and several weeks have gone by in which I could have already filed my return.  Intuit makes it hard to speak to anyone in the first place, and harder still to find anyone who can help you with your problems.

There is so much that can be said about security software. It can be either a hit or a miss in regards to the best of what is done to protect your computer from any damage. But trying to find the right one can work to your advantage, while looking for the wrong one, can actually lead to the end of your computer. This security software from Avast specifically for your Mac computers, doesn't actually deliver for the money. Instead it does slow the speed and the quality of your Apple computer. I found this software to be very easy to install. However, it was very easy for spyware to slowly go into my computer. It honestly might seem like a good buy, but overall it definitely might be more of a heartbreak. I really found better antivirus programs to be worth the money like Norton and Bitdefender. Overall, I would recommend a software that really delivers more for the money, than something free, and can ruin a computer.  Price: D  Setup & Quality: D+  Overall: D 1/2+	-1

would not work all I received was an Adobe Flash Player Installer. Not worth anything if it doesn't do what it said it is "Adobe Flash Player 16 for Windows". Very disappointing. If there was a zero star that is what I would have given.

When I get a message from Adobe saying that there is an update for "Reader", I always accept it.  The last time I did this, it was truly a mistake as the update was to their new "DC" version which I absolutely hate.  Aside from the totally new GUI, the biggest problem is that text doesn't show up correctly and I couldn't figure out how to correct.  So, after too much frustration, I uninstalled Adobe and installed another PDF reader.  The other reader worked ok, in that text displayed properly, but had other things about it I didn't like so I dumped that reader as well.  I looked on the internet for "perhaps" a copy of the old XI version.  There are a number of sites that claim to have XI, but I was leery of them.  As luck would have it, I found THIS offering on Amazon so there seemed to be hope.  Wrong!  I selected Run "download".  The process started but quickly but halted with a message from Adobe saying "file not found, start over".  When you click "start over", Adobe starts to download the newer, DC, version.  Next, I tried to download to my desktop and run from there.  Same problem.  So, I guess I'm going to have to find another reader unless Adobe fixes Reader.  At least Amazon provided the link for free.  Edited a day or so later by me.  So, I re-installed "DC" since I STILL need a PDF reader.  To my great surprise, when I opened it, the text display was FINE.  Then, I tried to print or something, and Adobe said "we see that this is your first time, you need to set up 'accessibility'." The choices offered several options including "use defaults".  I liked everything the way it was (in my previous Adobe life) so I chose that.  That is when the display went bad.  So, the Accessibility settings have something to do with bad text displays. I tried to correct but could not.  Then, I just uninstalled and re-installed.  Re-installed, display looks okay again.  I don't know what "triggers" this.  I did expect that "use defaults" means use what you have now, not what someone else would want you to use.  This reminds me of my wife beating me (mentally, not physically).  I don't think I deserve it, but, maybe, I'll just have to endure it if I want to stay married.  I need PDFs!  I bumped the rating from I to 2 since I think this could be fixed.	-1

Kindle is an average e-reader, especially if you are on Android.  There are many features in other readers.  UNFORTUNATELY, and this is the worst aspect of Kindle, is that it is a closed ecosystem.  By that I mean, you have to buy all your books that you want to read from Amazon.  There is no way to import ebooks that have been purchased from other sources, even if you convert them to the encrypted Kindle format.  I personally believe that once a book is purchased and downloaded, you should be able to do with it as you please (as long as you preserve the author's copyrites.  This really annoys me with Kindle and other products that do the same (e.g. TIVO).  There are workarounds, but they are cumbersome at best.  If you want to buy books from Amazon and have them imprisoned inside Kindle, then you will probably be okay with this product.  Frankly, this is one of the reasons I rarely buy books from Amazon.	-1

You have got to be kidding me! Adobe has had multiple security breaches on their website which lost customer's credit card data and now the only way that we can order updates is by giving Adobe our credit card data???? I don't think so!! Adobe simply has too much competition in this area to continue to deal with them. Products like CaptureOne Pro and the new (free) Affinity Photo are becoming very popular alternatives to LR.  LR Mobile is basically a crippled version of the desktop so not much to get excited about there. Might as well get a laptop and use the much better Mac/Windows version if I need to go mobile and doing that won't require any subscription service.  Update: Before I wrote this review I was told by THREE Adobe employees that Lightroom was not available for purchase by 3rd party stores. After writing this review a couple of commenters told me that you can order through PayPal on adobe.com. I am not sure what is going on. If the LR6 upgrade is available at 3rd party stores then why are MULTIPLE employees telling me it isn't available from the 3rd party. Frankly I don't even want to give Adobe my email address since you know you are going to get a million emails a day nagging you to move off LR6 and over to Creative Cloud just like how Adobe nags you with web banners when you browse the internet. No thank you.  If anyone needs the update to LR6 and doesn't want to join CC type the following into Google: Here is the direct link to download/upgrade the standalone version of Adobe Lightroom 6	-1
Not all the features of the CC version, SURPRISE, not at all, Adobe is only for very large publishing companies, and professional photo studios with 10 or more photographers on staff. Adobe does not want small studios. Adobe has the mindset of Digital Research the owner of the CP/M (Control Program for Microcomputers[3]) operating system, they only wanted the high end market. Digital Research turned down IBM when asked to create the new operating system for the upcoming PC. Bill Gates jumped on that deal, so Microsoft is a household name and Digital Research well not so much. The question I have is who will replace Adobe ?	-1
I've been a Lightroom user since version 2 and never looked back.  As a photogapher, Lightroom seemed perfect- it was light weight, it was fast, and 99% of the time, it had what I needed so there was no need for photoshop.  As such, I was happy that they kept the standalone version when they started Creative Cloud.  With version 6 however, I wasn't quite sure whether the upgrade would be worth it.  There is face recognition and a few minor additions, but I was thinking of upgrading (since the upgrade price is not too bad) until I saw that they updated the software and left the updates out of the standalone version and only offered it to their rental version!  See here for the official announcement: https://helpx.adobe.com/lightroom/kb/compatibility-of-new-dehaze-adjustments.html  The addition of dehazing is not exactly earth shattering so it's an update, but they are hiding behind Sarbanes-Oxley and saying that this is a new feature that was not advertised and that's why they're not adding it.  https://forums.adobe.com/thread/1223742  I ask you, does this make any sense?  If you get a dozen doughnuts and they give you a 3rd one for free does SOX apply?  Really? If you go to get your oil changed and they see your fluids are low and add it for free, are they breaking the law?  I'm not talking offering features a few years later, but if you would have bought this last week, you would be out of luck.  It's clear that Adobe wants to force users to move to CC so they can make a monthly rental fee from you than buying the license.  Worse yet, they force you to rent both photoshop and lightroom whether you need both or not and pay for both.  For those who don't want to pay a rental fee, it appears that the time has come to move on to something else like Capture Pro.  I will hold off this upgrade cycle and move on when it's time.  *update* I did some research on this and apparently Adobe's answer to this to hide behind Sarbanes Oxley, a rule to ensure proper accounting.  When challenged, the people who cite this act say "I'm not an expert, but...".  Well, I'm not an "expert" either, but I do have a background in the corporate world and I challenge Adobe to show where it says they're not allowed to give away a feature for "free".  Of course we know that $140 paid is not exactly free, but for the sake of argument.	-1

Caution: You should care about stealth marketing and wrong reviews.  Generally, Windows 10 is the worst operating system. You should not use it. Windows 10 is inferior to Windows 7. So, Windows 10 is useless in the world.  You may have one question. [Why is Windows 10 inferior to Windows 7?] Actually, Microsoft wants to unite some OSs to one OS. Some OSs include laptop PC, desktop PC, TV game, mobile phone. It can realize that Microsoft create OS with lower cost. But, it has some problems. [Some hardware with high performance] must fit lower performance hardware. Therefore, Windows 10 makes desktop PC inferior than Windows 7.  Additionally, Windows 10 has worse functions than Windows 7. Lower security, lower flexibility, and lower option. For example, Windows 10 cannot select security programs. Although Windows 7 can select updated programs in a list of downloadable security software.  Finally, Windows 10 has many malfunctions. For example, many computers with Windows 7 were upgraded to Windows 10, and were crashed. Moreover, certain update software (called Windows 10 anniversary update) has broken many computers.  Conclusion: We must not use Windows 10 forever.	-1
why are people with windows 7, vista 8 and 8.1 buying this when Microsoft is giving it away free of charge.	-1
Don't do it.  I updated from windows 7 Ult 64 and found zero benefits.  It booted only slightly faster but sometimes actually slower, not sure why?.  Many programs did not work after upgrade.  I installed VMware player and it ran so slow it was almost not useable with my I7 processor. Has some features from windows 7, but feels a lot like windows 8.1.  Also has a tablet mode - who needs that on a desktop.  If you decide to undo the update, Microsoft will break your task scheduler.  After undoing the upgrade, the task scheduler returned so many errors I couldn't write them down.  I found out that this is the case for many users and you need hours online to figure out how to fix it.  I thought windows 10 would be more secure, but after some research, it is not.  I will wait several years before I attempt this again	-1

GET WINDOWS 7 INSTEAD  I can't believe how they screwed this up. Will be waiting for Windows 12.  Do I really have to give it a one, seams to me -1 is a much better rating.  Why I HATE Windows 10  Microsoft needs to show they are actual giving you something, so they change all the places that everything used to be. Well if you drill down and jump around enough you can find the same menus if you like spending a few hours figuring out where they moved everything to. Thanks to Googe you can find SOME solutions.  It only can find one monitor, and you can not tell it you have two, windows 7 allowed you to tell it you had two. I am sure with a little time I will fix this crap. Ok, forget an HDMI to VGA, and running a second monitor with a VGA switch. in Windows 7 it works easy, it DOES NOT WORK IN 10 BUY ALL NEW EQUIPMENT, OR JUST STAY WITH WINDOWS 7.  Ok, its only my first few days getting it started. Need to find a freeware program that sets it all back to win XP, or win 7. The ONLY reason to upgrade is some programs check what version of windows they are running on and Microsoft working with other companies like ADOBE will make sure you MUST upgrade, so since it is free I am putting it on an extra drive to start the painful time wasting process of learning what crap has changed, just to change it and make it look different. Lets face it if it looked like windows 98, XP, or 7 that would be to easy.  Hope windows 10 actually makes an improvement SOMEWHERE !!!!!!!  Be ready, like I am and have two hard drive to go back and forth. If I am lucky all my programs will work fine in Windows 7 and I can stall off actually upgrading to Windows 10 TILL NEVER.  PROS: It installed without any major problem, it does not like my WD Worldbook, says it is not working, but it is so will let it tell me it is not working, as long as it IS WORKING.    can't think of ANY OTHER PROS  CONS: they put Windows 8 and Windows 7 together, great way to screw up both systems. I liked Windows 3.1 which slowly changed into the nightmare of Windows 10. Windows 8 should have been on every logon a choice of Win 7 interface or Win 8. That's how mine is set up now, and I always go to Win 7. Not to insult anyone, but Win 8 is just to time consuming to learn when I know Win 3.1 to 7 and all are easy to do everything I want.  I am sure many hardware items will not have Windows 10 drivers, so time to buy all new hardware, again. Mouse and keyboard still work, and the connections are the same small ones that we went to years ago. Still have adapters from back then, thought they might switch back and forth every ten years.  Bluetooth dongle, nope no Windows 10 driver  Have not tested my Canon scanner, lost one scanner with every upgrade, just got rid of 5 scanners, in the landfill. no new drivers, no slots from the old days, TWAIN turned out to not be as universal as I was hoping.  WISH MICROSOFT INCLUDED NEW DRIVERS WITH EVERY UPGRADE INSTEAD OF A NEW INTERFACE give users the option of what interface THEY WANT TO USE WHEN INSTALLING THE SOFTWARE and let them change it later.	-1

I have five computers with Windows 7.  Tried Windows 10 on three of my PCs.  Total disappointment!  Windows 10 was a step backward in every way,except it can use a touch screen!  (I won't even get into all the customer control features that it forces or tries to force on us.)  All my PC's are back happily running Windows 7.	-1
It's fast, lean and the engineers who wrote it are klutzes. It's also pretty.  Now for the not so wonderful stuff. The Windows 10 "Start" menu is more like the one in Windows 8.1 (awful) than in Windows XP (terrific). It certainly is no improvement over Windows 7, which was barely useable and very ugly.  I upgraded my slightly over one-year-old system to Windows 10 pro. Over half of my software did not make it into the Start menu in the process. The programs that did migrate from Windows 7 were not organized as in my Windows 7 setup, and did not include other programs and utilities contained in the same folders. Thus, when clicking "all apps," I inevitably found many programs missing. Worse, the "all apps" section of the Start menu cannot be modified or edited -- except to uninstall programs which did make it to the list. You can remove, but not add back the missing stuff.  Microsoft is obsessed with the "tiles" feature of the Startup menu. Yes, tiles are still with us. Ironically, unlike the "all apps" selection, this least liked feature of Windows 8 and 8.1 can be edited and modified in Windows 10, and programs missing from the "all apps" list can be migrated to tiles (the missing programs are somewhat buried in Windows 10, and sheer persistence is needed to reveal their location -- not in a place available for everyday use, but inserted so it seems as an afterthought to let you know they were not forgotten.).  Dumb! Dumb! Dumb!  Edge (Microsoft's new Internet Explorer) is not even fully functional. It cannot accept add-ons, plug-ins or other essential accessories to make the browser useable. Microsoft promises this capacity will be forthcoming.  Still, only one of my programs that is available after the transfer did not survive the changeover from Win 7 to Win 10 -- Norton Internet Security (NIS). Almost immediately after booting up, I received notification that a new version of NIS was available and that it would be necessary to uninstall the old version before installing the new one. Even that venerable security standby did not do well in this new environment. The latest version was obviously rushed to completion by the folks at Symantec. I had considerable difficulty getting the program to register once installed. In fact, after many unsuccessful attempts to achieve this essential operation (otherwise the program ceases to function in 13 days ), I was compelled to seek the help of the good folks utilized by Symantec in India to exercise remote control of my computer to make the necessary adjustments to get NIS up, running and registered.  Needless to say, allowing strangers to poke around inside my computer did not inspire much confidence in the security I was hoping to achieve.  I suppose I should be grateful that I was not one of those unfortunates who made the change to Vista or to Windows 8 (the latter was available as an option, but I elected to stick with Windows 7 on one system, and XP on two others).  If Microsoft will fix the Start menu issues and render Edge fully functional, I believe that I will eventually adjust to this new operating system. And, quite possibly, even like it. I did so when moving from MS-Dos 2.11 to Windows 3.1, then to Windows 95 and onwards to Windows 98, and finally to XP. I never did care much for the change from XP to Win 7. But if nothing else, I do consider myself open to new and improved things...when they are proved better than what they replaced.  UPDATE: 8/20/15 - Installed Classic Shell Startup menu program. Solves ALL the Microsoft shortcomings with the startup menu. Installs easily. Allows for logical modification of the startup folders, simple additions to the "programs" listing, and even preserves the Windows 10 startup as an option (tiles and all).  UPDATE: 10/19/15 - The two most recent attempts to install Windows updates KB3093266 and KB3097617 have failed. The latter was supposed to fix the issue in the former. I made 10 unsuccessful attempts to install the most recent update between 10/13/15 and 10/19/15. Windows 10's control panel includes a utility to check and repair installation problems. It failed to do so. A telephone call to Microsoft support ended with a disconnect while waiting for a transfer to a techie who could assist me. An attempt to reconnect with support ended after numerous outgoing recorded messages, including a final one stating that support was overloaded and help could be expected in approximately 30 minutes. It is obvious to me (and others) that Windows 10 was not ready for general release, and unfortunates like me who "upgraded" to this latest Microsoft operating system fiasco can expect an indefinite period of frustration and futility while MS gets its act together.  I have downgraded this product rating from 3 stars to 2, and will lower it again if this situation does not improve.  UPDATE:  11/16/15 - The so-called "Threshold Update"which Microsoft rolled out Nov. 10-12 (a massive update supposedly equivalent to a "service Pack," or complete substitution for the existing Windows 10 installed free in July) did NOT make it to my computer automatically as promised. I was not alone in this experience. However, I was able to find the solution with the help of Google. The solution was to download the update/upgrade at Microsoft's website and manually install it. It took about 2.5 hours to download and install the entire package. Aside from some minor work needed to fix the Start Menu after the latest version was installed, everything else seems okay. Things appear to work faster, and I am thus far optimistic the switch from Win 7 to Win 10 may eventually prove acceptable. BUT, I still advise friends to wait a bit longer before leaving Win 7 or Win 8 for the new OS.  UPDATE:  8/3/16 - The so-called "anniversary update" available 8/1/16 (and gradually making its way to users with Win 10 already installed) is (IMHO) a dreadful disaster. The Start menu has not been fixed -- it is still a disorganized mess. Attempting to organize it so that it is usable is nigh impossible. Even removing items from the Menu is difficult (and nowhere explained). As installed, it is not possible to add or modify the applications (left) side of the Start menu. Thus, customizing it is out of the question. For the past 11 months I installed and utilized "Classic Shell," a godsend alternative to the truly miserable Start Menu.  With the anniversary upgrade this week, the folks at Microsoft to my dismay rendered the Classic Shell incompatible and removed it. Fortunately, the latest version of Classic Shell can be installed and will work with the Win 10 Anniversary update. Those who prefer the Win 7 (XP similar) styled start menu are not stuck with the latest Win 10 abomination.  The folks at Microsoft now insist that Windows Defender be used instead of at least one anti-malware/anti-virus software preferred by users (in my case, Symantec's well-tested and highly regarded security suites). I have been unable to get Win 10 to allow me to select the latter in place of Defender -- and error notifications persist if I try; mainly to the effect that I have no firewall. This, despite that I have updated Symantec -- which Win 10 seems to accept as compatible, but which nevertheless is not allowed to be selected as the default security program.  And the "no firewall" doomsday message continues to appear when it is installed. THEN, after installing the latest Norton update, which worked for one day and disappeared the next, I had to manually install and utilize the latest Norton Removal Tool when all other efforts to restore or repair the preferred Symantec security suite failed. Yesterday's installation had even disappeared from the Win 10 uninstallation menu (and not even Revo Uninstaller could locate it).  Since installing Windows 10 last August, I have managed -- grudgingly -- to learn to live (sort of) with the new Windows Explorer file system (This PC).  I am even somehow, and with difficulty, able to find my way through the vague and cluttered Settings menu. Given time, I have even found and adjusted to the new Control Panel buried two levels down in the Start Menu Folders, and even to the thoroughly counterintuitive interface which now dominates Microsofts latest operating system concoction. But I sorely miss XP (which I continue to use on two computers).	-1
Works nicely. I use a Quad Core processor. Updated my Previous Win 7 OS to 64-bit. The WIN 10 install took about 4-hours to complete. Microsoft then updated the OS and changed all my personal setting back to default. (about 1-week later) which caught me off guard. I've stopped using IE-11 and use Microsoft Edge. I experience long load times (online) and there are times it takes 90-minutes to establish a good connection. I think WIN 10 is necessary. === I removed WIN 10 and re-installed Win 7. It just became so wacky. WIN 10 would attempt to install the same update twice. Removed the OS at the start of July 2017. Win 7 is running great. I did some reading at MS Support / and it seems that WIN 10 Home Edition isn't very good as a purchase. WIN 10 Pro version is the actual OS. Using WIN 10 Home may be a " come on " for the WIN 10 Pro version (upgrade), have not even looked up such a cost. And I don't run my desktop like that. So, I must give a thumbs-down for WIN 10 Home.	-1

Will stay with Windows 10 on my Laptop as it is working, not much different than Windows 8.1, I am running DosBox and VM's for my older programs which run fine on Windows 2000 in a VR just fine Wish Windows 10 could run DOS and Windows programs too. Wish the battery level when charging was correct, but it still works, more or less. Maybe a future update will fix it.  Installed Windows 10 on my HP Stream 8", WOW my tablet works right, finally. Not sure why the installed Windows 8.1 had so much trouble working right. Hard to believe Windows 10 FIXED THE PROBLEMS, not sure why the OEM Windows 8.1 bought direct from Microsoft with the tablet had several problems. So if you own an HP tablet and it is not running right, try the upgrade before dumping the tablet.  Final some pros - still can't run on my desktop yet.  can't think of ANY OTHER PROS  CONS: they put Windows 8 and Windows 7 together, great way to screw up both systems.

Bluetooth dongle, nope no Windows 10 driver  Have not tested my Canon scanner, lost one scanner with every upgrade, just got rid of 5 scanners, in the landfill. no new drivers, no slots from the old days, TWAIN turned out to not be as universal as I was hoping.  WISH MICROSOFT INCLUDED NEW DRIVERS WITH EVERY UPGRADE INSTEAD OF A NEW INTERFACE give users the option of what interface THEY WANT TO USE WHEN INSTALLING THE SOFTWARE and let them change ot later.	-1
I have five computers with Windows 7.  Tried Windows 10 on three of my PCs.  Total disappointment!  Windows 10 was a step backward in every way, except it can use a touch screen!  (I won't even get into all the customer control features that it forces or tries to force on us.)  All my PC's are back happily running Windows 7.	-1
I've been playing around with Windows 10 for a few days now, it's the downloadable version but this should be the same. I had originally hoped it would be a viable desktop OS going forward but unfortunately it seems this is not to be. Microsoft made some much needed changes to the desktop experience after the Windows 8 disaster, however they did this at some expense to the touch experience. The user interface continues the flat, sparse trend that started with Windows 8. The icons look like placeholders hastily drawn in mspaint and the whole interface just feels stripped out, sparse and unfinished with huge amounts of screen-wasting white space. The result is an operating system that still doesn't come close to Windows 7 on the desktop and isn't as good as Windows 8 on a touch device. On top of that, it throws out any performance advantage Win8 may have had over Win7, and it feels more like a platform to push Microsoft subscription services and paid apps than a desktop operating system. Then there are the mandated updates which are not limited just to security patches but can include arbitrary changes to the UI or features. In a nutshell, by obsessing over this one OS, one experience across the board, Microsoft has created the Spork of operating systems that tries to be everything to everyone and doesn't do a particularly good job at anything. They seem to be doing their best to throw away their desktop dominance in order to chase after mobile in a battle they already lost. I should have stocked up on a few more copies of Windows 7 before prices went through the roof.	-1
The operating system was working ok and better than Vista but pretty much similar to Windows 8 plus a classic shell start menu. However, there's no privacy in this system even if you disable ad option. I got a phone call from this 860-207-8604 which was trying to sell something to me after a few days I installed Windows 10. If they insist to do so, I will block Windows 10 from my computer.	-1
UPSHOT: YOU TURN YOUR COMPUTER/DEVICE INTO BIG BROTHER BY AGREEMENT IN THE LICENSE AT INSTALLATION, IF YOU INSTALL WINDOWS 10.  Never before in history has such a 'license' created such awful terms.  Look in the comments for links so you can see the language for yourself.  I can't put the links in an Amazon review.  SERIOUSLY YOU NEED TO SEE FOR YOURSELF PRIOR TO INSTALLATION, WHAT HITLERIAN TERMS YOU'RE AGREEING TO.  Installation is also extremely glitchy.  About 50% of the installers' reports I've read, are 'smooth', especially from Windows 8.1.. else, glitchy.  Given the above warning, I spend a lot of time watching how people in tenforums, wilderssecurity forums, bleepingcomputer and even microsoft community, are suffering with installing this horrible new Windows 10.  I do have it, but as an Insider.  I write extensively about it in bleeping computer and vimeo PC World Alumni forum and brainout(dot)net frankforum (latter two are my own), so you can read more there.  It has no confidential data on it, and the hard drive is removable.  I personally own 16 Windows machines which are eligible for this thing 'free'.  So obviously if I found it good, would get it for them all, and say so here.  But Windows 10, is scary.  First time, Windows is scary.  You'll have to see it yourself to believe it:  at least, I did.  That's why I became an Insider, first.  So here, I feel I owe it to my fellow Amazonians to disclose the upshot of this awful installer:  1.  It will only allow you to do a so-called 'inplace upgrade' ON TOP OF your current Window 7 or 8, which 50% of the time results in disaster.  People do it, to keep their current programs and settings.  Don't bet on this working.  Even experts are getting it wrong, see the 1st paragraph's forums.  That is also how the free version works.  Just avoid this option like the plague it is.  2.  The other option is 'clean install', which here is only available if purchased.  But people who use this, are having really bad luck, and Windows help personnel always blame the seller, so make you go back to the seller.  So here, unless the seller sells you support with the license (and they usually do not), then you shouldn't buy.  The problem with 'clean install' is the installer looks for a key.  The key you are supposed to provide, is a Windows 10 key.  The key you get is a Windows 10 key, but the installer often won't recognize it. When you call MSFT for help, often you're told they can't help, you must go back to the seller.  So if they are not the seller, you're s.o.l.  More importantly, the license is downright frightening.  It's so much worse than turning your machine into Big Brother, but Microsoft tells you that you agree to let IT play Big Brother on you, even if you turn off all the privacy destroyers baked into the thing.  This is a series of lawsuits waiting to happen.  And what do you get for all this?  Nothing you didn't already have.  Frou-frou that doesn't work:  Windows 'Hello' requires a special camera you don't have, Windows Xbox requires Xbox too, Hololens can't work yet, Cortana is a joke, Edge is a gray sheet of paper which gets papered with ads you can't get rid of, your search bar is turned into advertising if you search on the web, you can't get rid of Bing, you can't customize, there is no real Start Menu but instead a vertical version of the Win8 start Screen... and on and on with the nonsense.  Oh, and no you really can't revert within 30 days, they overwrite your windows.old folder with the first Windows 10 cumulative update.  Which happens, the day or the day after, you activate.  IF IF IF you managed to activate.  Do you really want to go down the rabbithole with Alice and be much poorer afterwards?  I thought not.  It gets two stars for two things it does well:  it runs old software and hardware which businesses use (not consumer stuff, business stuff).. really well. I use 1980's and 1990's business hardware and software, and Win10 can work with them.  Consumer stuff, maybe yes maybe no.  The MSfanboy proselytizing is at an all-time high.  Which should warn you immediately.  If faith is warranted in God or some product, then it shouldn't need salesmen.  So if everyone's trying to 'convert' you to it, something's VERY wrong with that idea of God or that product.  Right?  DISCLOSURE is one thing.  That, you need.  Selling is quite another, and the fanboys never tell you the many dark undersides to Win10.  So...  PLEASE DO YOUR HOMEWORK BEFORE BUYING THIS.  Links will be in comments after this review is approved, so you can read the license fright for yourself.	-1
I am rating the free upgrade version I recently installed, not the USB flash drive, but I believe they are the same. For one thing, I tried to get the Windows 10 upgrade in 3 of my machines, but only one took. The other two refused let me upgrade and didn't give a reason; just said "update failed". The three machines all had Windows 7 home version preinstalled. The one that worked is the one that I recently reinstalled a fresh copy of Windows 7.  Anyway, I tried using Cortana, one of the new attractions that is similar to Siri. Couldn't get the microphone to work, a nice microphone I bought a few weeks ago. The computer itself says that microphone is installed properly and shows bar response, but Cortana says it can't hear anything. I have never had trouble with microphones in my life. I tried two different microphones. In the end, the piece of junk doesn't work, so I type in my questions. All it does is show me the Bing search. I could have used Firefox for that!  If I were the one who designed Cortana, I'd SHOOT MYSELF! How dare they push this thing out when it isn't working right? Do those Microsoft people have no shame at all???  Windows 10 sucks as much as Windows 8 with the big slabs that are supposed to be shortcuts but actually just blocks the view and take up space. Can't find the list of programs. Super annoying.  Luckily, this computer is the one my son uses, so I will let him suffer rather than getting it back to Windows 7. I will not be upgrading my other Windows 7 computers (I have 5 more). Microsoft is offering the free upgrade hoping to change all the Window 7 computers out there into Windows 10.  My question: WHAT THE HECK FOR???  Note: After I wrote the above review, I reinstalled Windows 7 in another one of my computers which couldn't get Windows 10. Once I got the fresh copy in, the Windows 10 upgrade option showed up. So if you want the free upgrade but can't get it to work, better consider reinstalling Windows.  Rreview update 8/11/2015: My son (age 9) actually likes Windows 10 even though Cortana still doesn't work. He likes the new look. I don't. I've found that Windows Aero doesn't work in Windows 10! Now they just have a boring, solid colored WHITE Window! Let's go back to being ugly, shall we? Also, every single time I do a search, Cortana asks me what my name is, even though it's already been entered. SUPER ANNOYING.	-1
Yes, I downloaded Windows 10. I have multiple laptops some with Windows 7 and some with Windows 8 so I can compare. Windows 7 has everything I need on front page with easy access plus help etc. Conflicts between software, viruses, attacks  are common these days so I have to deal with it  but its all reasonable in Windows 7. Ok, now Windows 8...booms--tiles--zillions of them and everyone is trying to sell you something like I am drug addict. Ok, I deleted most of them immediately. Hm, customer always right, right? Not in Windows 8. Now I downloaded Windows 10--even worse.	-1
I bought it and messed up every computer it was on. I called and they said that I had to pay $150 to $175 more to get it fixed.	-1

I got a new notebook recently that had this on it. I almost returned the machine because EVERYTHING on it was so slow. I mean everything ... apps ... web page response, Settings. It was ridiculous.  Then I had a wild idea ... what if the AV was the problem. I uninstalled McAfee and the machine started to fly. So I put one of my AVG licenses on it. There was very little performance degradation with AVG.  McAfee might be a great AV software, but if I can't stand to use the computer with it installed, it is worthless to me.	-1
I did spend a couple of hours trying to install this.  I feel like a dummy, but it just soesn't work for me.	-1

The last time I got the updated McAfee version, it added onto the previous year's subscription.  This time, it didn't, so I ended up losing a month of my old subscription because I added this code in early.  I guess I could call their service number to fix it, but that's always a pain.  It was so cheap anyway.  McAfee 2016 already found three viruses on my computer for which I'm grateful, but the three stars is for what it did to Windows after it told me I needed something like 30 updates for Windows.  I clicked the box to update everything and then Windows ceased to work.  I was in the middle of a project. It was stressful trying to restore, because the restore wasn't all that smooth.  Windows wouldn't let me back in, I couldn't get to the safe mode, etc.  Finally, I restored and everything is fine, but then McAfee said I needed Windows updates.  This time, I went to Windows to see, and I was completely up to date.  I'm sure updating Windows through McAfee would have put me in the same predicament I was in before. Why the discrepancy between the two?  I don't know, but I'm going to trust Windows on this.  _______________  UPDATE 2/13/14:  Every time this thing run a scan, my computer slows down to being barely usable.	-1
Update:  I have changed my 5 star review to 1 star after McAfee has forced Yahoo to be my default internet search provider.  It continually changes it from Google to Yahoo, every time I try to switch it back.  I've been using McAfee for a couple of years now and have mixed feelings on it.  The pro of  McAfee is that I haven't gotten a virus.  The software has popped up an unsafe warning several times, usually when miskeying a URL.  So I feel reasonably sure I am protected.  I like this package is unlimited, as I have a bunch of computers and other devices.   There are a couple of cons however.  The first is performance.  It downloads updates and scans in the background, when that happens the PC essentially is unusable.  Luckily this only happens for a minute or two.  The second con is that I had an existing copy of this software.  If there was an option to enter a new key I couldn't find it, so it forced an uninstall/reinstall, which is time consuming.  The third con is that box is pretty big for essentially a card with a code and an address on it.  My final con is when the license does expire, there will be a bunch of popups from McAfee about renewing.  One reminder per session would be plenty.    All in all I'm happy with McAfee, the performance impacts are a nuisance, but I can live with it.	-1
Here we go again folks ,addition by subtraction. Takes about 15 minutes to install on a very fast machine and doesn't allow for a custom install.  So if you don't want to clutter up your system with programs (One note Access,Skype OneDrive) and have it on a drive other that C,you're out a luck.  I smell the perfume of Vista in the air.	-1
Excel: Does not allow you to copy and paste sometimes. I later found out it's related to having many Excels open. Clicking the lower edge of a cell will navigate to the end of the sheet. Does not allow you to paste into visible cells only, despite having this setting selected. Shortening long numbers by default Does not save, unable to edit a cell. Freezes. Constantly freezes, unable to copy, close, or open anything. The only way out is to close all the windows and restart, or end task. Mangles special characters and eff me over on more than a few occasions. Why would the default encoding be Western instead of UTF-8?? Returning false positive in Conditional Formating when highlighting duplicate values. Opening a new window will minimize it (the new window)  Outlook: Minimizes a newly opened window. Folder pane disappears for no reason, unable to go back to Mail from Calendar. Cannot search for emails using part of the senders domain, would have to provide the entire domain. It updated and then it says "this app can't run on your pc" Run indexing in the middle of the day, preventing search results to fully return. Crashes constantly.	-1
<Warning: You must be careful of [stealth marketing], and wrong reviews.>  Microsoft Office 2016 is inferior to Office 2010. Office 2016 has many malfunctions and inconveniences. So, you must not purchase [Microsoft Office 2016]. I report as a victim to you.  If you need a high-performance office software, you should purchase [Microsoft Office 2010] or less. If you need a low-performance office software, you should use free software, like Libre Office, Google Drive, and so on.  ************************************************** <Detailed Explanations> During operation of Office 2016, we must carry out forcible sign-in at Microsoft account certainly. As the proof, our [Microsoft licensing name] is displayed in the screen of upper right absolutely. It is useless information.  When we save a file, [Access to the Microsoft's storage in the Internet] is displayed preferentially, like OneDrive. Because, It is a source of revenue for Microsoft. But, it is very useless for users.  About 20 days after I started to use Office 2016, a following error was displayed. ---------------------------------------- The license of this application is not found. Restoration was failed. Microsoft Office will end. [OK] [Help] ----------------------------------------  I searched about this error in the Internet, and I realized that many users is suffering from the same error. [The licensing data for Office 2016] is very fragile, despite very high licensing fee.  When we use Microsoft Outlook, A weather report is compulsorily displayed in the center of the upper part of the screen. This is an absolute deterioration. The very useless information is displayed in the most important place. It is too user-experience.  Many icons are made into monochrome. In Office 2010, users can distinguish many icons with their color. So, Office 2016 became very inconvenient. It is too user-experience.  Excel 2016 often displays an error [Operation was stopped] and it is forced to terminate.  ************************************************** <FAQ (Frequent Answers and Questions)> Question: You recommend Office 2010, but the support term is shorter than later version.  Amswer: No problem. Any problem cannot be found, even if the support period passes. Because this is a typical sales promotion called [a support end fraud].  Microsoft always forces purchasing latest products for end of support period. However, how many injury occured? The answer is [zero]. You can confirm it with retrieving the information in the Internet. Informational underdogs are being deceived by the sales promotion. Even if you suffered from a victim, the amount of damage is much less than [the cost of the installation for the useless software].  Now, which is you, an informational winner, or an informational loser?	-1
Made the mistake of moving to Office 2016 from Office 2007. It is astonishing how little has been improved, and how many things have quite literally been diminished: keyboard shortcuts gratuitously changed or even entirely removed; useful functionality cut; less interface customizability than in the version from almost a decade earlier. What a travesty.	-1
IT SUCKS even more than Office 365.  Unfortunately I am being forced to use it because my employer uses it.  Office 2016, just for starters.    There is no Minimize button.   I have to manually sync over 400 files because Office 2016 is not syncing with my One Drive account..   I am sure there will be many more booby traps which will cost countless hours of time.	-1
I was really looking forward to having a shiny, new, updated Office quite for Mac, with this version.  Unfortunately, it is just totally unstable. I have a brand new Macbook Pro fully updated OS and high RAM, and the Office applications (particularly Excel, but also Word) crash on a regular basis, almost always resulting in data loss for me.  When running, these apps seem to use up an extremely high amount of system resources and can run very slowly, or result in the rainbow spinny wheel for minutes at a time.  Wish I could recommend, but I would not rely on these for mission critical tasks, given the instability.	-1
Let me say up front that the only programs I care about in this package are Word and Excel.  Frankly, I do not see much improvement in either program versus the 2011 version.  If you don't HAVE to get the new version (say for file compatibility with coworkers or customers) I would suggest you pass on this version.	-1
Unfortunately it says you must have a previous Sage Accounting account to use this on the box. So I can't use this.	-1
This product IS NOT what it says it is!! It is a 2014 version & is a Nightmare to try to install. Had to call a Non-Toll-Free number to answer questions on how to receive the product. It DID NOT come with a CD...you have to download 170 megabytes of the program. DO NOT buy this product!	-1
I have tried numerous times to obtain a CD for this program. I don't want a download for many reasons. I cannot obtain a CD no matter what I do. The download program is a mess. You cannot connect with their password and registration site (Error!). In fact using their URL, it is incorrect. I tried the regular Kapersky site. In spite of all my efforts, they cannot record my payment. Much else goes wrong. A piece of junk. I finally got it to work, and then 3 days later it switched from my paid for version to the free version with no reason. I returned it. Customer service is terrible and well hidden. I have a 2014 copy, and with that,  I had no trouble at all. DO not buy this program. You will be sorry.	-1
very intrusive. After installing my usual crossword pages, like cnn games would no longer load.	-1
Awful...glad to be done with this.  All the time I was getting warnings about malicious threats from Kaspersky, only to find out that it could not block or eliminate the malicious threat.  It's kind of like hiring a policeman who let's all the criminals go by but tells you about all the criminal activity.  Worthless!  Not to mention, Kaspersky is a Russian company and I frankly don't trust Russia and especially Putin.  Remember all American and foreign reporters were spied on during the Winter Olympics in Russia, phone calls bugged, internet hacked, etc.  I simply do not trust a company run by a mobster and thug.	-1
No CD included in package	-1
It has bubble popup advertisements on your desktop.  In the middle of the day, while you're working, any time.  I've contacted them 3 times and they can't figure out how to stop it.  It's still happening.  The last person I talked to, said it was email that was causing it?  Not sure how that works, but if it's true, then it's spam, that won't let me opt out, which is illegal.  I'm going to uninstall and try some other software.	-1
Since the August 22 release of Mac OS X 10.10.5, Toast 14 will not burn discs.  I have a stack of coasters (blu ray discs are not cheap) that are unwatchable.  Even standard DVDs burn as unwatchable, the picture freezing and jerking.  Spent two days with Toast tech support and they could not solve the problem, just said to wait for an update to make the program work with Apple.  I use this program to burn DVDs for my work.  I'm out of business because Roxio/Toast isn't keeping up with the times.  DO NOT UPDATE TO OS X 10.10.5 or you will regret it using Toast (any version).	-1
The product is good, but the customer service from Corel is terrible. Strongly recommend looking for a different product for your needs. Amazon sells many different products to take care of needs. Shop around, don't spend your hard earned money on this product. You will need customer service and Corel currently policy is focused on sales, not retaining customers.	-1
Waist of time!	-1
Bad	-1
Only use it to track expenses going though our checking accounts. I do not like it that Intuit requires me to sign in each time I access my online bank accounts to download transactions. It smacks of them monitoring my activity or worse. Looking for a replacement product that has less of a "Big Brother" approach.	-1
They make you log in all the time now to do anything with your local data and account. I don't use anything online related to this and do not want to and never would. I deeply resent that they require you to login to your account all the time to update, see your data, etc.  If there were any other serious product available, they'd be out of business.	-1
Better than a few years ago, but not really useful.	-1
I update Quicken every 3 or 4 years. After the buggy mess that was Quicken 2012 (where the software could not even do simple math correctly), I upgraded to Quicken 2016 thinking it would be better. Although only slightly buggy, it is almost unusable:  You cannot use Quicken without creating an online Quicken account now. So now you must store you private financial info on Quicken's servers - EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE OF WHERE I WANT MY PRIVATE FINANCIAL INFO.  Of course, since I created a Quicken account about a decade ago, I had no record of the password. I could not create another account with my email. Resetting the password was almost impossible and took several days, making the software unusable.  To make the situation even worse, the geniuses at Quicken force you to log back into Quicken online every few weeks. If you don't you are locked out of your desktop software.  Why would you want to pay ~$40 for software that provides few improvements, prevents you form keeping your financial software safe on your PC, and locks you out if you don't repeatedly log into an online account you don't want or need??!!  You don't. QUICKEN IS NOW MALWARE.	-1
Only does the basics. The pc version is much better	-1
I have used, upgraded, been held hostage by, hated, and reviewed the highest level Quicken finance program releases since the days of windows 95.  I have now once again been strong armed to "upgrade" this complete piece of garbage.  If there were ANY OTHER program available I would have left it in an instant years ago.  Each new edition is more buggy, with useless "enhancements" and more annoying and constant messages to buy upgrades, and of course a large price increase.  This extortion plot is made possible by Intuit killing the download ability of your installed program so that you cannot communicate with your online accounts until you pay a ransom in the form of an upgrade at an exorbitant price. This is very similar to the gangster protection rackets of old. The ultimate insult is that the offered special discount price is about $35 higher than the retail price available everywhere.  The constant annoyance of dealing with password and data glitches, and the Intuit corporate greed  have tipped the scales so that the supposed convenience of a one source finance management program is no longer viable.  The tax data export and capital gains modules have never been reliable.  Since all you can do with the program is download banking and investment information already available from the source for free, this application makes no sense.  I will not pay to upgrade Quicken again.  I strongly recommend that no one ever start using it.  ADDED LATER:  After using it a few days it has crashed three times and completely trashed my modest investment accounts losing track of my cost and  account balances and completely vaporizing one stock holding.  So far have been unable to recover even with backup retrieval.  God... I hate this software.  ADDED LATER AGAIN:  Now have installed update 5 which took 3 attempts and upgrade 6 which installed after two crashed attempts.  Now my program crashes EVERY time  I attempt an automatic account update.  Before the upgrade it only crashed sometimes.  Nice job Intuit.  This is pathetic.  Zero stars is too much.  ADDED 5/9/16.  Today Intuit added a new Intuit password feature that has locked me out of all of my online download files.  All attempts to recover have failed.  Intuit principals should be jailed for fraud.	-1
Not ready yet. I like the look and quick downloading of transactions, but some basic functionality is missing. For example: Quicken 2016 decided that my checking account was a brokerage account (probably based on the financial institution) ... and there's no way for me to change that. Why not? How could they miss a simply option of editing the account type? I get a dozen options (like 401K), but can't change it to checking. As a result, I get useless options (buy/sell stocks) and miss critical ones (like transferring money). I still use ACE Money, which has great functionality but looks like it's from the 1908s. But at least I can decide whether an account is checking or brokerage ... so I'm returning Quicken for a refund.	-1
No-one who is serious about personal financial accounting should buy this product.  Intuit has foisted yet ANOTHER outrage on the Mac user community with ANOTHER farcical release of a sub-par product. Yet ANOTHER so-called "Quicken for Mac" that is incompatible with and requires conversion from ANY of its own Quicken for Windows products; that lacks numerous essential features Quicken for Windows has had for years such as multiple currency capability.  Intuit has had 26 years to get it right, since the first Quicken for Mac in 1989. All they have done with their Quicken for Mac range since at least 2007 is produce the least capable of all personal finance software for Mac.  What is Intuit thinking? Do they think at all? What rational conclusion is possible from release of Quicken for Mac 2016after the debacles of Quicken Essentials and Quicken for Mac 2015than that Intuit thinks we Mac users are innumerate idiots, dupes, pushovers to have our pockets picked?  If you match that description, this is the product for you. If not, a swathe of far better full-featured Mac personal finance software is availableincluding iBank, Moneydance, SEE Finance, GnuCash and MyMoney.  Have I fallen into the trap and bought it? Noand I will not. I've read and compared its specifications with other products, including its immediate predecessor Quicken for Mac 2015, which I own. (See my detailed review, with 93 comments, on that disaster at https://www.amazon.com/review/RB8PUB93R2QVO/) . This is all rational and reasonable assessment needs to show that Quicken for Mac 2016 is a sub-par product.  Run, fly, flee, do not merely walk, from Quicken for Mac.	-1
After several hours trying to convert data from PC to Mac format, I finally succeeded.  Then, however, I tried to connect accounts online to banks, etc.  Accounts came back with wildly diverging amounts and transactions from the PC version.  I couldn't understand what was going on.  When I compared my PC accounts to the online versions, they matched transaction for transaction, but with the Mac version, there were discrepancies.  Next, the interface is totally non-intuitive.  I could not figure out had to make a scheduled transfer appear in the check register.  And then when I clicked on something to accept the transfer, the balance for the account went into the negative.  It should have been  a positive number, since it was a deposit.  I give up on Quicken for Mac.  Amazon does not accept returns on downloads, so I'm stuck with it, and will have to get the PC upgrade.  Live and learn.	-1
When will I learn? It's nowhere near as good as the PC version. I'm going back to running&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Quicken-Premier-Personal-Finance-Budgeting-Software-2015-Old-Version/dp/B00M9GTL6M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Quicken Premier Personal Finance & Budgeting Software 2015 [Old Version</a>] using&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Parallels-Desktop-11-for-Mac/dp/B013XFGA6G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Parallels Desktop 11 for Mac</a>&nbsp;on my mac	-1
I have Kaspersky 2015 and it has worked well. I downloaded 2016 and started the installation process. Immediately after "checking for incompatible software" it stops the process and says it didn't install. I entered the new code and it says it will activate as soon as the old code expires. I guess this means that Kaspersky 2015 will work for another year. Next year I will try something else. I have Windows 10.	-1
Awful...glad to be done with this. All the time I was getting warnings about malicious threats from Kaspersky, only to find out that it could not block or eliminate the malicious threat.

Remember all American and foreign reporters were spied on during the Winter Olympics in Russia, phone calls bugged, internet hacked, etc. I simply do not trust a company run by a mobster and thug.	-1
One would think that backup software named True Image would create an accurate image of your computer disk. But it doesn't. Buried three menu levels deep is a list of files that it excludes by default from even a disk image backup. Some like hiberfil.sys can generally be ignored without problem, but also included is the Chrome/User directory. So no Chrome cookies or user settings are restored. If Acronis is not actually making a true disk image, what else is it hiding from me? Also, I had to type my encryption password four times during a test restore before it was recognized. Maybe I mis-typed it the first time, but not twice after that. Having done more than a few restores from backup in the past 35 years, I have to have absolute trust in the backup software I use. Acronis falls far short of earning that trust.  To add insult to injury, half of the main menu features are attempts to sell cloud backup space and backup for phones and other devices. I want no nonsense backup software, not shill-ware. Finally, despite thousands of words in English in the interface, the main menu is a set of cryptic icons with no text. I guess that made sense to someone at Acronis. Macrium Reflect is more expensive but I'll gladly pay for solid backup software.	-1
Used to be 5 stars, but they are pushing Cloud service so hard it is irritating.  They don't respect your decision to not want it.  Acronis wants to suck everybody into keeping backups, files - everything in their cloud.  They charge a yearly fee for this, but think about it:  If you want to cancel, you will have to download all that information - maybe years worth -back to your computer before you can stop the fees.  It could take a long time at internet speed to clean out your stuff.  Don't fall for it - you could be spending a lot more money than you think. - and of course, they can raise the fees after the first year.  As a side note: The backup software works fine but the GUI is poor. As an example: There is no context sensitive Help and you have to click on an icon to tell what it does.  Most new software allows you to hover the mouse pointer over the icon and it displays options so you can quickly determine if it is appropriate. PS: After using for a month or so. I now give it 1 Star.  Note: After  months of using this software and two major upgrades it is still bad!  The last update  on 4/29/2016 (Win 7 Pro) caused errors on my computer -"Acronis Stopped Running.....".  I tried to uninstall and reinstall, rolled back registry all to no avail.  I finally had to restore using an earlier backup.  So backup software that is supposed to protect my computer caused me to have to do a restore.  What is going on at Acronis?  8/31/16 - still using product - hasn't gotten any worse, but the user interface still drives me nuts. I've tried a few disk image restores and they work fine. The core software is good, but GUI is bad. PS: Been using Acronis 2016 for many months and it is now on my list as the worst backup software you can buy.  I actually had it mess up my computer to the point where even a registry restore did not work - bad software stay away!	-1
do not install this program or any other McAfee programs. At least on sys 10 it will inbed programs/add ons that cannot be removed. It will not uninstall under programs and features or with their removal tool. (which will download but not open). There is a reason one can put it on all their computers for 1 price. It will infect each with a program that cannot be removed. Additionally, their total protection will slow your computers operation considerably. The Kapersky trial will do the same thing. Install an unremoveable infection.	-1
Maybe it's my fault but, I didn't see it can't be installed on Windows VISTA, which is what my seldom used PC is.  Didn't see anywhere that that it can't be.  Was pleased when I saw that it is also for tablets.  Planned to ised it on my i-pad mini.  Product can't be installed on that either.  So, my "unlimited device" Total Protection was only able to be installed on my 8.1 laptop.  Felt cheated.	-1
I bought it and it messed up every computer it was on. I called and they said that I had to pay $150 to $175 more to get it fixed.	-1

This does not work well with Windows 10. After installing this software, my icons on desktop and folders kept on flickering continuously. Only after uninstalling the software would it stop.	-1
Norton's Security Deluxe came complete with minor installation problems and they have been even worse every day since.  It claims to scan automatically.  If it does, it fails to inform of the malware.  I have to run a scan manually. Then it guides me to remove the offending whatever, and it never fixes the problems.  For one, it informed me that a fraudulent security program, 360 . . . something,was causing problems.  But I couldn't remove it by following their directions.  I found it in my Windows Control Panel, under Programs, and removed it manually.  But that didn't end the problems.  Every time I ran the scan, it stopped and cited new errors.  And I haven't been able to remove any of these - not even after hours of my best efforts.  Their seemed to be so many that I felt all the free  technical chats in the world would never be able to solve all the problems.  And I would never know it until either m y computer  malfunction, or by running the scan manually.  This made me wonder if Norton even cared.  So I gave up.  I'm, ordering another brand of Internet security software, then I plan to remove Norton's.  I was given this Norton Security Deluxe in exchange for an honest appraisal.  Sorry, but this review is to satisfy my obligation.	-1
Eats up cpu time, and slows the computer to a crawl.	-1
Norton Security has been working fine for the last 6 years. But now it starts use popup advertisement for its new product. Norton, this is not a freemium, so stop the popup ads!!	-1
this software never worked. it said: this product has invalid region and can not be installed. Symantec recomended to purchase directly from them, and not from Amazon.	-1
I've used the various incarnations of Norton's security products for several years.  I've recently (say three months) had problems with several Windows 10 computers that I own or support for friends, that require frequent restarts to run properly.  The issue has the characteristic of a "memory leak," that is, a piece of software is using more and more of a resource as it runs, until the computer doesn't run correctly.  I remember this characteristic from when I was heavily involved in computers, but I don't actually know what is causing it in this case.  I have found that when I remove Norton Security from the problem computers, and use Windows Defender that comes free with Windows 10 and turns on automatically when Norton Security is removed, that the problems go away, and the computers run normally.	-1

As a user of the most recent upgrade of Microsoft Office Im told (by a pop-up window) I must accept one of two choices before I am allowed to use the software I paid for.  Either I must allow Microsoft to fully monitor and report back to Microsoft how I use apps, features, and devices on my computer, or I must agree to allow Microsoft only to basically monitor and report back on Office settings and device capabilities on my computer.  There is no option that allows me to decline Microsoft surveillance.  I can postpone granting Microsoft permission to track the use of my apps and devices by closing the pop-up window (the one that offers me no option but to agree) and upon doing so I am permitted to use my software until the next time I open Office, when again I am blocked from using Word or Excel until I give Microsoft permission to snoop.  Or until I close the pop-up window, which again gives me annoyingly temporary access to my software.  Endlessly, I suppose.  I could comment on Microsoft upgrades generally, and how the company seems to have a malevolent genius for identifying those features of Word and Excel that I actual find quite useful and over-enhancing them until they are essentially unusable.  I could comment on that but theres hardly space.	-1
Received the card key.  Very difficult to load.  Microsoft kept saying that the product key is not in the database.  When I finally got MS to accept the product key, I got a statement that the product has expired on April 7, 2018, before the card key was even shipped.  This product is not even described as an annual subscription, but as a one-time purchase.  This is the second problem in a row that I have had with Amazon.  19% of the reviews for this product were one star.  Amazon, fix this problem.	-1
Excel: Does not allow you to copy and paste sometimes. I later found out it's related to having many Excels open. Clicking the lower edge of a cell will navigate to the end of the sheet. Does not allow you to paste into visible cells only, despite having this setting selected. Shortening long numbers by default Does not save, unable to edit a cell. Freezes. Constantly freezes, unable to copy, close, or open anything. The only way out is to close all the windows and restart, or end task. Mangles special characters and eff me over on more than a few occasions. Why would the default encoding be Western instead of UTF-8?? Returning false positive in Conditional Formating when highlighting duplicate values. Opening a new window will minimize it (the new window)  Outlook: Minimizes a newly opened window. Folder pane disappears for no reason, unable to go back to Mail from Calendar. Cannot search for emails using part of the senders domain, would have to provide the entire domain. It updated and then it says "this app can't run on your pc" Run indexing in the middle of the day, preventing search results to fully return. Crashes constantly.	-1
Would not load. Invalid Key Code from re-seller. Returned.	-1
I have struggled to understand the changes to this software, and its incompatibility with my existing Office 2007 products. *  Excel is difficult to use due to unnecessary changes in the look of the pages, some unnecessary product changes and a plethora of errors that lock up my computer. *  One Note is not a program I would choose to use. There are many ways to track and update your items without using this software. Why make it an integral part of a suite? *  The Power Point is difficult to maneuver, the look has changed so completely that it's like learning it all over again. Why is that necessary? *  Word is pretty much the same thing: The look, feel and maneuverability of the product is totally different. I can see adding new features, but why keep changing things around and losing things that worked? Microsoft needs to learn: If it works, don't fix it... I'll stick with Office 2007 until they come up with the same format and new features that work.	-1
This is only for one PC. I attempted to load it to my HP Stream (online based computing) and it took forever to get it to register and has not loaded yet. I am on the phone with support as I type this. I purchased Microsoft Office 365 Home 1 Year | 5 PC or 5 Mac Key Card (which is a 1 year subscription) and loaded it to multiple laptops (has smart phone abilities as well) and I did not go through so much trouble!	-1
Product  Key card number was not accepted, saying that it was not a valid number.  I triple checked it.  I can tell an O from a Q.  I was polite, but Technical Support said that it was a pleasure serving me, then immediately terminated contact.  It would be easy to purchase this product on-line, but it is very troublesome to  find a page that accepts a Key card number to download it.  After a few hours, I just gave up.  Sorry Microsoft. but as a consumer, this was  my true experience.	-1
I've used and liked Cyberlink for years now, upgraded (RIGHT!!) to this..."PowerDirectorContentPack_150527_ContentPack_Essential_PCP150526-06.exe" is corrupt, please download another copy, etc.  I installed without the content packs on my main machine, so I figured I'd just copy the offending file from that install, be fine.  Not.  Also corrupt, so I waited through another download, ran it, corrupt again.  Got on line hoping against hope that the company had a hotfix with just this file, not to be.  Now I see all kinds of people having the same issue, and been going on for a while.  I don't know what it takes to get the company to not just listen, but FIX the issue.  I'm far from a beginner at this so I'll keep trying, and will escalate as need be and update this review with any progress, but I'm not hopeful.	-1
doesn't come with a CD Key you have to buy it as an add on.....	-1
Another update 1/2/16:  I downloaded and installed an update to this software, thinking maybe they had worked out the bugs  I went to create a video off of eight HD files that we shot on a recent vacation trip, intending to burn it onto a Blue-ray disk.  After about three hours of rendering, once again, the software became unresponsive and froze up.  My one-star review stands....avoid this one, unless you want to spend your money on nothing but frustration.  After writing the review below, I tried two things.  First, I tried to go back and produce the same video via the Easy Editor option that I had tried the first time to no avail.  Once again, the program started rendering the file and it took hours...and it finally froze my computer...so it failed for me twice.  Second, I tried to play the disk that I had finally produced as mentioned below, and my DVD player simply stated "disk not recognized."  So, even the DVD I did finally manage to create is unplayable.  I really can't recommend this software....I suggest you try one of the Corel products instead.  I seriously question whether or not Cyberlink runs beta tests on products like this prior to releasing them to the market.  This ended up being nothing but a time wasting, frustrating experience for me.  Original review here: Let me say first of all that I am not a professional video producer by any means.  Im just a dad who likes to catch home movies of family vacations, birthdays, graduations, etc. on video and then transfer them over to a disk, either through Blue-ray or through AVCHD formats.  I like to put a snazzy title at the beginning, put some subtitles in along the way that explains where we were and when, and chop out those moments when I forgot to turn off the camcorder and we get to see what footwear everyone was wearing that day.  The best software I have found so far has been Corel VideoStudio Pro X7.  It allows me to do all of the above very easily.  I took about 90 minutes of HD video that I have on an SD card and gave this PowerDirector 14 software from Cyberlink a shot.  It proved to be fairly frustrating for me, far more so that what I have experienced with the Corel software.  When you open the software for the first time, you have to put in your key code, which I found odd because this is usually requested when you load the software onto your computer, not when you first open it.  Anyway, once that was done, a screen come up that gives you five choices: 1) Full Feature Editor, 2) Easy Editor, 3) Express Project, 4) Theme Designer, and 5) Slide Show Creator.  The second and third choices are supposedly easier to navigate...created for novices like me, allowing you to progress upward at your own pace to do more things, and arguably more complicated things, with your video production.  I chose Easy Editor.  First I had to load my files, and I did this by either importing a file or a folder, which was fairly straight forward, and took a few minutes because I had around 280 HD files.  It would pop up occasionally telling me that an error had occurred, which was actually images it was trying to load that I had embedded into my video files (my camcorder automatically takes photos when it sees a smiling face).  It then moves to a Style section that gives you a choice, albeit rather limited, of title frames to put on your video.  After this, you go to an Adjustment section where you can add music, and then you click on a Preview section where you get Magic Style is analyzing your movieplease wait.  This is where things fell apart for me.  I waited.and waited.and waitedand after several hours the little bar that indicates its progress got to about 59%, and then the software became unresponsive.  By this time it was 10:00 at night (and I had started the process that afternoon), so I finally just shut the project down and called it a day.  Not one to give up, the next day I tried Express Project, and struggled for a while to figure out how to capture the files from my SD card.  I finally ended up dragging the files to the timeline.  This time the choices for the title frame were even sparser for some reason, but I picked one and off I went.  The entire process this time took me about two hours.  At the end, when you are about to burn to disk, you have a myriad of choices for file sizes and formats for the burnjust make sure you have the right media to accommodate this.  At first I tried to use a DVD+R DL disk, but no matter what format I selected, the disk was too small for the size of the project.  I finally ended up burning a Blue-ray disk.  Its also worth noting that I have a fairly powerful PCwith an Intel Core i7 processor and 12GB of RAM.  I suggest you make sure you have some fairly serious horsepower for this software if you elect to purchase it.  For HD editing, they recommend 6GB of memory for a 64 bit OS (which I have) and for 4K editing.  Although my first attempt to use this software was met with frustration, I am sure things will improve as I use it more and I learn its unique features.  It has MANY great capabilities, including editing and producing 4K video, which is the main reason I wanted it.  I have a 4K television, and plan to get a 4K camcorder soon.  However, to be quite honest here, if you are just a family video guy like me and don't really need all the whistles and bells, I suggest you go with something a bit more basic, like the VideoStudio Pro X7 I mentioned early.  But, if you think you might want to get into the video production world a bit heavier and have software that is future proofed to at least some degree, this option from CyberLink is definitely a great choice.  Just be prepared to put some time in to learn all of its features.they are substantial.  I plan to stick with it and try to learn as many as I can, time permitting.  In the time it has taken me to render on DVD with PowerDirector, I could have produced three or four with VideoStudio.  I hope my experience has helped you to some degree.  If you have any questions feel free to ask, and as I use it more, should things change, I will update the review.  Thanks for reading!	-1
Only found my Logitech camera....and unable to find any other cameras.  It had so many unknown camera's listed but not what I have which are of the more popular brand such as AmCrest.  I don't need this program for Logitech so I gave it a low value for the money.	-1
not worth the purchase. good thing i got it for free.	-1

Totally disappointed with this transaction.  I purchased Photoshop Elements to install on an HP quad core running Windows 10, 64 bit.  Both 32 bit and 64 bit extractor exe files are included.  The 64 bit version failed to complete after 4 attempts each ending with an unresponsive program error.  The 32 bit extractor did work however installation failed 3 times each time an error code file could not be found.  Searching for similar problems the Adobe website suggested downloading the 64 bit directly from their website which did extract the program properly.  However upon supplying the serial number during the installation Adobe advised the files I downloaded were not genuine Adobe product.  After 4 hours and much frustration I must assume the Adobe Photoshop Element 14 program as delivered by Amazon is DOA. My best advice is to purchase your product on DVD from a local retailer...	-1
